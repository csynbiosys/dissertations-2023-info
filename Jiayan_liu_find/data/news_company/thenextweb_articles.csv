Angel and seed funding remain insulated from startup market volatility: Report,Thomas Macaulay,2023/08/15,"
Angel and seed funding in Europe are remarkably resilient to the startup market downturn, according to new research by Pitchbook.
In the first half of 2021, both median deal values and valuations in these stages exhibited positive trends. The biggest increase was in median angel deal values, which were up 28.8% compared with 2022. The median angel valuation, meanwhile, was up 10.2%, while the median seed-stage valuation was flat.
 These figures illustrate the insulated nature of early-stage funding. Angel and seed rounds are typically more removed from public markets, as businesses at those stages are further away from maturity and exit. Because the returns tend to be long-term, investors in these rounds are less dependent on temporary market frailties. 
Public funding programs have also helped. The growth of angel and seed stages in the UK, Ireland, France, and Benelux was partly credited to government initiatives, such as SEIS and the FCPI.

Pitchbook expects angel and seed valuations to remain relatively insulated from near-term market volatility. In later rounds, however, the signs are less encouraging.
At the venture-growth stage, times are particularly tough. In the first half of 2023, median venture-growth valuations and deal value paced at 18.5% and 16.7% below their full-year medians from 2022, respectively. 
One factor behind this decline is the role of nontraditional investors, such as investment banks, private equity firms, and pension funds. 
In previous years, these investors boosted competition, round sizes, and valuations at the venture-growth businesses, which often have similar operations to large public companies. But in H1 2023, deal value with nontraditional investor participation dropped from €27.8bn to €18.7bn.
That may reflect attentions shifting to early-stage funding. The proportion of deals with nontraditional participation has stayed at around 38% since 2021 — which suggests they’re focusing on smaller, earlier rounds where deal value is lower.

Despite the early-stage resilience, the broader funding landscape remains immensely challenging.
Down rounds, for instance, have become far more common. In Q2, 26.2% of company valuations were lower than in the previous funding round. A notable example is Turkey’s Getir, which was hit by a 42.4% decrease in valuation in Q2 2023. 
Unicorn activity, meanwhile, has been constrained. There are currently 134 privately-held startups in Europe valued at least €1bn, but only five have emerged since the end of 2022 — a rate markedly lower than in the previous two years. To mitigate this decline, Pitchbook recommends more support from government funds for venture-growth companies.

Exit valuations have also plunged. The median valuation fell from €33.9mn in the first quarter of the year to €17.3mn in Q2.  Macroeconomic factors — namely interest rates — are driving the dip.
Pitchbook expects further corrections to be lumpier with a lag to public equities, which means it’s too early to assume that the declines have reached the bottom. As a result, stakeholders will need patience and extended runways to manage the industry’s loss of liquidity and capital.

"Einstein, Newton could have been wrong about gravity, Gaia telescope data reveals",Siôn Geschwindt,2023/08/14,"
A groundbreaking study, based on observations from the European Space Agency’s billion-pixel Gaia space telescope, has revealed a “gravitational anomaly” that challenges our fundamental understanding of the universe. The anomaly occurs when loosely orbiting stars, known as wide binaries, seem to move in ways that defy standard models of gravity established by Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton.  
Astronomer Kyu-Hyun Chae from Sejong University in South Korea made the discovery while studying binary star systems, which refer to two stars that orbit each other. At accelerations of lower than 0.1 nanometres per second squared, the orbit of the two stars deviated from Newton’s universal law of gravitation and Einstein’s general relativity. 
The discovery puts into question the existence of ‘dark matter’ which was often used to explain such anomalies. “Testing gravity with wide binaries is interesting because dark matter can play no role in their internal dynamics,” Chae said.
Professor Chae theorised that a model known as Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) could explain why these previous theoretical frameworks were unable to explain the stars’ movements. MOND was first conceptualised by Israeli physicist Mordehai Milgrom, who proposed a modification to the laws of gravity at low accelerations to explain observed irregularities in galactic rotation without the need for dark matter.
“Chae’s finding is a result of a very involved analysis of cutting-edge data, which, as far as I can judge, he has performed very meticulously and carefully,” said Milgrom, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel. “But for such a far-reaching finding – and it is indeed very far-reaching – we require confirmation by independent analyses, preferably with better future data.
“If this anomaly is confirmed as a breakdown of Newtonian dynamics, and especially if it indeed agrees with the most straightforward predictions of MOND, it will have enormous implications for astrophysics, cosmology, and for fundamental physics at large,” he added.
Professor Chae commented on the implications, asserting that potential systemic errors were rigorously examined and the results appeared to be genuine. He anticipates that the results will undergo further scrutiny and refinement as more data becomes available.
Nevertheless, these findings could have a profound effect on our conception of the universe. “Because the standard cosmology is based on general relativity, cosmology needs a major revision now,” Chae said. “I think we are now entering an extremely exciting period of time.”

"UK’s promise to protect encrypted messaging is ‘delusional,’ say critics",Thomas Macaulay,2023/08/11,"
The British government’s promise to protect encryption has been pilloried by security experts and libertarians.
The dispute stems from a section of the Online Safety Bill. Under the legislation, messaging apps would be forced to provide access to private communications when requested by the regulator Ofcom. 
Proponents say the measures will combat child abuse, but critics are aghast about the threat to privacy. They fear the plans will facilitate mass surveillance and damage the UK’s tech sector. Signal, Whatsapp, and five other messaging apps have all threatened to leave the country if the law is passed.
The British government has sought to allay their concerns. On Thursday, technology minister Michelle Donelan said the government is “not anti-encryption” and will protect user privacy.
“Technology is in development to enable you to have encryption as well as to be able to access this particular information, and the safety mechanism that we have is very explicit that this can only be used for child exploitation and abuse,” Donelan told the BBC.
Her remarks were quickly lambasted by critics. Matthew Hodgson, CEO of secure messaging app Element — which is used by the government’s own Ministry of Defense — described Donelan’s claims as “factually incorrect.”
“No technology exists which allows encryption AND access to ‘this particular information.’ Detecting illegal content means ALL content must be scanned in the first place,” he said.
In response to these concerns, the government’s cybersecurity chiefs argue they can protect both children and privacy. To do this, they propose using client-side scanning, which involves installing software that detects suspicious activity. Many experts, however, argue that this tech is impossible to build.
“You cannot turn scanning on and off,” Hodgson said. “The government still does not understand how technology or encryption works, despite numerous experts explaining this to them. 
“Its own ‘Safety Tech Challenge Fund’ failed to deliver an impossible solution to scan messages without breaking encryption. What more will it take for the government to finally accept how encryption works?”
Tech firms are not alone in opposing the plans.  Civil rights groups and libertarians have also denounced Donelan’s comments.
Michelle Donelan was appointed to lead the new department for science, innovation, and technology in February.
Matthew Lesh, director of public policy and communications at the IEA, a free-market think-tank, described the government’s claims as “delusional.”
“There is no magic technological solution in existence or development that can protect user privacy while scanning their messages,” he said. “It’s a contradiction in terms.”
These arguments, however, have struggled to convince the general public.
According to a recent YouGov survey, there is strong support for the government’s plans. Almost three-quarters (73%) of respondents backed the requirement for tech that can identify child abuse in encrypted messages.
The NSPCC — which commissioned the research — said the critics are “out of step” with the public on the issue. 
Defenders of encryption are running out of time to win more hearts and minds. The Online Safety Bill is expected to become law later this autumn.

German rocket startup bags €30M as it eyes takeoff this year,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/08/9,"
While the US and China have dominated the space sector for decades, Europe is carving out a niche for itself: small satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO). 
One of the most promising startups in this space is Germany’s Rocket Factory Augsburg, which has just raised €30m from KKR, an American investment firm.  
The cash injection will facilitate RFA’s upcoming launch test at the end of this year and help complete its launch pad at SaxaVord Spaceport in Scotland.
SaxaVord Spaceport is a planned spaceport to be located on the Lamba Ness peninsula on Unst in the Shetland Islands, the most northerly point in the UK.
In January 2023, Rocket Factory Augsburg signed a multi-year launch agreement which gives the company exclusive access to the northernmost launch pad of the spaceport. 
The startup has also signed an agreement with the French Space Agency to build a dedicated launch pad at the Guiana Space Center (GSC) in French Guiana, with launches commencing in 2025.

“We aim to provide cost-effective access to space and data-generating business models in space for monitoring, connecting, and protecting our planet,” said Stefan Tweraser, CEO at RFA. 
Tweraser established RFA in 2018 alongside Jörn Spurmann, Stefan Brieschenk, Hans Steiniger, and Marco Fuchs, as a spin-off of German aerospace firm OHB SE.
RFA is developing a three-stage launcher called RFA One with a payload capacity of 1,300 kilograms to low Earth orbit. The rocket will stand at 30 metres and 2 metres in diameter, slightly bigger than Rocket Lab’s Electron but less than half the size of a SpaceX Falcon 9.
The company plans to undercut the competition by offering payloads of up to 1,300 kg at a base cost of $3,000 to $4,000 per kg. By 2030, it hopes to launch approximately 50 times per year to dedicated orbits for full satellite constellations.
The company has spent a little over €40mn so far in its quest to become Europe’s first small launch provider. A small-lift launch vehicle is a rocket orbital launch vehicle that is capable of lifting 2,000 kg or less.  
Other companies operating in this arena include UK-based Skyrora, which also aims to launch its first rocket from SaxaVord at the end of this year, and PLD Space, a Spanish startup which aims to launch Europe’s first reusable rocket from a site in South Spain.  Perhaps Europe’s most promising small launch startup, at least funding-wise, is Isar Aerospace, which has bagged over €300mn to date.   
However, because Isar, Skyrora, PLD Space, RFA, or any of the dozen or so European small launch companies haven’t actually attempted an orbital launch yet, it can be difficult to tell who is making real progress and who is not.

Deep learning model can steal data by listening to keystrokes with 95% accuracy,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/08/9,"
A team of UK researchers has trained a deep learning model to interpret keystrokes remotely based solely on audio.
By recording keystrokes to train the model, they were able to predict what was typed on the keyboard with up to 95% accuracy. This accuracy dropped to 93% when using Zoom to train the system.
According to the new research, this means that sensitive information like passwords and messages could be interpreted by anyone within hearshot of someone typing away on their laptop, either by recording them in person or virtually through a video call. 
These so-called acoustic side-channel attacks have become much simpler in recent years due to the abundance of microphone-bearing devices like smartphones that can capture high-quality audio. 
Combined with the rapid advancements in machine learning, this makes these kinds of attacks feasible and a lot more dangerous than previously thought. Basically, you could hack sensitive information armed with nothing more than a microphone and machine learning algorithm.
“The ubiquity of keyboard acoustic emanations makes them not only a readily available attack vector, but also prompts victims to underestimate (and therefore not try to hide) their output,” the researchers said. “For example, when typing a password, people will regularly hide their screen but will do little to obfuscate their keyboard’s sound.”
The team conducted the test using a MacBook Pro. They pressed 36 individual keys 25 times a piece. This was the basis for the machine learning model to recognise what character is associated with what keystroke sound. 
This information was recorded both via a phone in close physical proximity to the laptop and Zoom. There were enough subtle differences in the waveforms produced by the recording for it to recognise each key with a startling degree of accuracy.
To prevent someone hacking your keystrokes, the researchers recommend typing style changes, using randomised passwords as opposed to passwords containing full words, adding randomly generated fake keystrokes for voice call-based attacks, and using biometric tools, like fingerprint or face scanning.

ESA satellites capture the extent of Europe’s wildfires,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/08/8,"
In recent weeks devastating wildfires have swept across Greece, Italy, Spain, and Portugal, causing several fatalities, the displacement of thousands of people, and widespread damage to infrastructure.  
More than 260,000 hectares of land across the EU has already burnt since January — an area the size of Luxembourg. Many fires are still raging across swathes of southern Europe and beyond.
In response to the increasing threat of wildfires, the European Space Agency has released an upgraded version of its World Fire Atlas which harvests satellite data to track the blazes. 
Through the dashboard, users can compare the frequency of fires between countries as well as analyse the evolution of fires taking place over time. The atlas was originally launched in 2019, where it supported both European civil protection agencies and firefighters.

The tool uses night-time data from the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer on board Copernicus Sentinel-3A, Europe’s primary earth observation satellite.   
Working like a thermometer in the sky, the sensor measures thermal infrared radiation to take the temperature of Earth’s land surfaces which is used to detect fires.  
Over the previous seven years, data from the World Fire Atlas shows a significant number of fires detected in Portugal, Italy, Greece, France, and Spain. The highest number of fires reached in that timeframe was in Portugal in August 2016 and October 2017.
While wildfires are a natural part of many ecosystems, scientists have warned that they are becoming more frequent and more widespread as climate change brings hotter, drier conditions in many parts of Europe.

On Rhodes in July, some 50,000 hectares burnt in just a week, forcing almost 20,000 people to flee the Greek island. The Copernicus rapid mapping service, which supports authorities with geospatial information during emergencies, was activated for this event and helped firefighters battle the blaze. 
By utilising satellite data, the ESA believes authorities, researchers, and organisations can devise more effective strategies for fire prevention and management.
“The ongoing commitment of ESA, Copernicus, and the EU to continuously provide this valuable resource reinforces the importance of leveraging space technology to address critical environmental challenges,” said Olivier Arino, head of the ESA’s Earth Observation Projects Section.  
"
Germany’s Marvel Fusion to build $150M laser facility in US,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/08/8,"
Scientists are edging closer to a fusion energy system that doesn’t rely on magnetic field-based tokamak reactors or twisty stellarators.
German startup Marvel Fusion has teamed up with Colorado State University to build the world’s first facility dedicated to commercialising inertial confinement — a type of fusion reaction produced by slamming atoms together many times per second using high-intensity lasers.
Interest in this type of fusion has increased since scientists at the US government’s National Ignition Facility successfully achieved net energy gain in a fusion reaction for the first time ever in December, and repeated the feat again in July. 
‘Net energy gain’ basically means the reaction produced more energy than went into it — igniting hopes that fusion’s promise of abundant, clean, and limitless energy may not be as far off as first thought. 
However, there’s a huge difference between achieving net energy gain and making a commercial fusion power system — you’d need to produce these fusion blasts at a rate of nearly 10 per second to generate energy around the clock. 
This is exactly what Marvel Fusion wants to do. The $150m laser facility, located at CSU’s campus in Fort Collins, would feature at least three laser systems, each with multi-petawatt peak power and an ultra-fast repetition of the ten flashes per second rate required to generate ongoing fusion energy. The startup is targeting completion of the laser facility in 2026. 
“This public-private partnership sets the global standard for laser-based fusion research, propelling the development of a safe, clean, and reliable energy source,” said Moritz von der Linden, CEO of Marvel Fusion.  
While Marvel Fusion has established a subsidiary in Colorado to support this collaboration, the company’s headquarter remains in Munich, Germany. 
When asked why he chose the US von der Linden told the Financial Times that it was the “fastest, most capital-efficient way for us to move on building this facility.” There is simply more funding and an appetite for this kind of technology across the pond, he said. 
Nevertheless, he doesn’t necessarily intend on building a full-scale commercial plant in the US. “It could very well, maybe hopefully, be in Europe,” he said. 
Marvel Fusion will continue its laser experiments at the Ludwig-Maximilian Unversity’s CALA laser near Munich, and at the ELI-NP laser centre in Romania — the world’s most powerful of its kind.

UK’s first drone delivery service launches in remote Scottish islands,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/08/1,"
Remote communities off the Scottish coast are now the first people in the UK to have their mail delivered by drone. 
Royal Mail and London-based Skyports Drone Services launched the project to make it easier for residents of Orkney, located off the north coast of Scotland, to receive their mail without delays. 
The drones will carry mail from Stromness to the remote islands of Graemsay and Hoy where postal staff will complete their usual delivery routes. 
While the service will initially operate for three months, the partners intend to continue it on a permanent basis. This is possible under existing regulatory frameworks due to Orkney’s unique landscape and the proximity of the islands to one another.
The drone service is expected to significantly improve service levels and delivery times to Graemsay and Hoy, as weather and geography can cause disruption to current deliveries which are made by ferry or small planes. 
“Rural and maritime logistics are contingent on access, weather, and personnel — if one of these factors is compromised, so too is the ability to provide a safe and reliable service,” explained Alex Brown, Director at Skyports Drone Services. “Orkney is just one example of a hard-to-reach location that will benefit significantly from regular recurring drone operations.”
Skyports will conduct the inter-island flights with an all-electric Speedbird Aero DLV-2 aircraft. The multirotor drone is capable of carrying payloads of up to 6kg and has a range of 8km. 
“Using a fully electric drone on a permanent basis supports Royal Mail’s continued drive to reduce emissions associated with our operations, whilst connecting the island communities we deliver to,” said Chris Paxton, head of drone trials at Royal Mail.
The project is funded by the Department for Transport’s Freight Innovation Fund and executed by the Connected Places Catapult. The fund focuses on accelerating the adoption of commercial solutions to make the UK’s freight sector greener and more efficient.
Plans for a Royal Mail drone delivery service were first detailed last year. The firm is aiming to secure more than 50 drone routes supported by up to 200 drones over the next three years. Longer term, the ambition is to deploy a fleet of more than 500 drones servicing all corners of the UK.
In other parts of the world, delivery companies have also been trialling post by air, most notably Amazon in parts of the US and SingPost in Singapore.

Tech is breaking accessibility barriers in transport — here’s how,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/08/1,"
According to WHO, people with disabilities represent 16% of the world population. They also find transportation 15 times more challenging than non-disabled individuals. But for mobility to truly be sustainable, it has to go beyond reducing emissions; it has to be inclusive and cater for every member of society.
To this end, technology represents a beacon of hope as much as an invaluable tool. To find out more about its role in enabling universally accessible transportation, I spoke with Jonathan Chacón Barbero, Senior Accessibility Software Engineer at Cabify.


“Technology helps us overcome our limits.


Chacón Barbero joined the ride-hailing scaleup in 2019 and is the person behind the accessibility menu of its app. He has led a multi-year-long career in the design and development of accessible applications, and has worked as an accessibility consultant and lecturer. He is also amongst the few blind software engineers in Europe.
“The first time I got a personal computer as a child, it was love at first sight,” Chacón Barbero says. “That’s when I decided I wanted to be a computer scientist.”At the age of five he built his first software programme, and at the age of nine, he decided to focus on hardware.
Chacón Barbero could see with his right eye until he was 15 years old, at which point he fully lost his vision, leading him to work on software instead.

“The worst moment in my life was when I became blind and I had to be out of technology for three months,” he recalls. “I didn’t know braille. I didn’t understand computers for blind people. I didn’t know anything about the blind world. I had to understand and study everything. I think at that moment, I set my mind for the rest of my life.”
He emphasises that from this point onwards, technology acquired a double meaning in his life: it was no longer just a passion, but also a tool to address challenges related to his condition.
“Technology helps us overcome our limits,” he adds. and And that’s what he set out to do.
Accessibility barriers and impact
The transportation challenges people with disabilities face go far beyond the lack of accessible ramps. Among others, they include inaccessible vehicles; poorly designed curbs, crosswalks, and sidewalks; and non-existent or inaccessible signage, wayfinding, and journey planning information.
Furthermore, studies have shown that social and infrastructural barriers render specific transport modes unavailable to travellers with disabilities and increase journey time. As a result, people with disabilities make fewer trips and travel shorter distances.


“Disability isn’t recognised by all of society yet.


In the UK, for instance, a 2022 survey found that one in five disabled individuals are unable to travel due to the lack of appropriate transport options, while one in four said that negative attitudes from other passengers prevent them from using public transport.
Chacón Barbero shares an example from his experience with using taxi services.
“I have to call a taxi company. I hold on the call as I’m waiting for the driver to arrive. But there is a problem: he doesn’t know that I can’t see the car and I can’t know where the car is. I waste time and money because there hasn’t been direct communication between the driver and the user.”
Putting tech to work
Optimistically, the past few years have seen an increasing number of both public and private initiatives employing new technologies to rise to the challenge of universal accessibility.
For instance, the city of Lyon has developed a public transport app that uses real-time data to assist disabled individuals in getting around, including a feature that helps them identify the most accessible itinerary and the shortest routes.
European startups are also getting active in the field. Think of London-based Wayfindr, which helps vision impaired people travel independently using audio navigation. Or Noteabox whose Button App enables users to press buttons — such as those on pedestrian crossings — through their smartphone.


“Technology is the solution to many accessibility aspects.


Cabify presents another example of how technology can increase inclusiveness in ride-hailing services.
When Chacón Barbero joined the Spanish scaleup, his first step was to build a semantic basement for the app’s digital interface to enable the gradual addition of multiple accessibility features and disability profiles. During the same year, Cabify’s app became 100% accessible for blind people.
In 2020, the company launched its accessibility menu. Since then, it has been adding functionalities and expanding its target groups, such as the hearing impaired, individuals with cognitive disabilities, and the elderly.
“We created a special menu for accessibility in our journey to offer the user the possibility to identify their special needs,” says Chacón Barbero.
Users can choose between the three options displayed in the image below:

The first option is designed to help the visually impaired, the elderly, and people with reduced mobility inform drivers that they need help reaching the vehicle.
For users with a hearing impairment, the second accessibility option offers the possibility to chat instead of calling. Finally, receiving and playing back important alerts via voice caters for multiple groups, such as the elderly, the visually impaired, and individuals with cognitive impairments.
According to Cabify, by the end of 2022, over 99,000 users had activated at least one of the accessibility menu functionalities. Now, this number exceeds 110,000 users worldwide.
Chacón Barbero says that non-disabled users have also activated the accessibility features as they feel they optimise the experience. He mentions the preference for a bigger font size and the option to chat instead of calling “simply because many people hate phone calls.”
But for Chacón Barbero his work is far from over — on the contrary, he champions the need for continuous improvement. His future plans include adding new in-app functionalities, extending the disability user profiles, and increasing the number of accessible cars.
The biggest barrier to break
For Chacón Barbero the biggest barrier to inclusive mobility is the lack of awareness and social acceptance.
“Accessibility is unknown, because disability is not recognised by all of society yet. Only when you have a friend, a parent, or someone in your environment with disabilities, do you understand what accessibility is. And that’s the problem,” he says.
Eurostat’s numbers are telling: in 2022, 29.7% of the EU population with disabilities aged over 16 were at higher risk from poverty or social exclusion.
Chacón Barbero hopes that, in the future, society will be more inclusive and recognise that people with disabilities are, above all, people. He believes that the younger generations can drive change forward by further embracing individuals who are different and diverse.
“Technology is the solution to many aspects related to accessibility, but it has its limits,” Chacón Barbero concludes, pointing to the need for human action as well. “The solution isn’t only technology. The solution is technology for people and with people.”

Telecoms giant BT wants to turn old broadband boxes into EV chargers,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/07/31,"
The innovation arm of British telecoms giant BT — called Etc. — is looking to convert the Group’s street cabinets into EV charging points.
The big green cabinets, a common sight across the UK, are currently used for providing copper-based broadband and phone services but are soon to be decommissioned as BT transitions to full fibre networks.
The company estimates that as many as 60,000 of its 90,000 cabinets may be suitable for retrofit. Etc. will now conduct a series of technical and commercial pilots over the next two years to determine the feasibility of a conversion on this scale.
The first of these pilots will kick off in Northern Ireland this autumn, and will initially offer BT Group colleagues access to the charging ports. The company plans to broaden the trial to the public soon and launch more pilot locations across the UK later in the year, it said.
“With the ban on sales of internal combustion engine vehicles coming in 2030, and with only around 45,000 public charge points today, the UK needs a massive upgrade to meet the needs of the EV revolution,” said Tom Guy, managing director of Etc. at BT Group.
The UK government aims to grow the number of EV charge points from around 45,000 today to 300,000 by 2030 and has allocated £1.6bn to get the job done. It’s not clear from the release whether any of that cash has been allocated to BT’s trials.
Despite the government’s ambitions, recent analysis shows that it is “10 years behind” on its charging infrastructure commitments, which risks derailing the transition to greener transport.  
“Programmes like BT Group’s are an incentive for other businesses and drivers to go electric,” said Helen Clarkson, CEO at London-based non-profit Climate Group. “But we need the UK government to play its part – wider availability of charge points right across the country, not just in London, will help build confidence that switching to an EV is the right option.”
Businesses across Europe are starting to capitalise on the government’s sluggish response. In Ireland for instance, startups are developing solutions to bridge the gap between the growth of EV sales and the roll-out of charge points — from the Airbnb of home chargers to hub-style sites along arterial routes. 
Startups like these are set to benefit from new regulations passed last week which require fast recharging stations to be installed every 60 km along the EU’s main transport corridors by 2025.
Back in the UK, it remains to be seen whether BT will make a dent in the government’s EV charging targets. The company said it is weighing up whether to go into this venture alone or with a pre-established charging partner, acknowledging the necessity to work with local councils and authorities in order to get the infrastructure installed smoothly.

Greek AI shipping startup acquired by Japanese automation giant,Linnea Ahlgren,2023/07/24,"
Greek shipping software startup DeepSea Technologies has sold a majority share to Japan’s automation giant Nabtesco for an undisclosed amount. 
DeepSea will continue to develop the company’s fuel optimisation platforms that reduce emissions (and cut costs) of fossil-based maritime fleets, while also becoming a “centre of excellence for AI research and product development.” Furthermore, the Athens-based startup will support Nabtesco Marine Control Systems in its quest for scalable semi-autonomous shipping. 
The company will continue to function (fittingly enough) autonomously, and carry on work on its two platforms — Cassandra and Pythia — and on “the broader digital transformation of the maritime industry.” 
Cassandra is a vessel monitoring and optimisation platform that allows customers to see emissions for a specific vessel and across an entire fleet, while also understanding how each component of the ship contributes to its performance. In addition, the tool offers notifications in real-time when something requires attention, such as fuel waste and maintenance requirements. 
Meanwhile, Pythia is a world-first weather routing platform, tailored to the exact performance of a specific ship. It comes up with tailor-made routes, speed and trim policies, assessing overall cost and CO2 emissions, while providing minute-by-minute updates on conditions.  
The company claims that it is possible to unlock energy efficiency improvements of up to 10% across almost any fleet in 12 months, using its optimisation technologies. 
Best of both worlds
DeepSea was founded in 2017 and has previously raised €8mn, five of which came from Nabtesco Technology Ventures in 2021. The company has offices in Athens, London, and Rotterdam, and employs over 70 specialised engineers, most in AI and software development. The two co-founders of DeepSea, Dr. Konstantinos Kyriakopoulos and Roberto Coustas, will continue on in their roles of CEO and President, respectively. 
“The deepening of our existing partnership with Nabtesco unlocks even greater potential for our technology and approach, and will be key to unlocking the next wave of innovation for our customers,” Kyriakopoulous stated when announcing the news last week. 

“It’s truly the best of both worlds: DeepSea will maintain its startup culture and focus on disruptive technology, whilst harnessing all the expertise and support of a global powerhouse.”
Staying on top of CO2  emissions will become increasingly important for shipping companies worldwide. Not only from a “the world is burning, let’s get our act together” kind of perspective, but also from a business and regulatory point of view. 
Maritime carbon emissions regulations
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), in 2022, maritime shipping accounted for about 2% of energy-related global CO2 emissions. While there is no legally binding agreement holding the industry to emission reduction targets, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), a specialised agency of the UN, has adopted measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from international shipping. 
As stated in the latest version of the IMO’s GHG strategy from July 2023, it is now targeting net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Member states have agreed to “indicative checkpoints.” These include reducing total emissions by 20% and striving for 30% by 2030, with targets increased to 70% and 80% by 2040.
From 2024, shipping will also be included in the EU emissions trading scheme (ETS), which means that every kilogram of CO2 will be of financial — not to mention planetary — importance.

UK bets on 11 key technologies to boost its space sector,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/07/20,"
The UK Space Agency has identified 11 critical technology areas to strengthen the country’s position in the space sector and enable further cooperation with international partners such as NASA, the ESA, and Japan’s JAXA.
The technologies are listed in the agency’s newly-published Space Exploration Technology Roadmap, which will guide research, development, and future funding decisions over the next 10 years.
The roadmap’s overarching aim is to help the UK fully benefit from the growing commercialisation of space exploration and the global space economy — estimated to reach $1tn (€897bn) by 2040.
“We are entering a new era of space exploration where governments and commercial operators are working closer than ever before,” said the space agency’s CEO Dr Paul Bate.
“By setting out this roadmap, we are giving clarity to industry and researchers across the space sector, and positioning the UK as a partner of choice for future space exploration missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.”
Autonomy and AI are listed as a the priority for boosting the capability and efficiency of missions. Autonomous navigation, for instance, can enable spacecraft explore remote planets and moons without the need for human intervention. The technology is also considered crucial for commercial satellites in low-Earth orbit.
Another focus area is space nuclear power. It’s expected to serve as a reliable source of energy on the lunar surface to sustain life and facilitate construction as humans return to the Moon and build the infrastructure needed to travel to Mars.
The rest of the technologies include: advanced manufacturing; communications and mission operations; in situ resource utilisation; life support and crew performance; navigation and sensing; propulsion; robotics; sample curation; and science instrumentation.
The roadmap also features a number of existing projects, which form part of the UK’s plan to become a space superpower. A notable example is Lunar Pathfinder, a satellite developed and operated by Surrey Satellite Technology, which will provide communication services around the Moon as part of the ESA’s Moonlight project.
The 11 technologies align with the aims of the UK’s National Space Strategy to advance and upgrade the country’s space industry — which has had a strong funding year so far. According to data from VC firm Seraphim Space, between Q2 2022 and Q2 2023, UK companies saw the world’s third highest investment in space tech, raising $311mn (€279mn).

Electric air taxi completes first untethered test flight,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/07/20,"
Vertical Aerospace’s electric urban air taxi has completed its maiden untethered flight, marking a significant milestone for the Bristol-based startup.
The flight took place on Wednesday at Cotswold Airport in southwest England, where a full-scale prototype of the VX4, the  company’s eVTOL, flew at about 70km/h or 40 knots.
According to the company, the aircraft was remotely piloted and reached the targeted speed powered only by its battery propulsion system. It managed to lift, hover, fly, and land successfully.
You can see footage of the flight in the video below:

 
Founded by British entrepreneur Stephen Fitzpatrick, Vertical Aerospace entered the eVTOL world in 2016 with the vision to electrify urban air mobility.
The VX4 is powered by eight electric motors mounted on movable nacelles and its 1MW powertrain is co-developed with Rolls- Royce. The eVTOL also boasts a 161km range with a top speed of 322km/h. The startup claims it can fly from London’s Heathrow Airport to Canary Wharf in 13 seconds.
As an air taxi, the aircraft can carry five people in total, including the pilot. In addition, it can be used as a medivac or cargo plane.
The VX4 is pending certification by the UK Aviation Authority in 2026, when Vertical Aerospace expects to start delivering its first eVTOLs. Nevertheless, the startup has received 1,400 pre-orders from airlines, operators, and rental companies. These include a number of big global industry players such as American Airlines, Virgin Atlantic, Air Asia, Japan Airlines, and Gol.
Following this week’s successful takeoff, the company’s planning further flight tests over the coming months, as well as developing a second prototype aircraft with “even more advanced technology,” the startup said in a statement.

"European VC deal value down 61% in first half of 2023, report finds",Thomas Macaulay,2023/07/20,"
Venture capital funding in Europe is plummeting as investors shift focus from growth to cutting costs.
In the first half of 2023, European VC deal value was 61% lower than at the same time last year, according to a new report by Pitchbook, a financial data firm.
The total capital raised in the continent was €8.9 billion. At the current rate, the full year is on track to pace 37% below 2022 levels.
 Analysts blame the decline on surging interest rates, high inflation, fundraising hurdles, and a subdued IPO market. 
These economic headwinds have prompted new investment strategies. Instead of prioritising growth at all costs, VCs are increasingly working with their startups to restructure operations and extend runways as far as possible.
A gloomy impact of this prudence is mass layoffs and hiring freezes at startups. British unicorn GoCardless, for instance,  is cutting 15% of its global workforce as of June 2023.  According to Pitchbook, startups with lower growth rates that need funding to survive are likely to face down rounds and valuation cuts. More companies are also likely to seek capital despite lower valuations.
This recently occurred at Getir, the Turkish food delivery app. In April, the company raised €435.5m from Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala at a valuation of €5.7bn. Just a year earlier, the same investor had injected €690.7m into Getir at a valuation of €9.9bn. The new funding effectively slashed the startup’s value by 42.4%.

The cautious approach has depressed both value and volume of deals. Exit activity has slowed to decade lows, with corporate acquisitions now the most common exit option. Debt-heavy leveraged buyouts, however, have lost share. 
US participation in European deals has also plunged. To date, American participation in VC deal value in 2023 is down 69% year-on-year.
The software sector, which laid the foundations for today’s VC industry, has been hit hard by the downturn. In the second quarter of 2023, the value of software deals dropped 71.8% year-on-year — more than any other sector.
“Just as the dot-com bubble reset the sector in 2000, we are seeing a similar reset from the bonanza of deals in 2021 and 2022,” said Pitchbook’s analysts.
Nonetheless, there are signs of hope. The generative AI investment boom could spur dealmaking for software startups in the space.
Sectors that are less cyclical in nature, such as biotech and pharma, have also shown resilience. A notable example of this is Ascend Gene And Cell Therapies. In May, the London-based startup raised €120.3m for its gene therapy tech.
Median deal size has doubled in recent years and sits at €2.1m for 2023. Credit: Pitchbook
Overall, Pitchbook’s data suggests a trend towards larger deals, often as follow-on VC investments that provide extra runway to their startups. Venture growth stage and late-stage deals, meanwhile, have gained a growing share of the VC deal count, while the proportion in angel and seed stages has shrunk.
The findings add further evidence of the current difficulties in securing funding. 
Mercifully, a recovery could be on the horizon — particularly in the US, where the Federal Reserve has suggested that monetary tightening will soon end. But in Europe, high inflation could lengthen the contractionary cycle.

"UK plan to police internet may be unlawful, force Wikipedia shutdown",Thomas Macaulay,2023/07/19,"
British plans to police the internet may be unlawful and force Wikipedia to shut down in the country, critics have warned.
The proposed legislation, named the Online Safety Bill, aims to protect people from illegal or “harmful” content. Under the rules, any platforms that host user-generated content will need to quickly remove any proscribed material, which ranges from porn to cyberbullying. Failure to comply could lead to massive fines, services being blocked, or even jail terms for executives.
Campaigners have long been alarmed about the threat to privacy and free speech. They now believe the rules could be unlawful.
Their concern stems from clause 9(2) of the bill, which requires platforms to prevent users from “encountering” certain “illegal content.” In a new legal opinion published today, experts warned that the clause may breach international law.
The legal advice was provided to the Open Rights Group by barristers from Matrix Chambers. They found that there is “likely to be significant interference with freedom of expression that is unforeseeable and which is thus not prescribed by law”.
This represents “a sea change in the way public communication and debate are regulated,” they said, as online content will need to be screened and blocked before it’s even posted. Furthermore, there are no provisions for explaining the restriction to users.
Monica Horten, policy manager for freedom of expression at Open Rights Group, said the rule “up-ends the existing legal order” on platforms.
“As well as being potentially unlawful, these proposals threaten the free speech of millions of people in the UK,” she warned. “It is yet another example of the government expecting Parliament to pass a law without filling in the detail.”
Surveillance in the guise of safety?
The legal opinion arrives amid a fierce backlash against the bill. One of the biggest critics is Wikipedia, which reportedly could withdraw from the UK over the rules.
The Wikimedia Foundation, which supports the site, has refused to comply with any age checks required under the bill. As a result, the online encyclopedia may be blocked.
“There is a material risk that, without further amendment or clarification, then Wikipedia and other similar services may feel they can no longer operate in the United Kingdom,” said Lord Allan of Hallam, a British politician who was Facebook’s director of policy in Europe for 10 years.
Some lawmakers have called for an exemption for public goods services such as Wikipedia. The site’s founder, however, would prefer to “rip this bill up and start over from scratch.” Jimmy Wales, who launched Wikipedia in 2001, described the legislation as “a travesty of justice which will make the UK internet obviously less safe.” 
Wales is also concerned about the law’s threat to encryption, which has alarmed messaging apps. Signal warns that plans to access end-to-end encrypted messages threaten privacy and safety. Element, another communications platform, goes a step further. The company says the legislation is “not an Online Safety Bill; it is an Online Surveillance Bill.”

New VR therapy helps schizophrenia patients rehabilitate,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/07/19,"
Researchers at Semmelweis University in Budapest have tapped into VR to help the rehabilitation process of schizophrenia patients.
According to WHO, the disease affects approximately 24 million people worldwide and is associated with considerable disability, often impacting all areas of life such as personal, social, and occupational functioning.
The scientists have developed the so-called VR-ToMIS therapy method (short for “Virtual-Reality based Theory of Mind Intervention in Schizophrenia”), which aims to enhance the patient’s mentalisation (Theory of Mind) skills — a fundamental component of human cognition and social interaction.
“Theory of Mind is our ability to interpret the feelings, thoughts, and desires of others. Schizophrenic patients tend to decode these messages incorrectly. They often struggle to understand irony and metaphors, or misunderstand certain gestures. Our method aims to improve these skills,” explained Dr Lajos Simon, head of the university’s Reality and Emotion research group.
How does it work?
VR-ToMIS, developed using the software of British startup vTime, consists of nine sessions in total. It starts with an introductory one to familiarise patients with the technology and basic concepts such as the Theory of Mind. Then follow eight 50-minute-long intervention sessions.
In the first step, patients wear VR glasses and become immersed in everyday situations that range from a walk on the beach or a blind date, to moving in with a roommate or meeting a new colleague. In all simulated scenarios, patients interact with an avatar controlled by a therapist. To uncover mentalisation deficits during the interaction, therapists use multiple linguistic tools, including metaphors, irony, humour, and double meaning sentences.

After this simulation is over, patients participate in a second interactive exercise with another novel VR device, the temporal disc controller. They are shown a 3D face on a screen and they’re asked to infer the right emotions it displays by moving a mouse around it.
“This is a very useful task because patients can display these emotions even if they don’t have the vocabulary to do so due to their illness,” Dr. Edit Vass, assistant lecturer at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy and co-developer of the VR therapy, told TNW.
The two simulations are followed by analytical discussion between the therapist and the patient. This process identifies any changes in behaviour that are needed to help make the patient more adaptive to the situations they practised on.
“Before we suggest practising these modified behavioural techniques as homework between the sessions, we offer patients the chance to repeat the simulations so they can see how the change of their behaviour can affect their emotions and thoughts about the situation,” Vass added.
She believes that the therapy’s overall “iterative approach” contributes significantly to its success.
Promising results
The testing phase of the VR-ToMIS method concluded in 2022, involving 43 patients. The researchers observed significant improvements in both the cognitive and negative symptoms of the participants. These include coherent thinking, social cognitive deficit, Theory of Mind, emotional bluntness, decreasing facial expressions, and apathy.

The patients’ feedback was also very positive. 93.3% of the participants found the method entertaining and 78% considered it an important part of their rehabilitation.
Meanwhile, 77.3% tried to apply the learned skills in real life situations, with 93.3% of them reporting subjective improvement in their communication skills, even if they didn’t practise to a high extent. On the other hand, 26.7% of the patients found the temporal disc controller task a challenging part of the intervention and 13.4% considered it cumbersome.
According to Vass, another crucial part of the method’s success was the “outstanding rate of patient compliance.”
“Compliance is the biggest obstacle to recovery in schizophrenia,” she told TNW. “In our therapy there were no dropouts, so I think that VR might have a non-specific motivational effect. Of course, the therapist’s approach might be another important factor as well.”
Vass noted that, although a direct link between VR and motivation isn’t supported by studies yet, “the main contributor would be the balance between the empathetic attitude of the therapist and the fact that this novel technology is very exciting for the patients.”
Semmelweis University has already obtained the Hungarian industrial trademark for VR-ToMIS, with plans to secure an international trademark within two years. The next step is training professionals in the field to use the method, initially in Hungary.

Meet Europe’s hydrogen trailblazers on a quest for zero-emission air travel,Linnea Ahlgren,2023/07/19,"
Hydrogen-powered planes are, essentially, nothing new. The USSR flew the alternative fuel testbed Tupolev Tu-155 on hydrogen (and liquid natural gas) more than 35 years ago. 
However, challenges associated with the technology meant that it was basically moth-balled for commercial aircraft operations (rocket fuel is another matter) — until now. With the future of the planet in peril, almost everyone in air transport wants to talk about hydrogen propulsion.
From startups to multinational original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), much of  the industry is adamant that hydrogen can make zero-emission flights a reality. 
It is just a matter of actually building the engines and the planes, ensuring adequate and economically viable fuel supply and infrastructure, scaling the technology — and, of course, convincing regulators that it is safe enough for commercial flights carrying passengers. 
“Most technologies required for a hydrogen-powered aircraft are emerging already in other industries and we have been working on this for some time already,” aerospace giant and hydrogen-propulsion proponent Airbus shared with TNW. “We’re not starting from scratch. The main challenge will be to certify them to airworthiness standards.”
Researchers have indeed been hard at work for years studying both direct combustion and the conversion of hydrogen into electrical energy through fuel cells. (Both are applicable to aviation and we will look more closely at them further on.) 
The technology has, on the whole, been proven to work. But what will it take to make air travel “guilt-free” in earnest? 
Past few years have seen ‘dramatic’ validation of hydrogen aviation
Aviation accounts for about 2.5% of carbon dioxide emissions worldwide. However, its share is rising quickly. The industry is expanding at an alarming rate, with the global fleet of aircraft predicted to grow by 80% by 2041, compared to pre-pandemic 2019 levels. Furthermore, aviation has an impact on the climate that goes far beyond CO2. 
“Sustainability in aviation used to be buying random offsets in various places,” Val Miftakhov, founder of hydrogen fuel-cell powertrain developer ZeroAvia, tells TNW. “In the last five years, we have seen dramatic validation of hydrogen aviation.” 
Miftakhov is something of a veteran in zero-emission transportation, having founded eMotorWerks, developing SmartGrid-integrated EV charging technologies, in 2010. After selling the company in 2017, Miftakhov, a long-time pilot hailing from a family legacy of aerospace engineering, turned his attention to decarbonising one of the world’s most hard-to-abate sectors. 
Zero emissions from the UK to the Netherlands by 2025
ZeroAvia has one of the most ambitious timelines in the hydrogen aviation industry. The company intends to have a fuel-cell engine capable of powering a 19-seater aircraft for flights between the Netherlands and the UK commercially ready as soon as 2025. 
In January this year, ZeroAvia flew a Dornier 228 19-seater testbed, at the time the largest commercial aircraft powered by a hydrogen fuel cell, for the first time. (That title has since been — temporarily — nicked by US-based Universal Hydrogen and its 40-seat ATR 72 nicknamed ‘Lightning McClean’. ZeroAvia intends to steal it back with a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400.)
The testbed aircraft took off from Cotswold Airport in Gloucester, UK, and was powered by a conventional engine on the right wing, and ZeroAvia’s ZA600 600 kW hydrogen-electric engine on the left.

The company is also developing a powertrain for 40 to 80-seater aircraft with a range of 1,000NM (1,852km), the ZA2000, which it says will be ready for commercial use by 2027. Thus far, it has secured €10bn in pre-orders from a number of the major global airlines and lessors, who plan to use it to retrofit their regional fleets. 
ZeroAvia is still mulling over a shortlist of potential manufacturing sites. “We are looking for the shipments of our engines to start in 2025. So we have to have production capacity next year, which means that we have to finalise locations this year,” Miftakhov told TNW, adding that the decision would probably be made by the end of summer. 
Realistic entry-into-service projections?  
Not everyone in the field shares ZeroAvia’s enthusiastic timeline. Josef Kallo, founder and CEO of H2FLY, a Stuttgart-based startup also developing a hydrogen-electric fuel-cell propulsion system, says that 40 seats with a range of about 2,000km is more likely to happen by 2029. 
“I am a little concerned that we have to tell a realistic path to the realisation, even if it’s a little bit more risky for the financing,” Kallo tells TNW, adding that he believes his colleagues in the space might be underestimating how much effort and time needs to go into component development. 
It’s not as if H2FLY hasn’t gotten far already. The company, founded out of the University of Ulm and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in 2015, performed the maiden flight of its four-seat hydrogen fuel-cell powered aircraft, the HY4, in 2016. It has since achieved several significant milestones, including the world altitude record for a hydrogen-powered aircraft, cruising at 7,230 feet.

Furthermore, H2FLY completed the successful integration of a new liquid hydrogen storage system in April this year. The ground fueling tests were part of the EU-funded Project Heaven (short for High powEr density FC System for Aerial Passenger VEhicle fueled by liquid HydrogeN), and the aircraft has now been shipped to Slovenia for a summer flight test campaign.
The company also recently announced the H175 program for its next generation fuel-cell system, capable of powering aircraft in the megawatt-class range, for 20 to 80 seats. H2FLY hopes to have it certified “by the end of this decade.” 
Retrofitting existing airframes compared to clean-sheet designs
If anyone thinks that civil aviation regulators would allow operators to strap even a conventional tube-and-wing configuration to some hydrogen tanks and off into the zero-emission future we go, they would, naturally, be mistaken. 
According to Airbus, hydrogen planes will “need to achieve equivalent or better safety levels [to kerosene-powered jets] before hydrogen-powered aircraft will take to the skies.” 
It can usually take anywhere between five to nine years to certify a new aircraft. Established OEMs will have a leg up on startups when it comes to certifying clean-sheet designs, due to experience of the process. 
This is why startup powertrain developers have decided to go down the route of retrofitting existing airframes with their propulsion systems. However, converting older airframes is not going to go on forever. 
“Really visionary is to have a new aircraft designed for the [hydrogen] propulsion and then use that with all the benefits to really have long-range, high-efficiency, low-noise aviation,” Kallo states.
Those who are looking to design larger aircraft powered by hydrogen will need a new approach to everything from aerodynamics, structural reinforcement, thermal management, and systems integration. 
Solving the storage problem
Hydrogen has a higher energy density by weight than jet fuel. However, it has a lower energy density by volume. This means that putting hydrogen tanks on a plane entails throwing out seats or cargo capacity, i.e. paying customers or payload, or altering the design of the aircraft. 
In addition, storage of hydrogen as a gas requires high-pressure tanks (350–700 bar tank pressure), whereas hydrogen as liquid, albeit taking up less space, requires cryogenic temperatures of -252.87°C. 
For instance, a blended wing body design (BWB) could offer potential benefits to storing hydrogen on board due to larger internal volume compared to traditional tube-and-wing designs.
A few intrepid companies out there are already intending to build new planes specifically designed for hydrogen propulsion. One is Swiss startup Destinus, which is developing a hypersonic hydrogen-powered jet capable of travelling at Mach 5 and above. 
Another concept is the blended wing body Kona, designed to “revolutionise the status quo of freight transportation,” from aerospace startup Natilus. The company recently completed flight testing of a quarter-scale prototype aircraft, following three years of extensive wind-tunnel testing.

While ZeroAvia has decided to go after existing types of aircraft for certification purposes, the company has all critical technologies, such as high-temperature fuel cells, motor and electronics development, in-house, and for very practical reasons. 
“There’s no supply chain for this yet, because it’s so new,” Miftakhov states. 
There might not be a supply chain for parts yet, but OEMs are also labouring away at new propulsion technologies. For example, British engine maker Rolls-Royce is also developing a range of products based on hydrogen fuel cells.  
Hydrogen-electric vs. direct combustion
A hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical cell that converts the chemical energy of hydrogen into electricity. Fuel cells enable aircraft to produce electricity autonomously without the need for a built-in battery that requires charging from an external power source. 
They do not have any moving parts and, as such, operate in near silence. As previously mentioned, this requires extensive component development. 
However, this is not the only technological pathway to flying planes on hydrogen. A more immediate means of using existing gas turbine technology would be through direct hydrogen combustion. 
Hydrogen combustion works in the same way as conventional internal combustion. It can work equally well in turboprop and turbofan engines and is scalable for different types of aircraft configurations and ranges. However, it comes with a different set of considerations. 
The technology eliminates most emissions and reduces some remaining ones such as nitrous oxide (NOx). But, it does produce water vapour, which in turn produces contrails. Research shows that contrails may be responsible for as much as 50% of aviation’s warming effects. 
However, the contrails produced by hydrogen combustion differ from those generated by burning fossil fuels. In July last year, Airbus announced a project called Blue Condor, which will use two gliders — one fitted with a H₂ combustion engine and one with a conventional kerosene engine — to study hydrogen contrail formation. 
ZEROe
Airbus is looking into both technological pathways. A little over two years ago, the European aerospace behemoth unveiled four possible hydrogen aircraft concepts — known collectively as ZEROe — with the promise of delivering one into commercial service by 2035. Three of the designs under the ZEROe umbrella use hydrogen combustion. 
One of these is a BWB. However, Airbus has said it will not be the first hydrogen plane out of the gate, as designing both a new propulsion system and a new airframe at the same time would be incredibly complicated. 
The BWB design could solve storage issues, but will not be the first to fly. Credit: Airbus
The fourth concept aircraft, representing a high-wing 100-seat regional airliner, features six eight-bladed propellers attached to removable fuel-cell engine pods. Essentially, each pod is a stand-alone propeller propulsion system. 
They feature propellers, electric motors, fuel cells, power electronics, liquid hydrogen tanks, cooling systems, and a set of auxiliary equipment. Due to the removable fixtures, the pods can be quickly disassembled and reassembled, potentially creating rapid solutions for refuelling at airports. 
In order to try the associated technologies, Airbus will use an A380 flying testbed equipped with liquid hydrogen tanks, and hydrogen engines mounted on the fuselage. The double-decker airframe employed for the mission is none other than MSN 001 — the very first A380 to roll out of the factory. Airbus says the demonstrator will take off on its first flight in the next five years.

Not all are convinced by Airbus’ efforts thus far. William Todts of Transport & Environment states that the company is spending more time and money building the hype than the planes. 
Meanwhile, there is another crucial element missing — the actual fuel to power all this innovation. Nobody will buy an aeroplane they cannot operate. Not only does the promised land of zero-emission aviation need access to an abundance of hydrogen; it needs it to be green. 
Green hydrogen
Green hydrogen is produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis using renewable electricity. Currently, it accounts for less than 1% of global hydrogen production, with the other 99% derived from non-renewable sources that produce greenhouse gas emissions. So what will it take to scale?
Carol Xiao, an expert on hydrogen with the Institute for Sustainable Process Technology (ISPT) in the Netherlands, says that, contrary to what she first thought when learning about the industry, money is not the problem. 
“The money is there,” Xiao tells TNW. However, she adds, investors will not commit as long as the supply and demand chains are not secure. 
According to Xiao, aviation can have a substantial impact when it comes to creating a market for green hydrogen. “If they say ‘we will use hydrogen’, especially green hydrogen, they will be a market which people can supply,” she continues. “It will help the supply chain make a decision on equipment, and it will also help get the infrastructure ready.”
Technology without a business case?
In addition, the industry will also be competing for materials to build hydrogen electrolysis production plants — and the renewable energy to run them. 
“I think if we fail, we will fail on the renewable energy provision, and not on the technology,” Josef Kallo says. “And this has to go hand in hand. Otherwise, we’re working on the technology but there is no business case because there is no infrastructure and fuel.”
Guillaume Faury, Airbus chief executive, seems to share these concerns. At a company event last year, Faury said that availability or lack of availability of clean hydrogen at the right quantity in the right place at the right price in the second half of the decade was a “big concern.” He further added that a lack of green hydrogen could be a reason for delaying the launch of the ZEROe programme aircraft. 
The renewable energy equation
Using renewable energy to produce hydrogen could help solve problems around what is known as intermittency — the unpredictable and fluctuating nature of certain renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power. 
“You can use hydrogen production and hydrogen storage as a grid storage mechanism; you can generate it when the renewable power is abundant on the grid, and then utilise it when you need to on the aircraft,” says Miftakhov. 
“That allows you to, in fact, increase the renewable penetration of the grid. We know that we can make it economical, and we can scale it.” 
Achieving economies of scale will also bring the cost of renewable hydrogen down, with predictions that the price will drop from the 2020 cost of 5–7$/kg, to ~3$/kg in 2030, and ~2$/kg in 2050. One recent study showed that, taking into account a potential tax on fossil jet fuel and the price of carbon, it could become cheaper to run a hydrogen plane than its kerosene-powered counterpart by 2035. 
How aviation can be certain it will get priority when it comes to accessing a limited supply — or all the renewable energy it will require — is another matter. 
Aviation’s decarbonisation journey is anything but easy. Nor is it moving at a fast enough pace. With record-breaking aircraft orders happening as we speak, it is clear that neither airlines nor aircraft manufacturers have any intention of curbing the industry’s growth. 
With all the challenges that hydrogen-powered aviation still has to face, it may seem like a long shot. But with concerted efforts and the potential for widespread adoption, it could maybe, just maybe, make zero-emission air travel a reality.

Why brands actually benefit from staying true to their cultural roots,Sherzad Rahmatian,2023/07/18,"
Six years ago I moved from the US to the EU to break from American culture and try something new. But in this short time, I’ve seen Amsterdam, my adopted home, morph into a place that can sometimes feel culturally more like San Francisco than a major European capital.
My anecdotal experience is the result of a larger commercial exchange between Europe and the United States reaching new heights. A flurry of retail investment apps inspired by America’s Robinhood are getting Europeans, historically more prone to saving, to invest their money for the very first time. Mobility startups looking to replicate Uber’s success have flourished in Europe with copycats like Bolt and Gett. And the European food tech ecosystem saw explosive growth through the pandemic as Europeans experienced the new convenience of having their food and groceries delivered on-demand.
Working daily across both markets, we at SYLVAIN see this blending of cultures as a state of ‘Europicana’ – a feeling of sameness in consumer culture and brand offerings in both markets.
You could argue this, or any cultural blending, creates more commercial potential for brands to scale across borders by catering to like-minded consumers. And there’s no doubt that companies can benefit from global consistency. Every business-building playbook will advocate for it because it’s cost-efficient, builds equity, and aids scalability. Tech companies, in particular, follow this guidance. With pressures to scale fast and gain ground in a market, it’s also easiest to create a one-size-fits-all global strategy.
But what is lost when brands expand without a sense of cultural consciousness and nuance? While business models can travel well, the same cannot always be said for brands, for which culture has always been the lifeblood. In fact, consumers are increasingly pushing back against homogeneity and yearning for a return to communities, spaces, and subcultures that reflect their uniqueness. Demonstrating this point — a 2022 survey revealed that 68% of consumers feel more positively about brands demonstrating cultural knowledge, while another 2023 report showed businesses that used cultural data in their marketing strategy saw a 19% increase in engagement. And in the US, 38% of Americans shop local because they want to feel a sense of connection back to their community.
Others are rescinding loyalty to mass cultures that have lost the nuance that made them special. Sneakerheads hate how sneaker culture has been gentrified, and even the UFC, once a fringe sport, now has a mainstream audience, and many are claiming “casual fans” are ruining the viewing experience.
So how can brands bypass these traps to steward culture, and what role can tech brands play in the emerging movement against homogeneity?
1. Anchor through an authentic sense of place or space
Culture is formed around a shared physical (or proverbial) place, whether that be a city, cuisine, language, or myth. And brands with ambitions to grow big don’t need to dilute this in order to appeal to mass audiences.
How might tech brands travel around the world while remaining ‘rooted’ in a sense of place? Perhaps the best examples to learn from are FMCG brands that have proven this. Muji oozes the simplicity and functionality of Japanese lifestyle in all of its 700 stores. Havaianas takes consumers’ minds to the laid back beaches of Brazil. Desigual celebrates the vibrant, creative energy of its native Barcelona.
While the majority of tech companies are inherently placeless, they can still represent an idea, story or set of values through product, service or brand experience. For example, Apple has infamised “designed in California” as an homage not only to its headquarters but also to its design ethos, proving that tech brands can also ground in a sense of place.
2. Tap into the subcultures that transcend physical borders
If the 20th century’s greatest brands exported the mass culture of a place, the 21st century’s might be rooted in more niche subcultures that can be formed anytime and anywhere, much like tech companies.
How might tech brands, which often grow popular first by solving for niche audiences, maintain relevance within subcultures? Tech brands like Nike showcase the breadth of NYC dance subculture by weaving together interviews and moves from real NYC dancers in Own The Floor. Van Moof brings a Dutch POV on the role of cycling in smart cities through its e-bike business. And our recent work with Disney embodies the full complexity of the Black experience in its digital platform Andscape.
3. Re-centre the voice of the consumer
Ultimately, cultures require people to generate, nurture, and protect them. Rather than seeking to own, arbitrate, and express culture themselves, brands can set egos aside, re-centering and elevating the voices of the people who are at the centre of the cultures themselves – their own consumers.
How might tech brands, often leaning on personalisation as a solution, let consumers truly lead the way? Patagonia answers to the calling of environmentalists and treats them as stakeholders in the wider business. And Airbnb’s “experiences offering” elevates hosts to cultural experts who bring an on-the-ground, human voice to the brand experience, to name a few.
For how ubiquitous tech brands are in our everyday life, they can have an outsized role in the anti-homogeneity movement. And consumers will reward them for it. Ultimately, it’s up to digitally-native tech brands to lead a next era of branding which celebrates and nurtures culture, rather than losing it.

"Early-stage European SaaS startups set for funding rebound, report finds",Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/07/16,"
In the second half of the year, early-stage European SaaS companies will see a significant funding increase across Series A and seed rounds. That’s according to the aVC index, a new monitoring tool developed by London-based AlbionVC and Google Cloud.
The aVC index is based on an anonymous survey of 40 investors, who are actively deploying capital into the European ecosystem at seed, Series A, and Series B stages. The respondents expect to invest £2.4bn (€2.8bn) early-stage SaaS startups by the end of the year.
The projected recovery follows stagnant investment activity in Q2 2023. Specifically, 25% of VCs chose not to issue new term sheets despite having sufficient capital available. UK funds issued an average of three terms sheets, while their European counterparts came at an average of two. Overall, only 4% of all portfolio companies received externally-led term sheets.
In addition, two in five VCs believe valuations will fall further in 2023, with a quarter predicting a 20% or higher drop. But, in total, respondents reported that they expect more investor-friendly terms.
Nevertheless, there is cause for optimism in the second half of the year. The aVC index found that Q2 already showed an increase in the number of companies within investors’ active pipelines.
The index’s Q2 score reached 54 — with a rating below 50 indicating a contraction in the market and a rating at 50 indicating no market change. For Series A, in particular, the index was 57.1, pointing to higher funding activity in this stage.
Meanwhile, the VCs surveyed reported they have significant capital reserves, with two-thirds of the funds dedicated to new investments and the remaining one-third intended for follow-on investments.
“The funding market now appears to have bifurcated. Some companies are attracting 2021 levels of interest — whether because they are in super hot sectors (including gen AI and climate tech), or because there is strong investor demand and a limited supply of exceptional companies,” said Robert Whitby-Smith, Partner at AlbionVC.
“While such deals are still an exception there is a feeling among VCs that the tide is turning and an expansion in the aVC index at Series A confirms this.”

New deal on EU-US data flows sparks privacy fears and business uncertainty,Thomas Macaulay,2023/07/14,"
A new deal on data transfers between the EU and US has alarmed businesses and privacy campaigners.
The pact, known as the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, was announced on Monday by the European Commission. The EU’s executive body concluded that the US offered an “adequate level of protection” for data transfers under the new arrangements.
The framework replaces the Privacy Shield, which the EU’s top court had struck down in July 2020 over concerns that the US didn’t provide sufficient protection against government surveillance. 
As a result, companies were forced to move data by using a mechanism called Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC), which can be burdensome to manage. As Meta recently learned, the process could also have costly consequences. 
In June, the Facebook owner was fined €1.2bn for mishandling personal information under SCCs — a record penalty for a breach of the GDPR. Meta described the ruling as “unjustified and unnecessary.”
Under the new framework, companies have been offered hope of clearer, easier data flows for companies. The deal also adds new safeguards, including a new review court for data protection and restricted access to EU data by US intelligence services.
Yet critics say the new arrangements provide insufficient safety. They note that the Fourth Amendment still doesn’t apply to EU citizens, which would protect them from US government spying under existing American legislation.
“[The framework] limits US spy agencies to what is ‘necessary and proportionate,’ but that is little comfort to EU citizens who remember similar promises under Safe Harbour and Privacy Shield,” said Paul Bischoff, consumer privacy advocate at cybersecurity site Comparitech.
Another cause of concern is the possibility of further changes. The privacy campaigner Max Schrems, who previously challenged data-sharing deals between the US and the EU, has already threatened legal action against the new framework.
As a result, businesses must now adapt to yet another set of rules that could also be undone.
“The fact that the agreement has already been successfully challenged twice means there is a real risk it will be invalidated once again, leaving companies further in the dark about how to move forward,” Cory Munchbach, CEO of customer data platform BlueConic.
The challenge from Schrems and his privacy non-profit, noyb (None Of Your Business), could lead the framework to be overturned within a few years.
David Dumont, a lawyer at Hunton Andrews Kurth, who specialises in EU privacy law, warns that businesses need reassurances they can rely on the new rules.
“If the new adequacy decision would, once again, be struck down by the Court of Justice of the EU, organisations may lose faith in the feasibility of a successful EU–U.S. data transfer framework and turn to EU Standard Contractual Clauses as their sole and permanent solution to legitimise data transfers to the States.”

Spotify CEO’s startup for AI-powered preventive healthcare raises €60M,Linnea Ahlgren,2023/07/5,"
Spotify founder and CEO Daniel Ek’s preventive healthcare startup just received a very strong vote of confidence from venture capitalists. Earlier today, Neko Health announced it had raised €60mn in a round led by Lakestar and backed by Atomico and General Catalyst. 
The funds will be put towards expanding the concept outside of the company’s native Sweden, where it currently operates a private body-scan clinic. 
Neko Health, named after the Japanese word for cat, was founded in 2018 by Ek and Hjalmar Nilsonne. After much secrecy, its first clinic opened in February this year in Stockholm. Within two hours, it was fully booked out and 5,000 people were placed on a waiting list. 
“I’ve spent more than 10 years exploring the untapped potential of healthcare innovation,” Ek said in a statement. “We are dedicated to building a healthcare system that focuses on prevention and patient care, aiming to serve not just our generation, but those that follow.”
3D body scans
At the clinic, people go through a 3D full-body scan in a minimalist booth that would not look out of place in an episode of Star Trek, fitted with dozens of sensors and powered by, you guessed it, artificial intelligence. In particular, algorithms can immediately detect potential skin conditions and risk of cardiovascular disease. 
Patients (are they still called that in preventative care?) also go through laser scans and an ECG, which, altogether, takes between 10 and 20 minutes. They may not be met by Bones himself after the examinations, but their results are looked over and explained by an actual, human, doctor. 
“We have our own nurses, doctors and specialists,” Nilsonne told Bloomberg. “We have dermatologists employed just to review the skin images. There is a doctor on site who can make qualified medical judgments for anything that comes up.”
The price for a Neko Health assessment is €250, and the company has performed over 1,000 scans since launch. Close to 80% of customers have reportedly prepaid for follow-up scans after a year. 
AI does indeed hold great potential for disease prevention and early detection — but only if the results are interpretable. It is unclear how much insight Neko Health physicians have into how the algorithm makes its predictions (as in, which factor contributes to the risk of cardiovascular disease so the patient/client can be better informed about what measures to take).
Purpose and ambition
One of the company’s backers is Skype co-founder and founder of Atomico, Niklas Zennström, who will also be taking a seat on the board. He sees enormous potential in the new venture from the man who essentially changed how we consume music. 
“Neko Health is exactly the type of mission that gets us excited at Atomico. It’s that rare combination of a firm with a purpose and outsized ambition, and founders with a world class track record,” Zennström said. “They’re solving a problem we can all relate to, with the potential to fundamentally transform global healthcare forever.”

The startups on a mission to upgrade Ireland’s meagre EV charging network,Chris Baraniuk,2023/07/5,"
Next month, 50 homeowners in Ireland will start renting out their home electric car charging points to their neighbours with the help of a new app. It’s “the Airbnb of electric vehicle (EV) home chargers,” says GoPlugable co-founder Maebh Reynolds.
The app’s trial launch will be limited to that first group of 50 people who have their own charging point at home, and around 50 people with electric cars who would like to park up and pay to use them. If all goes well, a wider public launch could follow in September or October. 
“We are drastically falling behind in terms of public charger availability,” says Reynolds of the charging network in Northern Ireland, as she explains why she and her co-founder decided to develop the app. “For a lot of people, it’s the main reason why they won’t switch to electric vehicles.”
Such is the dearth of charging points that Reynolds says she has heard from individuals in Ireland who are already handing over cash to neighbours with chargers on an ad hoc basis, just so they can juice up their EV. In the GoPlugable app, such neighbours are defined as “hosts,” and the platform is designed to help them manage payments and advertise their charging point to more EV owners in their area. 
To date, Belfast-based GoPlugable has raised £50,000 via competitions and grants, and the company has a headcount of two co-founders and two interns.
Worst in Europe?
It’s just one of many private businesses aiming to improve the EV charging network across Ireland. In Northern Ireland, there are 20 public charging points per 100,000 people — far below the UK average of 60 per 100,000. And last year, price comparison service Uswitch named the Republic of Ireland the worst place to own an EV out of a list of 34 European countries.
In the Republic, 80% of charging occurs at home, which suggests a severe lack of public charging infrastructure. The Irish Electric Vehicle Association estimates that there are around 2,000 public chargers in the country – but not many of them are rapid chargers. 
These devices can fully power up some EV batteries in less than an hour. But in the Republic, a country of five million people, there are only a few hundred such chargers available to the public, though this number is set to more than double under government plans.
GoPlugable’s approach is based on opening up access to domestic chargers in communities in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Hosts will be able to set whatever price they like for, say, a 60-minute charge, says Reynolds, and EV owners will have to go through identity verification and submit their vehicle registration to the app before being able to book a slot.
This might be convenient if you live near someone with a charger who’s willing to rent it out – but what if you just need some power, quickly, while out and about? 
“There needs to be some good on-street solutions, possibly some good local hubs,” says Jade Edwards, head of insights at Zapmap, which has charted the location of thousands of public chargers around the island of Ireland.
If hubs are the answer, someone is going to have to build them. Weev, a Belfast-based startup recently received £50 million in funding from UK energy firm Octopus to greatly scale up the EV charging network in public areas in Northern Ireland. The firm will focus on establishing hub-style sites with multiple chargers, including at locations along major arterial routes.
The need is growing. EV ownership is rising in Northern Ireland at a noticeably high rate – with a 72% increase in battery electric vehicle registrations there in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021.
“We have about 30 sites at the moment with 70 public chargers,” says Weev chief executive Philip Rainey. “Moving from that position to having over 3,000 chargers around the province is the challenge.”

Don’t make me wait
Weev wants to achieve this in just three years and the vast majority of chargers will be rapid chargers, he emphasises. The devices are popular with users because they let them power up their vehicles even while making a quick visit to a shop or while attending a work event at a hotel, for example. The company currently has a headcount of just over 20 people but is planning to increase this to 50 during the next 12 months.
One huge hurdle in Northern Ireland, according to the Electric Vehicle Association Northern Ireland (EVANI), a non-profit, is the sheer cost of setting up new connection infrastructure whenever someone decides to build an EV charging hub. 
Unlike the rest of the UK or Ireland, in Northern Ireland, installers must sometimes stump up 100% of the funds required for upgrading the electricity network in the area in order to connect the new chargers to it. Elsewhere, such costs are often “socialised” or spread across multiple users of the network.
It is a kind of “first mover disadvantage”, argues Mark McCall, EVANI co-founding director and chairman: “Not only does that affect EVs, it affects connection of wind turbines and heat pumps, solar — all these low-carbon technologies.”
Depending on the scale and location of the hub, it could mean that the price tag for installing it runs into the millions whereas, in Great Britain, the same hub might only cost a few hundred thousand pounds to set up, EVANI suggests.
TNW asked NIE Networks, which owns the electricity network in Northern Ireland, for comment on this situation but did not receive a response. 
Charging ahead
Rainey says that Weev intends to be “strategic” about where it sites new hubs, and will piggyback on under-used electricity network infrastructure at certain locations, to avoid excessive charges for new connections.
Meanwhile, in the Republic of Ireland, there is also a huge push to improve the public EV charging network, says Ricky Hill, Ireland Country Manager at Monta, a Danish startup that has developed software to help charging point operators manage their devices.
“We know we need to put more in because the rate that EVs are being bought now is really increasing,” he says, adding that Monta covers just under 3,000 charging points across the island of Ireland. Within 18 months, that number should rise to between 17,000 and 20,000 chargers, estimates Hill. Monta employs 170 people and has raised €50 million to date.
The company’s software gives operators a live view of available charging points on their own network, including whether a specific charger is currently in use, and any indications of downtime. 
In the near future, the platform will introduce new features such as smart charging based on variable energy prices, says Hill. In total, Monta helps to manage 90,000 chargers, most of which are in Europe, where growth of EV charging infrastructure has, in general, been “phenomenal” lately, says Hill. 
Ireland might have been slow off the mark — but it now seems ready to join the EV party in earnest.

"Grocery delivery app Getir exits Spain, after bidding adieu to France",Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/07/3,"
Following its upcoming exit from France, quick commerce startup Getir is losing yet another European market: Spain.
According to Spanish trade union CCOO, Getir failed to raise sufficient capital in a recent funding round. As a result, it will cease operations in the country and lay off its entire workforce of 1,560 employees.
“We condemn the disastrous business management of Getir, which has not known how to grow or have a market strategy in Spain. Now its staff will suffer the biggest harm,” the union said in a statement.
The Turkish-owned Getir Group emerged as the greatest rapid grocery delivery company in Europe, expanding across seven countries and gradually absorbing rival Gorillas and Frichti. It even reached decacorn status, after achieving a $12bn (€11bn) in March 2022. But in the post-pandemic world it has struggled to reach profitability.
The soaring inflation, stricter regulations on “dark stores” (where the products are stored before delivery), and consumer return to in-person grocery shopping have left quick commerce companies hanging in the balance.
With its user base and revenue in decline, the Getir group has moved to layoffs and mass store closures over the past few months. In France alone, the company counts €17.6mn in debt and was placed in receivership by the court of trade in Paris.
At the moment of writing, the startup has declined to comment on its upcoming exit from Spain. But according to the CCOO, it will comply with the national legal requirements for laid-off employees. These include an outplacement plan, 20 days’ severance pay per year with a maximum of 12 monthly payments, and a special agreement for individuals aged over 55.
Getir’s example proves an overarching trend in Europe: the appetite for rapid grocery delivery is fading away. Alongside Flink, Zapp, and Gopuff, Getir is among the last remaining companies in the region — where it seems that the quick commerce bubble is bursting.

European companies hate the EU’s new AI rules — here’s why,Thomas Macaulay,2023/06/30,"
Artificial intelligence sure is keeping the post office busy. After a recent flurry of open letters about runaway AI, unregulated AI, and apocalyptic AI, another missive arrived on the EU’s doorstep today.
In this case, however, the signatories have raised a contrary concern. Rather than call for more rules, they fear there will soon be too many.
Their target is the impending AI Act. Billed as the world’s first comprehensive legislation for the tech, the new rules are trying to walk the fine line between ensuring safety and supporting innovation. The new letter, signed by executives at some of Europe’s biggest companies, warns that they’re losing balance.
“The draft legislation would jeopardise Europe’s competitiveness and technological sovereignty without effectively tackling the challenges we are and will be facing,” said the letter, sent to the European Parliament, Commission, and member states.


“States with the most powerful models will have a decisive competitive advantage.


The signatories encompass bigwigs at corporate giants including Heineken, Carrefour, and Renault, as well as leaders at tech firms such as Ubisoft, TomTom, and Mistral AI. They say the AI Act will lead to companies leaving the bloc, investors redirecting cash, and stunted development in Europe.
One of their chief concerns stems from a recent change to the rules. On June 14, the European Parliament added new requirements on generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, which would provoke “disproportionate” compliance costs and liability risks, according to the signatories.
They warn that this will push Europe further behind the US in AI development. This impact, they continue, will extend from the economy to culture, as large language models will be embedded into everything from search engines to digital assistants.
“States with the most powerful large language models will have a decisive competitive advantage… Europe cannot afford to stay on the sidelines,” said the letter.
Bending AI rules
In addition to raising the complaints, the business leaders proposed some solutions.
Their principal suggestion is restricting EU laws to broad principles in a risk-based approach, which would be implemented by a dedicated body and adaptable to new advances and risks. Such a process, they said, should be developed in dialogue with the economy.
The signatories also expressed support for some aspects of the AI Act. Specifically, they endorsed mandatory safety testing for new systems, standard labelling of AI-generated content, and a duty of care in model development.
Those overtures haven’t won over the lawmakers, however. Dragos Tudorache, who co-led the drafting of the AI Act, promptly rebuffed the letter.
“I am convinced they have not carefully read the text but have rather reacted on the stimulus of a few who have a vested interest in this topic,” he told Reuters.
On the plus side for the authors, there’s still time to write plenty more letters. The AI Act isn’t expected to come into force before 2026.

"Solar-hybrid car explodes, killing two Italian researchers",Siôn Geschwindt,2023/06/30,"
Two Italian researchers have died after a solar-powered hybrid car prototype they were test-driving exploded last week near the city of Naples.
The vehicle, a rejigged VW Polo, was being developed as part of an EU-funded project to convert old combustion engine cars into solar-powered hybrids. The prototype caught alight last Friday during a test drive, leaving the two occupants in critical condition.
Maria Vittoria Prati, a researcher at Italy’s National Council of Research (CNR), died of complications from third-degree burns on Monday. 
Earlier this week, the CNR paid tribute to Ms Prati as “a brilliant researcher” and “an expert in the field of emissions studies and the use of alternative fuels”.
The other occupant, research apprentice Fulvio Filace, 25, died overnight, a spokesperson for the Cardarelli hospital in Naples told Reuters on Thursday.

Naples authorities are investigating the cause of the explosion, according to ANSA news agency, although no specific suspects have yet been identified.
The CNR said on Thursday it has launched an internal audit to “reconstruct the cause of the very serious incident” and is cooperating with investigators.
The test was part of the EU-funded Life-Save project, which was researching ways to retrofit regular combustion engines with additional electric motors, which were charged by batteries and solar panels mounted on the vehicle’s roof and bonnet. 
Solar-powered cars have been touted as a potential solution to the lack of infrastructure and affordable charging needed to accelerate the electric vehicle revolution, but the technology is still in its nascent stages. 
Life-Save secured almost €1.8m in funding from the European Commission since 2017 under its LIFE programme, a fund that supports clean tech startups.
Since the incident, Life-Save has disabled its website, which now features a tribute expressing condolences to the families of the deceased.

Opinion: We can’t engineer ourselves out of the climate crisis,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/06/30,"
Let’s face it — climate change is humanity’s greatest screw-up. We’ve known about it for almost a century. The science is clear. And yet, we’ve done nothing. It’s a f**king embarrassment. 
Now, finally, global leaders are scrambling to clean up the mess. But, even though most of the climate solutions we need already exist, we can’t seem to get our arses in gear to deploy them at the pace and scale required. 
In short, the world is heating up, and we are failing to cool it down. Humans emitted more CO2 into the atmosphere last year than ever before (uh…WTF?).
Understandably, leaders are scared shitless. Which is pushing them to explore some pretty dumb, and outright dangerous, ideas. One of their worst brainwaves is geoengineering — AKA playing God with the Earth’s climate. (“Geoengineering” as used here does not refer to carbon removal technologies which are, to the best of our knowledge, pretty legit.) 
Some of these proposals include brightening clouds, altering the ocean’s chemistry, or shooting particles into the atmosphere to dim the light of the sun — what could go wrong?
While these proposals might sound like something from a dystopian sci-fi flick, it’s actually remarkably easy, and cheap, to alter the Earth’s climate.  
Solar geoengineering is one of the more controversial of these “solutions”. Its most popular derivative, stratospheric aerosol injection, involves shooting dust into the atmosphere to reduce the amount of sunlight hitting the Earth’s surface. The tech was inspired by volcanic clouds which have been known to cool the entire planet for years following a major eruption.
Clouds increase the reflectivity of the Earth’s surface. Stratospheric aerosol injection aims to replicate this effect by spraying dust into the upper atmosphere, in hopes to cool the climate. Credit: Woovii/Getty Images
While stratospheric aerosol injection could be remarkably effective in halting global heating, it might open a Pandora’s box of problems. According to a recent UN report, interfering in the globe’s natural climate could damage the ozone layer, alter global rainfall patterns, and cause severe geopolitical tensions.
While proponents say solar geoengineering would be a short-term measure to combat warming, a recent study published in Scientific American suggests that if politicians do decide to shoot dust into the atmosphere they could become dangerously dependent on it for “centuries or more.”  
To put enough dust in the atmosphere to curb warming could require tens of thousands of high-altitude flights per year. A sudden halt to this process could cause temperatures to skyrocket, potentially faster than life could adapt, a concept known as “termination shock.”  
Then there’s the ethical issue that a techno-fix could take pressure off politicians and businesses to decarbonise as fast as possible. 
Simply put, solar geoengineering could be the equivalent of a climate change band-aid. 
Despite the risks, last year, the US government set up a five-year research programme exploring ways to reflect more sunlight back into space, setting the stage for further funding into the nascent technology.  
Billionaires including Bill Gates, George Soros, and Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz have all expressed their interest, while 60 prominent scientists want to conduct small-scale solar geoengineering field experiments. 
There’s even a startup, Make Sunsets, that is preselling carbon credits based on its promise to release sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere to curb warming.
US startup Make Sunsets was kicked out of Mexico for conducting unsanctioned tests of stratospheric aerosol injection. Several researchers at MIT Technology Review have condemned Make Sunsets, saying its efforts are “wildly premature”.
The precautionary principle — or “if in doubt, leave it out,” to ordinary folks — is one of the fundamental premises of sound environmental decision-making, and one that we ought to heed going forward. 
In a potentially positive step, the EU announced this week a call for talks at the “highest international level” on the risks posed by the possible use of climate geoengineering.
“These technologies introduce new risks to people and ecosystems, while they could also increase power imbalances between nations, spark conflicts and raises a myriad of ethical, legal, governance and political issues,” said EU officials in a joint communication on Wednesday.


 “We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking that created them. 


While the EU is taking a precautionary approach, it is not outright against the technologies and seeks to create “rules” for governing them. 
Others are taking a harder line. 
In a statement issued last year, Frank Biermann from Utrecht University’s Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development, warned that “the risks of solar geoengineering are poorly understood and can never be fully known.”
Biermann is the leader of a group of renowned climate scientists calling for a non-use agreement on solar geoengineering. In other words, a worldwide ban on its development.  
“Research on solar geoengineering is not the preparation of a Plan B to prevent climate disaster, as its advocates argue. It will instead simply delay and derail current global climate policies,” he said.
“Moreover, the current system of international institutions is incapable of effectively regulating the deployment of this technology on a global scale. Solar geoengineering is no solution.”
I couldn’t agree more, professor. By playing God with the climate we not only risk worsening our predicament, but we also send a dangerous message — that humans can simply engineer their way out of their problems, rather than fix them at the root (think widespread cultural, social, and political transformation).  
As Einstein famously quipped: “We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking that created them.”

Digital euro framework seeks to quell privacy concerns,Thomas Macaulay,2023/06/29,"
The digital euro is edging closer to reality, despite concerns over the project’s privacy risks and functionality.
The European Commission on Wednesday proposed a legal framework for the electronic currency. Under the draft legislation, digital euros would be accepted for transactions anywhere in the eurozone, but cash would remain safeguarded as a form of payment. It would then be up to the European Central Bank (ECB) to decide if, and when, to issue the digital currency.
“In the euro area, the digital euro would offer a digital payment solution that is available to everyone, everywhere, for free,” said Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Commission’s executive vice president.
According to Dombrovskis, the project will modernise payments, enhance financial inclusion, and support innovation. He also emphasised the need to protect the eurozone from rival digital payment systems.
“If other central bank digital currencies were allowed to be used more widely for cross-border payments, we would risk diminishing the attractiveness of the euro… and the euro could become more exposed to competition from alternatives such as global stablecoins,” he said.
Unlike cryptocurrencies, the digital euro would be backed by a central bank. That could reduce volatility, but it’s triggered anxieties about government control.
These concerns are prevalent across the bloc. In a consultation last year, 43% of respondents said privacy was what they wanted most from the digital euro. The next most desired features were security (18%), usability across the euro area (11%), absence of additional costs (9%), and offline use (8%).
The share of citizens per country who ranked privacy as the most important feature of a digital euro.
Privacy advocates have raised fears about monitoring transactions and government control of personal finances. Other critics question whether the bloc needs its own digital currency. They argue that existing digital payments already provide sufficient functionality. 
In response, the EU has added various safeguards and features.
To allay the privacy concerns, lawmakers have promised that ECB would not see users’ personal details or their payment patterns.
Users will also be able to pay offline. Officials say this will provide greater privacy than any current digital payment methods. They also argue that the digital euro will reduce payment-related fees for consumers by spurring competition for the likes of Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal.
Mairead McGuinness, the EU’s financial regulation chief, describes the digital euro as “a project of choice” rather than “a project of control. “
“By complementing cash, I have no doubt that a digital euro will bring advantages to citizens and businesses across the EU,” she said. “But I am aware that it requires peoples’ trust and confidence.”
That process remains a long way from completion. The proposal will now go to the European Parliament and EU member states for amendments, which provides another opportunity to address concerns.

Opinion: European startups should welcome global tech layoffs with open arms,Janis Kreilis,2023/06/29,"
Like a runaway train, the tech sector’s layoff spree shows no sign of hitting the brakes in 2023. Layoffs.fyi found that between January and May this year, more than 200,000 people around the world found themselves on the wrong end of the pink slip.
Echoing through the industry like a gong are the layoffs from big tech. Silicon Valley giants collectively slashed over 104,000 roles last year, and these cutbacks are far from over. Meta, for instance, began a round of layoffs last month targeting up to 6,000 people, as part of plans to eliminate 21,000 total roles across a so-called year of efficiency. 
To some degree, this was expected — publicly-listed tech titans sway to the tune of the stock market, and it’s been a bear market since January 2022. And it’s not just the giants in the forest facing this storm. The saplings are bending, too. 
Startups in Europe collectively cut over 40,000 jobs between March 2022 and March 2023. For example, the Netherlands-based MessageBird laid off 31% of its staff (approximately 250 people) in November 2022, while Spain’s Glovo cut loose 250 people in January this year.
It’s high time for Europeans to sound the alarm — just not the kind you might think.
The European layoff landscape – not quite the apocalypse
First off, most job cuts are happening outside of Europe. 
According to Atomico’s State of European Tech report for 2022, only 7% of the global workforce cutbacks have been in Europe. Similarly, Layoffs.fyi data for the past two years show that only roughly 12% of all laid-off workers were based in Europe.
Even global tech giants with offices in Europe are letting go of fewer employees here than anywhere else — and there are two main reasons for that.
First of all, companies like Amazon and Google are finding it hard to copy and paste their mass layoff tactics in Europe, thanks to the continent’s labour protections. 
For example, Google’s branches in France and Germany haven’t had any staff reductions in 2023, and the company has announced that no layoffs are planned in Romania, Greece, or Austria. In the UK, on the other hand, the labour protection regulations aren’t as robust since Brexit, thus Google plans to bid adieu to around 500 of its 8,000 employees there.
Secondly, in Europe, tech talents such as sales reps, software engineers, and systems analysts are still in very high demand. In Q4 last year when the global mass layoffs took up the speed, there were still close to a million open vacancies in tech across 11 EU countries analysed by trade association CompTIA. 
In addition, a DESI report showed that European companies had a hard time filling these roles. Around 55% of enterprises that recruited or tried to recruit ICT specialists said they found it difficult. 
In other words, the EU’s tech layoffs are a drop in the ocean compared to the tech talent shortage in the bloc, which is predicted to reach 3.9 million people by 2027. This explains why, amid the talent crunch in Europe, tech companies, both big and small, are cautious when it comes to workforce reductions. If hiring is already painful, firing is even more so. 
The global talent bazaar: Can Europe fill its talent gap?
American companies are letting people go, while Europe desperately lacks talent. Doesn’t that sound like a perfect match? This is Europe’s chance to attract the talent American companies have hired, trained for the tech industry, and then dropped like a hot potato.
And it gets better. Global tech talents are showing interest in joining European companies, either by relocating or working remotely. According to the Landing.jobs report, 34.1% of respondents listed Europe as their preferred continent to work, while North America ranked second with 24.9%.
Europe’s allure is a rich tapestry of factors, from its employee-friendly labour laws to its emphasis on work-life balance. And in these tough economic times, European startups have become attractive to the global talent pool for another reason — higher job security.
For decades, European startups have had comparatively limited access to later-stage capital. While American founders developed and adopted the hyper-growth mindset, European companies learned to survive by prioritising profit. Compared to their American counterparts, European founders are more cautious. While this often holds them back, this time it has paid off – we’re seeing fewer layoffs and employees, as a result, can be more confident about holding onto their jobs.
With global talent eyeing Europe, and European companies growing increasingly open to hiring remotely to fill the talent gap, it looks like a win-win. Besides, the fact that mass layoffs have affected even major tech companies has shattered people’s illusions of “job security” in big tech. This, ironically, makes the prospect of joining a smaller startup seem less of a gamble. Thus, it’s the chance of a lifetime for early-stage startups to hire talent they otherwise might not be able to attract.

"Flying car startup eyes 2025 takeoff following US, EU certification",Siôn Geschwindt,2023/06/28,"
Flying cars have captured the public imagination for decades, but have yet to enter the mainstream. However, with investors pouring cash into the sector, could the 2020s be the decade when sci-fi vision becomes reality? German startup Lilium certainly hopes so. 
The startup announced this week that the design of its all-electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) jet has been approved by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Lilium’s primary airworthiness authority, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), issued its approval — known as a ‘certification basis’ — for the jet in 2020.   
Lilium, which has raised a whopping $1bn to date since its founding in 2015, has developed an eVTOL jet — which differs from the helicopter-style craft developed by most eVTOL startups —  that it hopes will take passengers faster and further than the competition. It aims to begin commercial flights from late 2025.

But the startup has little control over this timeline, regulators do. Regulators oversee every component of these machines, from the engines to software, and make the final call of whether an aircraft meets all the stringent requirements for commercial flight.  
Achieving certification basis is the first step on this complicated, and expensive, journey. Essentially it means that both the FAA and the EASA have approved Lilium’s jet design as commercially viable. However, there are still three more steps to go before the authorities issue a type certificate — the golden ticket to the skies. The certification process can cost hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Despite the hurdles ahead, Lilium CEO Klaus Roewe is confident. “Receiving the FAA G-1 demonstrates the Lilium Jet’s path to global acceptance by aerospace regulators and the expected start of global operations in late 2025 for the revolutionary Lilium Jet,” he said. 
Whether the startup can secure enough of a runway to pay for certification, while growing its team and developing its product, is anyone’s guess. But if the track record of other eVTOL ventures is anything to go by, I would take Lilium’s 2025 target with a pinch of salt.

"Apple’s Vision Pro can boost Europe’s XR kingpin — in the short-term, at least",Thomas Macaulay,2023/06/26,"
The Vision Pro arrived with great fanfare. At the launch event in California on June 5, Apple CEO Tim Cook described the new headset as a “revolutionary” device that heralds a “new era of spatial computing”. Bold claims indeed, but Apple’s track record lends them credibility. 
The tech giant has already redefined music players, tablets, laptops, desktops, smartwatches, and headphones. Analysts are now proclaiming an “iPhone moment” for extended reality (XR). 
Across the Atlantic, the launch was being watched closely by Europe’s XR kingpin: Varjo. The Helsinki-based startup claims to produce the world’s most advanced VR and XR. But it now faces competition from the biggest company on the planet.

When Apple revealed the Vision Pro’s cost, the announcement drew an audible gasp from the audience. At a whopping $3,499 (€3,238) the headset is strictly for big spenders. But the impressive specs, the mix of VR and AR, and the focus beyond gaming have triggered comparisons with an even pricier device: Varjo’s €6,495 XR-3.
Nonetheless, Varjo (pronounced “var-yo”) remains bullish. Rather than view the Vision Pro entry as a threat, the company hopes Apple’s arrival will turbocharge the sector.
“Apple’s entrance into XR with Vision Pro is an important moment for our whole industry,” said Urho Konttori, Varjo’s CTO and co-founder. 
“Mixed reality is already a fixture in the enterprise sector… We hope today is the turning point for consumers when it starts being part of their everyday lives too, with promising applications for entertainment, personal productivity, and communication.”
Such public positivity was expected from Varjo. But it’s been echoed in the thoughts of external experts.
Varjo says the XR-3 delivers “the most immersive mixed reality experience ever constructed.” Credit: Varjo
“I expect that, in the short term at least, Vision Pro will largely create opportunities for other businesses by raising the profile of XR generally,” Sam Dale, a technology analyst at market research firm IDTechE, told TNW. “This includes Varjo, which I believe targets a substantially different customer type to the Vision Pro.”
Indeed, Varjo has been laser-focused on high-demanding enterprises. The company says over a quarter of the Fortune 100 is using Varjo today, as well as various government departments. The Vision Pro, meanwhile, has been promoted as a more general computing system, suitable for use cases ranging from a workstation to an entertainment device.


“We’re shaving off huge amounts of time and costs.


Varjo has eschewed these consumer applications. All the company’s customers have sky-high requirements — sometimes literally. In aviation, the tech is used to train pilots without the need for lengthy travel and expensive simulators. In 2021, the system was certified for civil aviation training in the EU — an endorsement that rival products won’t gain overnight.
Varjo also had to overcome large entry barriers in other sectors, such as the defence and automotive industries. According to the company, 15 of the 20 largest carmakers in the world now use the tech to build and sell their vehicles. Again, the savings can be immense — but only if the XR accurately reflects reality.
“You see every contour of the car, you see every flake of paint,” Timo Toikkanen, Varjo’s CEO, told TNW. “We’re obviously shaving off huge amounts of time and costs from that process.”
Toikkanen was an executive at Finnish phone giant Nokia before joining Varjo. Credit: Varjo
The effects were certainly impressive in our demo of the tech. On a sunny day in London, England, TNW tested out the XR-3 at the offices of VC firm Atomico, which led a $31 million (€28 million) investment round in Varjo in 2018. 
After strapping on and calibrating the headset, a  photorealistic sports car appeared on the meeting room floor. Using hand gestures, we unlocked the doors to admire the vehicle’s interior. 
Seconds later, we were transported to the iconic Silverstone motor racing circuit. The same car was parked in front of our eyes, but now reflecting its virtual surroundings.
Aside from a flicker of sunlight shining onto the display, the experience was remarkably lifelike. The image resolution, field of view, depth perception, and eye and hand tracking were all superior to any other XR device we’ve tried. But then again, we’re yet to have a go on the Vision Pro.
Varjo headsets include the mixed reality XR-3 (centre), and two virtual reality devices: the VR-3 (left), and the Aero (right). Credit: Varjo
Apple’s XR device has impressed both early users and analysts. But the tech differs significantly from Varjo’s.
Dale notes that Varjo headsets connect to external gaming PCs via cables to receive computing power. The Vision Pro, however, does this internally. That makes it more portable and the power is substantial. But even Apple’s high-end silicon is unlikely to match the performance of elite PCs.


“I think it’s primarily a developer device.


Another difference is that the Vision Pro is more of a personal system. People with bad eyesight will require prescription inserts, and further individual customisations may be needed. In contrast, Varjo’s headsets can be worn over glasses and shared between multiple users.
“Varjo’s headsets will likely beat the Vision Pro in top-end image quality, but at the cost of a lot of hardware complexity, extra weight, and a price in at least the same range,” said Dale.
The companies have also trod divergent paths to their ecosystems. Varjo’s hardware relies on a broader, more open network of partners, including Steam for base stations. The systems interface with external hardware for user tracking
Apple’s headset, meanwhile, keeps everything self-contained within Apple’s own ecosystem. That will appeal to many existing Apple users and developers, but it could erect new barriers for enterprise customers. These companies often have complex needs and established systems outside Apple’s empire.
Founded in 2016, Varjo has a commercial headstart on Apple. Credit: Varjo
In time, Apple may shift focus to cheaper devices, mass consumption, and new segments. There are already reports that the company aims to release a more affordable headset by the end of 2025. Experts expect that the Vision Pro is merely a first step into extended reality.
That’s the prediction of Tom Furness, one of the sector’s leading luminaries. Known as the “grandfather” of VR and AR, Furness build the first helmet-mounted displays used by US Air Force pilots. He expects Apple to use the Vision Pro to refine the XR plans.
“I think it’s primarily a developer device,” Furness said at TNW Conference. 
Varjo will be keeping a close eye on the progress. As an established player with a strong customer base in highly-specialised industries, the company has found a niche that Apple is yet to target. 
While Apple’s unparalleled resources make it a threat to any XR incumbent, Varjo remains hopeful that the Vision Pro invigorates the entire sector — at least, for now.

Startup Genome: 2022 was tough — but a recession is a great time to invest in tech,Thomas Macaulay,2023/06/15,"
The tech sector is experiencing an unprecedented slowdown, but analysts see immense opportunities for startups that survive the downturn.
Across the world, VC funding in 2022 plummeted by 35% from the previous year, according to a new study from Startup Genome and the Global Entrepreneurship Network (GEN). The Global Startup Ecosystem Report 2023 (GSER 2023) also observed slowdowns in deal counts, exits, and unicorns. But a deeper dive unearths grounds for optimism.
After a year of heavy market losses, inflation is now slowing and economic growth appears to be holding up. The headwinds remain challenging, but the GSER 2023 notes that recessions are good times to invest in startups. 
Historical trends substantiate the theory. Startups funded during the Great Recession had higher exit multiples over total money invested than those funded during economic expansions. During downturn years, startups that achieved Series A financing were able to multiply by 20 the value of that round by the time of exit. 


“Lean economic times can produce high-performing startups.


Tangible examples of successful startups born in a recession include Spotify raising a Series A in 2008, Twitter doing the same in 2007, and Flipkart in 2009. Similar successes emerged after the 2001 dot-com crash. When the bubble burst, pessimists tolled the death knell for the tech industry. Within a few years, their prediction was proven entirely wrong.
The spree of mass layoffs is also set to unleash a fresh wave of startups. A vast pool of elite talent with tech know-how and industry expertise is now looking for new ventures. 
“Given that over half the companies on the 2009 Fortune 500 list launched during a recession or bear market, we know that lean economic times can produce high-performing startups,” said Jonathan Ortmans, Founder and President of GEN. 
“Despite recent downturns in investment, this report foreshadows where we might see the world’s most disruptive and solution-driven companies emerge in the years to come — and provides unparalleled insights that policymakers and community leaders need to build resilient startup ecosystems.”
Furthermore, the report notes that high-interest rates can actually benefit startups. They concentrate capital and talent into ventures that create value, weeding out the less competitive ventures. Indeed, while fewer startups were funded in 2022, they received larger sums. According to the GSER, the average deal size grew by 2%.
Increasingly, those investments target artificial intelligence. AI and big data was the sub-sector with the highest count of total VC deals in 2022, making up 28% of the global share. 
European prospects
The report highlights numerous positives for European startups. Despite macroeconomic woes and geopolitical tensions, 2022 was the second-biggest year overall for European VC activity after 2021, with deal count and amount surpassing pre-2021 numbers.
The continent has also captured more unicorn land. While there’s been a global slowdown in the number of startups valued at over $1 billion, Europe’s share of unicorns increased from 14% to 20% in 2022.  
Of the seven ecosystems that produced their first tech unicorn in 2022, three were in Europe: the Sofia-based Payhawk, Zagreb’s Rimac, and Rohlik Group in Prague.
Europe is also the most represented region in the GSER’s “Emerging Ecosystems,” which is comprised of startup communities at earlier stages of growth. The continent expanded its share from 37% to 41% since last year, and contains the number one ranked ecosystem: Copenhagen.

Europe’s performance was even stronger in the Strong Starters category, which features the 25 Emerging Ecosystems where early-stage funding activity is most robust. Over half of the class is European, including the top four: Istanbul, Barcelona, Estonia, and Madrid.
Among the leading ecosystems, London remains number one in Europe and joint-second globally. 
The UK capital has the most companies valued at over $1 billion. The city’s 83 exits over $50 million include Wise, at a valuation of $12.2 billion, and Deliveroo at $10.5 billion. Revolut, one of Europe’s largest Fintech unicorns, is valued at $33 billion.
In second place is Berlin. The German capital minted five new unicorns in 2022, increasing its total from 14 to 19. Exits over $50 million have increased by 40% since the GSER 2022, with AUTO1-Group attracting the highest value in a $9.2 billion IPO. 
The third spot was retained by Amsterdam, thanks to an increase in exits over $50 million, early-stage deal count, and unicorns. Banking platform Backbase is the most recent addition, valued at 2.7 billion. 


“This essential mission cannot be put on hold.


Another ecosystem that deserves special attention is Zurich. The city rose 10 places to 36th place in the world, marking the biggest year-on-year improvement in Europe. Exits over $50 million have grown a massive 300%, with Healthtech Pharvaris exiting at a valuation of $636 million. The unicorn count, meanwhile, has surged from two to six, including Blockchain company Dfinity, which is valued at $9.5 billion.
Zurich offers further evidence that startups can still thrive through a downturn. JF Gauthier, Founder & CEO of Startup Genome, expects further success stories to emerge.
“Despite current economic challenges, we are confident that, equipped with the right knowledge, entrepreneurs, policymakers, and community leaders everywhere can leverage opportunities to come together and show how innovative technologies can not only continue to drive growth and job creation, but simultaneously help save the planet and ensure a better future for everyone,” he said. “This essential mission cannot be put on hold while we wait out rocky economic times.”

Mistral AI secures €105M in Europe’s largest-ever seed round,Linnea Ahlgren,2023/06/14,"
The artificial intelligence hype shows no sign of fading just yet, and investors are practically falling over themselves to fund the next big thing in AI. Yesterday, Paris-based startup Mistral AI announced it had secured €105mn in what is reportedly Europe’s largest-ever seed round. 
Mistral AI was founded only four weeks ago, by a trio of AI researchers. Arthur Mensch, the company’s CEO, was formerly employed by Google’s DeepMind. His co-founders, Timothée Lacroix (CTO) and Guillaume Lample (Chief Science Officer), previously worked for Meta. 
The company has yet to develop its first product. However, on a mission to “make AI useful,” it plans to launch a large language model (LLM) similar to the system behind OpenAI’s ChatGPT in early 2024. 
A large part of the funds raised will be used towards renting the computer power to train it. The idea is to only use publicly available data to avoid the legal issues and copyright backlash faced by others in the industry. 
While Mistral hopes to take on OpenAI with actual open-sourced models and data sets, it is setting itself apart from the Microsoft-backed step-change initiator by targeting enterprises instead of consumers. The company says its goal is to help business clients improve processes around R&D, customer care, and marketing, as well as giving them the tools to build new products with AI.
Vision coupled with hands-on experience
The funding round is led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. The VC’s partner, Antoine Moyroud, says that Lightspeed has had the opportunity to meet with several talented researchers-turned-founders in AI, but few had a vision beyond the technical field. 
Mensch, Lacroix and Lample, on the other hand, according to Moyroud, are “part of a group of select few globally who have both the technical understanding required to build out their own vision along with the hands-on experience of training and operating large language models at scale.”
Generally, the American VC says it believes that Europe has “a decisive role” to play in the AI field. Just in September last year, the firm opened up new offices in London, Berlin, and Paris, and says it is looking to partner with more European founders of the same ambition behind Mistral. 

“Our investment in Mistral, and all our portfolio companies in Europe, are evidence of our firm conviction that a new generation of global players will emerge from this ecosystem,” Lightspeed said in a statement.  
JCDecaux Holding, Motier Ventures, La Famiglia, Headline, Exor Ventures, Sofina, First Minute Capital, and LocalGlobe also participated in the round, along with private investors including French billionaires Rodolphe Saadé and Xavier Niel, as well as former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and French investment bank BpiFrance.

8 things we’re excited about at TNW Conference day 2,Thomas Macaulay,2023/06/13,"
Ladies and gentlemen, friends and nemeses, the moment has finally arrived: TNW Conference is this week! 
After taking our show on the road to València in April, we’re returning to where it all began: Amsterdam. The two-day event kicks off on June 15  — and you’re all invited.
Expect our usual smorgasbord of talks, networking, learning, and festival vibes, but with a new unifying theme. Following a turbulent few years, this year we want to reclaim the future — and reignite the positive power that tech can have.
That spirit has been infused throughout the conference agenda. It featured prominently in our guide to day one, and it’s equally pervasive in our top picks for day two. Read on for our highlights from the jam-packed agenda.

1. Spellbinding speakers
Our stellar schedule is bursting with splendid speakers, but we have to whittle the day down to four faves. Why? Well, because that’s what we did for day one, and we love our conference days like our kids: equally (at least, that’s what we tell them).
Lila Ibrahim, Chief Operating Officer of Google DeepMind
DeepMind is one of the most exciting artificial intelligence labs in the world. From its humble roots as a UK startup conquering games, the company has risen to lead the AI revolution at Google. At 10:10 on the Vision Stage, we’ll be hearing from the woman helming the company’s growth: Lila Ibrahim, DeepMind’s first-ever COO.
We had the pleasure of interviewing Lila ahead of her keynote, which left us eager to hear more on the epochal subject of her talk: the future of AI.
Viktoriia Itskovych, Deputy CIO of Kyiv City
Ukraine’s tech sector has proven remarkably resilient since Russia’s invasion. As well as keeping the country’s economy afloat, IT has played a central role in fighting the war.
At 14:40 on the Vision Stage, we’ll get the inside story from one of the key figures on the digital frontline: Victoria Itskovich, the deputy CIO of Kyiv.
Philip Rosedale, Founder of Second Life
Virtual worlds existed long before the metaverse hype. The most popular of them all, Second Life, has provided a parallel reality for 20 years.
At 16:00 on the Discovery Stage, the platform’s founder, Phillip Rosedale, will share his insights from running the community — and what it can teach us about the future of virtual worlds.
Nagin Cox, Spacecraft Systems Engineer at NASA Jet Propulsion Lab
Nothing excites us more about the future than space travel. At 16:10 on the Vision Stage, we’ll get an inside glimpse into the direction we’re heading.
Nagin Cox, spacecraft systems engineer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, will explain our path towards the cosmos — and the role that robots will play in the mission.

2. Fun and games at our revamped festival site
Our festival site has had a major makeover this year. The Wi-Fi’s been souped-up, the co-working spaces have expanded, and the badge pick-up’s gone auto. But most importantly of all, we’re bringing games.
You can find the likes of ping-pong and Dutch shuffleboard around the venue. It’s a great way to break the ice, do business, or ruthlessly humiliate your rivals.
To find your way around the fun and games, you can use our floor map.

3. Healthy runs and indulgent breakfasts
On the sidelines of the big show are a medley of marvellous side events. Our recommendation for day two is a healthy run around the picturesque Vondel Park, followed by some unhealthy drinks with our friends at Techleap. 
If that balanced diet doesn’t appeal, there are options on the menu to suit every taste.
4. The Startup Liasion Network + Netherlands Point of Entry Breakfast Session
TNW Conference is an international festival, but we’re also highlighting the opportunities in our home country. At 09:00 in TNW HQ, we’re opening a gateway to the Dutch tech ecosystem.
Over breakfast, the Netherlands Point of Entry and the Startup Liaison Network from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are joining forces to unite entrepreneurs and explain how the Dutch government can support startups. After the grub, the hosts will whisk you straight to TNW Conference by bus.
You can reserve a spot at the event here.

5. DEI talks, mentoring, and networking
TNW Conference 2023 has partnered with the Dutch DEI Coalition to celebrate and accelerate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in tech.
The day’s agenda begins with a roundtable on the challenges and opportunities to spur DEI in the sector. Next up is a plenary talk on the role of tech and new metrics in DEI strategies. In the afternoon, there are mentoring sessions with senior representatives from Diversity Hero, Techleap, Taskforce D&I by NLdigital, and Booking.com. We’ll then bring the programme to a close with networking drinks.
You can find the full itinerary for the day here.
6. Startup pitch battles (and lessons)
It wouldn’t be a TNW Conference without a pitch battle, but this year’s contest has a more harmonious edge. In line with our conference theme, we’ll be shining a sector spotlight on tech for good at 10:10 on the Glasshouse stage. The winner will progress to the finals at 16:10 on the Growth Quarters stage.
The pitching doesn’t end there. At 14.00 at the Glasshouse, pitching coach David Beckett will provide a masterclass on the art. There’s also the second half of the impact-driven Startup Pitch Hour at the Amsterdam Pavilion at 14:00.
7. The official closing party
What would TNW Conference be without a massive closing party? From 17:00, we’ll close the event in style at the event garden. Bring your dancing shoes and head to the giant disco ball to catch our DJ on the wheels of steel.

8. The ferry shuttle
We like to think that the whole agenda is full of unmissable events, but one thing you definitely shouldn’t miss is your ride to the venue.
Our favourite mode of transport is the free ferry service.  The pick-up spot is next to Amsterdam Central at SUPPER Cruise. You can find the location on Google Maps and the full timetable here. The boat journey from there to our conference site takes around 45 minutes.
If you prefer to travel by road, you can get to the venue by public transport, car, or bike. We’re also providing a free shuttle bus service between Zaandam Central Station and the venue. Check out our travel guide for everything you need to plan your trip to the event.

Uncommon bags €28M to scale lab-grown meat using RNA technology,Linnea Ahlgren,2023/06/9,"
Global livestock contributes 14.5% of all manmade greenhouse gas emissions. Our food systems need a significant revamp, not to say a revolution, if we are to have any chance of feeding a growing population while also making sure there is still a planet that is worth populating at all. 
Some of that revamping is happening in the lab, with cell biology taking centre stage. With global meat consumption showing no sign of slowing down (in fact, quite the opposite), cellular agriculture could be one of the keys to reducing livestock-related emissions. 
UK-based cultivated meat startup Uncommon announced today it has raised $30mn (€28mn) in Series A funding. The round was led by Balderton and Lowercarbon, but also included angel investors in the form of Sam Altman (of OpenAI fame) and his brother Max. 
Patent-pending RNA technologies
Uncommon, founded in 2018 and based out of Cambridge, leverages RNA technology to cultivate bacon and pork belly from pig cells. If RNA sounds familiar to you, it is probably due to the mRNA vaccines developed to fight COVID-19. RNA stands for Ribonucelaic Acid, a molecule that contains the instructions, or recipe, that directs cells to make a protein using its natural machinery. 
“As the only cultivated meat leveraging RNA technologies, we believe we have a competitive advantage that could help us become the largest protein company in the world,” said Benjamina Bollag, founder and CEO of Uncommon. 
The cultured meat startup has now raised a total of approximately €35mn, including a £1mn (€1.16mn) Innovate UK grant. The latest round will go toward bringing down the cost of goods further, the regulatory application procedure, and the scaling of production at a pilot manufacturing facility at Cambridge Technopark. Furthermore, the company says it will double its team over the next 18 months. 
Will cultivated meat succeed where plant-based alternatives appear to have failed?
Investors who backed the initial rush towards plant-based meat alternatives have not had a great time of it over the past couple of years. But if the failure to capitalise on the early enthusiasm for vegan meat substitutes has proved anything it is this: people will not stop eating meat, even if the future of the planet depends on it. 
Even though the taste and texture of plant-based alternatives have come a long way, they cannot fully replicate actual meat. Lab-grown meat doesn’t have that problem since it is, well, actual meat. 
Cells are taken from an otherwise unharmed animal and then cultivated in a lab setting. Uncommon transforms the individual cells into induced pluripotent stem cells in a process called “reprogramming,” a technology that won the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 2012. 
Costs associated with the technology have thus far been prohibitive of commercialisation (and that is saying nothing of regulatory hurdles still to be overcome). However, companies in the sector claim that scaling production will reduce costs to where, in a few years time, the products will reach price parity with conventional meat. Indeed, Uncommon says it aims to own 5% of the global pork market by 2035. 
UK cell agriculture investment is booming
Analysts differ in their estimates, but the cellular agriculture market could be worth hundreds of billions by 2040; an attractive proposition for investors willing to play the long game and potentially do something good for the planet. Globally, the cultured meat industry raised $869mn (€806mn) in venture capital funding in 2022, down from $1.3bn (€1.2bn) in 2021. However, in the UK, investments rose by 400%. 
While most people have come to know him as the CEO that brought ChatGPT to the world, Sam Altman is an avid startup investor. He has backed over 100 companies over the years, including several biotech startups, for instance, Elon Musk’s Neuralink. 
Securing food supply
Cultivated meat may be one of our best bets when it comes to curtailing the slaughter of 200 million animals per day and cutting down the vast emissions and overuse of antibiotics associated with land use and factory farming. What’s more, it may help assist with food security. 
It is perhaps no coincidence that the first country to approve cultivated meat for human consumption – Singapore in December 2020 – imports 90% of its food. The US also approved the first cultivated meat product (chicken) in November 2022. 
However, the EU could be in for a bit of a tussle, as Italy’s government recently backed a bill that would ban lab-grown and other synthetic meats in the name of cultural food heritage. Although, given it is the country’s 68th government in 76 years, things may still change in time for when the technology becomes commercially mature.

UK startup launches ‘world’s most intelligent’ e-scooter,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/06/8,"
British startup Hilo — co-founded by Andy Palmer, often referred to as the ‘godfather’ of EVs — has launched a new e-scooter crammed with high-tech safety features, in a bid to tackle the sector’s poor safety rep. 
The e-scooter, dubbed Hilo One, is equipped with the same kind of collision warning tech found in cars. Using computer vision AI, the e-scooter alerts the riders of impending dangers through visual, audible, and sensory feedback in the handlebars. 
“E-scooters have faced challenges with safety and public perception,” said Palmer, who helped supercharge EV adoption in the UK during his time as COO at Nissan, and later, as CEO at Aston Martin. “The Hilo One is an e-scooter that addresses these concerns head-on.”

The Hilo One comes fitted with a large 31cm front wheel, to help clear potholes and remove the twitchy handling that plagues some e-scooters models. It also projects lights from its undercarriage to increase visibility at night. These lights flash when other commuters get dangerously close. The onboard computer also connects with Unit 1 helmets and can recognise helmet use. 
Beyond its safety credentials, the Hilo One has a built-in control unit that integrates with an electric car, sharing navigation information and charge sites bidirectionally — especially useful for EV drivers looking for a last-mile add-on to their car.

Charging can be done at home, or through a dedicated in-car charger. Android Auto compatibility allows navigation and range information to be shared between the car and the Hilo One. 
Lotus Engineering, a division of racing car manufacturer Lotus, has contributed to the overall design of the Hilo One, including the patent-pending folding system. This sees dirty wheels enclosed within the body of the e-scooter, and allows the Hilo One to be carried or wheeled using the telescopic handle.

The Hilo One has a speed limit of 25kph, in line with regulations, and its twin 350w electric motors deliver a range of 40km. 
The design hasn’t compromised on looks either — I saw it with my own eyes at the Microbility Europe conference in Amsterdam today, and must say it is a sleek, futuristic-looking piece of kit.  
Predictably all of these gadgets and good looks carry a hefty price-tag — the Hilo One starts from €2000. The startup is already taking pre-orders with delivery scheduled for 2024.

An industry insider shares what’s in store for the future of dating apps,Alex Pasykov,2023/06/8,"

2023 has been a rough year for startups. Getting funding has become increasingly difficult, and this is no different for the dating app industry. Investors want dating businesses to operate effectively without raising investment. Dating companies that combine technological solutions with a strong brand have an advantage in further expanding their user base through organic growth, performance marketing, and paid acquisition. Thus, it’s now more important than ever to align product strategy with trends to build a sustainable dating business.
AI and the future of dating apps
Generative AI might be the breakthrough technology of 2023, but for dating apps, its possibilities are limited. We will likely see some features that help users to start a conversation faster or better than just: “Hey, how are you,” using AI-generated prompts and prescribed icebreakers. But because users will still want to chat with other real people, dating apps can’t just let large language models impersonate users on the platform. Nobody wants to date a chatbot in the real world.
However, AI can be integrated to improve algorithms and make dating apps run smoother. For example, it helps suggest people to connect with, based on a user’s preferences and usage history. And although chatbots cannot replace users on the platform, they can offer quick and efficient customer support. So dating apps can use large language models to answer user questions or help with other queries.
Greater Segmentation and Personalization
In the near future, dating apps are heading towards greater personalization for segmented audiences. Since Tinder’s breakthrough in 2012, it has catered to all audiences. But now, apps are gradually evolving and begin to cover more specific dating preferences for specific audiences. So, instead of one big app covering all needs, we have different apps created for different audiences and dating interests — like polygamous relationships or dating for Christians.
While segmentation is a growing trend, extremely niche apps like pro-vaxxer/anti-vaxxer apps, might not have the most sustainable business model. By drastically narrowing your audience and relying on a tiny user base, you introduce risks that could make it hard to raise funding or provide desirable metrics to investors, regardless of how cool your idea is.
While some dating apps focus on specific audiences, others focus on specific needs. For example, there are apps where you can indicate your preference for a one-night stand as opposed to a long-term relationship. There is a catch, though: when apps focus on specific audiences, like people looking for hookups, users are likely to switch to other dating apps that serve more needs than such nuanced experiences.
The future of dating apps
While it has become increasingly hard to raise funding, the online dating landscape has become more complicated as well. The biggest issue is still that most dating apps run on business models that need users to keep using the apps as long as possible, as opposed to quickly satisfying their needs. That said, dating apps that can successfully shorten the time between a first like and an actual meeting will likely succeed in the long-term.
In this regard, niche apps catering to specific audiences or needs, are leading the way. These apps set the standard for service quality for their targeted users and will elevate the level of service. If larger apps can learn from their experiences by integrating and effectively serving those segments within their own apps, it will accelerate business growth and acceptance of these apps in society.
The purpose of dating apps is not to make every user fall in love with each other, but to give them the freedom to pursue what they want — romantically or sexually — at any given moment. Today, someone might be looking for a date, tomorrow a casual hookup, and the day after that, a long-term relationship. By understanding the complexities of online dating and staying in tune with users’ evolving preferences, dating apps can increase their chances of success in key business metrics that matter to investors.

DeepMind made its AI name in games. Now it’s playing with the foundations of computing,Thomas Macaulay,2023/06/7,"
DeepMind has applied its mastery of games to a more serious business: the foundations of computer science.
The Google subsidiary today unveiled AlphaDev, an AI system that discovers new fundamental algorithms. According to DeepMind, the algorithms it’s unearthed surpass those honed by human experts over decades. 
The London-based lab has grand ambitions for the project. As demand for computation grows and silicon chips approach their limits, fundamental algorithms will have to become exponentially more efficient. By enhancing these processes, DeepMind aims to transform the infrastructure of the digital world. 
The first target in this mission is sorting algorithms, which are used to order data. Under the covers of our devices, they determine everything from search rankings to movie recommendations.
To enhance their performance, AlphaDev explored assembly instructions, which are used to create binary code for computers. After an exhaustive search, the system uncovered a sorting algorithm that outperformed the previous benchmarks.
To find the winning combination, DeepMind had to revisit the feats that made it famous: winning board games.
Gaming the system 
DeepMind made its name in games. In 2016, the company grabbed headlines when its AI program defeated a world champion of Go, a wickedly complicated Chinese board game. 
Following the victory, DeepMind built a more general-purpose system, AlphaZero. Using a process of trial and error called reinforcement learning, the program mastered not only Go, but also chess and shogi (aka “Japanese chess”).
AlphaDev — the new algorithm builder — is based on AlphaZero. But the influence of gaming extends beyond the underlying model.


“We penalise it for making mistakes.


DeepMind formulated AlphaDev’s task as a single-player game. To win the game, the system had to build a new and improved sorting algorithm. 
The system played its moves by selecting assembly instructions to add to the algorithm. To find the optimal instructions, the system had to probe a vast quantity of instruction combinations. According to DeepMind, the number was similar to the number of particles in the universe. And just one bad choice could invalidate the entire algorithm.
After each move, AlphaDev compared the algorithm’s output with the expected results. If the output was correct and the performance was efficient, the system got a “reward” — a signal that it was playing well.
“We penalise it for making mistakes, and we reward it for finding more and more of these sequences that are sorted correctly,” Daniel Mankowitz, the lead researcher, told TNW.
As you’ve probably guessed, AlphaDev won the game. But the system didn’t only find a correct and faster program. It also discovered novel approaches to the task.
The sorting algorithm led to improvements that were up to 70% faster than benchmarks for shorter sequences and about 1.7% faster for sequences exceeding 250,000 elements. Credit: Google DeepMind
The new algorithms contained instruction sequences that saved a single instruction each time they were applied. Dubbed “swap and copy moves,” they served as shortcuts to further algorithmic efficiencies.
DeepMind compares the approach to another moment in games: the fabled “move 37,” which an AI system played against Go champion Lee Sedol. 
The strange move shocked human experts, who thought the machine had made a mistake. But they soon discovered that the program had a plan.
“It ended up not just winning the game, but also influencing the strategies that professional Go players started using,” said Mankowitz.
The win marked the first time AI has beaten a top-ranked Go professional — a milestone that experts had predicted was another decade away. 
Three years later, Lee retired from professional Go competition. He attributed the decision to the abilities of his AI rivals.
“Even if I become the number one, there is an entity that cannot be defeated,” he said.
Sorting out computing 
AlphaDev’s sorting algorithms have now been open-sourced in the main C++ library, where it’s available to millions of developers and companies. According to DeepMind, it’s the first change to this part of the sorting library in over a decade — and the first algorithm designed through reinforcement learning to join the library.
After the sorting game, AlphaDev began to play with hashing, which is used to retrieve, store, and compress data. The result was another enhanced algorithm, which has now been released in the open-source Abseil library. DeepMind estimates that it’s being used trillions of times a day.
Ultimately, the lab envisions AlphaDev as a step towards transforming the entire computing ecosystem. And it all began with playing board games.

This AI-powered platform could predict the next big flood,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/06/7,"
The European floods of 2021, which affected large areas of Germany and Belgium, took the lives of 209 people and cost over €30bn in damages. Catastrophic floods like these are becoming more and more common as climate change increases the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. 
While there is no easy fix for preventing floods, there are ways we can prepare for them. One company tackling this challenge head-on is Norwegian climate tech startup 7Analytics. Founded in 2020 by a team of data scientists and geologists, the startup aims to help municipalities and businesses better predict flooding and minimise damage to infrastructure. 
The startup’s main offering, FloodCube, applies AI and machine learning to vast quantities of terrain and land use data in order to predict how a future flood will unfold. Whereas the weather forecast tells you when a storm is approaching, 7Analytics will tell you exactly how the water from this storm will travel through your community, to a metre-scale accuracy.  
Recent advancements in computing power and AI couldn’t have come at a better time for the startup. “These technologies enable us to analyse data and generate predictive insights in a way that was impossible just a few years’ ago,” says Jonas Aas Torland, co-founder and CCO of 7analytics.

While there are a handful of other companies operating in this space in the US and Australia, Jonas says that none of them offer such high resolution data nor do they constantly reprocess data to account for physical changes in the landscape.  
For governments or businesses looking to minimise damage to infrastructure, the value of these predictive insights cannot be understated. “Knowing how a flood will occur in the future gives you the gift of time,” Jonas told TNW. 
“Our platform can tell you if a flood will occur in your area of interest and issue alerts 72 hours in advance so you can take all the necessary actions to protect employees and assets,” he says. 
These insights are also of interest to insurers, who are always looking for more accurate ways to predict future risks to assets.  
So far, 7Analytics has secured contracts with the likes of the Municipality of Bergen, construction giant Skanska, and, most recently, French oil conglomerate Total Energies. 
The startup secured €2.5m in its first funding round last year, and looks to grow its customer base both in Europe and the US.

Adapting to the new climate reality
Investors are pouring trillions into climate mitigation technologies like renewable energies and EVs in an attempt to reduce carbon emissions. While essential, there is increasing acknowledgement that investing in technologies that help humanity adapt to a changing climate is an equally urgent priority.  
In 2021, however, less than $50 billion — or just 10% of all climate finance — was allocated to adaptation measures such as flood and wildfire prevention, resilient agriculture, and clean water supply.  
This is partly because climate adaptation tech investment has often been regarded as the realm of NGOs and government, not private capital, partly due a false perception that there is no money to be made. But this outlook appears to be shifting.  
Bill Gates’s Breakthrough Energy Ventures pledged last year to expand its scope to climate adaptation technologies, while water tech firm Gradiant — which helps companies reduce water usage — hit ‘unicorn’ status last month after a $225m raise. 
Michiel de Bruin, portfolio manager for Dutch investment firm Robeco, says that recent climate disasters are a “wake-up call,” directing “more attention to adaptation.” 
Jonas believes that solutions like his flood prevention platform are part of this new wave of climate adaptation tech. The startup is now plotting its Series A funding round for next year, and looks to expand its offerings to predict landslides and other natural hazards.

The case for letting workers live in the WFH la-la land,Kirstie McDermott,2023/06/7,"
Work can be pretty stressful these days: globally tech workers have had to deal with the effects of the pandemic, adjust to remote work—and handle all those more recent return-to-office mandates—in addition to dealing with fears of redundancy in an environment that has seen hundreds of thousands of sector layoffs since mid-2022.
It’s not surprising that workers are feeling the strain. Forty-four percent of European workers reported that their work stress had increased as a result of the pandemic, according to an EU-OSHA workers’ survey.
Burnout is rife, with a 2021 study finding that 66% of Polish workers and 59% of workers in Czechia experienced, or were close to burnout. Workplace trends such as quiet quitting, rust-out, and compassion fatigue are all symptoms of the same thing: employees are overworked, under-recognised, and fed up.
Your resilience depends on your age and expertise level too. Cigna 360’s Global Well-Being Survey found that 98% of young adults aged 18 to 24 (aka Gen-Z) are experiencing worker burnout globally.
What doesn’t help workers’ stress or exhaustion levels are the sweeping decrees from tech billionaires, such as Elon Musk. You could argue that by their very nature, billionaires are removed from the concerns of the average worker anyway, but Musk takes things further.
As the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and the former CEO of Twitter, he is hardline when it comes to how and where his employees should do their jobs. He recently told CNBC that “It’s not just a productivity thing, I think it’s morally wrong,” in reference to how service workers have no choice but to show up, while Silicon Valley engineers are the work-from-home “laptop classes living in la-la land.”
Musk also said he’s a big believer that people are more productive in person, saying that “People should get off their goddamn moral high horse with the work-from-home bullshit.”
Some are on Elon Musk’s side, with a Forbes survey revealing that 45% of 65 surveyed billionaires don’t believe in work-from-home culture either. But for many workers, his comments feel out of touch, and his declaration that he works seven days a week, and only takes “two or three” days off a year is even more alienating.
The future of work is shifting fast
European and global workers have experienced a sea change in the way they work over the past few years.
Workers want a remote or hybrid model as it eliminates commute time (and cost), can be a much more effective way to do deep work, and it also fosters a culture of flexibility, where a set schedule doesn’t matter as long as the work gets done—which is particularly attractive for working parents.
The rise of four-day working weeks is another aspect of change. Successfully trialled in the UK by non-profit 4 Day Week Global, the initial results found that 91% of participating companies will definitely continue or plan to continue with the format.
As return to the office mandates begin to make an impact, nearly a third of Eurozone workers want to work from home more frequently than their employer allows them to, according to a recent European Central Bank study.
The study found that workers who commute more than one hour each way want 10 work-from-home days each month. Those with a commute time of less than 15 minutes want six days at home a month.
Employees will vote with their feet if necessary. “Workers are more willing to change jobs if they have remote work preferences that exceed those they perceive their employers to have,” the study’s authors say.
Offering flexibility in the form of working styles is now considered to be an employee benefit, and it’s one that positively contributes to employee happiness, which increases as much as 20% by having the ability to work 100% remotely.
Work-life balance goes beyond what benefits employees. It’s good for business too, with companies offering fully remote jobs now able to utilise a much larger, global talent pool to boost their success. In addition, a survey conducted by Airtasker found that remote employees get more done, working 1.4 more days every month, or 16.8 more days every year, than those in the office.
For workers though (beyond mere happiness), the biggest benefits of achieving an optimum work setup, whether that is remote, hybrid, or fully flexible, is that it can help reduce chronic stress, prevent burnout, and as a result help to mitigate physical and mental symptoms such as anxiety, hypertension, digestive troubles, and heart problems. A true win-win.

Inside CUR8’s mission to scale carbon removals and help save the planet,Linnea Ahlgren,2023/06/7,"
Most of us have heard of carbon offsets by now. However, the average person perhaps doesn’t give them much thought beyond when prompted by an airline to “offset the CO2 of your journey” (for a suspiciously small amount). But how familiar are you with carbon removals? 
Offsetting and carbon credits (sort of like permission slips for emissions) are not only big business, but part of a new climate-accounting reality to which companies will have to adapt sooner or later as they embark on net-zero roadmaps. 
Offsetting as a practice has gotten a pretty bad rep, and not at all unjustified. As John Oliver quipped “if the idea that you can simply invest a little money and make your carbon footprint disappear sounds too good to be true, that’s because it absolutely is.” 
Indeed, at times, carbon offsetting projects have been proven to do more harm than good. Whether from well-intentioned incompetence or unscrupulous greed, issues have ranged from biodiversity loss to land grabbing. 
However, a different approach to reducing – and removing – CO2 emissions is evolving. A growing body of carbon removal technologies and projects might just actually contribute to cleaning up the mess we have made for ourselves in more efficient and, importantly, equitable ways. 
Brokering hope 
Carbon removals are also referred to as carbon dioxide removal (CDR), carbon drawdown, or negative emissions. Where carbon offsets simply aim to compensate for emissions by investing in emission reduction projects elsewhere, carbon removals target the capturing of CO2 from the atmosphere and locking it away for decades or even centuries.
And cleaning up the atmosphere is exactly what the London-based startup CUR8 wants to help facilitate. The company, which is building what it calls a market-maker platform for carbon removals, was founded in 2022 and recently raised £5.3 million (€6.15 million) in a pre-seed round led by GV (Google Ventures) and including funding from CapitalT. 
CUR8 co-founder and serial fintech entrepreneur Marta Krupinska says that when she first heard of carbon removals in December 2020, it blew her mind, and gave her what is “not a common feeling” for anyone working in climate – hope.  
“I’ve definitely felt that there’s been all of the scientific proof that we’ve left it too late. So to suddenly think that there are ways in which we can build these time machines that will undo the damage that we’ve done, that was just absolutely mind-blowing,” Krupinska told TNW. 
“It’s going to be a trillion dollar industry, and we have to build it faster than any industry we’ve ever built before. So obviously, that for an entrepreneur is very enticing,” she continued. The problem was, at the time, she didn’t know much about climate science. 
Krupinska, who has led Google for Startups in the UK and co-founded international money transfer platform Azimo, was introduced in 2021 by a friend to Dr Gabrielle Walker, the former climate editor at the prestigious journal Nature and features editor at New Scientist. 
Dr Walker, who has taught at Cambridge and Princeton Universities and founded non-profit Rethinking Removals, decided to focus her attention on removals after asking people from the IPCC if reaching the Paris Agreement would be possible without them. Basically, the response she received was, “Are you having a laugh?” 
Committed warming
Why they are so adamant is down to what is called committed warming. This means that even if we were to stop emitting greenhouse gases tomorrow, the warming effects of what we have already released would not simply stop; they have already been baked into the system (hence the need for removals). 

Indeed, the IPCC predicts we will have to remove 10 billion tonnes of CO2 by 2050 to have any chance of keeping global warming below 2°C by 2100. 
At first, Dr Walker was sceptical about CDR because, as she says, “It is hard to get CO2 back out of the air.” But having visited a small-scale pilot direct air carbon capture facility in British Columbia and coming away bolstered by the promise of the technology, she said to herself, “Ok, that could work, we need to make it happen.” 
However, in turn, she knew nothing of running a company. As such, Krupinska and Dr Walker bring “immensely complimentary skills” to the startup they have founded together with their third partner, Mark Stevenson. 
Stevenson has been an advisor to the UK Ministry of Defense on Peace, Security and Climate Change and to Médecins Sans Frontières, and is an ambassador to Client Earth and chairs the Impact Board for Climate.vc. The three have banded together along with their team to achieve CUR8’s ambition of facilitating 10% of all global carbon removals over the next 25+ years. 
Direct air capture
There are several pathways to carbon removal, both technology and nature-based. On the technology side, there is direct air capture, or DAC. Essentially, this sucks carbon out of the air using chemical reactions. Then, it pumps the CO2  deep underground for storage. Alternatively, it can go into other hydrocarbon products, such as (more) sustainable fuels but, of course, this means it goes straight back into the atmosphere again. 
According to the IEA, DAC is “a key part of the carbon removal portfolio.” However, it is categorised as “technology readiness level” 6 (on a scale of 1 to 9). This means that it is in the large-scale and prototype phase, but not ready for commercial deployment. As such, costs have previously been prohibitively high for anyone but the likes of Microsoft. But CUR8’s approach of including it in a portfolio will help achieve economies of scale and make it accessible to a broader range of companies. 
Spectrum of drawdown speed
Other pathways include something referred to as enhanced rock weathering (ERW). Some rocks with high silica content, such as basalt, sequester CO₂ from the air as a part of a chemical reaction, triggered by rainwater. This process can be sped up by spreading large quantities of selected and finely ground rock material onto land areas, beaches or the sea surface.
Further types of negative emission approaches include aforrestation (with respect for biodiversity), soil-based sequestration, and turning crop and forestry residue into biochar – storing carbon for millennia, instead of releasing it into the atmosphere. Making buildings out of timber also ensures the carbon stays locked in the wood, as well as replaces more polluting materials such as concrete. 
The oceans also provide a multitude of carbon removal opportunities, including photosynthesis-enhanced seaweed farming and oyster reef restoration and alkalinity enhancement. All of these methods come with their own set of benefits and challenges. 
“If you’re buying removals, you should always invest in all of the methods around because not a single method will scale to 10 billion tonnes by 2050,” Krupinska says.
“Our portfolio will always contain methods from across the spectrum,” she continues. “We try to achieve the maximum durability with maximum biodiversity and social benefits pulled together in one portfolio that’s significantly cheaper than the top end of price points of removals.”
CUR8 has, among other clients, provided carbon removals for The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee Pageant and The State Funeral of HM Queen Elizabeth II and large-scale events including British Summer Time and All Points East. The portfolio comprised technologies including direct air capture (1pointfive), enhanced rock weathering (UNDO) and durable soil carbon (Loam Bio). 
The cost of carbon 
Carbon credits range in price depending on the type, location, and availability of the projects that generate them. They can cost anything from between $0.30 to $300. (Remember the dubiously low cost of your air travel emissions offset?) 
Carbon offset credits represent one tonne of carbon dioxide prevented or reduced. Carbon removal credits (CRCs) on the other hand represent one tonne carbon dioxide equivalent that is removed from the atmosphere. 
CUR8 has set the cost of its CRCs at £150. This is pegged to $185 – what has been calculated as the “social cost of carbon,” or the economic cost to society from emitting one metric tonne of CO2  into the atmosphere. 
Speaking of social cost and impact, 40% of CUR8’s portfolio will be located in the Global South. “If we can help set up more of the carbon removal supply in the Global South, we can genuinely turn climate change victims into beneficiaries of this new economy,” Krupinska says. 
“There are credits that we need to get money towards, which are transforming infrastructure, from fossil infrastructure to clean, in the Global South, particularly, because that’s where the money isn’t available,” Dr Walker adds. “That’s a part of the climate system that otherwise might be harder to solve.”
Fostering trust in the process
The company says it performs all supplier due diligence in-house, tracking 100+ data points across impact, integrity, and scalability. And scaling the industry needs, and rapidly. 
The benefits of a portfolio approach, CUR8 says, is that by working with a range of suppliers it also helps to grow the entire sector, ensuring there is enough supply in 1, 5, 10, and 25 years time. Furthermore, it balances benefits and challenges with drawdown speed, as well as reduces risks. 
“We’re a market maker, so we’re going beyond the broker model. The broker model is the way that we’re starting. But we’re also talking constantly, both with suppliers and in the demand market to understand what’s actually needed to accelerate this,” Dr Walker says.  
“And the aim is not just to see a market that’s developing and grab a piece of the pie, or even make it a bit easier for some people who would otherwise have to do something that is a bit harder. This market needs to go from a few hundred thousand tonnes of high durability removals now to somewhere between 10 and 15 billion a year by 2050.” 
Not to be overly dramatic, but the fate of the world may actually depend on it.

BMW’s new electric 5 Series lets you play games while charging the car,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/05/26,"
BMW has partnered with Swiss gaming platform AirConsole to bring in-car gaming to its new all-electric 5 Series.  
Drivers and passengers can play the games to kill time while the vehicle is charging, for example. Sadly, but probably for the best, you can’t play while the car is moving. 
In addition to the new BMW 5 Series, which debuted this week, the AirConsole app will be rolled out in other BMW vehicles. The service has been available on TVs for some time, but this is the first time it has been available in a car.  
To use the gaming app, players need their smartphone, which acts as a controller, and the BMW Curved Display, which acts as a TV. After booting up the AirConsole app in the car, users simply scan a QR code to link their phones to the screen and then get gaming.  
Around 15 titles are initially available including Go Kart Go, Golazo, Music Guess, and Overcooked, with the list expected to be continually expanded. While not exactly catering to the hardcore gamer, the console should provide enough entertainment for families or anyone partial to smartphone games.   
To celebrate the launch of in-car gaming, BMW is presenting the electric i5 version of the 5 Series with a gaming wrap, featuring large pixels as a homage to the iconic 8-bit era of computer games.

Dutch startup targets European intercity air taxi service from 2027,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/05/26,"
Dutch aviation startup ELECTRON Aviation has inked an agreement with Twente Airport, in the next step of its plans to launch a zero-emissions short-haul flight service from 2027. 
The startup’s planned fleet of electric air taxis will transport up to four passengers at a time to various European cities within a 500km radius of the airport. 
“To be clear, that gets you to Berlin, London, or Paris, all in under 2 hours,” said Josef Mouris, CEO and co-founder of ELECTRON. 
The startup’s Electron5 plane, which is still in the prototype phase, will fly at around 300km/h with a max range of 750km on a single charge. By aiming for smaller aircraft, the company hopes to build out its fleet at pace. 
“To fly meaningful distances within this decade, we had to compromise on the aircraft size, limiting ourselves to five seats. Which, if you think about it, is the perfect size for our on-demand business model,” said Mouris.

The startup plans to provide a quick, easy service akin to the Uber of planes — offering a faster and greener way to travel between major European centres. The plane needs 800m of airstrip to take off, which means it can launch from most regular airports, the startup said.
Previously, Josef was quoted saying that a 400km trip in one of his air taxis would set you back around €225. However, in a press release yesterday, the CEO said the “low operating costs” of the aircraft (in comparison with other low-emissions alternatives like hydrogen) would eventually enable the startup to “match or beat” the price of an economy-class plane ticket. 
The startup is part of Electric Flying Connection (EFC), a Dutch consortium of companies that recently submitted a funding application to the Dutch Growth Fund to scale battery-electric flying in the country. 
Jan Schuring, CEO of Twente Airport, which joined the consortium this year, said that demand for improved connectivity in the region was high, both within the Netherlands and for cross-border travel to Germany, France, and the UK.  
By bringing in ELECTRON aviation as the second operator, Twente Airport looks to position itself as the airport of choice for electric air taxi startups looking to launch their services in the country. 
ELECTRON also signed a similar agreement with Groningen airport in 2021 and plans to roll out a fleet of battery-electric, zero-emissions aircraft at both airports in 2027.

‘Digital bridge’ between brain and spine enables paralysed man to walk again,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/05/26,"
Over a decade ago, a cycling accident left Gert-Jan Oskam paralysed after causing him a spinal cord injury. Now, he’s able to stand and walk again thanks to an innovative brain-spine interface (BSI) developed by a team of Swiss neuroscientists.
To walk, the brain must send a command to the region of the spinal cord that’s responsible for movement control. But a spinal cord injury interrupts this communication.
“Our idea was to reestablish this communication with a “digital bridge”, an electric communication between the brain and the region of the spinal cord that is still intact,” said Professor Grégoire Courtine, one of the project’s lead neuroscientists.
To do that, the team created a wireless interface between the brain and the spine using brain-computer interface (BCI) technology that transforms thought into action. As a result, Oksam can now stand, walk, and climb stairs naturally just by thinking about it.

To establish this digital bridge, two electronic implants in the brain detect neural activity when Oskam wants to move his legs. These signals are then transmitted to a processing unit, which he wears as a backpack. A specially-developed algorithm decodes them and sends them as instructions to another electronic implant, inserted in the spinal cord regions that controls leg movement. This implant works as a neurostimulator which, in turn, activates muscles to move.
Oskam had to undertake two surgeries and around 40 rehabilitation sessions to regain voluntary movement of his legs. “The most surprising thing, I think, happened after two days,” he said during an interview. “Within five to 10 minutes, I could control my hips.”

What is particularly noteworthy is that Oskam can also walk short distances without the device if he uses crutches. The researchers believe that the device has not only improved his sensory and motor perceptions, but also helped develop new nerve connections.
Oksam is the only individual to have tested the technology, but the research team is currently recruiting three people to examine whether a similar device could restore arm movement. The neuroscientists believe that the BSI could also deliver promising results for stroke-caused paralysis.
The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) along with project affiliated companies ONWARD medical and CEA have received funding from the European Innovation Council (EIC) to develop a commercial version of the digital bridge and make the technology available worldwide.

London crowned tech king of the world,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/05/25,"
London has been named the world’s most high-tech city, according to Z/Yen Group’s seventh edition of the Smart Centres Index, published today.  
The British capital secured the top spot for its world-leading financial services, deep talent pool, quality of its business environment, and international reputation.
Climbing from second place, London was joined in the top five by New York, San Francisco, Zurich, and Lugano. Oxford came in seventh place, putting four European cities in the top 10. 
The news that London has taken the top tech title from New York will undoubtedly be welcomed by British PM Rishi Sunak, who has on multiple occasions expressed his desire to make the UK as a whole a tech and innovation superpower. 
In a rather humourous speech recently Sunak even labelled the country “Unicorn Kingdom,” in a not-so-subtle nod to the fact that the UK has so far birthed 162 startups valued at $1 billion or more.     
While the PM definitely shouldn’t forge a career in comedy, he does have a point. During 2022, UK tech firms raised £24bn in funding, more than France (£11.8bn) and Germany (£9.1 bn) combined, making it the world’s third-largest tech sector.  
Leading this investment is London, which is currently home to a number of up-and-coming tech firms including Deliveroo, Revolut, and Wise, as well as emerging startups like AI research lab DeepMind and metaverse developer Improbable.

Improbable launches new metaverse think tank amid strategic pivot,Thomas Macaulay,2023/05/24,"
British unicorn Improbable has sharpened its metaverse focus with the launch of a new think tank.
Dubbed the Metaverse Society, the think tank will explore the social and economic impacts of the nascent tech. Improbable told TNW that it wants to develop use cases, clarify misconceptions, and reduce risks associated with the metaverse.
“We want to contribute to ensuring the metaverse holds its promise of being a network of meaning that unlocks creativity, social interaction, and economic opportunities, free from gatekeepers,” said Herman Narula, Improbable’s founder and CEO.
“The convergence of AI, metaverse, and blockchain technologies offers a unique moment to shape a space where communities, content developers and brands can re-imagine engagement, loyalty, and culture. We need to bring together key players and address the misconceptions around the metaverse.”
Improbable plans to present a detailed program of Metaverse Society activities at the end of June. 
To kick things off, the company is bringing its own research portfolio to the think tank. This includes studies of potential metaverse sectors, a report on European regulation — and a new research memo that offers clues on Improbable’s evolving strategy. 


“Without blockchain-based solutions, the metaverse is not possible.


The new memo emphasises the value of blockchain in making the metaverse decentralized, interoperable, and monetisable.
“The metaverse will rely heavily on blockchain technology, particularly in terms of economic activity… Without blockchain-based solutions, the metaverse is not possible,” write the authors.
On the blockchain
The think tank and memo were unveiled amid a big strategic pivot for Improbable. The company has developed virtual worlds for over a decade, but recently shifted to focus exclusively on the commercial metaverse.
As part of the shift, the Softbank-backed firm has abandoned plans to build its own video games. In December, the company also shuttered its US defence arm, which provided war-gaming simulations for military forces.
The subsidiary’s former president, Caitlin Dohrman, said Improbable had decided to “refocus on its commercial metaverse business” amid a need “to accelerate its path to profitability.”
Instead of in-house games and defence, Improbable is now concentrating on metaverse infrastructure. A key component of this effort involves blockchain tech.
In September, the Financial Times reported that Improbable was closing in on a new €100m funding round, which would value the company at more than €3bn. The round was led by Elrond, a blockchain company.
Improbable is also developing M2, a blockchain-enabled network of interoperable metaverses, and is collaborating with the company behind the Bored Ape NFTs on a virtual world project.
The pivot to a blockchain-powered metaverse aims to end Improbable’s operating losses. Narula says he expects the company to be profitable in 2023.

Dutch minister wants escooters on roads by 2025 — to Amsterdam’s dismay,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/05/24,"
Although escooters are a common sight in many European cities, you won’t see them in the Netherlands. That’s because escooter use is restricted to private driveways or gardens, but riding one on public roads and bike lanes is illegal, and will land you with a €280 fine. However, this might change soon.
The Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management is currently working on a bill that will make escooters road-legal, local newspaper Het Parool reports.
If the bill is approved by the House of Representatives, escooters that meet the criteria of the Netherlands Vehicle Authority (RDW) will be allowed on bike lanes starting in 2025. This also means that ride-sharing providers such as Lime, Tier, and Dott will be able to offer their vehicles in the country.
The news has evoked strong reactions from the city of Amsterdam, which is reluctant to include the popular two-wheelers in its already overcrowded cycle paths.
Melanie van der Horst, a spokesperson for the city’s transport chief, told the paper that the Municipality of Amsterdam along with several others in the country have sent a letter to the ministry, raising concerns over traffic safety issues.
Even if the bill passes, Van der Horst said that Amsterdam will still be able to keep shared escooters out. It’s within the municipality’s power to grant or not the exemption required for transport providers to offer transport services in public space.
Besides Amsterdam, Utrecht and the Hague are also firmly against escooters swooshing down their streets, according to BNR radio.
The Dutch cities aren’t alone in favoring the two-wheeler ban. Paris is also putting a stop to shared escooters from September onwards, following a city-wide referendum.

Scientists develop ‘artificial leaf’ that could power the cars of the future,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/05/24,"
Researchers from the University of Cambridge have developed an ‘artificial leaf’ that uses sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into ethanol and propanol. 
These so-called ‘drop-in’ fuels can directly power an internal combustion engine without any modifications, potentially offering a low-emissions alternative to gasoline. 
Unlike fossil fuels, these solar fuels produce net-zero carbon emissions, said the researchers, and are entirely renewable. What’s more, unlike most bioethanol, they do not divert any agricultural land away from food production.   
Researchers made the artificial leaf from multiple layers including copper, glass, silver, and graphite. The leaf contains light absorbers – similar to the molecules in plants that harvest sunlight – which are combined with a catalyst.
This catalyst, which is similar to chlorophyll, the catalyst for photosynthesis in a real leaf, is made from two elements — copper and palladium. In the presence of sunlight, the catalyst converts CO2 to ethanol and propanol, and the water into oxygen.

For years, the research team has been investigating ways to harness photosynthesis to produce sustainable fuels, but these artificial leaves have only been able to produce simple chemicals like syngas — a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide that is used to produce fuels, pharmaceuticals, plastics, and fertilisers.
But this latest breakthrough has enabled scientists to produce clean ethanol and propanol without producing syngas at all. Eliminating this step makes the technology “more practical and scalable,” said the researchers. 
While other scientists have been able to produce similar chemicals using electrical power, this is slated to be the first time that such complex chemicals have been produced with an artificial leaf using only sunlight.  
While the technology is still at laboratory scale, the researchers say their artificial leaves are an important step in the transition away from a fossil fuel-based economy.
“Even though there’s still work to be done, we’ve shown what these artificial leaves are capable of doing,” said Professor Erwin Reisner, who led the research. “It’s important to show that we can go beyond the simplest molecules and make things that are directly useful as we transition away from fossil fuels.”
The team is now working to optimise the light absorbers so that they can better absorb sunlight. They are also working on optimising the catalyst so it can convert more sunlight into fuel.
Further work will also be required to make the device scalable so that it can produce large volumes of fuel. In the future, though, cars could use the technology to produce clean fuel on the go.

From stem cells to supermarkets: The promise of cultivated meat,Linnea Ahlgren,2023/05/24,"

As a vegetarian for the past 13 years, I have tried the whole gamut of plant-based meat substitutes. And let me tell you, the texture and taste has come a long way since the early 2010s. Developers and restaurants have woken up to the fact that just because someone chooses not to eat meat for environmental or ethical reasons, doesn’t mean that they don’t want the satisfying experience of a juicy, umami-rich burger or hot dog. 
Meanwhile, it is understandable that for a hardcore meat enthusiast, a seitan steak is just not going to cut it. However, whether you are a dedicated omnivore or not, there is no denying that our current food production systems of livestock farming and animal husbandry are unsustainable.
Enter cultivated meat, and the companies working to make it a staple on our supermarket shelves within the next decade.

Krijn de Nood is one of the founders of Meatable, a Delft-based food tech startup that grows meat in a lab – without any animals harmed in the process. The company just recently held the first public tasting of its pork sausage in Singapore, and looks to be cost-competitive with corresponding organic conventional meat products in just a few years’ time.
First of all, let’s state what cultivated meat is not; it is not vegan, or plant-based. It is actual animal meat from stem cells, taken from a live animal, that have been cultivated and fed with nutrients in a bioreactor so they can grow. 
Another potential misconception around the technology is an underestimation of how complex the process is. According to de Nood, “Things go a lot slower than building a new, say, app. It’s not exactly the same, but it’s closer to developing a new vaccine, for example, or a new medicine.”
Ending unnecessary suffering 
Around the world, an unfathomable 70 billion land animals are slaughtered every year. That is close to 200 million every single day. And the world’s appetite for meat continues to grow along with population and GDPs. 
By 2050, global meat consumption is predicted to increase by 70%. While Meatable and its colleagues/competitors may not reasonably be expected to replace the entire conventional meat industry, by 2035, the company hopes to save an estimated 27 million animal lives cumulatively. 
As de Nood explains part of his reasons for leaving a business career with McKinsey and co-founding Meatable in 2018, “If I, in 20 years in this field, can look back and say, hey, I was a pretty significant part in starting the fact that we don’t have to rely on animals as much anymore for our food, I think that will be a lifetime well spent.”
Sustainability
When it comes to environmental impact, 14.5% of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are attributable to livestock farming. In contrast, aviation is responsible for around 2.5%.
Other than carbon dioxide, meat production also contributes to methane and nitrous oxide emissions. While the latter two do not linger in the atmosphere for as long as CO2, their climate warming potential is between 25 and 300 times higher. 
So much are we intent on keeping raising cows for meat and dairy, that an Australian startup called Rumin8 making a methane-reducing feed additive (basically, making sure cows burp less) has received a $12 million investment from Bill Gates-founded Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV). 
There have been tentative reports that put into question how environmentally sustainable it is to cultivate meat in a lab. However, de Nood says that comparisons being made between the current carbon intensity of cultivated meat and conventional livestock farming are not entirely fair. This is because it measures how much energy it requires to produce lab-grown meat today, and not how much it will need once reaching industrial scale. 
“If you look at the research process, it’s always going to be that to make, say, one electric car, you need to have a lot of infrastructure. And if you allocate all that to one electric car, that electric car is not going to be any better than the car that comes from an industrial normal car manufacturer.” 
De Nood explains that when looking at Meatable’s life cycle analysis (LCA), its cultivated beef can become approximately 97% less polluting than conventionally raised cattle beef, and its pork about 80% less polluting. Given, of course, that the company manages to scale its technology. 
Scaling cultured meat 
Pigs are by far the most butchered animal on the planet apart from chickens, which is one of the reasons why Meatable decided to first develop its pork products, although a dedicated “bovine team” is also busy cultivating beef. The cells themselves behave a little differently, which means that nutrient uptake needs to be optimised individually for each species. However, when it comes to scaling up to larger bioreactors, the process is very similar. 
As mentioned, Meatable held its first public tasting in Singapore, where it hopes to bring its first industrial facilityonline in 2026. In order for that to happen, there needs to be a whole lot of scaling, something de Nood attributes to a classic R&D process, “We know that it works on a small scale, now the question is if we can apply it at an industrial scale.” 
The company recently held its first public tasting in Singapore. Credit: Meatable
One of the key aspects in scaling production is achieving efficiency without sacrificing quality and safety. And Meatable is well on the way, given its recent breakthrough.  Just yesterday the company revealed that it can now cultivate pork meat in as little as eight days (less than 5% of the time it takes to rear a pig on a farm), with the highest quality of muscle and fat cells. 
This is essential to producing the actual taste and texture of meat, according to de Nood one of the three main metrics of bringing the technology to scale. 
“For example, cell densities are very important. So if you have a litre of bioreactor capacity, how many grams of meat can you cultivate? The second one is, what is the doubling time? So how long does it take before the cells to double themselves? And then the third one that’s very important is that we start with stem cells. Stem cells are not as tasty as muscle and fat cells. So we need to turn them into that. How many days does it take for that process?”
Apparently, now just a little over a week, combining Meatable’s use of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), which have the natural ability to keep on multiplying and to do so rapidly (with a doubling time of a couple of days), and the company’s patented opti-ox technology. 
Bringing down the cost
One of the major challenges to the budding cultivated meat industry is the cost associated with the technology. The very first lab-grown burger was produced in 2012, at a whopping cost of $375,000 (€347,000). Indeed, one of the founders of Meatable and currently the company’s CTO, Daan Luining, was an intern on the project. 
Ten years on, what has happened to the price tag? While the exact number remains undisclosed, de Nood says that Meatable’s is now “more than a thousandfold” lower than the original. 
The company is looking at a small-scale launch of its products – a pork sausage and dumpling – in Singapore next year. Following the inauguration of its production facility in the city-state, Meatable says its products will become cost-competitive with, say, organic sausages in the US and in Asia, with retail prices around $20-25 per kilo. By the early 2030s, de Nood hopes the company will be able to match the price of traditional meat. 
Why Singapore? 
This year, the company will open the Future of Meat innovation centre together with Asia’s first plant-based butcher Love Handle, where the two will work on developing hybrid meat products. But why Singapore? As the first in the world to do so, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) approved cultivated meat for consumption in late 2020 when it gave the go-ahead for Eat Just chicken nuggets. 
In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) followed suit in November last year, also clearing cultured chicken from Upside Foods for the first time. Essentially, the decisions of the two food safety administrations create more certainty for startups to operate within their jurisdiction. 
Europe, or specifically, the EU, has an extremely lengthy regulatory process due to the decision making processes of the union. There is hope for the bloc, as de Nood states that there are “a lot of people,” especially in the Netherlands, wanting to make it happen. 
Indeed, in April 2022, the Dutch government awarded €60 million to develop a national cellular agriculture ecosystem. And this is only the initial step toward funding a more significant growth plan with €252 to €382 million for the sector. Furthermore, the House of Representatives voted to allow tastings of cultured meat in controlled settings earlier this year. 
Are consumers ready? 
Well, apparently, it depends – mostly on age. “If you talk to people about 20 to 30 and below, it’s a no brainer. They are very climate conscious, and they have grown up with technology; technology is part of their life,” de Nood says. “So in 10 years, those people will be 40 and below, and those will be the ones with young children making the buying decisions. That is why I am very positive about consumer perception.” 
To those who question whether or not lab-grown meat is natural or even ethical, de Nood says Meatable wants to flip the narrative, which is why the company has coined the term “new natural.” 
De Nood explains, “Well, is it natural to have the rainforest cut down to sow soy plantations that are shipped to the Netherlands to feed our cattle? If you, at some point have the choice between a burger or a sausage, or in a couple of years a steak, where for the first one an animal had to be slaughtered and it was very bad for the environment, and for the second, which was exactly the same, none of those things were necessary, would you still go for that first one?”

Electric hypercar Rimac Nevera smashes 23 performance records in a single day,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/05/23,"
Since its launch in 2021, the all-electric Rimac Nevera has hit the hypercar world like the storm it’s named after — and for good reason. With an impressive 1,914 horsepower and a 0-100km/h acceleration in just 1.85 seconds, this beautiful machine not only holds the top EV speed record, but also outperforms its petrol-powered counterparts.
Now, the Nevera has hit another milestone: it has broken 23 performance records in a single day, claiming the title of the “ultimate record-breaking hypercar.” The tests were run at Germany’s Automotive Testing Papenburg (ATP) facility, and were independently verified by third-party companies Dewesoft and RaceLogic.

The EV’s strike was led by the 0-400-0km/h run, the utmost test of hypercar straight line performance, combining acceleration, aerodynamics, top speed, and stopping power. The Nevera managed to accelerate from 0km/h to 400km/h and come back to a standstill in 29.93 seconds — over a second faster than the previous record holder, the Konigsegg Regera.
In practice, the Nevera shuttered most existing acceleration records. It did a 0-200km/h run in 4.42 seconds, continued to 300km/h in 9.22 seconds, and reached 400km/h in 21.31 seconds. The hypercar even outperformed itself clocking 1.81 seconds for 0-100km/h — four seconds faster than its official acceleration spec. Not to mention that smashing 23 records within a day is a record in itself.
Below you can find the full list of benchmarks:

Behind the success lies Rimac’s in-house technology, encompassing the Nevera’s aerodynamic design, powertrain, battery system, and software.
To name its most essential specs, the Croatian-made EV comes with a 120kWh battery pack and uses four electric motors — one for each wheel — which produce an impressive 1.4MW of power. It also features a top notch regenerative braking system combined with 390mm Brembo CCMR carbon-ceramic brake discs, and six-piston callipers.

“I am proud to say that the car we’ve created can get to 400km/h and back to 0 in less time than it took the McLaren F1 to accelerate up to 350km/h,” Mate Rimac, founder and CEO of the company, said in a statement. “And not only that, but it can do it again and again, breaking every other performance record in the process. If you had a Nevera and access to a track, you could do it too.”
Rimac will make only 150 Neveras, so if you’d like to feel the power of this breathtaking car, you’d better act fast. You’ll also need to pay an estimated €2m to buy it, but that’s a rather fair price for recreational record-breaking.
In the meantime (or if the EV is far off your budget), you can watch the Nevera smashing records on the video below:

A glimpse into AI’s future in architecture: Inflatable skyscrapers,Thomas Macaulay,2023/05/23,"
Designers have given a glimpse into the future of urban architecture: AI-generated inflatable skyscrapers.
The buildings are the brainchild of Zumo, a Barcelona-based architectural practice. Founded in 2020 by Andre Sashko and Alessandro Lussignoli, the firm blends classical knowledge and contemporary tech to visualise new construction forms.
Their latest project adds Midjourney to the art of architecture. Zumo used the text-to-image model to visualise the wobbly edifices in urban settings.
First published by Design Boom, the images depict the superstructures towering over future cities. To my unsullied eyes, they resemble illuminated balloons soaring into the skyline. But my cruder colleagues compared them to giant condoms.
You can draw your own analogies after scrolling through the gallery below:

Inevitably, there’s a sustainability component to the project. As inflatables, the buildings can be pumped up to lofty heights, flattened for transportation, and reconstructed in locations where they’re needed. Just make sure to dispose all sharps before entry.
Powered by renewable energy, they also have a reduced environmental footprint — which could be useful if they were real. One day, perhaps they will be.
AI takes on architecture
Zumo’s buildings may be fake, but AI already has a role in designing real buildings. Zaha Hadid Architects, for instance, recently revealed that it uses text-to-image generators to produce ideas for “most” of its projects.
Although popular, the practice is proving divisive. Supporters argue that AI can provide fresh inspiration, engage clients with the design process, and replace menial tasks. But critics say the systems are biased towards certain architectural and visual styles.
There is also a broader concern about the threat to human designers. In January, three artists turned the issue into a class action lawsuit. The plaintiffs allege that Sta­bil­ity AI, DeviantArt, and Mid­jour­ney have violated the rights of “millions of artists” by remixing their copyrighted works.
These companies, the case argues, train their tools on pictures scraped from the web without the consent of creators. It’s hardly a contentious claim — Midjourney’s founder has admitted to the practice. 
Inspired by the original artworks, the systems now pump out endless AI-generated images — at a profit. Arguably, they’re stealing both past and future work from artists. But if they can deliver a glorious future of living in condoms, perhaps it’s justifiable.

Dutch students unveil ‘world’s most efficient’ hydrogen car,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/05/15,"
At the beginning of May, a student team from Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands unveiled what could be the world’s most efficient hydrogen car. 
Dubbed ERXII, the vehicle is slated to cover over 2,000km on just 1kg of hydrogen fuel — equivalent to the distance between Amsterdam and Kyiv.
This claim will be tested in June at Shell’s Eco-Marathon event in France. Eco-Runner will go head-to-head with student teams from across Europe to break the world record for the longest distance driven on hydrogen without refuelling. 
This year the number to beat is 2,056km, set by a methanol fuel-cell-powered Renault Zoe in 2022.

The 80kg carbon fibre vehicle has been designed to be as aerodynamic as possible. With a constant speed of 45kph, the ERXII should be able to cover 2,056km within three days.  
This is one of several hydrogen cars developed by Eco-Runner in recent years. 
“Efficiency and reliability are the main focus of this year’s project,” said team leader Julian de Klerk. “While the previous concept proved efficient, this year, we aimed for improved reliability for the record we’re trying to set. And well, it’s quite futuristic looking.”
Eco-Runner sees its tiny hydrogen car as a vision of a future where “all cars are smaller, lighter, and aerodynamic,” with the focus being  on “shared mobility” as “people deal with transport more sustainability and efficiently.”

This comes at a time when Europe is transitioning from fossil-fueled vehicles to more sustainable alternatives. While most of the emphasis in the passenger car segment has been on EVs, the team at Eco-Runner believes that hydrogen-powered city cars also have a place on the tarmac. 
“Electric cars are also part of the solution for sustainable mobility, but the electricity grid is already filling up,” said operations manager Eliane van Boxtel. “Electrifying the whole world is not an option. Hydrogen and electric cars go hand in hand. There is no one big winner.” 
For now, the students have their sights set on June, as they look to take home first prize and set another record for hydrogen-powered travel.

Spain’s Crowmie empowers everyone to invest in green energy,Jill Petzinger,2023/05/15,"
This profile is part of the main prize of the Pitch Battle at TNW Valencia 2023 won by Crowmie. Want your company to get featured as well? You’ve only got a few days to join the startup contest at TNW Conference in Amsterdam on June 15 & 16! 
Valencia’s hottest green-fintech startup is on a mission to break down the high barriers to investment in the energy sector and make it easy for everyone to fund renewable projects.
Crowmie, which launched February last year, is jumping into the micro-investing space by allowing anyone with as little as €100 to spend the chance to invest directly into renewable energy projects in Spain, and see monthly returns. 
Tech-wise, Crowmie has built a platform to create digital security tokens (STO, Security Token Offerings) for the total amount of each project they want to finance. This automated process means all investment transactions are registered in the blockchain. 
The 12-person startup, led by founders Fernando Dávila (26), Pablo Valverde (29) and Joshua Cleveland (29) won the Pitch Battle at TNW Valencia in March this year.
“The jury was impressed with the team’s vision and goal of making it easier to invest in renewable energy,” said Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten, co-founder of TNW and jury member of the Pitch Battle. “This is such an amazing opportunity that people like you and I can now finally get active in. This is one of those startups that you hope become very successful, not just for the team, or the investors but for the whole world.”
Crowmie (the name is a mashup of “crowd” and “homie”) has received €300,000 in pre-seed funding so far and is going after a €1.5 million seed round this year. The company will deploy the funds towards marketing, tech, opening up the investment platform to people in the US and building a presence in Mexico and Colombia. 
Tokenised investment inspiration
CEO Dávila, who studied astro-engineering in Valencia before becoming a founder, told TNW that innovation in property tech was one of their main inspirations.
“The idea came about because we saw an incredible trend in the tokenisation world, especially in the real estate sector,” Dávila said, citing RealT in the US and Reental in Spain as two pioneering companies in real-estate tokenised investments. 
The trio thought that the same model of fractional, tokenised investment could totally work in the renewable energy sector too — and no one was doing it in Spain. 
“Right now only those with high amounts of capital can invest in the renewable energy vertical, and we want to do it with tokenisation, because impact investment is growing now and will grow much more in the future,” Dávila added.

“We are really digitising a completely traditional sector like investment, using blockchain technology that allows us to open the doors to anyone from anywhere in the world, making it easy to invest in renewable energies, which until now was completely impossible.”
Spain is a promising base for green-energy initiatives. Just over 42% of the country’s electricity was generated from renewable sources in 2022, and it wants to increase this share to 74% by 2030.  
According to a Reuters report from December 2022, Spain has the largest solar pipeline in Europe, with so many solar projects in planning that the government is struggling to get all the permits issued. 
Zero-hassle investing
Getting up and running on the Crowmie app is simple, according to Dávila. Once someone signs up and completes the legal verification steps, they just need to select which of the Crowmie energy projects they want to invest in, and how much. 
They then receive a minted token for that monetary value giving them economic rights to the project. They can resell their tokens with one click any time.
Crucially, Crowmie’s business model is not purely about facilitating investment and financing the projects, as they actually own the installations and plants themselves. Once they’ve built an energy plant, typically for a large company or factory, they sell the energy from it to the customer, and distribute the money to all investors. 
Two solar plants are up and running so far, with, Dávila says, a total of 66 investors from multiple countries on board, with an average investment ticket of €2,000.

Crowmie’s photovoltaic plant supplying the TYPSA factory in Zaragoza was financed with €114,000 and started operating in February this year. Investors started getting dividends from the first month of operations and it is expected to deliver a return of 7.5% per year for five years for investors, and save 1,365 tonnes of CO₂ per year.
The startup also makes money by taking 5% of the value of tokens that they mint on the platform (giving them 5% of the economic rights of any one project) and a 2% processing fee. 
Chickens and eggs
“Our biggest challenge is to balance the projects and the investors – it is chicken and egg,” said  Dávila. “You have to balance the volume of investors on the platform, and the volume of projects that you have, in order to finance that project fast, really timing when the projects are coming, then creating FOMO among those investors that they are going to miss this opportunity.”
“We have three kinds of investors,” he added. “On one side, we have professional investors, who invest between €10,000 and €50,000. Then there are retail investors, who go in for about €2,000 a ticket. The third level is those who put in between €100 and €2,000.” 
Compliance and due diligence across finance, technical and legal before they sign contracts with clients for the energy projects is the expensive part of doing business for Crowmie, and needs to be outsourced.  
For now, the founders are cutting their teeth on projects in Spain, but they’re already looking at expanding into Mexico and Colombia, where their partners have other energy projects. These 25 partners, Dávila said, have already created a pipeline of 40 potential projects for Crowmie to the value of €20 million.

Arina is one of the world’s leading authorities on the movement. He co-authored the bestselling Biohacker’s Handbook and founded the Biohacker Summit — Europe’s leading conference for optimising human performance. He’s also the co-founder of Biohacker Center, an independent think tank that researches peak performance, health, and well-being.
Naturally, Arina meticulously biohacks himself. Initially, I imagined this would involve drilling brain chips into his skull. But biohacking is closer to DIY biology.
Arina’s website provides a more detailed description:
“Biohacking is the art and science of optimizing your body, mind, and performance with systems thinking, technology, and biology — in other words, better living through science.”
Arina entered the field after he was afflicted by a chronic illness. Biohacking provided a route to recovery. That led him to further optimise his health and performance with biological and technological tools.
Some of these tools are surprisingly accessible. Arina uses activity trackers to manage stress, a headset to measure brainwaves, a muscle scanner to guide fitness training, and a blue light device to synchronise his circadian rhythm.
At TNW Conference on June 16, Arina will unravel the next phase of biohacking — and how it can unlock human potential. He promises to share his pioneering techniques for enhancing physical and mental performance.
To my decrepit mind and body, that sounds like an unmissable offer. And just in case Arina wants to ramp it up, I’m bringing my brain and scalpel.
Teemu Arina’s biohacking tips are merely one attraction of TNW Conference. You can find more on the event agenda — and remember: for a 25% discount on business passes, use the promo code READ-TNW-25.

Northvolt to build gigafactory in Germany after state aid pledge,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/05/12,"
Northvolt, Europe’s biggest battery maker, has confirmed that it will build its next gigafactory in Heide, Germany, following the federal government’s pledge to provide state aid.
The announcement comes after several months of uncertainty. In March 2022, the Swedish manufacturer and the German state of Schleswig-Holstein signed a memorandum of understanding to construct a factory in the region. But in October 2022, Northvolt said it might postpone the plan and priotirise a US expansion instead — unless the EU was willing to match the IRA’s loftier subsidies for green technologies.
In response, the German government has now confirmed it’ll fund the gigafactory under the Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework (TCTF) — a new EU state-aid plan, designed to support the development of green projects in view of the US’ respective subsidies and Russia’s energy monopoly.
The funding needs to be approved by Brussels first, but the federal government said it’s already “in the first constructive discussions” with the European Commission.
“Backed by this commitment of the federal government, Northvolt has decided to take the next steps towards our expansion in Heide,” said Peter Carlsson, founder & CEO of the company.
The gigafactory will have a 60GWh annual production volume of battery cells, aiming to supply approximately 1million EVs. It’s expected to unlock a multi-billion euro private investment, and create 3,000 direct jobs with thousands more estimated in the surrounding industry and service sector.
“With the next steps regarding Northvolt, Germany can look forward to one of the most significant lighthouse projects of the energy and transport transition,” said Robert Habeck, Germany’s deputy chancellor and economy minister.
In addition to the Commission’s approval, the gigafactory still requires preparational on-site work for construction and the final building permission. Deliveries of the first battery cells are expected in 2026.

Fairphone unveils user-repairable wireless headphones,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/05/12,"
At a time when the electronics industry is constantly luring consumers into buying the latest and most advanced devices, Amsterdam-based Fairphone has made a name for itself by doing the exact opposite.
Best known for its sustainably-made, modular, and repairable (DIY style) smartphones, the startup is now applying the same ethos to another product segment: headphones.
The newly-launched Fairbuds XL are a pair of over-ear wireless headphones, priced at €249. Much like the company’s smartphones, they’re sold mainly in Europe, although some authorised resellers ship to other parts of the world as well.
The Fairbuds XL come with a 30 hour battery life, 40mm dynamic drivers for sound quality, and active noise cancellation. They also feature a USB-C connector for charging, a 10m Bluetooth range, and smart assistants capabilities.
But their most impressive element is undoubtedly the design. The modular headphones consist of nine components/potential spare parts: battery, speaker to speaker cable, earcap covers, headband, ear cushion, headband base, speakers, and headband cover.

Customers can order any of them on the company’s website or the Fairbuds app, and easily replace or repair parts that are broken or worn over time. The headphones come with a two-year warranty, which means that within this period the components’ cost will be most likely covered by the startup.
To further boost their positive environmental and societal impact, the Fairbuds XL are made with 100% recycled plastics, aluminium, and tin solder paste to the maximum extent possible, while the startup claims it’ll pay $0.55 per headphone to fill the living wage gap of the production line workers.
Fairphone’s overall ethos aligns with the EU’s goal to drastically reduce e-waste and move towards a circular economy by 2050. Upcoming policies such the Right to Repair and the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products could give a significant regional boost to the startup’s approach.

Sweden to pave world’s first permanent e-road for EV charging while driving,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/05/10,"

As countries across Europe scale up efforts towards fossil fuel-free mobility, Sweden is working on the world’s first permanent electric road — allowing electric cars and trucks to charge while driving.
The project is led by the Swedish Transport Administration, Trafikverket, which has selected the E20 highway. Specifically, it will build the electric road system (ERS) on the 21km route from Hallsberg to Örebro, located between the country’s two largest cities, Stockholm and Gothenburg.
The e-road is now at the procurement and final planning stage, while Trafikverket expects to complete and introduce it to the public in 2025/2026.
How will it work?
Trafikverket has yet to determine which technology it will use for the ERS. Currently, there are three types available: overhead conductive, ground-based conductive, and ground-based inductive charging.
In the first type of charging, power is transferred from overhead wires to a vehicle through a pantograph — much like how trams operate. This technology, however, is only suitable for heavy-duty vehicles that are high enough to reach the electric lines.
The other two ground-based options work in a similar way. In conductive charging, power is transferred from special rails or tracks placed below or on the road. The vehicles charge with the help of a mechanical arm or stick that touches the rails. In the inductive system, the power transfer takes place between coils embedded in the road and the vehicles.
Sweden’s bet on electric roads
The ambitious electrification of E20 follows a series of successful ERS pilot projects in the country. From 2016 to date, Trafikverket has tested all three road charging technologies in various parts of the country, including Lund, Gotland, and Sandviken.
Most of the focus has been on trucks and buses and for a good reason. Electrifying the road network that connects the country’s biggest cities would reduce emissions of heavy duty vehicles by 1.2m tonnes in 2030, research estimates.
But, in 2018, Sweden began testing road charging for both commercial and passenger EVs as well on a 2km route between Stockholm’s Arlanda airport and a logistics area in Rosenberg.
The government’s plan is to deploy 2,000km of ERS on public roads by 2030 — the same year it has proposed to ban new fossil fuel-powered cars. But whether betting on e-roads constitutes a fruitful strategy remains a controversial topic.
On the one hand, electric road systems will enable longer distances to be traveled between charging station visits, increasing the adoption rate of EVs and, in turn, reducing carbon emissions.
A recent study by the Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg has further found that e-roads would also lower the demand on the grid during peak times, working as an alternative to home charging. The team also suggested that combining home (static) and on-the-go (dynamic) charging can reduce the battery size by up to 70%.
“This would reduce the need for raw materials for batteries, and an electric car could also become cheaper for the consumer,” said Sten Karlsson, co-author of the study.
There is, however, an important counterargument: the lofty investment and maintenance costs for a nascent type of infrastructure that, in the long run, may prove obsolete as battery development accelerates.
But according to the study’s findings, the risk doesn’t seem that high. The team estimates that only 25% of the national and European roads would need to be electrified for the system to work.
Sweden is not alone in developing e-roads, with Italy, France, Germany, and the UK testing the technology as well. In fact, Europe’s interconnectivity might indeed give a winning chance to an electric road network.

Swiss startup edges closer to first-ever space trash collection,Thomas Macaulay,2023/05/9,"
The first active removal of space debris has moved closer to lift-off after a new deal was inked on the landmark mission.
Swiss startup ClearSpace and French rocket giant Arianespace today announced that a launch contract has been signed for the assignment.
The mission, named ClearSpace-1, aims to capture and deorbit a chunk of garbage weighing over 100 kg. To start, the trash-collecting spacecraft will be released into a sun-synchronous orbit by the new European light launcher Vega C. 
After commissioning and critical tests, the spacecraft will be raised to the target litter, which will be disposed of through an atmospheric reentry.  
The launch is scheduled for no earlier than the second half of 2026.

Luc Piguet, the CEO and co-founder of ClearSpace, hailed the new deal as a crucial step for the project.
“This secures ClearSpace’s access to space for our trailblazing space debris removal mission,” Piguet said in a statement.
“The ClearSpace-1 mission demonstrates a turning point in the space industry as we urgently need to bring solutions to a fundamental problem: we are putting objects into space quicker than they are being removed.”

The deal between two European players also marks another milestone for the continent’s space ambitions. It comes a month after Europe was found to have surpassed the US in private spacetech investment for the first time.
More importantly, the contract brings us closer to solving a growing problem in space. At present, there are over 34,000 pieces of space debris larger than 10 centimetres — as well as about 6,500 operational satellites in orbit, a number expected to exceed 27,000 by the decade’s end.
All these objects are increasing the risk of collisions with satellites or space stations. If the build-up of trash continues at this rate, some regions of space could become unusable. And for those of us on Earth, the litter’s ruining our views of the cosmos.
If all goes to plan, ClearSpace-1 will set a benchmark for making our solar system a cleaner place.

"8 in 10 German companies still fax, study finds — but, umm, why?",Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/05/9,"
In the age of digital communication, fax machines seem as outdated as using a rotary dial phone or a cassette tape. Think about it: if a colleague asked you to fax them a document, you’d probably give them an incredulous look. But in Germany, fax machines haven’t been relegated to the history books just yet, research shows.
Digital advocacy group Bitkom surveyed 505 companies across the country and found that a whopping 82% of them still fax. Notably, one-third of the respondents said their use of the 180-year old technology is “frequent” or “very frequent.”
The intensity of use, however, is gradually declining. Last year, it was at 40%, down from 62% in 2018. Correspondingly, half of the companies now send faxes only rarely or occasionally, while 16% have stopped altogether. According to Bitkom, this data shows that faxing is — slowly but surely — nearing its end in the business world.
To fax or not to fax?
But regardless of the declining trend in use, one question still remains: why use fax machines — well beyond their heyday — instead of simply emailing or cloud sharing?
“What is most valued about the classic fax machine is above all its ability to clearly trace whether something has been sent,” said Nils Britze, Bitkom’s head of digital business processes.
Britze pointed to another factor as well: “Once a channel of communication has been established, it usually takes a while before it is completely replaced — even when much more comfortable and safer means of communication have emerged.”
From a business perspective this translates to the challenge of digitisation. According to Bitkom’s previous research, larger companies find it easier to go fully digital compared to small ones with less than 100 employees. Specifically, 42% of large companies surveyed had digitised their business processes in 2021, while 94% of smaller companies were still using paper.
From a personal perspective, postponing the fax machine replacement refers to what Jonathan Coopersmith, History Professor at Texas A&M University, calls “comfortable inertia.” That is, the people’s tendency to stick to the familiar, and in turn, their reluctance to change technologies.
So it seems that classic ol’ faxing still has some good years before becoming a relic of the past — at least in Germany.

Spotify cracks down on AI-generated music streaming fraud,Linnea Ahlgren,2023/05/9,"
According to Spotify founder Daniel Ek, the value of a company is “the sum of the problems you solve.” 
The problem of bot farms playing the same tracks over and over to manipulate streaming data may not be entirely new. However, as generative AI tools become increasingly mainstream, it is taking on a new dimension for the music industry. 
This will require streaming service providers to vigilantly predict and plan ahead not to be left playing a game of reactive whac-a-mole, desperately beating down issues as they arise. Otherwise, apart from dealing with obvious copyright controversies, they may end up paying large sums of money for millions of bot-boosted “fake streams.” 
According to a report in the Financial Times, Universal Music Group (UMG), which controls about a third of the global music market, has been sending takedown requests “left and right.” Stockholm-headquartered Spotify has obliged – at least to some degree. 
Last week, the music streaming giant temporarily ousted hundreds of thousands of songs generated on the AI platform Boomy. The California-based startup’s tool lets users create tracks by picking from a selection of styles, such as Lo-Fi or EDM, and then customise them and either record or add vocals, before uploading them to streaming services. 
However, this is not a case of making Drake rap on your track – the vocals must belong to the user. As such, the tracks were not greyed out because of copyright infringement concerns, but due to the discovery of widespread “suspicious listening activity.” 
Meanwhile, this does not mean that Spotify has completely blocked Boomy users and forbidden them from uploading new tracks. Indeed, the AI platform announced this weekend that “Boomy artists” had their curated delivery to the streaming giant re-enabled.

We are pleased to share that curated delivery to Spotify of new releases by Boomy artists has been re-enabled. 
Supporting our artists and creators who use the Boomy platform is our top priority, and we greatly appreciate your patience these past few days.
— Boomy – Create AI Music (@boomy) May 6, 2023

 
Reportedly, the two sides are still in negotiations over the reinstatement of the rest of Boomy’s catalogue. 
Fake stream farms an industry-wide issue
Spotify’s crackdown is part of an ongoing battle against bot streaming farms. Essentially, this is when a bunch of digital devices are logged in on various platforms, and simply play music 24 hours a day, often playing the same track over and over again. 
Obviously, this impacts the number of listens, directly generating revenue for the owner of the track. Meanwhile, it also affects data driven features such as charts and playlists. 
According to the streaming giant, “Artificial streaming is a longstanding, industry-wide issue that Spotify is working to stamp out across our service.”
Earlier this year, France’s Centre National de la Musique (CNM) released a study on music streaming fraud, in which Spotify participated. However, CNM called out other major streaming platforms Apple, Amazon, and YouTube as “unable or unwilling” to take part in the study. 
The first-of-its-kind study established that, in France, in 2021, between one and three billion streams, at least, were false, i.e. between 1% and 3% of total listening. Of course, plenty has happened since. 
The CNM says it will launch a new study into the matter in 2024, which may better reveal the implications of the recent revolution in access to generative AI  – and the ability of Spotify to mitigate it.
Grimes stands alone in the pro-AI camp
Over the past few months, the music streaming market has experienced a significant rise in AI-generated tracks. According to Boomy, its users have already “created” more than 14 million songs. 
Services such as those provided by Boomy, Aiva, and Soundful leverage machine learning to allow users to generate unlimited tracks and even monetise their creations on streaming platforms, to the chagrin of artists, producers, distributors, and other industry stakeholders. 
Grimes has launched an AI platform specifically for people to use her voice to make new music, stating that “Copyright sucks. Art is a conversation with everyone that has come before us. Intertwining it with the ego is a modern concept. The music industry has been defined by lawyers, and that strangles creativity.” 
Needless to say, she is quite the exception in her pro-generative AI stance in the global artist community.

Not ready for a 4-day work week? The nine-day fortnight could be for you,Suzie Coen,2023/05/9,"
You’ve heard of the four day week. Now, meet its slightly less fun but still a good time younger brother: the nine-day fortnight. It’s taking workplaces by storm, with leaders lauding this new model as a happy medium between burnout and excessive time off.
Its growing popularity is not surprising. The need for a dynamic approach to the changing landscape of the workplace isn’t just advisable, it’s a necessity.
According to an Economist report, 59% of people say they would consider taking a job with a company that offers better well-being benefits than their current employer. But, if the last few years have taught us anything, it’s that there isn’t a blueprint for flexible working policies.
Companies have experimented and continue to experiment with the models that seem best suited to their individual organisations — from the new nine day fortnight to complete location flexibility; a remote-first policy to offering employees flexibility around when they work.
What is a nine-day fortnight?
The nine-day fortnight working pattern effectively means that across 14 calendar days, nine of them are working days and five are days off.
Every other week, employees get an extra day off, often a Friday. Some companies ask employees to work longer hours on the days they’re working to allow for the extra day off, or to take a small pay cut—typically around 10%. Others say this isn’t important to them as long as their output remains consistent.
What are the benefits?
The idea is that it isn’t only a sweet deal for workers, but for employers too. Many of the benefits are similar to those of the four-day week, according to those who have tested it.
Studies have shown that reduced working hours can actually lead to higher productivity, meaning increased company profits, and improved well being among workers.
It could also help to reduce carbon emissions, improve gender equality in the workplace, help tackle unemployment and lead to a better work-life balance.
Where has it gotten substantial buzz?
Worldwide trials of flexible working models have been in operation post-Covid with mostly positive results. In Australia for instance, many workers moved to the nine-day format and took 10% pay cuts in the recession,
The model is also very common in the UK’s public sector bodies. At London Councils, a 9-day fortnight is based on a compressed working week, and allows staff to work nine working days instead of ten over a two week period—as long as the total number of hours worked meets contractual working hours.
And Public Practice, a company delivering services to support the public sector, has just concluded a six-month 9-day fortnight study where it trialled a number of approaches. These included a 10% reduction of working hours, benefits adjustments and flexibility. Once the body conducts an analysis on the impact of the trial, it will take a decision on whether it will be implemented formally.
Why should companies consider a 9-day fortnight?
Bottom line, it’s going to be hard to attract talent if you’re not offering some flexibility. Even for companies that haven’t considered four-day weeks, nine-day fortnights might work best in the long term anyway.
For some workers, four day weeks can feel quite intense. Alternating four and five-day weeks creates a better balance. With a nine-day fortnight, employees are able to switch between working styles and can adapt to how they work based on how many days their working week has, as well as enjoying quality of life improvements.
Businesses should think creatively about what type of adjusted work week works for them. Too often the options are presented as binary (a five-day or a four-day week), but there are lots of potential routes in between.
If you’re striving for a proper work-life balance this year, it’s time to explore new ambitious career paths that also offer more attractive flexible working opportunities.
Employers offering flexibility
If flexibility is key for you, or indeed new to you, it’s worth checking out roles at progressive companies like Improbable on The House of Talent Job Board.
Flexibility is deeply rooted in this British metaverse technology company’s values and culture and the majority of its workforce is hybrid. Right now it has exciting open positions on offer such as Senior Backend Engineer and a Senior Producer, both of which are entirely remote.
If you’re looking to work for a company that’s particularly focused on a hybrid work model, look no further than the European ecommerce platform Zalando with current openings in Berlin for a Senior MicroStrategy Developer and a Project & Talent Development Manager in Ansbach.
Zalando’s hybrid working model is 60% remote per week, as well as a commitment to flexible working hours. The cherry on the cake here is the opportunity to work from abroad for 30 (working) days per calendar year.
Other leading firms like the German engineer company Bertrandt AG are similarly dedicated to promoting a great work-life balance model. Open roles for Squad Lead Software Development in both Ehningen and in Hamburg come with options for mobile and flexible working hours as a standard, plus an attractive assurance of a high degree of freedom in team construction and leadership.

Dutch startup to build floating solar array at North Sea wind farm,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/04/25,"
A Dutch startup has been awarded a contract to install floating solar panels at an offshore wind farm in the North Sea. 
Oceans of Energy secured the contract from CrossWind, a joint venture between Shell and Eneco. The renewable energy startup has been tasked with building a 0.5MW floating array between wind turbines at the 750MW Hollands Kust Noord wind farm, located 18.5km off the coast of the Netherlands.  
According to the startup, which was founded in 2016 by Dutch engineer and entrepreneur Allard van Hoeken, this would be the first offshore solar farm in the world to be connected, installed, and operated within a wind farm in “high-wave conditions”.
The solar panels will be situated in between the offshore wind turbines, providing backup power on sunnier but less windy days. The panels will be moored to the wind turbines and connected to the same cables, transporting energy efficiently to end users. 
Van Hoeken says the project “will function as an example for combined offshore wind and solar parks in the future.”
The solar array will provide energy for around 500 households once it links up to the Dutch electric grid in 2025, two years after the wind farm comes online.  
Until now the startup has mainly relied on subsidies from the Dutch government, of which it has raised €20m to date. Financial details of the new contract with CrossWind, however, were not disclosed.

Oceans of Energy built a slightly larger array in 2019 which it has been using to test the technology and its ability to withstand some of the roughest seas on Earth. The rig is still operational despite being hit by some pretty severe storms over the last few years. 
Researchers from Utrecht University have closely monitored energy production at the pilot array, located around 15km off the coast of The Hague, at a testing zone known as the North Sea Farm.  
“In addition to removing the problem of a land shortage, there are several other benefits to building at sea, similar to those in wind energy,” solar energy expert Wilfried van Sark at Utrecht University, who is involved in the project, told Reuters. “There is more sun at sea and there is the added benefit of a cooling system for the panels, which boosts output by up to 15%,” he said.
According to Dutch research organisation TNO, 200 gigawatts of solar power is expected to be generated in the Netherlands by 2050, 25 of which will be on inland waters and 45 at sea. This is expected to open up many opportunities for Oceans of Energy and other budding startups like SolarDuck, a Norwegian-Dutch venture that is currently building an even bigger floating solar array in the North Sea.

Scania and Northvolt develop battery for electric trucks with 1.5 million km lifespan,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/04/25,"
Heavy truck manufacturer Scania and emerging EV battery powerhouse Northvolt have developed a battery for electric trucks that they say will last as long as the vehicles themselves — about 1.5 million kilometres.
The lithium-ion battery is the product of a five-year partnership between the two Swedish companies that began in 2017. ​​At the time, Scania was on the lookout for more robust, cost-efficient, and sustainable battery cells for its heavy-duty trucks and buses — and Northvolt was poised to deliver. 
“Northvolt’s mission to build the world’s greenest batteries perfectly matched Scania’s purpose to drive the shift towards sustainable transport,” said Scania’s CEO Christian Levin in a statement.
The lithium-ion cell was produced at Northvolt’s Ett gigafactory in north Sweden, which opened last year and runs entirely on renewable hydro and wind power. As a result, the partners estimate the battery has a carbon footprint of approximately one-third that of a comparative industry equivalent.  
The cell’s long lifespan also makes it one of the most durable and long-lasting batteries in the electric vehicle industry. Most EV batteries on the market today are only estimated to last between 150,000-300,000 km. 
“At the outset of this partnership, Northvolt and Scania agreed to an ambitious timeline for the development of a high-performance battery cell which would enable their plans for electrifying heavy transport,” said Peter Carlsson, CEO and Co-Founder of Northvolt. “To have proceeded through extensive development and validation phases, and now be delivering cells from Northvolt Ett which exceed our initial expectations in terms of performance is a tremendous accomplishment for everyone involved.”

Northvolt will start mass production of the truck batteries at its Ett gigafactory imminently. Over the next few years, Northvolt aims to increase capacity at Ett to 60 GWh to supply clients like Volkswagen, BMW, Volvo and, of course, Scania. 
In addition, Scania will open a new battery factory in Södertälje, Sweden, next year, where Northvolt’s battery cells will be assembled into battery packs for the start of production of heavy-duty electric trucks. Developing long-lasting batteries is seen as an important milestone on the company’s electrification roadmap, which aims for electric vehicles to make up 50% of sales by 2030. 
Other automakers in the EV heavy vehicle space include Tesla, which is developing an electric semi truck imaginatively dubbed ‘Tesla Semi’, and Volvo, which is already distributing its electric trucks to customers throughout Europe. Swedish startup Einride, considered a competitor to the Tesla Semi, is taking the tech a step further with its plans to roll out fully autonomous electric trucks. 
While electric heavy vehicles only made up 0.6% of sales in Europe last year, accounting firm PWC predicts that they will account for one-third of all truck sales in Europe by 2030, and 70% by 2035,  due to tightening regulations on fossil fuel-powered vehicles and the falling costs of cleaner alternatives.

How travel businesses can leverage generative AI solutions,Singapore Tourism Board,2023/04/25,"
Everyone is talking about the potential of generative AI as buzzworthy tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E make the headlines. But just what is generative AI and is there actually a use for these tools within the tourism sector?
First of all, it’s important to note that, although ChatGPT is one of the most popular examples of generative AI on the market right now, there are many examples of tools employing this technology. Second, while the adoption of AI in general has been growing, this technology represents a new leap forward. Generative AI is seen as a breakthrough within the AI space because it goes beyond simply identifying and categorising past data, and uses this information to create original content.
For example, DALL-E and Midjourney have taken the design world by storm, being able to generate unique images in just a few clicks.
Generative AI has also helped to improve chatbots. Rather than spitting out simple, formulaic answers, this technology can analyse customers’ queries at a deeper level and generate more personalised responses, increasing both accuracy and response rate.
One important misconception to keep in mind is that these tools are not necessarily free. For example, while a free version of ChatGPT is available, OpenAI (the company behind the tool) recently introduced ChatGPT Plus with unlimited access and additional features for businesses which costs $20 USD a month. Other generative AI ventures, from advanced chatbots to generative design layouts, will likely include a price tag from the startups and design firms employing this technology. However, if used early and strategically, generative AI could help give your business a leg above the competition.
Let’s dive deeper into the specific opportunities this technology could present to the tourism sector including improving customer experience, reach, security, and more.
Leverage generative AI to transform venue design
One way the hospitality, MICE, and attractions industries can leverage this technology is by taking advantage of its generative design capabilities to come up with new layouts and concepts, and design for specific needs like security or minimising congestion.
Whether you want to redesign your hotel lobby to increase foot traffic to the spa and other amenities or you have a sustainability-focused redesign in mind, these smart tools can be used as a jumping off point. By inputting parameters such as square footage, location, target audience, and style, generative AI can be used to automatically create multiple design options for a hotel’s interior and exterior.


By analysing behaviour and purchase history, this tech can create dynamic customer segments.


MICE and attractions planners can also use this technology to design layout concepts that are optimised to encourage traffic flow and minimise congestion or security risks. Using generative AI can help professionals be more time and resource efficient, automating certain aspects of the planning process, while providing a variety of event and attraction design options with visitor demographics and venue characteristics in mind.
Virtual tours can also be developed using generative AI, creating immersive and interactive experiences for potential guests, attendees, and visitors in significantly less time. For example, imagine being able to explore a hotel’s facilities and amenities online before booking.
Generative design studios are just taking off in Singapore. For example, Digital Blue Foam was one of the first that launched a web-based interactive generative design tool in December 2021. Both Nanyang Technological University and Singapore University of Technology and Design are also offering courses in generative design, signalling this trend is only set to grow in the future.
Deliver better service with human+AI collaboration
Chatbots have already entered the scene providing answers to customers’ frequently asked questions in no time, but sophisticated generative AI tools are now helping to take this a step further. Rather than simply answering prepopulated queries, chatbots can now serve as a pocket guide able to provide customers with personalised itineraries, travel tips, and more throughout their trip.
The heightened level of personalisation is something that enhances the experience for customers and saves staff time, especially when dealing with shortages. Generative AI chatbots can also be programmed to respond in a customers’ native language streamlining accessibility for international guests.
In addition to catering to customers’ needs, these tools can analyse data from past interactions and generate deeper insights for a business’ long term strategy. This is beneficial for revenue management, helping businesses optimise their pricing, develop new revenue models for the future, and even automate dynamic pricing to offer relevant rates for customers.
For example, generative AI is being used to advance predictive customer segmentation. By analysing patterns in past behaviour and purchase history, this technology can more accurately create dynamic customer segments. Going beyond this, it can also use this information to come up with personalised offers and other upselling opportunities.


All in all, a human still needs to operate and moderate it.


One company experiencing the success of human+AI collaboration is TUI. Their new AI customer assistant, Louise, has a 95% opt-in rate with around 500-600 customers using the service monthly. Hosted by Netherlands-based startup Zoey, Louise offers an empathy-driven Whatsapp service that utilises AI alongside human expertise. Unlike other chatbots, when asked a question from a customer, Louise searches an extensive database to provide the best personalised recommendations and answers.
Brit Haarmans, Innovation Lead at TUI says, “it feels like talking to a friend, and I think that’s the benefit of using agents in combination with AI.”
With its package holidays, TUI provides physical representatives at its various resort and hotel destinations, however this isn’t offered for other product lines like its city trips. Haarmans explains, “we wanted to add value to our holiday products where we are less present in the customer journey.” With Louise, it’s as if customers have a representative with them at every step of their trip.
Every morning Louise will proactively offer tips for the day based on the traveller (if they’re on a family or work trip for example). Users can then interact with the chatbot saying, “Instead I’d like to go to the beach, do you have some tips for me?” Or, “Today I’d like to visit these attractions, can you give me some background and booking information?” It also connects to Google Maps, and some excursions are directly bookable via Louise, making things even smoother for both the customer and the agent.
Keep in mind that humans will always be needed
While generative AI represents an exciting new frontier of opportunities, the most important thing to remember is that it’s not a replacement for human staff, but a helper. Human prompt generators and moderators will always be needed.
When it comes to using AI chatbots, Haarmans advises: “It takes a lot of time to train AI, especially if you want it to answer in a personalised way.” An AI can’t sense the emotion or undertone in a message in the way a human can, so humans continue to be essential in moderating responses. TUI has a team who moderate and edit Louise’s responses and also feed in additional information when needed to provide more accurate results.
The same goes for predictive design. While generative AI may be able to put out a number of different and exciting layouts in seconds, it’s still likely that it can miss important considerations that haven’t been included in the prompt. For example, creating a perfectly sustainable, modern, and congestion free hotel lobby, but forgetting to include restroom facilities in the layout.
An AI solution might be able to give you answers quickly but, all in all, a human still needs to operate and moderate it, and ultimately make business decisions based on the information it gives them.
All in all human-AI collaboration can provide the best of both worlds: the precision and intel gathered from the AI, along with the empathetic, personalised touch of a human moderator.

Swedish startup wants €1.5BN to build emissions-free steel plant,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/04/24,"
Swedish startup H2 Green Steel has announced its plans to raise more than €1.5bn in equity funding to build steel plants that emit virtually no emissions.
The startup, backed by high-profile investors such as Mercedes, Maersk, and Spotify’s chief executive, is constructing a ‘green steel’ manufacturing plant in Boden, north Sweden. 
Construction of the plant will be financed through more than €5bn in debt and equity. The startup said in October that it had received support from European financial institutions for €3.5bn in debt financing, making it one of the most capitalised climate tech projects in Europe. 
H2 Green Steel confirmed today that it is now in the process of securing the remaining €1.5bn equity funding and is working with advisers from Morgan Stanley, Financial Times reports. 
Traditionally, steel is made by combining iron ore with coke (a type of coal) at extremely high temperatures. The burning coke produces carbon monoxide, which converts the iron ore into ‘pig iron’ — the basis of steel. The only problem is, when the coke burns it produces a lot of CO2. In fact, the steel industry as a whole is responsible for an estimated 8% of global CO2 emissions. 
H2 Green Steel looks to decarbonise steelmaking by replacing coke with ‘green’ hydrogen (hydrogen produced using renewable energy). Hydrogen reacts with the iron ore to create pig iron — but without the emissions. The only by-product, the startup says, would be water vapour.

The hydrogen itself would be made in an electrolyser at the Boden site. The electrolyser would be powered by ​​renewable energy, including hydropower from the Lule River and nearby wind farms. Overall, this process is predicted to slash steelmaking emissions by 95%.    
If successful, the Boden plant will be the first large-scale green steel plant in Europe, with its products used to construct everything from cars and cargo ships to buildings and bridges. The startup expects to roll out the first commercial batches of its steel by 2025 and aims to produce five million tonnes of green steel a year by 2030. 
However, global annual steel production is currently around 2,000 million tonnes, according to figures from the World Steel Association. This would make the production capacity of the Boden plant a mere “drop in the sea,” Ms Lund Waagsaether, senior policy advisor at the Brussels-based climate think tank E3G, told the BBC.  
But the Boden plant isn’t the only one of its kind in the pipeline. H2 Green Steel has already signed an agreement with Spanish company Iberdrola to build a plant powered by solar power on the Iberian peninsula. Hybrit, another Swedish company, hopes to open a fossil-free green steel plant by 2026 in a joint venture with mining operator LKAB, Nordic steel company SSAB, and energy company Vattenfall. GravitHy plans to open a hydrogen-based plant in France in 2027, and German steel giant Thyssenkrupp recently said it aims to introduce carbon-neutral production at all its plants by 2045.
These projects are set to boost Europe’s domestic production of green steel, and could soon have political backing too. The EU is in the process of finalising the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a strategydesigned to make it more expensive for European companies to import cheaper, non-green steel from other parts of the world.

Irish startup and CERN join forces on experimental energy transmission project,Thomas Macaulay,2023/04/24,"
An Irish startup has teamed with CERN to develop a new form of insulation for superconducting cables, which are designed to accelerate the green energy transition.
Named SuperNode, the company has invented energy transmission cables that can transfer immense power across long distances. As the system requires less space and voltage than conventional copper-based cables, the environmental impact is reduced.
These benefits derive from superconductivity. This phenomenon occurs when certain materials are cooled below their critical temperature — typically -180°C for high-temperature superconductors. As a result, superconductors can offer a hefty power density and zero electrical losses.
To harness this potential, SuperNode needs unique scientific resources — which is where CERN comes in.
“In its research, CERN pushes the limit of superconductivity to reach record energy levels and operates one of the largest vacuum systems in the world,” said CERN’s Paolo Chiggiato in a statement.
“In particular, to avoid collisions with residual gas molecules inside the accelerators, we must reach extreme levels of vacuum. Vacuum is also used at CERN as a thermal insulator for our superconducting magnets. We believe that this know-how can be successfully applied to evaluate the technological solutions proposed to insulate the superconducting cables developed by SuperNode.”
To test the tech, CERN will subject candidate materials to temperatures, pressures, and environments that replicate the conditions that the cables will face. CERN will also design and develop a novel test rig to validate scale prototypes. Eventually, the rig will be installed at SuperNode’s Dublin headquarters — dubbed the European Cryogenic Centre for Superconductors.
A study commissioned by SuperNode found that an integrated pan-European energy grid could reduce energy costs by 32%. Credit: SuperNode
The tie-up with CERN caps a busy month for SuperNode. Last week, the company announced that shareholders Aker Horizons and Dr Eddie O’Connor had committed €16 million of extra money towards developing the tech. The new funding followed a previous €14m cash injection made last year.
John Fitzgerald, CEO of SuperNode, believes adding CERN to the mix will provide a further boost.
“To meet increasing electricity demands, future transmission grids will have to reliably transfer bulk electricity over distances of hundreds of kilometres — connecting consumption hubs with areas of production, which are often located far away,” he said.
“We believe that by working together, we can find innovative solutions to improve the world’s energy infrastructure. Without new grid technology, we cannot integrate the level of renewables governments across the world have targeted and we will not achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement”.
SuperNode says its system is more efficient, cheaper, and better for the environment than any other viable alternative. Credit: SuperNode
The collaboration also comes at a historical moment for CERN. The lab has just taken its first steps towards building a 91 km-long particle accelerator. The new system would more than triple the length of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) — currently the world’s largest and most powerful particle collider — which will complete its mission around 2040.
The plans were revealed amid growing competition for Europe’s leading position in the field.
The most notable rival is China, which also intends to build the world’s largest particle accelerator. CERN’s Malika Meddahi told AFP last week that “China displays the same ambition” as Europe.
“Let’s be vigilant and be sure that we are not on the verge of a change in this hierarchy,” she said.
Some concerns have also been raised over the enormous cost of the new collider. Critics worry that the investment in fundamental science would be better spent in applied sciences. But the collaboration with SuperNode is further evidence that CERN’s work can lead to practical applications.

Icelandic startup bags €6M EU grant to fight drug-resistant infections,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/04/24,"
Reykjavik-based Akthelia Pharmaceuticals and the University of Iceland have been awarded a €6m grant by Horizon Europe to combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR). This occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites evolve and no longer respond to medicines, making infections harder to treat.
AMR is listed among the WHO’s most pressing health threats of our time, with the potential to give rise to the next global pandemic as “pan-drug”-resistant strains emerge. It’s also estimated that AMR associated infections already contribute to approximately 5 million deaths per year — more than AIDS/HIV or malaria.
Now, the EU-funded IN-ARMOR project, led by Aktelia and the University of Iceland, aims to tackle this challenge in collaboration with eight other universities and institutes and six companies across Europe.
The project’s aim is to develop a new type of drug that will boost the body’s natural immune response, also known as “innate immunity.” It will address infections caused by bacteria, viruses, and fungi.
IN-ARMOR will tap into Aktelia’s R&D on innate immunity and antimicrobial peptides – short protein chains that play a key role in the immune systems of mammals, including humans. The startup‘s work builds on the research of the University of Iceland, which is one the company’s owners.
The project will develop the new medicine using computer-aided drug design and in-silico approaches. It will harness nanotechnology to target drugs to specific areas within the body, extending their effectiveness and reducing side effects.
Upon completion, IN-ARMOR will move to clinical validation. The team hopes that the new drug could be used not only in combination with other antibiotics, but also by itself.
“By concentrating on stimulating the body’s innate defences against infection, we can avoid the use of traditional antibiotics and develop revolutionary new treatments to tackle multiresistant bacteria. This could save countless lives across the world,” said Guðmundur Hrafn Guðmundsson, professor at the University of Iceland and CSO at Akthelia.
If successful, IN-ARMOR would have the potential to save long-term €107 billion in antibiotics development. Furthermore, it would reduce the global disease burden by 97 million DALYs — the years of life lost due to premature mortality or the years lived with a disability as a result of a disease.

Reddit expands its European operation with a new hub in Amsterdam,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/04/20,"
Following its European expansion in Dublin, London, and Berlin in the past few years, Reddit is now opening its first regional sales hub in Amsterdam.
Centrally located in the wider European market, adjacent to countries with a strong customer base such as Germany and France, and breeding a competitive talent pool, the Dutch capital emerged as the perfect location to further drive the growth the US-based company has seen in Western Europe.
The hub’s mission is to bring together the platform’s EMEA markets in a central location and support a wide array of customers spread across Europe in meeting their advertising goals. It will house over 50 employees in sales and engineering, and serve as the home base for the EMEA Ads Engineering team as well.
According to Susanne Mostertman, EMEA Head of Mid-Market and Small Business (SMB) Sales, who will be leading the hub, the company plans to significantly growth both the sales and engineering teams by the end of 2023, and Amsterdam will be Reddit’s largest office in continental Europe by employee number.
“We know from our research that Reddit users in Europe are open to seeing ads or content from brands on the platform, and are more likely to trust a brand that participates on Reddit than brands they see advertising on other platforms,” Mosterstman told TNW. “By expanding our footprint in Amsterdam — and Europe more broadly — we’re able to better connect Reddit’s audience with brands they’re interested in and care about.”
This new chapter of Reddit in Europe, Mostertman added, enables the platform to focus on the teams and resources that can best attend to its advertisers in the region “with local and country-specific experts ready to provide tailored guidance.”
These efforts will not only support large advertisers such as Google, Warner Bros., and reMarkable, but European startups as well. The Amsterdam hub is already working together with a number of existing partners, including payment provider Klarna and refurbished device marketplace Back Market.
“Partnering with Reddit has allowed us to reach out to a wide variety of communities — from tech to fashion and everything in between — to encourage responsible shopping at the right time,” said Salah Said, Head of Sustainability at Klarna.
Reddit’s new European office will located in Amsterdam’s Plantage neighbourhood in the city centre. Hiring is still ongoing and the company plans to host a recruiting event later this spring.

European mission to explore the dark universe sets sail for launch site,Thomas Macaulay,2023/04/19,"
The European Space Agency (ESA)’s Euclid satellite has taken another step on its journey to explore the dark universe.
On 15 April, Euclid set sail for a port near its launch location in Cape Canaveral, Florida, the ESA announced today. 
The spacecraft is expected to reach the take-off site at the beginning of May. The launch is due to take place on a SpaceX Falcon 9 in July.
After lift-off, Eulic will travel 1.5 million km from Earth to the Lagrange point L2, an auspicious location for studying deep space. From L2, it will start investigating the dark universe.
ESA has grand ambitions for the mission. The agency wants to map the large-scale structure of the universe. It also aims to shed light on the power of dark matter and dark energy, which makes up an estimated 95% of the universe.
To delve into these mysteries, Euclid plans to create the largest, most accurate 3D map of the universe ever. The satellite will observe billions of galaxies up to 10 billion light-years away, covering more than a third of the sky.
The map will offer insights into how the universe has expanded, and how its structure has evolved over cosmic history. It will also reveal more about the role played by gravity, and the nature of dark energy and dark matter.

The prime contractor for Euclid is Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales of France and Leonardo of Italy. The company is one of Europe’s leading satellite manufacturers.
In total, more than 80 European companies are involved in the mission. They include Airbus Defense and Space, which built the telescope — the main instrument of the payload module.


“Every aspect of this project is a real challenge.

.
Before its journey, Euclid underwent a rigorous testing program at Thales Alenia Space’s Cannes plant.
“In recent months, we focused on the thermal vacuum, mechanical, and electromagnetic compatibility tests,” said Laurent Sanna, Assembly Integration and Test Systems Manager for Euclid in Cannes.
“Our main challenge was to perform these tests while staying on the tight schedule and accommodating changes in the baseline launcher. Because Euclid’s performance requirements are so demanding, every aspect of this project is a real challenge.”
After the tests, the satellite was sealed in a transport container, which was flushed with nitrogen to maintain a clean room environment. The temperature, pressure, and humidity will be monitored throughout the journey.
The satellite was then taken by convoy to the port of Savona, Italy. On arrival, it boarded a ship to Florida. From there, the journey into the dark universe will truly begin.

"European VC fundraising on pace for lowest total since 2015, study finds",Thomas Macaulay,2023/04/18,"
It’s been a tough start to the year for tech investments. According to a new report, European VC fundraising is on pace for its lowest annual total since 2015.
Research by PitchBook, a financial data firm, found that European VC funds raised over €20bn in each of the past four years — but only €3.4bn in Q1 2023. Total VC deal value fell 32% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) to €11.8bn. Deal count, meanwhile, dropped 19%.
Pitchbook called the quarter “the first substantial decline” from the pace set in the past four years.
“The VC ecosystem could finally be displaying the effects of the challenging fundraising conditions,” the study authors wrote. “Capital investment into startups has slowed, and if muted exits markets persist, returns will be stifled and long-term capital commitments could be harmed.”
The analysts found that exit activity had also plummeted. Amid adverse macroeconomic conditions and weaker valuations, substantial VC exits effectively ceased in Q1. Pitchbook expects the activity to remain quiet for the next few quarters.
In Q1, the preferred route to exit was via mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Four out of the five largest exits in the quarter were through M&A. Such exits tend to be smaller, but they offer increased security and synergies — which can be crucial for startups facing economic uncertainty.
Public listings, meanwhile, have lost appeal due to the dangers of choppy markets. According to Pitchbook, they’re unlikely to pick up until inflation cools, interest rate hikes cease, and business confidence re-emerges.
In Q1 2023, European VC activity generated only €1.6 billion in exit value — a 69.6% QoQ decline.
Pitchbook’s report echoes the findings of other analysts. According to research by Dealroom, just over 2,300 European funding rounds closed in Q1 2023 — the lowest number since 2016. 
The decline comes amid concerns over high inflation, monetary policy tightening, and the stability of the financial system. In these challenging economic times, investors and operators are prioritising capital efficiency and robust paths to profitability.
With focuses shifting from growth to cost bases, layoffs became extensive in Q1. Pitchbook expects this trend to continue as companies seek to extend runways during 2023.
Despite the gloom, there are signs of hope in emerging areas of tech. Notably, Europe surpassed the US in private spacetech investment during Q1, while quantum computing raised a continental record $220m, according to Dealroom. 
Pitchbook is also confident about the prospects for the resurgent energy sector. Near-term interest and long-term climate targets in Europe are creating new opportunities for backers and startups in the industry.
“We believe deal activity in the clean energy subsector will continue to grow as renewable energy sources are developed globally,” said Pitchbook’s analysts.

EU lawmakers fear AI is moving too fast — and call for global oversight,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/04/18,"
A group of 12 Members of the European Parliament working on the EU’s upcoming AI Act, are rallying for a set of preliminary rules to control the advancement of AI systems. They warn that technological progress is “faster and more unpredictable” than expected.
“The recent advent of and widespread public access to powerful AI, alongside the exponential performance improvements over the last year of AI trained to generate complex content, has prompted us to pause and reflect on our work,” state the MEPs in an open letter.
Correspondingly, they believe that a complementary series of preliminary rules is also needed to regulate the growth and deployment of “powerful” general purpose AI.
The signatories are, therefore, calling on European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and US President Joe Biden to hold a global AI summit where world leaders can decide on an number of governing principles that will steer the development and use of powerful AI, while ensuring it’s “human-centric, safe, and trustworthy.”
The MEPs are also calling on companies and laboratories working on the technology to demonstrate a high sense of responsibility, increase transparency, and collaborate with policymakers.
The letter lands at a time when individual EU members are already trying to manage the operation of advanced AI models  in lack of an overarching legislation. For instance, France, Spain, and Italy have opened investigations into OpenAI’s ChatGPT over data privacy concerns — with the latter even imposing a temporary ban.
The MEPs warn that political inaction “can widen the gap between the development of AI and our ability to steer it,” asking for the mobilisation of industry, research, and decision-makers in Europe and worldwide. But at the same time, the AI Act has been in draft form for nearly two years now.
According to Reuters, the act is currently being debated by a parliamentary committee, which hopes to reach a common position by April 26.
Concerns about AI’s exponential growth have been expressed across the Atlantic as well. In an open letter by the Future of Life Institute (FLI), over 26,000 signatories — including researchers at DeepMind, computer scientist Yoshua Bengio, and Elon Musk — have called on AI labs for a six-month pause in the development of systems more powerful than GPT-4, ChatGPT’s successor. 
And while the EU MEPs find a number of the letter’s statements “unnecessarily alarmist,” they agree with its core message: the rapid evolution of powerful AI requires political attention to prevent challenging future scenarios.

Mammoth meatball beef exposes foodtech’s patent problem,Thomas Macaulay,2023/04/6,"
A bitter feud has erupted over who first resurrected the woolly mammoth — as a meatball.
The de-extinct delicacy was unveiled last week at Nemo Science Museum in the Netherlands. Naturally, no mammoths were harmed in the making of this product — and nor were any other animals. In lieu of dead flesh, an Australian startup called Vow produced the meatball from DNA.
First, the team identified the DNA sequence for mammoth myoglobin, a protein that creates a meaty taste. To fill in some gaps in the sequence, they added genetic data from the African elephant — the pachyderm’s closest living relative. Using a low-current and high-voltage charge, they then inserted the gene into stem cells from a sheep. Finally, they multiplied and moulded the cells into a pasty.

It certainly looks the part, but did it pass the taste test? It seems an essential question, but it’s sadly one that remains unanswered. To the disappointment of daring diners, the meatball isn’t ready for human consumption.
That anticlimactic outcome sparked accusations that the whole endeavour was a publicity stunt. But the project team insists that their experiment serves an important purpose: showcasing cultivated meat’s potential to transform the food industry. They note that food production creates copious greenhouse gases and biodiversity loss. Cultivated meat, they argue, offers a sustainable alternative.
“Our aim is to start a conversation about how we eat, and what the future alternatives can look and taste like,” said Bas Korsten, a marketing executive who initiated the project. “Cultured meat is meat, but not as we know it. It’s the future.”
The meatball was created as a launchpad for the tech — and for Vow. With apparent justification, the company now claims it’s rewriting the rules of food. But a rival claims it’s also rewriting the rules of decency.

As Vow was being lauded in the Netherlands, a very different reaction was brewing across the border.
In Belgium, a scaleup called Paleo was considering legal action. The company was enraged by claims that Vow had showcased a mammoth protein for the first time.
Paleo argues that it developed the myoglobin tech two years earlier. The company had also filed patent applications at that time, which Paleo says have been publically available to competitors for almost a year.
Paleo contacted Vow before the event in the Netherlands. According to the Belgian scaleup, Vow’s legal team argued that the mammoth meatball “was not food” and dismissed Paleo’s claims.
“When we learned about the event, we were surprised,” said Hermes Sanctorum, CEO of Paleo. “We sent out a press release nine months ago to announce that we developed the exact same mammoth protein (myoglobin), based on our fundamental research and innovation.
“When Vow claim that no one has tasted mammoth myoglobin, this is simply not true. We developed the mammoth myoglobin and we tasted it in our lab.”

Vow has dismissed the allegations.
“The technology and innovation involved in Vow’s creation and presentation of the ‘mammoth meatball’ owes nothing to any technology or alleged invention by Paleo,” the company said in a statement.
“The ‘mammoth meatball’ was conceived, developed and created entirely by the hard work and ingenuity of Vow’s own scientists (and collaborators) and using a combination of publicly available genetic data and Vow’s own proprietary production processes.”
Paleo expressed some satisfaction with the response. The company said Vow had confirmed that it had not, in fact, showcased mammoth myoglobin for the first time. Nonetheless, Paleo feels that Vow crossed a red line — but the patents could prove difficult to enforce.

According to Vow, it has only been accused of adopting the idea of creating something with mammoth myoglobin. Vow argues that Paleo has no basis to claim that idea as its own. 
In addition, the startup notes that an examiner at the European Patent Office deemed Paleo’s patent application was likely invalid.  The Australian company described the application as an “attempted landgrab of outrageous proportions.”
“Patent rights exist in order to protect innovation and can (if granted and valid) protect truly new, innovative and proprietary ideas; but Paleo do not have any such patent rights,” Vow said in its statement. “Paleo has no granted patent in relation to mammoth myoglobin and therefore has no legitimate claim.”
Vow also criticised the pending application. If granted, the startup warned that the patent would prevent companies from using myoglobin from a wide range of animals — including pig, sheep, cow, chicken, tuna, and, of course, mammoth — as a meat substitute or food ingredient.
The feud will rumble on for now. Regardless of the outcome, the dispute has exposed the complexities of patenting food innovations.

Swedish startup unveils first ‘origami’ e-motorcycle — and €15K price tag,Thomas Macaulay,2023/04/4,"
What do you get when you mix motorcycles with origami? The answer, dear reader, is the Stilride 1.
The unique vehicle is the brainchild of Swedish startup Stilride. The company today unveiled the final design and price for the new electric ride, which is due to launch in 2024.
For €15,000, each customer will get a made-to-order motorcycle that combines looks, performance, and sustainability.
To manufacture each vehicle, Stilride uses a pioneering method dubbed “industrial origami,” which applies the Japanese art of paper-folding to sheet metal. The startup’s software first defines the geometries, which industrial robots and laser-cutting then bring to life. 
For the Stilride 1, the entire process requires a single sheet of stainless steel. As it’s folded instead of welded, minimal pollutants are produced.  To further minimise the environmental impact, the bike is produced locally from a small number of parts. It’s also lightweight, which reduces energy consumption.


“It’s been designed for both the motorcycle enthusiast and the design and sustainability purist.


 Tue Beijer, CTO and co-founder at Stilride, wants the bike to set “a new gold standard” for electric mobility.
“The Stilride 1 is the culmination of many years’ ambition, passion, and experimentation, distilled into a deliciously unconventional lightweight electric motorcycle that isn’t only a feat of engineering, but a work of art,” Beijer said in a statement. “It has been designed for both the motorcycle enthusiast and the design and sustainability purist.”
But does it pass the eye test? You can judge that for yourself in the gallery below:

The aesthetics modernise the previous design, which my colleague Ioanna compared to “an origami duck.” To my eyes, the new model looks more like the steel lovechild of a Vespa and an electric guitar. 
Regardless, looks aren’t everything on the road. In terms of specs, the Stilride 1 features an ultra-lightweight chassis made from recycled Swedish steel, a premium HUB motor system, single shock absorber and multi-link rear suspension, and a braking system that was co-developed with ISR. 
There’s also a compelling connectivity system. The motorcycle’s Electric Vehicle Control Unit (eVCU) powers various features through the Stilcontrol app, which provides theft protection, geographical positioning, service diagnostics, and battery status control. 
You can find further technical details in the image below:
The motorcycles will be built in Stilride’s Stockholm-based pilot production facility.
The specs and price are certainly eye-catching — but will they convince you to splash your hard-earned cash? Let us know via the usual channels.
If your answer’s yes, the launch date for the Stilride 1 will be announced this summer. And if you’re interested in early access, you can get more information on Stilride’s website.

Italy’s ChatGPT ban sets a worrying precedent for EU startups,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/04/4,"
OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which took the world by the storm after its launch in November, is now facing a temporary ban in Italy over “unlawful” personal data collection and the lack of an age verification system for children.
The Italian data protection agency, known as Garante, was prompted to act by ChatGPT’s data breach on March 20, which, according to OpenAI, allowed a number of users to see other users’ information, such as their first and last name, email address, and the last four digits of their credit card number.
Garante accused the US-based AI company of having “no legal basis” that justifies “the massive collection and processing of personal data” it needs to “train the algorithms on which the platform relies.” It also added that the lack of an age verification mechanism exposes children to “inappropriate” responses.
As a result, on Friday, the Italian regulator opened an investigation into OpenAI and has temporarily blocked access to GhatGPT in the country.
In response, OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altam tweeted that GhatGPT has ceased its services in Italy, stating, however, that he didn’t think the company had violated any privacy laws.

We of course defer to the Italian government and have ceased offering ChatGPT in Italy (though we think we are following all privacy laws).
Italy is one of my favorite countries and I look forward to visiting again soon!
— Sam Altman (@sama) March 31, 2023

Open AI has 16 days to respond with appropriate safety measures, or it could risk either a fine of up to €20 million or 4% of its total worldwide annual turnover.
Rising concerns
ChatGPT’s stirring capabilities are breeding growing concerns over the exponential advancement of generative AI.
In late March, the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) called for EU and national authorities to investigate OpenAI’s system.
“For all the benefits AI can bring to our society, we are currently not protected enough from the harm it can cause people,” Ursula Pachl, Deputy Director General of BEUC, said in a statement.
The organisation fears that until the union’s AI Act takes effect, consumers will be at risk of harm from a technology which is not sufficiently regulated, and for which they’re not prepared.
Across the Atlantic, an open letter signed by AI experts and industry executives called for AI labs to immediately pause for at least six months the training of systems more powerful than GPT-4, ChatGPT’s successor.
The signatories — including researchers at DeepMind, computer scientist Yoshua Bengio, and Elon Musk — highlighted the need for regulatory policies, stressing that “powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable.”
Tech industry opposition
The Italian regulator’s move to suspend access to ChatGPT could lead to a loss of economic opportunities in the country, Daniele Servadei, founder of Bologna-based SaaS ecommerce startup Sellix, told TNW.
“It limits the development and growth of the AI and tech sectors, preventing local companies from harnessing the technology,” he said.
Servadei further noted that the ban could have” a chilling effect” on AI development in Italy and beyond, “as developers and investors may fear future bans or restrictions on their products, which could hinder innovation and investment in the sector.”
Simone Basso, Chief Product and Technology Officer at Milan-based travel scaleup WeRoad, also stressed the potential negative impact on local businesses.
“ChatGPT has enhanced productivity for teams at WeRoad and worldwide, but recent decisions in Italy — from banning research on synthetic meat to holding back 5G rollouts — have hindered the country’s technology, innovation, and productivity growth,” Basson told TNW.
Basson added that while consumers can circumvent Garante’s restrictions using a VPN, companies with solutions based on such technologies “face uncertainty” and will be forced to prioritise other markets.
Is Italy setting a precedent for Europe?
While ChatGPT was already unavailable in mainland China, Hong Kong, Iran, Russia, and parts of Africa, Italy is the first Western country to take action against the AI system.
Germany could soon follow Italy’s lead, Ulrich Kelber, the German data protection commissioner, told Handelsblatt.
Meanwhile, authorities in France and Ireland are in contact with the Italian regulator, Reuters reports.
“We are following up with the Italian regulator,” said a spokesperson for Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner. “We will coordinate with all EU data protection authorities in relation to this matter.”
The regulators’ concerns about ChatGPT — along with its popularity, as the fastest-growing consumer app in history — singal the need for co-ordinated and transparent EU policies that regulate the use and development of large language models.
It’s still unclear how ChatGPT and similar models will be impacted by the EU’s impending AI Act, which aims to strike a tricky balance between safety and innovation.

Spain launches space agency in big boost for local startups,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/04/4,"
Spain has officially launched its own national space agency, at a time when Europe looks to establish itself as a global space industry leader.
Plans for the Spanish Space Agency, or Agencia Espacial Española (AEE), were first announced in May 2021, and finally got the political thumbs up last month.
The agency will be based in Seville, near the Arenosillo launch facility in Huelva, which was built in the 60s as part of a collaboration between the Spanish government and NASA. Initially, around 75 personnel will be based at the site. 
The agency will serve to “guarantee Spain’s strategic action in the field of space, both from the point of view of its technological development and the use of space in areas such as security, Earth observation, geolocation, and telecommunications,” according to a statement from Spain’s Ministry of Science and Innovation. 
“Space is a priority and strategic area, essential to help and protect our society in fields as diverse as cybersecurity, navigation, the fight against climate change, or the monitoring of phenomena such as drought or fires,” the statement continued. 
Minister for Science and Innovation, Diana Morant, has allocated the new agency an initial budget of more than €700m in 2023. 
The minister has also made €45m available to fund the development of a domestic microlauncher. This class of launch vehicle, Morant said, is “the commercial future of the space sector.” 
Currently, the most likely contender to receive the funding is PLD Space. Founded in 2011, the Spanish startup has developed a suborbital microlauncher, named Miura 1, that will be capable of delivering commercial payloads to space and back. It is set to launch as early as this month.
Spain has a long history in the space industry. It is one of the founding members of the European Space Agency (ESA) and has a thriving spacetech ecosystem. As of 2019, 12% of the total 400+ investors in the global private space industry — dubbed ‘new space’ — were based in Spain.
In addition to frontrunners PLD Space, startups to watch include Barcelona-based Zero 2 Infinity, which has developed a balloon-borne launcher, Madrid-based ienai GO, a space industry software provider, and Bilbao-based SATLANTIS, which is developing AI-enabled payloads for microsatellites. 
The launch of the Spanish Space Agency is undoubtedly a major boost to these startups and the country’s spacetech industry as a whole, and comes as Europe looks to catch up with the US, Russia, and China in the global space race.

Meet the finalists of the TNW València startup pitch battle,Thomas Macaulay,2023/04/2,"
Some of Europe’s hottest startups arrived at TNW València last week to develop ideas, expand networks, create new leads, and — and most importantly of all — fight.
Not in the physical sense, of course, but in a fiercely-contested TNW València pitch battle. After surviving a series of fiery knockout clashes, eight of Europe’s most electrifying startups were selected for the contest final on Friday.
València provided the perfect stage for the showdown. The region is Spain’s fastest-growing entrepreneurial ecosystem, with the most startups per capita in the country.  It was also bathed in glorious sunshine — but this was no vacation for the contenders. With thousands in attendance, an all-star jury on the front row, and a springboard to success on the line, the stakes were high for all the startups.
To the victor goes an array of spoils, including a 4 square-meter turnkey booth at TNW Valencia 2024 and two business passes for TNW Conference in Amsterdam on June 15-16. But best of all the prizes — and I say this without a scintilla of bias — is a full feature on TNW’s wonderful website by our marvellous media team.
Before we reveal the winner, here are the eight elite finalists who pitched for first place.
Internxt

Many of today’s biggest internet companies are essentially data mining companies. Google, for instance, generates over 80% of its revenue from advertising, which it amasses by leveraging user data for ad targeting.
Internxt has created an alternative model: data storage that respects user privacy.
The València-based startup provides an end-to-end encrypted cloud storage service, which means nobody can see your files. Founded in 2020, the company has positioned itself as a privacy-centric competitor to Google Drive.
“We provide an easy way to manage, share, and store user data in a completely private way,” says Joan Mora, head of data and analytics at Internxt.
Users can get 10GB of free storage. If they need more, premium subscriptions that provide from 20GB to 2TB are available for as little as low as €0.89 per month.
Sophie’s Bionutrients

Sophie’s Bionutrients has reimagined protein production. It’s the first company in the world that uses microalgae to develop 100% plant-based and sustainable alternative protein.
The microalgae is cultivated inside bio-reactors and harvested within days. This rapid process also minimizes the quantity of energy and water that’s required.
Both the idea and name for the company came from the daughter of Eugene Wang, the co-founder and CEO of Sophie’s Nutrients.
“Sophie is allergic to shellfish,” says Wang. “That’s how the whole thing started — I was looking for a way for people to get nutrition from the ocean without using the animals.”
The startup began life in Singapore, before moving its headquarters to the alt-protein hotspot “Food Valley” in the Netherlands. Wang now plans to take the product around the world, in a B2B business model that will first target small and medium-sized food manufacturers.
CAPS
CAPS wants to make urban flights a daily routine. Credit: CAPS
CAPS is developing a product that seems futuristic: an urban aircraft for single passengers. Yet the company expects the tech will soon be available to the public.
“My strong belief is that you will be experimenting with flights in urban areas within the next 10 years,” says Paul Cass, CEO of CAPS. “For that to properly be done, it has to be quiet, safe, and affordable.”
The startup’s founders got the idea after growing sick of their long commute to college. In a garage, they began to assemble a more convenient alternative: a flying car.
Their concept evolved into a driverless aircraft for single-passenger trips in urban areas. Both small and entirely-electric, the vehicle is built for a quiet flight with optimum security. In case of technical trouble or emergencies, a professional driver in the company’s operating centre can remotely control the aircraft.
CAPS  is confident that the design offers the safety, affordability, and practicality needed for mass adoption. With the world’s electric air taxi network scheduled to launch in 2024, the vision could be closer to reality than it first appears.
Wenalyze

Wenalyze is on a mission to protect SMEs, which represent 99% of all businesses in the EU.
In tricky economic times, these companies face mounting challenges. Insurers can provide a safety net, but bad information is reducing the security. According to Wenalyze, insurance companies have 47% of their data wrong, leading to underinsurance and premium leakage.
The Spanish startup wants to reduce the risks. The company uses open data analytics to correct, update, and enrich SME information. As a result, insurers, banks, and financial institutions can offer their clients the right coverage.
To access the enhanced insights, users only need to enter the name and address of the SME. Wenalyze’s system will then analyse open data sources and deliver real-time results.
“By protecting SMEs, we protect our economy,” says Carlos Albo, CEO and co-founder of Wenalyze.
Therminer

Amid a global energy crisis, the vast electricity consumption of data centres has become a pressing concern. But even greater harm to our climate comes from heating, which comprises half of the world’s total energy consumption. That’s roughly the same imapct as electricity and transportation combined.
Therminer has created a system that addresses both concerns: a cooling solution for servers that reduces their energy consumption and recycles the wasted heat to warm buildings.
According to Gonzalo García, CEO and co-founder of Therminer, the system cuts 95% of the energy consumed to cool servers — and recycles 90% of the heat they release. “Our competitive advantage from the data centre perspective is that we can reduce operational costs and our data centres are more sustainable,” he says.
From its base in València, Therminer produce the hardware, installs it in homes, and manages the data centre services. The initial target for the system is single-family homes.
“They can use our waste heat and we can create a decentralised network of data centres and then sell hosting power,” says García.
Chaise Longue
Affordable comfort is an elusive pleasure on flights. Credit: Chaise Longue
Flying economy is rarely a pleasurable experience, but Chaise Longue believes comfort doesn’t have to cost a fortune — and has the chair to prove it.
The Madrid-based startup has created a double-decker airplane seat configuration. The design increases comfort, reduces cabin weight, and provides at least the same passenger capacity. Best of all, it’s made for economy class.
The extra space comes from maximising the cabin’s verticle volume. Overhead luggage compartments are removed, with bags instead stored in bays under seats. The result is bigger recline angles, extended leg room, and more overall space.
The modular structure is designed for swift integration into existing aircraft. According to Alejandro Núñez, Chaise Longue’s founder, CEO, and designer, most leading airlines are interested in the system — and planes are just the start.
“We are also moving into other industries such as trains, buses, and ferries — for the lowest class and for the cheapest tickets,” says Núñez. “We are trying to improve that experience for everyone.”
Nightstream

Twitch enjoyed explosive growth during the pandemic, and still consistently doubles its pre-COVID audience numbers. Many advertisers, however, remain wary of entering the market, which can appear too large and complicated. Nightstream wants to help these brands to grow alongside smaller streamers.
The startup found that brands currently use just 250 streamers to advertise. That means that oer 1.5 million daily viewers — and 95% of streamers — are being overlooked. Nightstream’s software is designed to capitalise on these opportunities.
The company’s tools and services allow brands to connect with streamers that will reach their target audience. Streamers, meanwhile, get the chance to build their audiences, earn money, and win prizes.
Brands are given data dashboards and analytic tools to analyse the performance of each player in the ecosystems. Nighstream also picks moderators for each streamer and brand, which further strengthens the partnership. To increase the streamers’ audiences, the startup rewards viewers as they become part of the communities.
“With our API and software, they can develop and connect directly with brands that don’t have enough money to connect with the biggest streamers,” says Luis Ruiz Climent, co-founder of Nightwatch.
Crowmie

Crowmie has invented a unique approach to sustainability: the first investment platform in tokenised renewable energy projects.
The concept aims to turbocharge the adoption of renewable energy, while democratising investment in the sector. At present, the vast majority of the market is controlled by large energy generators, which are financed by the traditional banking system. Crowmie allows the public to make their own contributions — and get returns.
After registering, the user can invest a minimum of just €100 in any asset on the platform. The user receives tokens in return. These entitle them to monthly rents for the electricity generated and sold by the energy project. Users can also sell the tokens to another investor at any time.
The investment is used to build facilities that produce electricity. Once built, the projects generate renewable electricity that’s sold to the grid. Profits from this sale are distributed among investors according to the number of tokens they hold.
“We have completely changed the way of investing in traditional assets, accelerating the energy transition, supporting the business fabric, and allowing anyone in the world to invest from just 100 euros,” says Fernando Dávila, CEO and co-founder of Crowmie.

The conversations covered everything from funding secrets to sector spotlights, across keynote speeches, startup battles, panel discussions, workshops, fireside chats, and much more. Too much in fact to attend it all  — but don’t worry, we’ve got you covered. Read on for a few highlights.
MC Oison Lunny speaks to a packed audience at the Impact Stage on Day 1 of TNW València
Our MC for the event, the award-winning Oison Lunny, kicked things off with a call for connections across València’s tech sector. “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. If you want to go fast AND far, go as part of an ecosystem,” he said. 


 “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. If you want to go fast AND far, go as part of an ecosystem. 

   
After the opening speech, a battle ensued between Valencia’s most promising startups. There were some seriously impressive pitches, and the winners will now face-off at the finals tomorrow.   
The winners from today’s startup battles will go head-to-head at the finals tomorrow.
The role of ecosystems was a recurring theme on day one. Phill Robinson, the CEO of Boardwave, explained how Europe can replicate Silicon Valley’s famous network effects, while Erwin Verstraelen, digital chief at the Port of Antwerp-Bruges, divulged why he founded ‘The Beacon’, an IOT ecosystem of startups, scaleups, and researchers, to boost innovation.
Many of the startups in attendance harbour plans for global expansion, but the conference speakers stressed that they need local roots. At a talk titled, “Going global: a VC’s guide to preparing for international investment,”  Vanessa Palmer of CaixaBank DayOne said startups need people “working on the ground in that country who understand that market.”

The balance was succinctly summarised by one of the contenders in the startup pitch battle.“Our base is in Spain, but our focus is global,” said Mario García-Granero, CEO and co-founder of Feending.
Amid the rush to innovate and grow, attendees of the event frequently expressed the importance of the tech for the good — particularly around sustainability. “We need to speed up,” said Raquel Espada, sustainability lead at Schneider Electric in Spain. We don’t have time. Climate change is happening, there’s a wildfire near here right now and it’s 30 degrees [centrigrade] in March.” 
No doubt one of the most inspiring moments of the day came when endurance athlete and Barcelona ambassador Alex Roca took to the stage to share his unique perspective on persevering against the odds.

Stockholm is a world-class tech hub: 6 startups and scaleups to watch,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/03/30,"
Once predominantly known for IKEA, Ericsson, and Volvo, in the past decade, Sweden has emerged as one the most valued tech ecosystems in Europe, with Stockholm ranking as the fifth top performer in 2021.
The success of Swedish startups such as Tink and Spotify has turned the capital city into a world-renowned tech hub, attracting the attention of international investors — and for good reason.
Stockholm is home to nearly 3,000 startups and scaleups, and counts 208 VC investors and 101,000 tech employees.
The city has also bred more tech unicorns per capita than any other region in the world except for Silicon Valley — that is, 0.8 per 100,000 inhabitants. Some of those unicorns include the buy-now-pay-later fintech firm Klarna, lithium-ion battery developer Northvolt, and e-mobility provider Voi.
Stockholm’s fertile landscape reflects Sweden’s overall growth in the tech sector. Last year alone, the Nordic nation not only retained its place as the EU’s best-performing innovation leader, but also emerged as Europe’s fourth top ranking country in VC funding per capita, reaching $540 (€504).
To get a closer look at the city’s thriving ecosystem, we’re zooming in on six trailblazing local startups and scaleups.
Let’s dive in.
Exeger
Founded in 2009 by Giovanni Fili, the Swedish deeptech scaleup has developed a unique solar cell, Powerfoyle, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing devices and convert all forms of light to virtually endless energy.
Unlike typical solar cells, Powerfoyle is a silicon-free technology, and thanks to a special dye, it absorbs indoor and outdoor light through a process called artificial photosynthesis.

For Fili, who has a multi-year background in entrepreneurship and the commercialisation of high-tech innovations, looking into the everyday applications of solar power was a natural step.
“We realised after a few years that this had a huge potential because we can screen print this solar cell, which allows a free-form design with different shapes, colors, and textures,” Fili tells me.
Now, 14 years later, Exeger has raised over €180 million across 12 funding rounds, counts more than 200 employees, and owns two solar-cell factories in Stockholm.
Currently, the Powerfoyle is integrated into a range of products, from bike helmets and remotes to headphones such as the Urbanista Los Angeles, the Urbanista Phoenix, and the Adidas RPT-02 Sol.

According to Fili, it’s all about providing consumers with energy independence, while also increasing product sustainability and reducing battery or cable waste.
For Exeger, Powerfoyle’s flexibility and customisable nature means the sky is the limit. The company recently secured a partnership with SES-imagotag to provide an alternative source of power to the electronic labels and IoT devices the company supplies to retailers. The scaleup envisions further applications for its technology in consumer electronics, IoT, and smart workplaces.
Sesamy
Sesamy was co-founded in 2021 by Måns Ulvestam, Karl Rosander, and Markus Ahlstrand — the same trio that founded Acast, the global podcast giant.
Sesamy also operates in the digital media realm, but with a focus on news and magazine content. The company targets publishers who want to offer their readers an option to purchase a single article as a complement to subscriptions.
“Our mission is to enable people to actually pay for good quality journalism, while helping publishers increase their incremental revenue,” Ulvestam tells me. And based on the company’s data, consumers are willing to pay on average €2 per article.
In case a reader purchases three or four articles from the same outlet, Sesamy’s Smart Software can identify whether it would cost them less to become a subscriber and prompts them accordingly, driving further engagement. “Some of the data we have so far are very encouraging; 5.5% of the readers buying a single-purchase article then become subscribers,” Ulvestam notes.

The startup counts eight publisher partners so far, boasting three big Swedish outlets: Breakit, Kvartal, and Nyheter24. Currently, Sweden is the company’s focus market, being “at the forefront when it comes to thinking about how to monetize news,” co-founder Karl Rosander says. Nevertheless, Sesamy is looking into expanding into other European countries as well.
Sesamy’s current business focus is to engage with as many outlets as possible in order to collect enough data on publisher revenue and consumer behaviour and thereby further develop its software — and, in time, for instance, suggest dynamic pricing based on the articles’ length, exclusivity, etc.
Apart from the pay-per-article option, the startup’s software platform offers various interchangeable web components including the integration of services such as payment methods, third-party webhooks, and social media login.
In November, Sesamy raised €3.3 million during its second seed round, bring its total to €7.3 million.
X Shore
The award-winning electric boat manufacturer aims to facilitate the transition to maritime emobility by combining Scandinavian design with technology, innovation, and sustainability.
The startup was founded in 2016 by one of Sweden’s best-known entrepreneurs, Konrad Bergström, but has been reinvented since 2019, when Jenny Keisu took over as CEO.

For Keisu, who has an extensive background in business law and impact investing, achieving price parity with fossil fuel-powered boats while offering high-performance vessels is key to the industry’s net-zero transition. And that’s what X Shore set out to do.
In September 2022, the company launched its second model, the X Shore 1, following the release of its first commercial boat, the Eelex 8000, in 2020. Both models come with a modular design for increased functionality and can be configured with various layouts that accommodate activities from fishing and diving to watersports and socialising — thus reducing the need for multiple boat ownership.
X Shore’s vessels also feature smart boating capabilities, including overboard detection, navigation, and range estimate. This is combined with a respective app and a special captain’s watch — a smart watch which can be used as a remote key to unlock the boat and  as a “person over board” detector. 
The Eelex 8000 is powered by a 170kW electric motor, comes with a 100NM range, and can reach a 30+ knot top speed. Credit: X Shore
Compared to the Eelex 8000, which costs a little over €300,000, the X Shore 1’s price starts at €99,000 — the average cost of a vessel in its category. “Within 48 hours after its launch, we sold out all boats that we could produce in the first half of this year, and we’re also sold out for 2023,” Keisu explains.
The X Shore 1 is powered by a 125kW electric motor, comes with a 50NM range, and can reach a 30 knot top speed. Creidit: X shore
Driving down the price enough to engage with a larger customer base — while maintaining sustainability — was the result of two factors: an EV-oriented design from the outset and in-house production.
The startup manufactures the hull and does the assembly using largely automated processes at its factory in the city of Nyköping, which leaves only the battery and electrical components to be sourced overseas.
X Shore sells its boats in Europe and North America, which currently represents its bigger market. For operators of multiple vessels, it also offers a Fleet Management System for connected X Shore boats. The startup raised almost €50 million in its latest funding round.
Alight
Alight is a leading Nordic provider of solar power-as-a-service, co-founded in 2013 by Dr Harald Overholm, Richard Nicolin, and Wilhelm Lowenhielm. The scaleup develops, owns, and operates solar projects for businesses that want to switch to renewable energy.
Alight helps companies cover their energy needs either with offsite installations in the form of solar farms, or with onsite installations of panels on rooftops, parking lots, or unused land. The scaleup provides energy through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) — fixed term contracts at a pre-negotiated price lasting between 10 and 20 years.
The company’s decision to focus on commercial solar stems from two reasons, according to co-founder and CEO Dr Harald Overholm. First comes the fact that 70% of power worldwide is used by companies. Second, the trio was inspired by the US market, where solar-as-a-service first got traction in the commercial and industrial segment, and shortly after in the residential.

“We had some sort of base hypothesis that commercial solar was a pretty good place to start,” Overholm says. “And we think that the European market is now moving very quickly towards us because government incentives are being rapidly scaled down.”
Alight is developing more than 1 gigawatt (GW) worth of PPA-based projects across Sweden, with a further 170 megawatts (MW) under development across the rest of Europe. It also handles Sweden’s largest operational solar park to date, and is set to have an installed capacity of at least 5GW by 2030. Some of its clients include Toyota, Swedbank, and trading company Bixia.

But the road to success has been no bed of roses.
“People could not understand why we started the company when we did so,” Overholm explains. “And it was also horribly difficult to find investors,” he adds, citing a lack of interest in impact and sustainability projects at the time.
“So when, in 2022, we raised €150 million in equity, with an additional €20 million to €30 million coming in [from] buying out secondaries from previous investors, it was insane.”
Prior to that the company had done two funding rounds — following an initial angel capital injection — raising €2 million in 2015 and €5 million to €6 million in 2019.
Now, Alight is also developing co-located battery storage to mitigate solar power’s intermittent nature and enable its further rollout.
Milkywire
At the age of 31, marketing veteran Nina Siemiatkowski decided to pursue photography in Kenya, where she witnessed first-hand the hurdles local organisations were facing to secure funding and resources in their efforts to address pressing environmental issues.
Siemiatkowski decided to build a company that solves this problem and founded Milkywire in 2018.
The startup provides a smarter and more efficient solution to environmental, cause-driven donation, connecting vetted impact organisations around the world with companies and individuals who want to offer support, but are unsure how to donate effectively.
‘Initially, when I founded Milkywire, the idea was to connect the platform to consumers directly,” Siemiatkowski tells me. “But a year and a half ago we completely pivoted as a business.” Since then, the startup has been implementing a B2B2C business model.

Milkywire’s platform enables companies to take responsibility for their environmental footprint and make a positive contribution by financing high-impact initiatives beyond their immediate value chain. Businesses can select organisations from five different causes, such as wildlife and climate transformation.
The platform also offers transparent and traceable reporting of the companies’ donations and impact metrics, which can be used to engage stakeholders and customers. To facilitate that, Milkyware provides integrated tools that enable customers to contribute to the same causes.
The startup currently counts numerous partner companies, including Klarna, PANGAIA, and Footway. To date, it has raised $25 million (€23.5 million) in donations.
“The timing couldn’t be better for us,” Siemiatkowski says. “There’s massive demand for sustainability solutions and, from what I know, we’re sitting with a quite unique solution.”
Doconomy
Founded in 2018 by Mathias Wikström and Johan Pihl, Doconomy has merged climate tech with fintech, and is on a mission to help banks, brands, and consumers to better understand their environmental footprint through financial transactions.
Since launching the world’s first transaction-based footprint calculator, Doconomy has been building a global ecosystem, with its technology used by Mastercard and world leading banks such as BNP Paribas and Nordea — which translates to over 850 million potential end-users across 30 countries.
Driven by the aim to inspire consumer behaviour change and encourage them into a more sustainable lifestyle, the founding duo was interested in the credit card as an everyday tool that’s connected to consumption patterns.

“We looked at how environmental data could be presented in a tool that you’re willing to use every day, and that, in the end, would motivate behavioural change,” Pihl tells me.
The result was Doconomy’s core solution, a cloud-based environmental impact index (Åland Index), which enables CO2 and H2O calculations for all digital financial transactions.
The Åland Index is complemented by a set of other digital tools, such as the Lifestyle Impact Calculator, helping individuals assess their footprint based on lifestyle choices, and the Product Impact calculator, which enables brands to calculate their products’ CO2 footprints. The startup also offers the DO mobile banking service, which allows consumers to manage their finances and everyday climate action.

Thanks to its data and the ecosystem it’s built, Doconomy has created a standardised language around how impact is measured. But using this language to drive consumer engagement and, in the end, behavioural change, remains “as tricky as ever,” co-founder Mathias Wikström says.
Doconomy is now focusing on achieving exactly this and believes that its recent acquisition of financial well-being fintech startup Dreams Technology will play an integral role in that objective.
What’s the secret to Stockholm’s success?
Stockholm has several unique and powerful ingredients that stimulate startup growth.
For Alight’s co-founder Harald Overholm, the city breeds a culture of entrepreneurship, while a strong network of entrepreneurs, mentors, and angel investors can provide guidance.
The collaboration and advice of like-minded entrepreneurs and expertswas also pointed out by Milywire’s founder, Nina Siemiatkowski, and Sesamy’s co-founder, Karl Rosander, who also added access to capital as an important element of the ecosystem.
“I think collaboration is closer at hand in Sweden than in many different markets,” Mathias Wikström, Doconomy’s co-founder and CEO, says. “There’s a strong social security network, a strong trade labour union, [and] a strong industry and trade labour union agreement dating back to the 40s and 50s. We’re not keeping our success close to our chest. We’re rather sharing it with many, I think slightly more than in other parts of the world.”
Swedish mentality plays a vital role for Johan Ekelin and Christian Ihre — co-founders of Lynxeye, a Stockholm-based strategy consultancy supporting companies in transformative shifts, which has been part of the ecosystem since 1999.

“We’re a bit of a caring nation, you could say, with a more human-centric mentality,” Ekelin tells me. “We want to find solutions to problems, and we try to democratise the offerings, and that’s good for innovation,” he notes, adding that Sweden is characterised by “a high level of social consensus.”
This, according to Ihre, stems from a simplistic survival instinct, the need to “stick together,” due to the country’s weather and climate conditions. Much like the Vikings created their own infrastructure webs and ecosystems, modern society has another kind of ecosystem, where companies, institutions, government, and people know they need each other to survive. “This has transcended our culture for millennia,” Ihre notes.
But this doesn’t mean that Sweden’s business sector is closed within itself. On the contrary, Ekelin believes that creating international brands and companies is one of its biggest strengths.
“Being a small country means that there’s a small home market, so you have to look openly for other opportunities around the world and be informed about what’s going on outside of Sweden.”

How an outsider’s freedom can make a successful startup founder,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/03/28,"
Building a startup in a sector you’ve never worked in might seem a risky move, but it can actually provide a competitive advantage.
That’s certainly proven true for Vivino. Founded in 2010 in Copenhagen, the scaleup has raised $221 million in funding, and become the world’s most downloaded wine app and largest online wine marketplace, with a community of 50 million users.
This success came despite an unconventional background. Vivino’s cofounders didn’t come from a place with a rich history of wine, and neither of them had previously worked in the sector.
For Heini Zachariassen, co-founder of Vivino, and founder and host of Raw Startup, coming from outside the industry adds a big advantage. “You’re free to do whatever you want in any way you want,” he tells TNW.
So how does this freedom translate into founding and scaling a successful startup?
The first important aspect is the ability to bring a fresh perspective to the market, which enabled Vivino to help a customer segment that the industry was neglecting: wine lovers who don’t know much about wine.
Vivino supports these users with crowd-sourced data. When they take a photo of a bottle of a wine label, the app can show them ratings, reviews, and average prices for the bottle.
“If you’re in the industry and somewhat set in your ways, you can have a lot of baggage that influences the decisions you make,” Zachariassen, who will be speaking at TNW València on March 30, says.

The outsider’s position allowed Vivino to steer clear of industry politics that can apply pressure towards a certain direction, or certain standards to live up to.
“We didn’t listen to the industry. We didn’t listen to the wine experts. And we purposely didn’t do so,” Zachariassen explains. “Because we’re not building the product for those two groups. We’re building it for the casual wine drinker.”
This played a pivotal role in product development and design. In its beginning, the scaleup focused its resources on how to solve a specific problem for a specific user group, and how to create a good product to do so.
“This initially left the design looking scrappy,” Zachariassen says. “And that was fine for us. But that’s harder to accept if you don’t have freedom. If you have three generations of winemakers looking at you, for example.”
Having the flexibility to prioritise problem-solving and substance over style in the beginning was also beneficial for the company’s resource management.
“When you build a startup, it’s all about resources, right? Design was always a priority for us, but we didn’t want to do it upfront because we also knew it could kill us,” Zachariassen notes.

At the same time, the freedom to fully focus on a specific target group and think outside the box led to an innovative solution: a user-friendly wine rating system.
The typical rating of wine is based on an 100-point system, which for the scaleup’s team wasn’t relatable to non-experts. “Vivino is not for someone who has a wine cellar. It’s for someone who has five bottles on the kitchen table,” Zachariassen says.
This led Vivino to implement a five-star rating system. As this scale is used in most popular rating apps, the company felt it would be easy for everyone to understand.
There’s also a personal element to Vivino’s success. While Zachariassen was an outsider to the industry, he was an insider to the problem; he was the actual future user. “And that’s probably the key if you’re an outsider, really understanding the problem you’re trying to solve.”

6 biggest tech nightmares to avoid next time you travel abroad,Ebony-Storm Halladay,2023/03/28,"
Drop me on a Balinese coastline with a decent paperback and my smartphone, and I’ll luxuriate for two weeks straight.
But fly me out to the same spot with a Nokia 3310 and a physical map, like the one my dad used to carry, and I’ll probably have a nervous breakdown.
Most of us can agree that we’re hyper-dependent on tech, especially when we’re navigating a new place abroad. And the further or more remote you go, the more likely you are to run into tech breakdowns that can put a damper on your plans to wander freely.
From racking up hidden costs to avoiding embarrassing gaffs, here are some of the top tech nightmares when traveling and how to avoid them on your next trip.
Free to roam… Or not
We’ve all been there. You forget yourself for one minute and enable your data to look something up: “best restaurants in Tel Aviv,” “fastest flight from Bangkok to Chiang Mai,” or “how to dress for Scottish weather.”
Five minutes later, you’ve racked up a hefty roaming charge. Ouch.
While some networks let you roam freely, others aren’t so generous. Before launching his alternative activewear brand, Rusty Martin spent some time travelling by skates. And subsequently paid a small fortune for it.
“I landed in Vancouver after an eight-hour flight and met some local in-line skaters,” Rusty tells me. “When I got back to my mate’s place, I had a bunch of notifications. I’d left my data on, and racked up about £70 in charges.”
Wait! It gets worse: “I didn’t pay the bill for over a year,” Rusty admits. “I was kinda like fuck the corporations, I don’t owe them. I didn’t even actively use my data, I’d just left it on. It all felt very unfair. But then they send debt collection agencies after you and ruin your credit rating.”
Always check your data plan (and your data settings), before you catch your flight. Or better yet, invest in a data plan that has your back.
Travel tech company Holafly eSIM provides eSIMs for people who want a steady and reliable connection without roaming charges. They offer regular data plans in over 130 countries, unlimited data plans in over 45 destinations, and even for entire regions like Europe. So, if you’re on a trip through Europe, instead of buying a plan for each country, you only will have to pay one time to get coverage in various countries. And because it’s a digital SIM, you can activate it in a matter of minutes by scanning the QR code sent to your email. Easy peasy.

Testing local limits
With internet censorship on the rise, don’t be surprised if your beloved apps and websites don’t work in other countries.
Srishti Verma got caught out in Vietnam when she was conducting research on reproductive health and rights for a non-profit based in Atlanta.
“The website loaded at first, but it didn’t work properly. The navigation was poor, things wouldn’t load, and it was affecting my research”, Srishti shares. “No access to related websites had me thinking something was wrong with my internet connection.”
Fortunately, Srishti’s pal reminded her to use a VPN, and all was not lost. But there are plenty of other countries where this solution would have fallen flat on its face. VPN bans and limitations are widespread in countries such as China, Turkey, and the UAE.
With a smartphone tucked neatly in our hands, it’s easy to forget not all countries have the same level of tech freedom.
All WiFi is good WiFi (just kidding!)
WiFi access is so ubiquitous that the thought of being without it is practically unbearable.
Michelle Coulson felt something similar on a recent trip to Portugal. As a digital nomad who helps people get remote jobs, her work was rudely interrupted by a lack of connectivity.
“We’d just gotten to a campsite and discovered there was no WiFi. We couldn’t find a shop open to get our mobile data topped up either — so we ended up driving miles to McDonald’s to use their crappy WiFi!”
At times like this, public WiFi is a godsend. But there’s a catch, often in the form of sacrificing a few personal details to log on. We all crave internet connection, but sometimes a public fix just isn’t worth the risk.
Crafty hackers can create doppelganger WiFi networks that look just like legitimate ones. So while you’re mindlessly scrolling, they’re scrounging for your account details. It’s an easy way to get your identity stolen — or the contents of your bank account.
You don’t even have to leave the airport to find trouble. According to a study by Forbes, 40% of respondents have had their data compromised while using public WiFi — with airport and restaurant WiFi posing the greatest threat.
If you’re using shared or public WiFi, find someone who can confirm you’re on the right network and call on your trusty VPN for an added layer of protection. Keep in mind that, if you’re connecting to a WiFi you don’t know, you also won’t know how they’re going to use the data collected during the session.
To ensure you have coverage without having to mess with dodgy free WiFi hotspots, check out Holafly’s guide to eSIMs.

Adaptors, voltages, and avoiding electrocution
No one wants to watch the light die on their phone screen before making it to the hotel. Forget your travel adaptors and this is the reality.
There are 15 electrical plug types, so make sure you find out which ones you’ll need for your destination country. Type C covers most of Europe (aside from the UK, Ireland, Cyprus, and Malta). But you’ll only get away with using type I plugs in Thailand.
Traversing multiple countries? Get yourself a universal adaptor. And try to find grounded ones — this will lower your risk of getting electrocuted if there’s an exposed wire in your gadget.
Most modern devices have variable voltage, so using them in a range of countries probably won’t get you fried. Gadgets that are designed to be portable — like smartphones, tablets, and laptops — usually have variable voltage. Shavers, hairdryers, and electric toothbrushes tend not to be, so make sure you check the specs on your devices before packing them.
Be prepared to power down 
Was the sun just turned off forever? Or did you get caught in a power cut? I’m guessing the latter.
Power cuts will increase as the climate crisis worsens. And even paradise isn’t immune from a little lights-out action.
Georgie Darling is a digital nomad and travel writer who spent the first seven months of the pandemic stuck on the tiny Indonesian island of Gili Trawangan.
Due to the size and position of the island, Gili is prone to earthquakes and power cuts. Often at the same time.
“They were such a part of my daily life that the only reaction to the ground shaking was an ‘earthquake?’ message in our group chats,” Georgie shares.
“I got caught out a few times when client calls fell around the same time as the earthquakes and power cuts,” Georgie admits. “I quickly learned to keep my laptop and phone fully charged.”
For added protection, arm yourself with an eSIM (as mentioned above) and a couple of power banks. The Zendure Supermini is pocket size but packs a powerful punch. If you need something more heavy-duty, pick up the ZMI PowerPack 20000 — it’ll charge your phone and your laptop via a USB-C connection. And make sure you give clients and loved ones a heads-up about outages when possible.
“It made a good talking point with clients”, Georgie says. “Especially when I told them that the phrase for ‘power cut’ in Bahasa Indonesia is ‘mati lampu’, which directly translates to ‘death to the light.’”
Don’t get lost in translation
Where the risk of embarrassing yourself is low, translation apps can get you out of a pickle. Like checking the menu for meat-free options, or decoding the signs at a train station.
But bad translations can have awkward consequences. If you arrive in France and need a lawyer (un avocat), you could end up asking for an avocado instead (also un avocat). Oops.
Promising research on using Google translate in emergency departments showed that 82.5% of the translations retained their meaning. But results vary significantly between languages, which is a problem if you have sensitive information to share.
The best way to avoid translation app fails is to use them cautiously. Don’t count on them saving your bacon every time — and do some practice on Duolingo before you jet off.
So if you’re not quite ready to trade your smartphone in for a map book, don’t forget to pack your virtual suitcase before setting out on your next globetrotting adventure. Handy travel tech tools like an international eSim, VPNs, and portable power banks will make all the difference when you’re trapped in paradise without a connection (your Insta followers and mom will thank you).

7 unmissable highlights of TNW València,Thomas Macaulay,2023/03/25,"
Ladies and gentlemen, the moment has almost arrived: TNW València is next week! 
In case you’ve been living under a rock (or frequenting another tech site, you traitor), we’re taking our cherished festival on the road. After 16 glorious years in Amsterdam, we’re bringing the show to Spain’s Mediterranean coast — and you’re all invited.
We’re not only there for the sun, sea, and sand — far from it, in fact. València has the fastest-growing innovation ecosystem in Spain, and the most startups per capita in the country. On March 30th and 31st, we’ll showcase the best tech in the region to over 2,000 guests. 
Across the two days, attendees will enjoy inspirational talks, networking events, learning opportunities, and the same festival vibes as our Amsterdam flagship. The entire editorial team will also be there, awaiting your company, ideas, and, of course, abuse.
València is one of the world’s most exciting tech hubs.
In total, we’re hosting over 100 speakers, 75 investors, 90 exhibitors, and 3,000 meetings. Admittedly, this has created one big problem: you simply can’t catch them all. To help find your way through the jam-packed agenda, here are eight highlights at TNW València.
1. The official opening ceremony and party
While the main agenda kicks off on March 30, the fun starts a day earlier, at our opening party.
Our guestlist contains a range of political heavyweights. They include Diana Morant, Spain’s Minister of Science and Innovation; Sandra Gomez, Deputy Mayor of València; Arcadi España García, Minister of Finance of the Generalitat Valenciana; and Borja Sanjuán, Vice Mayor of Economic Development at the City of València.
Join them (and us) for drinks, bites, and networking from 19:00 at Zeus València. To register for the party, click here.
2. A game of padel
The opening party is one of 10 side events, offering a healthy mix of learning, networking, and partying. On March 31, you can even join a padel tournament at the València Tennis Center. I’ll be waiting on the court, so you better bring your F-game.
3. Unmissable speakers
We’ve assembled a dazzling array of keynote speeches, fireside chats, panel discussions, and workshops. With more tech luminaries than a PayPal reunion, it’s hard to rank the speakers — but here are five of my favourites:
Heini Zachariassen, Founder and CEO of Vivino
Zachariassen built the world’s most-downloaded wine app and largest online wine marketplace. His company has made wine more accessible — and I speak from experience. My use of Vivino has become alarmingly frequent, but at least it’s finding me quality plonk at bargain prices.
Our speakers will shine lights on sustainability, AI, deep tech, and much more.
Katica Roy, Founder and CEO of Pipeline Equity
An award-winning economist and former Global 500 executive, Roy founded Pipeline Equity in 2017. At València, she’ll discuss how to close the innovation gap.
Miguel Ángel Leal, Chief Technology and Innovation Officer at LaLiga
As a digital chief at LaLiga, Ángel injects innovation into a  legendary football league. His role combines the best of both tech and sports, which sounds like a dream job for me — other than my position at TNW, of course.
Jen Carter, Global Head of Technology at Google.org
Carter leads the pro bono initiatives at Google.org, the Big G’s philanthropic arm. Having spent six years at the organisation, and a decade in Google’s Trust and Safety team, Carter has a unique understanding of using tech for good.
Alex Roca, Ambassador at FC Barcelona
It’s not only tech leaders that are taking the stage. One of our most intriguing speakers is Alex Roca, who recently became the first person with a 76% physical disability to complete a marathon. At TNW València, he’ll give his first public speech since achieving the feat. 
4. The FT Power Hours
Our beloved overlords at the Financial Times are bringing their best brains to València. At a series of sessions dubbed FT Power Hours, they’ll discuss tech’s hottest business trends with industry leaders.
5. The Startup Pitch Battle
It’s not all fun and games. While we don’t condone violence at TNW, we do love a pitch battle — and this one’s sure to be fiery. Some of the world’s most exciting startups will be presenting their ideas to our distinguished jury.
The startup stakes will be high.
The challengers will compete for the attention of top investors, a collection of prizes, and — most importantly of all — a profile by your favourite editorial team. I mean us, by the way.
And if you need to sharpen your skills, check out the startup pitching workshop at 12:30 on Thursday.
6. A ride on the TNW Ferris wheel
It wouldn’t be a TNW festival without our cherished Ferris wheel. As well as offering fun rides and stunning views, the carriages are the perfect place for private meetings — partly because your interlocutor can’t leave.
7. A stroll through the business floor
Our exhibition floor has racked up a vibrant mix of ideas and products.
The 92 organisations in the business hall encompass big brands such as Mercadona, Hubspot, and Helloprint; Valencian tech players like Sesame HR, Social Nest, and Delivers.AI; and government agencies including Spain Up Nation, Valencia Activa, Generalitat, Invest in Valencia.
There’s a lot to see, but our floor plan can smooth your route through the space.
The arena is dotted with stages, exhibitors, and lounges
I could go on and on, but my schedule is already bursting at the stems. Hopefully, these seven tips are enough to help you enjoy the festivities.
If they’re not, feel free to give me feedback at the bar. I’ll have an Aigua de València, por favor.

Europe’s ports are using tech to navigate ‘the perfect storm’,Jill Petzinger,2023/03/10,"
Cargo ports are vital transport hubs in the world economy. Around 90% of all globally traded goods by tonnage is transported by sea and in 2021, a whopping 3.5 billion tonnes of freight passed through EU ports alone.
Antwerp was the second-largest port in Europe — spreading across 120km² — before a merger with Bruges in 2022 created a combined port area of 160km² and the biggest chemical cluster on the continent. 
València’s expanding port is the largest on the European Mediterranean in terms of container traffic — and dates back to 1491. Its port authority, Valènciaport, is responsible for València, plus Gandía and Sagunto ports along the coast.  
Ahead of their talks at TNW València in March, we spoke to Erwin Verstraelen, Chief Digital and Innovation Officer at the Port of Antwerp-Bruges, and Juan Manuel Díez, Strategy and Innovation Director at the Port Authority of València, about how they are pursuing the newest advances in tech to transform their ports.
“Ports are not just logistics hubs, they’re also becoming the industrial and energy hubs for Europe as part of the European Green Deal, so we are in a complete transformation of our core activity and digital innovation plays a significant role in that,” Verstraelen told TNW. 
Verstraelen was appointed CDIO at Port of Antwerp-Bruges in 2017.
Ports ecosystems are facing what Verstaelen calls the “perfect storm” at the convergence of geopolitics, digitisation, mobility, sustainable growth, and the energy transition.
Zero-emissions
“We have a very ambitious goal: we want to be carbon neutral in 2030,” València’s Díez told TNW in his office overlooking the cargo terminals. “Already all the electricity that is consumed in the port comes from renewable sources — we buy it with this condition – but we have our own plans to produce electricity here in the port.”
València’s 300-plus annual days of sun will be put to good use, with the first of three solar plants in the port already launched. Gandía is on track to become the first energy self-sufficient European port, according to Díez.
“We have been thinking for many years now about installing windmills in our breakwaters but the technology wasn’t there,” said Díez. “Now it is advancing and we have plans for our own wind farm in the coming years.” 
Díez has spent over 12 years working for the Port Authority of Valencia.
The new cargo terminal in the port of València will be 98% electrified and the remaining 2% will use hydrogen, he added, making it “the most sustainable terminal in Southern Europe for sure.”
Getting to zero emissions means mobilising the whole port community. Valènciaport recently launched a pioneering project to test the use of green hydrogen for moving machinery inside the port, with an H2 storage tank and mobile hydrogen generator. The next stage will be to test hydrogen-powered prototypes of a container stacker and tractor.
Digital twins
Access to instant information is essential for ports. Both Antwerp-Bruges and València are investing in sophisticated “digital twins” of their port areas.
In València, the digital twin includes a Port Collaborative Decision Making (Port CdM) System, which could reduce a ship’s average call time by 10%. 
The digital twin of the Port of Antwerp-Bruges is a virtual copy of the port area with real-time information.
“Arrivals in a port are not on a precise clock, but by having and using timely information, the port can prepare in advance, e.g. by letting a ship know there is no mooring available at that moment so it can slow its speed, use less fuel, and reduce emissions,” said Díez.
The Port of Antwerp-Bruges is one of the first in the world to have a digital twin of its territory, according to Verstraelen. 
“By equipping the entire port area with sensors, cameras, drones, we create a digital nervous system on top of the physical port,” he said. “And if you bring all these data feeds together in what we call a digital twin, the people responsible for safety and security will be positioned or alerted if something is taking place in the port the moment it happens and can act immediately upon it.” 
Sensors monitor the port’s air quality to detect not just CO2 and other gas emissions but also volatile organic compounds like benzene and toluene — vital intelligence considering the size of the Antwerp-Bruges chemical cluster.

Once an air quality monitor triggers an alarm, different data sources offer information on wind speed and direction to indicate where an emission is coming from, and the location of ships in the port based on their automatic identification system (AIS) tracker. The data is then filtered to show tankers and turn cameras in the direction of the emission. 
“In real-time, you see that there is for example an illegal or an accidental degasification of a tanker ship taking place,” Verstraelen said.
By applying algorithms to AIS data, they not only create situational awareness but also prescriptive awareness about something that will need looking at from a safety, security, or operational perspective. 
The last step will be predicting what will happen a few hours ahead and acting on it in terms of allocating tugboats and pilots, knowing how the wind is going to change or if a storm is coming.
‘Outside-in’ innovation
All this innovation is a springboard for fresh ideas. As well as being an active member of Spain’s Ports 4.0 initiative with its €20 million equity fund, València has its own acceleration/incubation program, Opentop. The program, which works with startups focused on many aspects of port operations, will also be exhibiting in the València Ecosystem Pavilion at TNW València.
One of the young startups the port collaborates with is We Are Lab. The company has been developing ways to plant Posidonia, a Mediterranean seagrass that is tricky to grow but awesome for capturing CO2 from the ocean. Posidonia in the port breakwaters can be used to clean the surrounding sea.
Zeleros, the València-based Hyperloop scaleup, is also a partner, and currently trialling a test track in Sagunto to move cargo around the port in an emission-free way.

Up north in Antwerp-Bruges, Verstraelen explains that when it comes to fostering innovation, he cultivates a “what if” mentality, opening up the port as an ecosystem for “outside-in” innovation.
“We decided to open up the port as an innovation platform, inviting promising technologies to come and demonstrate their added value, and allowing them to make themselves market-mature faster,” Verstraelen said. 
One of the noteworthy startups backed by Antwerp-Bruges in 2018 to work on barges is remote-piloting technology startup SEAFAR. The largest concentration of barges in Europe is in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany and they account for around 40% of all cargo passing through Antwerp-Bruges.
However, with older barge captains retiring and fewer new ones replacing them, the time was ripe for a big change. In light of these trends, the port went “all in” to enable the four-person startup to demonstrate that its tech could remote-pilot one of the port’s ships.
“As a consequence of that they got permission from the regional government to operate ships in a commercial way the year after,” said Verstraelen. “Today, SEAFAR is 30 people, there are barge owners building new ships to be remotely piloted, and they are sailing around commercial cargo with ships that are operated from more than 100 kilometres away.”
A remote pilot, who can handle three or four crafts at the same time, means a reduction in labour costs and more on-board cargo space as there’s no need for living quarters. 
Drones and spills
In terms of new tech, Antwerp-Bruges puts the emphasis on proof of value rather than proof of concept. Service drones are a good case in point as the size and complexity of the port makes it the perfect test ground. 
The idea to have multiple automated drones simultaneously airborne over the port, performing oil spill and litter detection, asset management inspection, and supporting police and fire brigades had been germinating since 2018. However, there was no existing legal framework and it was forbidden to operate automated drones beyond visual line of sight in a no-fly zone like a port.
By demonstrating proof of value and relevant use cases, the government agencies were finally able to okay them and develop legislation for their use in the port.
“We are the fifth largest bunkering [supplying fuel for ships] port on the planet and you can imagine that accidents do happen,” Verstraelen said. “It’s important once we spot an oil spill to see where it is floating and how big it is if we call in the specialised services to clean it up.” Thanks to drones, these teams know what they need to do and what kind of equipment they need before they leave.
The drones have cameras that supply live feeds to central control, and the port is also developing algorithms that can detect spills in the camera feed. “You don’t want a ship going through an oil spill, because then it becomes polluted and it takes the entire thing with it,” Verstraelen said.

Tech is evolving so fast that “the biggest mistake you can make is to say we tried it in the past and it didn’t work,” according to Verstraelen. “If something doesn’t work now, try it again in six months, 12, 18, and 24 months from now.”
He points to speech-to-text AI, which the port tried to use a few years ago to translate very high-frequency (VHF) radio communication between ships. The team hoped to mine the data for sentiment analysis indicating a potential conflict between captains, but the tech wasn’t ready for the task.
“We tried it a month ago, again, with the same sound file… and it was 95% spot on. So in less than two years, it went from completely useless to completely and utterly usable on a daily basis.”
Both ports reflect the leaps that authorities are making to modernise, tackle climate goals, and prepare their ports for the future.
Their efforts are already reaping impressive results. Verstraelen describes his port’s ecosystem as “the most impressive innovation breeding ground I’ve ever seen in my entire life.”

10 trailblazing Valèncian startups to watch in 2023,Jill Petzinger,2023/03/3,"
València’s tech ecosystem is growing and maturing at a brisk pace. Founders, investors, and business leaders in the city are unanimous that this region in Spain will cement itself as a tech hub to be reckoned with in the coming years.
Names like Flywire, Fever, and Jeff are well-known, but there are tons more Valèncian startups and scaleups making waves at home and abroad. Ahead of The Next Web’s first conference in València on the 30th and 31st of March, we’re zooming in on 10 noteworthy local startups, selected by TNW and its key strategic conference partners: Lanzadera, Marina de Empresas, and Startup València.
Let’s dive in.

Can AI make better art than humans? We asked IBM’s Seth Dobrin,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/03/2,"
Artificial intelligence has been infiltrating every industry and the world of arts and culture is no exception. In other words, AI art is poised to explode.
AI text-to-image generators such as DALL-E or Midjourney have been creating remarkable visual artworks. ChatGPT has taken the world by the storm with its ability to answer questions, write essays, and summarize texts, among other things. AI-generated art is even being displayed at world-renowned museums.
These examples show just how powerful generative AI can be and bid this pressing question: is AI about to replace human artists?
Seth Dobrin, IBM’s first-ever Global Chief AI Officer, has an answer. We caught up with him at TNW Conference 2022 and talked about the potential of computer-created art.
If you’d like to get his predictions in full, check out the video embedded at the top of this article. Alternatively, you can watch it right here.
AI-generated visual art already exists in various forms. There are examples of artists — such as Refik Anadol — who are the actual creators, but use artificial intelligence to augment their artworks. There are also tools like DALL-E which “are getting there,” although it’s difficult to say whether their works are truly indistinguishable from humans’.
Dobrin has a similar view on news articles, noting that financial news is already being automatically generated to an extent. And while he doesn’t believe that AI-generated text is as engaging as a writer’s would be, he explained that GPT-3 and Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate stories that journalists can use as a starting point.
But when it comes to movies and novels, AI has a longer way to go. That’s because “AI needs to truly learn emotion, really be able to simulate it, and invoke empathy — better than it can today,” Dobrin said. He expects five more years for novel creation, and between five to 10 years for movie production.
But what’s Dobrin’s prediction on classical music? And does he believe that AI will merely augment humans in the creative process — or eventually replace them?

Insect farming startup targets pet food as gateway to human consumption,Thomas Macaulay,2023/03/1,"
Evolving views on food are challenging traditional diets — and not just for humans. Innovative dining options are also being added to the menus of our pets.
Startups have proposed numerous new ways to satiate their appetites. The UK’s Bella and Duke, for instance, caters to animals on raw diets, while Sweden’s Buddy Pet Foods serves natural dry food, and Portugal’s Barkyn personalises their grub.
If none of those excites their palates, our furry friends could try a more avant-garde delicacy: insects.
That’s what’s cooking in the kitchen of FlyFeed, an Estonia-based startup.  The company has developed an automated farming system that turns fly larvae into animal feed. 


“It’s challenging for humans, but a no-brainer for animals.


Arseniy Olkhovskiy, who founded FlyFeed in 2021, said the concept emerged from research into malnutrition. He concluded that insect farming can provide an affordable and sustainable solution to protein shortages. But he plans to feed animals before approaching humans.
“It’s challenging in human food right now, because people don’t really want to eat something connected to insects — but it’s a no-brainer in animal feed,” Olkhovskiy told TNW.
The 24-year-old rattles through a lengthy list of benefits of farming insects: they’re fed reprocessed waste that would otherwise rot in dumps; they grow up to 100 times faster than conventional animal food sources; they’re rich in high-quality nutrients; their production costs are minimal; and they require far fewer environmental resources than traditional agriculture.
Olkhovskiy promises they’re also highly palatable for pets. He says that his own cat is a fan of the flavours.

FlyFeed is not the first startup to turn insects into pet food. Ÿnsect in France has spent over a decade producing ingredients from mealworms, while Jiminy’s in the USA processes protein from crickets. FlyFeed uses another insect: black soldier flies. 
This species has several attractions. The larvae can convert organic waste into edible protein for animal consumption and fertiliser. They’re also suitable for wet food, high in various nutrients, don’t transfer diseases, and have a fast growth rate.
The insects will be reared on agricultural leftovers in vertically-stack crates, which reportedly require 100 times less space than soybean or livestock farming. The facility will also harness data-driven climate control to optimise conditions, and computer vision to monitor the larvae development.
Vertical farming was chosen for its scalability. Credit: FlyFeed
Protein from the farm will be incorporated into comestibles. FlyFeed plans to deliver the first commercial batch of the product next year. Annually, the company aims to convert 40,000 tonnes of waste into 17,500 tonnes of insect products. The output will be split between proteins, fats, and fertilisers. 
If all goes well, the early produce will provide a stepping stone to human consumption. 
“First, we need to scale it,” said Olkhovskiy. “We need to make it cheaper, we need to make it of standardised quality, and we need to also bring it to markets where people actually need it.”

According to Olkhovskiy, other insect farming startups have struggled to market their food to humans. He’s chosen to instead focus on the operational and technological challenges. Once they’ve been overcome, Olkhovskiy plans to distribute the produce in countries where malnutrition is most critical. He expects to drive adoption through a low price point. While a kilo of protein from cheap chicken broilers goes for 4$, he says, a kilo of FlyFeed protein costs under 2$.
In Europe, however, the low prices are yet to create demand. According to a 2020 EU report, only 10% of Europeans are willing to swap meat for insects.
There are, however, signs that attitudes could change. A study published last December found people were more open to eating insects after learning about the environmental benefits.
Regulators are also starting to embrace the possibilities. In January, the EU approved the sale of house crickets and larvae for human consumption.
Still, it seems unlikely that we’ll all be eating flies in the near future. But perhaps our pets can convince us to give them a try.
"
Will non-linear work days be the new hybrid working?,Aoibhinn Mc Bride,2023/02/28,"
For a long time, the concept of work-life balance felt like an unattainable myth; all it took was a global pandemic and the ensuing government-enforced lockdowns to show employers that their staff could work remotely and still get the job done.
In fact, studies show that remote employees work more hours overall than those based in an office for part or all of the week—remote workers put in an extra 8.7 hours per week on average compared to their office-based colleagues who average 6.5 extra hours.
Post-pandemic a vast number of organisations have come around to the idea that flexible working conditions should be a permanent fixture.
And research shows that adopting a more flexible approach to where we work has not only improved work-life balance, but our mental and physical wellbeing too.
However, for some remote workers, real flexibility doesn’t pertain to physical location only. There’s an increasing shift towards non-linear or asynchronous working styles, which essentially allow remote workers to work on their own schedule, instead of following the traditional 9-5 model.
What is a non-linear work day?
The premise of a non-linear workflow is simple: remote employees focus on outcomes rather than the tasks they must complete by a certain date or time, for example hitting weekly or even monthly targets, or driving revenue per quarter instead of focussing on projects or a daily workflow.
Why are some employees seeking it?
From the parents who wish they had more time to spend with their children during the day to the marathon runner who needs to train for up to three hours, non-linear work allows employees to segment their days, manage their own schedules, and fit work in around the things that matter to them.
Neurodiverse workers may also benefit; those with ADHD often find they are most productive at night, and therefore sleep later in the morning.
What are the pros and cons and which companies are open to change?
The benefits of non-linear work are manifold: not only does it empower employees to work when they’re most productive, it gives team members the autonomy to do so. And while some employers might baulk at the idea of giving their staff free rein, non-linear work can make teams more efficient, allow employees to thrive and frequently show more dedication and discipline towards their work.
However, there are some challenges that can’t be overlooked. Non-linear work requires organisation and communication, especially if teams need one member to complete a task before another can start their piece of the work. There’s also the danger of disengagement, something that all remote workers can struggle with when they don’t see team members face-to-face on a regular basis or by having regular check-ins.
The good news is that many organisations are already leaning in to the idea of non-linear work and for good reason: according to a recent study, 37% of European employees are prepared to decline a job if flexible hours are not offered, and just over two thirds (69%) would accept a pay cut in exchange for flexible hours.

New sensor promises to bring ‘true colour’ to smartphone photos,Thomas Macaulay,2023/02/27,"
In the fiercely contested smartphone market, photography can be a key battleground. Alongside the insatiable desires for better batteries, durability, storage, and processing, camera quality consistently ranks as a key factor when choosing a phone.
At CES 2023, Spectricity, a startup based in Belgium, unveiled a new entrant to the competition: the S1 chip. 
Spectricity claims the S1 is the first truly miniaturised and mass-manufacturable spectral image sensor for mobile devices — and the company is targetting sector dominance. Within two years, Spectricity boldly predicts the sensor will be inside every smartphone.
The bullishness derives from a singular focus: measuring “true colour” in smartphones. According to Spectricty, this is something that even the best smartphones still can’t do. 
The problem stems from shortcomings in their white balance software, which is used to remove unrealistic colour tones. Our natural vision system does this remarkably well. When we see a white wall under sunlight or a fluorescent lamp, our brain adjusts the colour temperatures to make both scenes appear white. Smartphones attempt to do the same thing, but the results are often disappointing.


“None of these cameras can recognise true colour.


Limited by the three RGB colour channels of red, green, and blue, their auto-white balancing algorithms struggle to correct unnatural colour temperatures. As a result, photos taken under incandescent bulbs can appear more orange than under sunlight, while shady areas can look bluer.
“Even though there’s a lot of processing power behind these cameras, none can recognise true colour,” Spectricity CEO Vincent Mouret tells TNW.
To resolve this issue, the S1 sensor uses additional filters to analyse the spectral signature of an object. After sensing the light source in an image, the system corrects the colours accordingly.  
Mouret (left) was CEO of several semiconductor startups before joining Spectricity founder Jonathan Borremans’ (right) team.
Spectricity showed TNW the effects in a live demo. Under different lighting conditions, the pictures produced by the S1 were compared to photos taken by high-end smartphone cameras.
Although the results of demos aren’t always replicated in reality, the colours rendered by the S1 appeared far more consistent under diverse illuminations.
“With our solution, you can have the same colours whatever the lighting condition,” says Spectricity application engineer Michael Jacobs.
Spectricity expects the first smartphones with the S1 to be released in 2024.

The ambitions for the sensor extend beyond better photos. As the S1 can capture the full visible and near-infrared range at video rates, the imager could enhance numerous mobile applications. Spectricity envisions using the sensor for remote cosmetics, e-commerce, ID verification, skin-health analysis, and even smart gardening.
A key component of these plans is the S1’s improved rendering of skin tones. Smartphone cameras are notoriously bad at capturing darker skin, which limits the inclusivity of photos. It also inhibits any apps that use skin analysis, from melanoma detection to virtual makeup. 
The S1’s recognition of darker skin could broaden access to the benefits.
Biomarker analysis can be incorporated in personalised skin care.
Smartphone giants are also ploughing fortunes into colour fidelity, but Specriticity says they still can’t compete with the S1 sensor. This confidence emanates from a long and narrow scientific focus. 
Spectricity began life as a spin-out of the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre (IMEC), a research lab for nanoelectronics and digital technologies. This connection has helped the startup amass 19 granted patents and 66 active applications, as well as 13 PhDs in their team. 
To commercialise the innovations, Spectricity has set up a high-volume manufacturing line at the X-FAB foundry — which is now ready for mass production.
The S1 is currently under evaluation by major smartphone makers. Amid a global decline in mobile sales, Spectricity is betting that the sensor offers them an irresistible edge.

What the Mesopotamians can teach us about ChatGPT and the impact of new tech,The Conversation,2023/02/27,"
Adapting to technological advances is a defining part of 21st-century life. But it’s not unique to us: it’s been part of the human story since our earliest written records – even featuring in the plotlines of ancient myths and legends.
While ChatGPT threatens to change writing (and writing-related work) as we know it, the Mesopotamians, who lived 4,000 years ago (in a geographical area centred in modern-day Iraq), went through this kind of seismic change before us. Their civilisation is credited with the invention of writing.

Living in changing times
Just two months after launching in November 2022, OpenAI’s ChatGPT has already reached an audience of over 100 million people.
The large language model (LLM), sometimes called “autocomplete on steroids”, has drawn attention for its capacity to create human-like answers to queries. Its work has received passing grades on university law and business exams, and been used in a Colombian court to help decide a legal ruling.
Responses to ChatGPT and its competitors have vacillated between recognising the potential risks of the chatbot and extolling its possible benefits. We’re flooded with theories on how new advances in AI may change how we work, study and live.
Ancient Mesopotamia was home to many of civilisation’s early developments. Its people were world leaders in adapting to technological and cultural change.
Mesopotamians invented the wheel and agriculture, and pioneered advances in mathematics, urbanisation and transportation. These breakthroughs are reflected in cuneiform literature, one of the oldest known forms of writing.
The history of cuneiform writing is complex, but it seems to have initially developed to record economic data, such as debts that were owed. Over time, however, the Mesopotamians widened their use of signs inscribed into clay tablets to record a variety of information, in numerous languages. New uses covered everything from diplomatic correspondences to omen texts, to some of the world’s oldest literary masterpieces.
Tech-assisted heroes
In the world’s earliest known written epic, Gilgamesh, the eponymous hero is shown inventing and using technologies, such as diving weights and a sail, to further his journey to the edges of the world – and beyond.

Mesopotamian epics feature numerous battles, some using technology such as advanced weaponry. Wikimedia Commons
As noted by Assyriologist Andrew George, the young hero develops new technologies to help his quest for fame and immortality. These advances allow him to engage in previously unknown activities, such as sailing and deep-sea diving.
Another royal hero from Mesopotamia, Lugalbanda (sometimes known for his super speed) is also credited with technological advancement. Lugalbanda improves the technique of fire-starting by using flint to spark embers and bake bread. The heroes’ use of new tools emphasises their exceptionalism.
Inventions and ambiguity
Mesopotamian epics don’t present cultural and technological advances as unambiguously and uniformly beneficial. In Gilgamesh, the benefits of civilisation and urbanisation, such as advances in wall-building technology, are juxtaposed with their costs – such as environmental destruction and alienation from the wild.
Indeed, the epics often represent new technologies being harnessed in the service of human conflict – and disproportionately serving the interests of those with high social status. In the Sumerian epic Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta, the heroic king defeats his enemy by inventing and using superior technology: the ability to write on clay tablets.
This invention is also thought to be referenced in the Epic of Sargon, where Sargon appears to dodge a murder attempt through his epic reading skills. The text notes that while writing on tablets had been developed at that stage, the use of envelopes to hide their contents had not (perhaps luckily for Sargon).
In some ways, the representation of new technologies in cuneiform literature echoes contemporary concerns about AI: fears of increasing social inequalities and its potential use in cyberwarfare.

The future of history
Studying the past can deepen our understanding of how humans have adapted to modern technology over thousands of years. Conversely, modern technology continues to broaden our understanding of history.
In recent years, AI – the newest form of writing – has been used to decipher the oldest: cuneiform literature. The Fragmentarium project, for example, uses sophisticated algorithms to determine which fragments of shattered cuneiform texts belong together; these algorithms predict the text that once filled the missing sections.
AI will likely continue to alter the way historians analyse the past. This will require new considerations around familiar issues – such as how to represent the past accurately in light of possibly biased evidence, and the need to critically evaluate sources of information.
In the broader field of academia, the boundaries of how AI may be used have not yet been clearly explained. In January, for example, a top international AI conference banned the use of AI tools for writing scientific papers – though its use in editing papers was accepted.
Considering the limits of technology
Even those early tech adapters, the Mesopotamians, ran into problems the technology of the day could not address.
Climate change is thought to have resulted in the downfall of the Akkadian Empire, sometimes called the world’s first multi-national political entity. And even the crafty Gilgamesh couldn’t escape his own mortality.
Humans have been grappling with how to invent, use and adapt to technology since our earliest civilisations. In Mesopotamian epic literature, new technology helps heroic individuals travel beyond accepted limitations and develop new skills. But the technology and resulting knowledge are not always evenly distributed.
Knowing how we adapted to changing technology in the past helps us more fully understand the human condition – and may even help us prepare for the future.

Plan to build UK’s first battery gigafactory falls out of British hands,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/02/27,"
Britishvolt, a prominent UK battery startup, had generated enthusiasm over its plans to build the country’s first battery gigafactory. But after filing for administration in January, it has now been bought by Australian firm Recharge Industries.
Launched in 2019, Britishvolt had planned a £3.8 billion battery plant near the Port of Blyth in Northumberland, promising 300,000 batteries per year, the creation of 3,000 direct jobs, as well as a significant boost to the region’s economy and the UK’s production of EV batteries.
Despite gaining a funding pledge by the government and partnering with major companies like Aston Martin and Glencore, in January, the startup filed a court notice to appoint administrators, after failing to secure sufficient funding. Consequently, Britishvolt terminated its employees, the plant’s construction was halted, and no commercial battery was ever produced.
Now, battery maker Recharge Industries has won the bid to buy Britishvolt out of administration. The Australian startup is owned and run by a New York-based investment fund, Scale Facilitation.
“Our proposal combined our financial, commercial, technology, and manufacturing capabilities, with a highly credible plan to put boots and equipment on the ground quickly,” David Collard, founder and CEO of Scale Facilitation, said in a statement.
As he told the BBC, Britishvolt will maintain its name, but will follow a different direction. It will now focus on batteries for energy storage with the aim to commercialise them by the end of 2025.
This leaves the UK with only one existing battery plant, next to the Nissan factory in Sunderland. The plant is owned by Chinese company Envision AESC.
But it’s not just takeovers by overseas companies that threaten the UK’s plans to build a competitive battery production sector. According to 2022 EU data, some 20 battery gigafactories are being developed across the bloc alongside 111 industrial battery projects.

These are the next 6 industries that are ripe for tech disruption,Emily DSilva,2023/02/17,"
When it comes to investing in innovation, certain industries have flourished over others. Those that haven’t are now facing a do or die situation to keep up with the demands of a modern society, the ever-prominent concern around the climate crisis, inflation issues, and an aging population.
Looking at the global stats Tracxn collected from 230+ sectors between 2013 and 2023, it’s clear which industries — education, hospitality, agriculture, industrial manufacturing, real estate and construction, and commercial airline — have fallen behind, received less funding and seen less successful startups being founded. Whether it’s been down to high costs, difficulty in securing funding due to risky innovation and uncertain ROI, or other financing issues, these industries will require more of a focus moving forward.
As our colleague Arno Nijhof, who leads the company’s innovation arm TNW Programs explained, the move towards more circular and transparent sustainability practices, plus recent supply and demand issues have put increased pressure on many of these industries to adopt new solutions now:
Corporate innovation is more and more focused on providing a positive impact on the world with many looking for new solutions to decarbonize and, at the same time, build a more resilient supply chain. TNW Programs works with a lot of parties, corporates, and companies to identify these opportunities by scouting and analyzing new technologies, startups, and markets. The world is asking for change and its new technological developments that will create the solutions we need to reach those goals.
Here’s a closer look at the industries in question, together with some of the startups challenging the status quo.
Education
Over the last few years, our lifestyles have changed significantly and so have the ways we work, interact, and communicate with each other. However, education has failed to adapt and align with people’s behaviors, tendencies, and society as a whole, with very few long-lasting technological disruptions over the last decade. For example, although 90% of students say they prefer learning online, rather than through traditional methods, the education sector only accounts for 21% of the global learning management systems (LMS) market.
Cloud-based platforms capable of engaging remote students globally are in greater demand. Equally, there is greater understanding that a one-size-fits-all approach doesn’t work when it comes to education, but there’s still so much more educators, parents, and policy makers need to understand to better tailor methods to different types of learners. Digital tools and advanced analytics are needed to assess and track learning progress for educators to have an ongoing insight into what methods are resonating well, and where there’s room for improvement.
Many companies are also starting to look at using VR/AR to enhance the learning process. Startups like Belgium-based Altheria provide VR training experiences that companies can use and tailor to their specific needs.
When it comes to edtech, according to Tracxn there are around 36,600 startups providing technology solutions to businesses and consumers in the education industry. Of that, only 5,500 companies have been funded over the last 10 years, receiving $31.9 billion in 5,850 rounds of funding. More is needed to allow these businesses to flourish and deliver the modern solutions our schools and educational institutions need.
Hospitality
The hospitality industry has been faced with a number of challenges in recent years, from the sudden loss of revenue during the pandemic to a shortage of staff to meet increasingly high demand. At the same time, hotels and vacation rentals are feeling the pressure to improve their sustainability practices as travelers’ preferences for eco-friendly accommodation grow.
Few hotels and vacation rentals are currently employing digital tools to their advantage, for example using AI to automate sharing information and answers with customers before and during their stay, or installing a smart in-room setup that connects to customers’ mobile devices can significantly enhance the customer experience.
Collecting and analyzing data at all touchpoints throughout the customer journey can help proprietors create a more detailed customer profile. Making use of a cloud-based property management system (PMS), such as Germany-based Apaleo, will help automate processes and allow staff to focus on the personalized, high-touch aspects of the customer journey.
With only 3,420 startups and just one unicorn launched in the last 10 years, the hospitality industry is in need of a sprucing up. There’s so much missed opportunity and need for a complete digital transformation, from both the customer experience side of things, as well as the proprietor’s side.
Agriculture
As the world’s population continues to grow, feeding everyone in a sustainable, affordable way is more challenging than ever. The global population and demand for food will increase 70% by 2050, which will continue to put a strain on agriculture and food production.
The biggest challenge we now face is how we can scale up global food production in a way that reaches the entire population, without causing irreparable damage to the planet. Of the 20,600 startups providing tech solutions to the agriculture and food industry in the last 10 years, 2,410 have unfortunately been deadpooled.
5,560 agritech startups, however, have received $52.4billion in funding, and 22 unicorns have been created. Investment is received from many sources: “For example, TNW is working with Rabobank to find innovative solutions that will help its agricultural sector clients to decarbonize,” says Nijhof.
One startup that’s created an interesting product, which is already available to the general public, is Beewise. Based in the Netherlands, the startup uses modern technology to monitor beehives and support healthy pollination and efficient honey harvesting. Anyone can order their own smart Beehome and easily track its progress using an app.
Industrial Manufacturing
Now more than ever the manufacturing industry needs to transform to increase operational efficiency, scale smart factory initiatives, improve supply chain resiliency, and improve sustainability with innovative new materials and processes. Within the next year, 62% of manufacturers plan to focus on robotics and automation, which will likely begin to address some of these needs.
Startups like Mecuris are pushing the boat out by reimagining traditional techniques into digital tools that are intuitive and easy for users to operate when designing orthotic & prosthetic products.
When it comes to developing and working with more sustainable materials, the industry can reduce its reliance on finite materials and energy. There is additionally greater potential for modern materials to allow manufacturers to create products with a longer lifespan, further improving efficiencies, and reducing the need for frequent upgrades and replacements. Finally, adopting a more circular economy allows materials and products to be repurposed, reducing production costs as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
However, while manufacturing has seen some progress, there’s still a lot more potential for the industry to grow and develop. The industry has seen just 970 funded companies, and only 36 series C+ companies. Nevertheless, there is a lot of opportunity for development, and 61% of manufacturers are already planning to partner with specialized tech companies to help drive their growth strategy in the next year.
Real Estate and Construction
Similar to industrial manufacturing, stakeholders in real estate and construction are expecting to see more sustainable solutions being implemented.
However, to make the industry truly sustainable, more transparency is needed, with standardized grades across different countries, as well as accurate traceability of maintenance, analytics, and reporting.
The whole market, process of sales, and construction and renovation needs to evolve, innovate, and increase its digital maturity for professionals to be able to operate more efficiently. 41% of real estate firms admit that keeping up with technology is their biggest challenge, while 30% worry about competition from emerging virtual firms.
Making use of the tools provided by startups like EagleView, which enables greater accuracy and access to property data through the use of autonomous drones, is a good place to start.
In the last 10 years, the industry has had 5,410 startups receive $68.8billion in funding. A significant increase in digital innovation will ultimately be needed for the industry to become more efficient and reduce both monetary and environmental risks and costs.
Commercial Airline
Air and airport congestion continue to be a challenge, but smart technology could help to ease this and enable more user-friendly flight and luggage tracking. Equally, things like ML and AI have the potential to improve efficiencies within the aircraft, to spot faults quicker and help to maintain the health of its components and infrastructure. And, like most other industries, innovation is needed to improve the environmental standards of aviation, for example improving fuel efficiency, in the face of climate change.
Having received the lowest amount of funding since 2013, and $490million in aviation IT and $2.9billion in aerospace tech, the industry has only seen 1,380 startups developed. There’s a lot of opportunities, particularly for companies offering software solutions to the aviation industry and providing tech-based solutions to aircraft manufacturers to transform and improve the industry.
Startups like UK’s Hiiroc have already developed an efficient method for producing zero CO2 emission hydrogen through use of Thermal Plasma Electrolysis technology, which lowers both costs and emissions for commercial airlines.
As each of these industries continues to evolve, more investment, and innovation will be needed to give them a boost. For more insights, strategies, and tips on how to boost innovation within your organization, contact our team here.

7 key takeaways about the Dutch tech startup ecosystem you need to know,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/02/16,"
The Dutch tech startup ecosystem has been steadily flourishing over the past five years, establishing itself as one of Europe’s most vibrant hubs. Yet, there are still hurdles the Netherlands needs to overcome in order to reach its full potential and successfully compete on a global scale.
That’s according to the annual State of Dutch Tech report by TechLeap, a non-profit organisation which helps quantify and accelerate the ecosystem in the Netherlands.
Here are seven key takeaways from the report you need to know about:
The Netherlands houses the EU’s most successful ecosystem
In 2022, the Amsterdam-Delta region was the leading ecosystem in the EU, overtaking Paris and Berlin. Globally, it ranks on the fourteenth place, behind cities in the US, Asia, and the UK.
However, the combined valuations of Dutch startups stagnated, with
the tech sector in the country dropping from the fourth to the sixth position globally at €0.4T in aggregate public market cap. The Netherlands is still the leader in the EU thanks to tech giants ASML, Prosus, and Adyen.
Fintech and healthcare were the dominant startup sectors in the country, with the first producing the greatest number of scaleups as well. The Netherlands also welcomed one new unicorn in 2022, bringing its total to 1.4 unicorns per million inhabitants. This places it above France (0.7) and Germany (0.5), but below Sweden (2.4) and the UK (1.7).
The tech sector is also growing outside the Amsterdam-Delta
Although the North Holland region remains the largest startup centre in the country, generating 38% of startups jobs, other local hubs are also growing thanks to regional specialisations and mutual cooperation.
For instance, North Brabant showed a 27% year-on-year growth in deeptech jobs, Utrecht increased its numbers of startups by 900, and Gelderland has become a leader in foodtech.
Job creation increases, but attracting talent remains a challenge
In 2022, startup-generated jobs reached 135K, rising from 109K in 2020 and 130K in 2021. Attracting tech talent, however, presents to be challenging for many startups.
Specifically, the percentage of hard-to-fill tech jobs has increased to 59%. On average, these types of vacancies stay open for more than 60 days.
This phenomenon occurred in other ecosystems as well, including Sweden, Germany, France, and the US.
Dutch startups struggle scaling up mainly due to lack of funding
The startup to scaleup ratio in the Netherlands (22%) is lower compared to other European hubs, such as Germany (37%), the UK (30%), and France (26%). That’s mainly because of insufficient capital.
In 2022, total VC funding in the Netherlands was €2.6 billion with the average funding being €0.26 million per startup. This was significantly lower than other major EU startup ecosystems. For reference, Sweden’s average was €0.9 million per startup.
Despite the Netherlands’ prowess in scientific and academic research, deeptech is amongst the underinvested sectors with €0.7 billion in funding in 2022 and a 23% startup to scaleup ratio.
On the brightside, investments on impact startups are on the rise with over €1 billion raised in 2022. And investments in all sectors overperformed pre-pandemic levels.
The gender gap
The gender gap is still a problematic issue within the industry. Just 10% of Dutch tech startups are run by women, and funding for female entrepreneurs is similarly insufficient. Only 0.7% of venture capital investments have been raised — since 2019 — by businesses with female founding teams, lagging behind the UK (2%), Germany (1.5%), and France (1.2%).
The potential for further growth
According to the report, the Dutch tech ecosystem has a massive potential of growth. In particular, it could add 250K jobs and €400 billion in value by 2030. This could be done by supporting the growth and impact of university spin-offs, bridging the talent and diversity gap, and cultivating a more resilient and internationally-embedded VC market.

UK scientists discover method to reduce steelmaking’s CO2 emissions by 90%,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/01/27,"
Researchers from the University of Birmingham have developed an innovative method for existing furnaces that could reduce steelmaking’s CO2 emission by nearly 90%.
The iron and steel industry is a major cause of greenhouse gasses, accounting for 9% of global emissions. That’s because of the inherent carbon-intensive nature of steel production in blast furnaces, which currently represent the most-widely used practice.
In blast furnace steel manufacturing, coke (a type of coal) is used to produce metallic iron from ore obtained from mining — which releases large quantities of carbon dioxide in the process. According to Dr Harriet Kildahl, who co-devised the method with Professor Yulong Ding, their technology aims to convert this carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide that can be reused in the iron ore reaction.
This is realised using a thermochemical cycle which performs chemical reactions through changes in temperature. That way, the typically damaging CO2 is turned into a useful part of the reaction, forming “an almost perfect closed carbon loop.” This drastically reduces emission by the amount of coke needed and, subsequently, lowers steelmaking’s emissions by up to 88%.
As per the researchers, if this method was implemented in the remaining two blast furnaces in the UK, it could save £1.28 billion in 5 years, all while reducing the country’s overall emissions by 2.9%.
“Current proposals for decarbonising the steel sector rely on phasing out existing plants and introducing electric arc furnaces powered by renewable electricity. However, an electric arc furnace plant can cost over £1 billion to build, which makes this switch economically unfeasible in the time remaining to meet the Paris Climate Agreement,” Professor Ding said. “The system we are proposing can be retrofitted to existing plants, which reduces the risk of stranded assets, and both the reduction in CO2, and the cost savings, are seen immediately.”
University of Birmingham Enterprise has filed a patent application covering the system and its use in metal production. It’s currently looking for partners to take part in pilot studies and deliver this technology to existing infrastructure, or collaborate on further research to develop the process.

How startups can protect their IP: 8 tips from a patent attorney,Thomas Macaulay,2023/01/25,"
For tech startups, the most valuable assets are often invisible.  While businesses were traditionally built on physical resources, the contemporary economy is increasingly driven by intangibles. The chip firm Arm, for instance, earned a $40 billion valuation and a reputation as the UK’s leading tech company — despite never manufacturing a single chip. Instead, the company designs the processor architecture that’s used in countless devices.
This intellectual property-based business model has transformed stock markets. In 1985, under a third of all assets in the S&P 500 were classed as intangible by 2020, that proportion had risen to around 90%. Startups, however, can overlook IP protection in their initial plans.
According to Robert Lind, a patent attorney at IP firm Marks & Clerk, they’re taking a major risk. Lind recently wrote an e-book on how to protect and monetize their intellectual property. He shared his top tips with TNW.
1. Start your research ASAP
According to Lind, tech firms often neglect IP until their business is exposed to creative and financial peril. He advises them to start their research before they really need it.
Naturally, Lind suggests their study material includes his e-book. But he doesn’t recommend relying on professional advisors at every turn.
“Arm yourself with the knowledge at the outset, so you know when to bring in the experts — and when you don’t need to bring them in,” says Lind. 
For tech startups, patents are the primary form of IP that can be protected. Founders should educate themselves on what a patent is, how to get them, how they’re enforced, and how third-party patents can be interpreted.
2. Keep it confidential
It should go without saying that your brilliant idea should be kept private, but that’s easier said than done. 
“​​Going public doesn’t just mean selling a product,” says Lind. “It could mean presenting a conference paper, publishing an article in a journal, or putting some information on your website. Be very careful about publishing your ideas before you’ve taken a view on whether something’s patentable.”
3. Diligently identify your innovations
Innovations are the lifeblood of patents, but they’re not always easy to identify. Many researchers and engineers don’t realize that their work could be valuable IP. 
“It’s very important that you have regular reviews internally and milestones in your project plans to consider what innovations have been made and whether or not they should be patented,” says Lind.
Lind has spend 24 years as a patent attorney at Marks & Clerk. He graduated from Glasgow University with a BEng in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, and followed this with a PhD in Bioelectronics.
Once you’ve identified an asset, you can get professional advice on whether or not it’s something you could patent.
4. Protect your rights
Experienced investors are savvy about the value of IP. Venture capitalists will use patents as evidence that a company is well-managed, at a certain development stage, and with a market niche. Their due diligence will likely differentiate between filing an application and receiving a granted patent.
Startups, however, often prioritize investing in R&D over protecting their IP. Lind recalls this issue emerging at a green tech company. The team had a very slim IP portfolio, which raised questions about its value to investors. 
“It’s the protection that really crystallizes the value in the R&D that you’re doing,” says Lind.
5. Devise a clear IP strategy
An IP strategy should begin with clear objectives. Broadly, this will involve maximizing value at a desired point of exit or investment, while remaining within the confines of financial prudency. 
Registered rights are territorial, so you’ll need to identify where to register your IP assets. This analysis can incorporate the territory’s size, potential, costs, and effectiveness. 
A cautious strategy can defer costs and commitments, but bear in mind that the registration process can be slow. To avoid delays, file early in the key territories, respond quickly to objections, and embrace opportunities to discuss issues with patent examiners. Careful cost forecasting and budgeting will help cover any pitfalls that emerge.
“You should pursue your strategy quite aggressively,” says Lind. “But unless you know where you want to get to at the start, you’re probably not going to get anywhere useful.”
6. Map your IP to your business — and the future
You need to make sure your IP maps to the tech you can sell. According to Lind, it’s surprisingly easy to get patents granted that don’t align with your most valuable assets.
“Make sure your patents actually cover what the efficient and clever parts are — that’s very important,” he says.
The e-book is available as a free download from the Marks & Clerk website.
Your IP should also be future-proofed, as the end product can be very different to the original vision. One of Lind’s previous clients, DNANudge, raised $60 million after building a portfolio of patent rights with diverse potential. While the company already sells a consumer product, its IP could also be integrated into various other devices or apps.
“Make sure your IP is broad enough in scope to cover not just what you’re doing now but also what you’re doing in the future,” suggests Lind.
7. Keep building your portfolio
Lind advises startups to look beyond those first few patents for their big idea. After all, each patent only lasts for 20 years.
“A slow-burn startup might take 10 years to get its product to market, which only leaves them with 10 years left on the patent,” says Lind. “They’ve got to keep innovating and keep patenting so they can keep that pipeline going.”
8. Resolve your ownership issues
The cooperation of staff can be crucial to registering IP. Signatures from inventors, designers, directors, and owners may all be required on legal documents. If you can’t get a name on the dotted line, you could have major problems.
To escape this fate, Lind recommends obtaining the necessary agreements while everyone is happy and cooperating.
“Make sure you clear all that ownership up and keep proper records all the way through the process,” he says. “And do it while everybody’s still friends — and before you start making money.”

EU unveils data-driven plan to make shipbuilding faster and cheaper,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/01/17,"
The EU-funded Smart European Shipbuilding (SEUS) project launched this month, aiming to improve the shipbuilding process via computational tools.
The launch arrives as the maritime industry’s increasingly embraces digitization and automation, facilitated by rapid advancements in data science and software development.
SEUS is backed by a consortium of eight organizations from five European countries, representing different technologies and parts of the design and shipbuilding industry: computational tools development, industrially applied research, and end-users (i.e. shipyards).
These partners will work together to create a framework for data-driven shipbuilding. According to the project’s description, this will be realized through the development of a new integrated platform that incorporates “early and detailed ship design solutions,” “data management,” and “collaboration software.”
Specifically, the platform will build novel practices for human-centric knowledge management, data-driven AI design elements, intelligent technology, and an Industry 5.0 concept for shipbuilding. It will also reinforce the growth of a European workforce that is highly skilled in the integration and deployment of these new technologies.
The project’s ambition is to cut down engineering time by up to 30% percent reduction as well as achieve an up to 20% reduction in the time needed for assembly and construction at EU shipyards. If it succeeds, it’s expected to not only accelerate shipbuilding’s digital transformation, but also provide shipbuilders in the Union with a strong competitive advantage through cost- and time-savings in the design and production stages.
Finland’s Cadmatic, Contact Software in Germany, and Netherlands-based Sarc BV will be contributing to the technological expertise. Ulstein Group in Norway and Astilleros Gondan in Spain are the two joining shipyards. And three research institutes, the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Turku University in Finland, and NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences in The Netherlands, represent the academic partners.
SEUS is being funded by Horizon Europe, the EU’s flagship research and innovation program. The Union is providing approximately €7 million for its implementation.

Brainy UK scientists create robust optic fiber that may unlock our quantum future,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/01/16,"
Optical fibers have become the foundation of modern data transmission, used for everything from telecoms and internet services to governmental and space applications. This is because they’re capable of transmitting larger amounts of data at faster speeds and over longer distances, compared to other technologies.
The structure of optical fibers, however, can occasionally lead to network failures, as any twisted or bent cables can hinder the information transfer. To address this issue, scientists at the University of Bath in the UK have designed a new type of fiber, aiming to enhance the robustness of these networks.
A regular optical fiber consists of three elements: the core, the cladding, and the coating.
The core is at the center and provides a pathway for light (the medium through which data is transmitted) to travel. The cladding holds the light inside the core and controls the direction in which it travels, bouncing along as though reflecting off a mirror. Finally, the coating works as the primary buffer and a jacket encases the entire structure.

“Whenever you fabricate a fiber-optic cable, small variations in the physical structure of the fiber are inevitably present. When deployed in a network, the fiber can also get twisted and bent,” Physics PhD student Nathan Roberts — who led the research — said.
These distortions can hinder the light’s optimum pathway and lead to information degradation as it moves between the sender and receiver.
“One way to counter these variations and defects is to ensure the fiber design process includes a real focus on robustness. This is where we found the ideas of topology useful,” Roberts added.
Topology is the mathematical study of the properties of geometrical objects that remain unchanged despite deformations, twistings, and stretchings. It has already been applied to physics and light research, but the Bath scientists are the first to use it in optical fibers.
The physicists have created a fiber that employs topological principles by adding several light-guiding cores in the fiber, linked together in a spiral. Light can still travel between these cores, but, thanks to the topological design, it remains trapped within the edge. These so-called “edge states” are shielded from disorder in the overall structure.
“By adopting optical fibers with topological design, researchers will have the tools to pre-empt and forestall signal-degrading effects by building inherently robust photonic systems,” Dr Anton Souslov, co-author of the study, explained.
Currently, the researchers are looking for industry partners to further develop their concept, which could benefit not only existing communications, but also future quantum networks.
“We have shown that you can make kilometers of topological fiber wound around a spool. We envision a quantum internet where information will be transmitted robustly across continents using topological principles,” Roberts noted.
Compared to conventional computers, quantum technology is expected to be vastly more powerful when it comes to storing and processing information, while promising an unparalleled (so far) level of data security — a potential game changer for information networks.
However, the quantum states of light with transfer information can be easily affected by the environment, presenting a significant challenge. This study may pave the way towards using topological design to preserve quantum information in optical fibers.

Quantum computing startup eyes mainstream adoption after £30m investment,Thomas Macaulay,2023/01/14,"
Quantum computing has immense potential but incredible complexities. While zealots claim it will cure cancer and save the planet, critics warn their promises are far from being fulfilled.
One of their key challenges lies at the very heart of the field: ​​quantum bits, or “qubits.” These information units are the quantum analog of binary bits in classical computers. To make quantum computers useful, the qubits have to be reliably controlled and manufactured at scale.
It’s a requirement that still confounds the world’s leading computer scientists. The likes of IBM and Google made impressive strides by building qubits into their quantum chips, which have to obey the laws of quantum physics at temperatures near absolute zero. 
One issue with this approach is that it requires million-dollar refrigerators. Another is that just a single atom in the wrong place on the chip can cause computing mistakes.
Oxford Ionics, a startup based in the UK, applies a different technique. The company uses a proprietary technology called Electronic Qubit Control (EQC) to control the qubits. This system applies different voltages and currents on a traditional microchip, which create magnetic fields in the surrounding space. 
The quantum bits in this system are comprised of individual atoms. In their natural state, these atoms don’t tend to stay still long enough to perform a computation. To stabilize them, one of their electrons is removed to make an ion. These ions have an electrical charge, which enables the electromagnetic field to “trap” them less than a hair’s width above a chip.


“We have perfect qubits.


Dr Chris Balance, who co-founded Oxford Ionics in 2019, compares the effect to toys that use magnets to suspend objects in the air.
“This gives us the best of both worlds: we have a chip that can be made just like a normal computer processor and which can run at room temperature, and we have perfect qubits made from single ions hovering above the chip,” Balance tells TNW. “Not building the qubits means we can’t build them wrong. Nature guarantees each individual atom is perfectly identical to any other.”
Ballance (right) and Tom Hardy founded Oxford Ionics aftedr earning PhDs in Quantum Computing from Oxford University: Oxford Ionics
Unlike other “trapped-ion” exponents, Oxford Ionics doesn’t rely on lasers to control qubits. According to Balance, laser-controlled devices are effective for small systems, but extremely difficult to fabricate and integrate at chip scale. They also become error-prone as the size of the processor and the number of qubits grows.
In tests, the Oxford Ionics system has shown seemingly superior results. The ​​technology currently holds a range of records for quantum computing performance, speed, and error rates, Ballance’s research was also cited in the scientific release that accompanied this year’s Nobel Prize in Physics. 
These achievements have caught the eyes of investors. Last week, Oxford Ionics announced that it had raised £30 million in Series A funding, which will be used to grow the team and bring the tech to market.


“We are entering the discovery phase.


Balance is now looking forward to solving real-world problems.
“Over the next few years, we are entering the discovery phase of quantum computing: up to now we have not had quantum computers that solve problems we can’t solve any other way — now we do!”
Balance doesn’t expect to integrate Quantum Ionics’ tech into general-purpose chips. Instead, he envisions the company’s quantum chips running in parallel with classical semiconductors.
“Think GPUs alongside CPUs,” he says.
It may likely still take years for killer apps to emerge, but Oxford Ionics could push quantum computing closer to the mainstream.

Sweden discovers rare earth metals — and that could redefine Europe’s relationship with China,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/01/13,"
Swedish company LKAB has discovered what’s claimed to be Europe’s biggest deposit of rare earth metals, promising a critical boost in the continent’s trade security and green transition.
“Rare earths” are a group of 17 chemical elements composed of scandium, yttrium, and lanthanides. Contrary to their name, rare earths are actually abundant; their rarity stems from the complexity of their extraction, separation, and refining, which can generate toxic and radioactive waste, negatively impacting the environment.
But despite their environmental hazards, they are crucial for the manufacture of numerous high-tech products. This ranges from household goods (TVs, computers, and smartphones) to medical equipment (X-Ray and MRI scanning) and defense systems (jets and night vision tech, among others).
Most notably, they’re also key for the clean energy transition, as they are components of the magnets used in EVs and wind turbines.
With no mining of its own, the EU imports 98% of its rare earth metals supply from China, which houses the majority of the world’s reserve and is the biggest global supplier.
LKAB’s discovery, however, could be a game changer. The state-owned company said that it has found a deposit — named Per Geijer — of over one million tons in the Kiruna area, located in Lapland within the Arctic Circle.

“Electrification, the EU’s self-suffiency and independence from Russia and China will begin in the mine,” Sweden’s Minister for Energy, Business, and Industry, Ebba Busch, said in a statement.
“We need to strengthen industrial value chains in Europe and create real opportunities for the electrification of our societies. Politics must give the industry the conditions to switch to green and fossil-free production,” she noted.
Reducing reliance on foreign supply chains and ensuring access to critical raw materials is an integral focus of the EU agenda as well as Europe’s aim to become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.
“Lithium and rare earths will soon be more important than oil and gas,” EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stressed during a speech in September. “Our demand for rare earths alone will increase fivefold by 2030,” she added, highlighting the imperative to avoid becoming dependent as on oil and gas.
In the same line of thought, EU Commissioner Thierry Breton underlined the need for action. “Take China, with its quasi-monopoly on rare earths and permanent magnets and prices rising by 50-90% in the past year alone,” he wrote. “Supply of raw materials has become a real geopolitical tool.”
While LKAB is already investing heavily in the project to move forward, President and Group CEO Jan Moström emphasized that there’s a long road ahead. He expects that it’ll take several years to investigate the deposit, assess its profitability, and evaluate the sustainability and environmental impact of the mining process. Following that, LKAB can proceed with an environmental review application and a permit application.
“If we look at how other permit processes have worked within our industry, it will take at least 10 to 15 years before we can actually begin mining and deliver raw materials to the market,” Moström explained.
Providing that LKAB finds a way to mitigate the environmental cost entailed in mining, the Per Geijer deposit could provide Europe with the impetus in needs to ensure domestic supply of critical raw materials and facilitate its green transition.

Concrete is one of the world’s most harmful materials. Graphene could change that,Thomas Macaulay,2023/01/11,"
Concrete has been described as the most destructive material on Earth. After water, it’s the most used substance in the world, with twice the usage of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminium combined.
To manufacture all this concrete, more than 4 billion tonnes of cement are produced every year. According to the Chatham House think tank, that creates around 8% of all CO2 emissions — more than what’s caused by all the trucks across the globe.
Cement makers urgently need to reduce this footprint. To meet the requirements of the Paris Agreement on climate change, the industry needs to cut emissions by at least 16% by 2030. At the same time, the sector faces growing demand from rapid urbanization and population growth.
It’s foreboding problem. But engineers believe that graphene offers a solution.


“Just 0.01% of the material is required.


First isolated at the University of Manchester in 2004, Graphene’s 2D nature provides a unique combination of strength, flexibility, lightness, and conductivity. These properties caught the eye of Nationwide Engineering, a British construction business. 
The firm’s memorably-acronymed R&D subsidiary, NERD (Nationwide Engineering Research and Development), was tasked with turning the “wonder material” into a new additive: Concretene. 
The substance has already formed floor slabs in the UK. Credit: Concretene
Concretene consists of graphene that’s produced at Manchester University. Small quantities of the liquid formulation are added during the concrete mixing process. 
The graphene provides both mechanical support and an active surface for the chemical reactions that occur during the cement hydration and hardening.
“Very low dosages of the material, in some cases less than 0.01%, are required to deliver substantial performance gains,”  Alex McDermott, the co-founder of Concretene, tells TNW.
“This means that Concretene is commercially viable with wholesale costs to be in-line with existing additives already used in the concrete industry.”

 
According to McDermott, Concretene used in real construction projects was up to 30-50% stronger than standard concrete. Subsequent lab tests have shown strength gains that surpass 100%. As a result, the volume of cement required can significantly reduce without impairing performance. 
Costs, shrinking, and cracking can also be trimmed, while increases in density cut concrete’s porosity.
“These factors will enable engineers to reduce the volume of concrete required in designs going forward, further reducing the CO₂  impact,” says McDermott.
Ultimately, he believes Concretene could be used in more than 99% of concretes worldwide.
McDermott’s team worked with the University of Manchester’s Graphene Engineering Innovation Centre (GEIC) to develop Concretene. Credit: Concretene
Initial tests of Concretene have produced promising results. 
In 2021, NERD laid the world’s first graphene concrete slab across the floor of a new gym in England. Further trials followed at a roller disco and a residential development.
In total, more than 1,000 tonnes of Concretene have now been poured in real-world projects. The next target is pushing the product into the mainstream.

A post shared by SOUTHERN QUARTER 🇬🇧 (@southernquarter_)



Graphene has been challenging to produce at speed and scale, but recent breakthroughs have made mass-production a more realistic prospect.
These developments have restored faith from investors. In December, Concretene raised £8m from a VC funding round led by LocalGlobe. The cash will be used to accelerate the commercialization plans.
Concretene will now turn to collaborations with Heathrow Airport, Network Rail, Yorkshire Water, and the Environment Agency. Work will also soon begin on the first road trial of Concretene with National Highways
“Concretene is being put through ‘live’ trials in the places where it can be used most,” says McDermott. “This is a key step to achieving industry adoption.”
That could be good news for both the construction sector and the environment. Because despite the claims of British shock jocks, you can’t actually grow concrete — but you can grow graphene.

"Wind, solar, and hydrogen: How energy will get more sustainable in 2023",Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/01/10,"
Both the EU’s ambitious 2030 climate target and the current energy crisis have highlighted the need to accelerate the transition to renewable energy.
And while wind, solar, and green hydrogen are already on the rise, there are still important steps to be taken the coming year to increase their sustainability — and improve what they’re capable of.
To find out how this will work, TNW spoke with three experts.
Wind power
Floating offshore wind is a “game changer” for the renewable energy industry and a “key technology” against climate change, Felipe Cornago — Commercial Director Offshore Wind, at BayWa r.e. — told us.
That’s because it has the potential not only to take advantage of areas with higher wind intensity, but also to open up markets previously incompatible with bottom-fixed technologies.
Compared to fixed installations, floating offshore wind farms also come with reduced environmental impact in maritime ecosystems, as well lower construction costs.

But despite accelerated development in recent years, as Cornago noted, there are still numerous challenges to be addressed.
“This is why industry and government efforts in 2023 should focus on a number of areas, including the establishment of clear regulatory frameworks as well as improving grid connection and grid planning,” he explained.
As per Cornago, focus should also be placed on the standardization of technological and commercial solutions. Currently, there’s a gamut of different designs and manufacturing methods, all of which drives costs up.
Finally, he believes that the lack of expertise in developing floating offshore wind platforms will start being mitigated in the coming year. This will be done “by tapping into pre-existing infrastructure and knowledge from the development of bottom-fixed offshore wind,” as well as “adapting existing supply chains.”
Solar
According to Frank Jessel — Global Director of Solar Trade at BayWa r.e. — 2022 has seen a rapid expansion in the adoption of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems and their accompanying energy storage solutions.

Jessel expects this trend to continue in 2023 “with the endorsement of renewables within the residential and commercial PV market higher than ever, and the price of PV systems in particular falling mid-term due to technological improvements, decreasing freight prices, and economies of scale.”
However, there are still challenges that hinder accelerated growth and require solutions, he added. These are disruptions in supply chains and a shortage of skilled workers regarding the installation of PV systems.
Green hydrogen
Green hydrogen, powered by renewable sources such as wind and solar, is a clean and promising alternative to fossil fuels.
But for the industry to achieve efficient production, it’s necessary to recognize the vital role of digitalization, David Hall, VP Power Systems at Schneider Electric UK & Ireland, told TNW.
“The challenges in the scaled production of green hydrogen can be addressed largely by using new digital technologies available today,” he explained.
For starters, digital twin technology and 3D modeling allows the simulation of data throughout the entire lifecycle of a green hydrogen plant, reducing costs, risks, and time.
Secondly, Hall highlighted the importance of an “overarching” Energy Management System that will indicate the optimal times to use electricity from the grid and forecast power generation, to ensure hydrogen’s required volume production on a low-cost basis.
Finally, he noted the need for a Unified Operating Center. This translates to the use of a Pi system — a software that collects and analyzes operational data — that can bring together all the different assets to allow for better decision making, optimal performance, and reduced downtime.

Facilitating the faster adoption of wind, solar, and green hydrogen requires our efforts beyond 2023, but starting to apply some of the above measures definitely marks a significant start.

French startup uses Hi-Fi speakers to develop eco-friendly heat pumps,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/01/9,"
Amidst the climate and energy crisis, heat pumps have emerged on the housing heating market as a technology that can replace gas and oil, while lowering the energy bills. Yet, their air compression systems require refrigerants to work. These refrigerants, also known as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), are amongst the most potent greenhouse gasses.
Founded in 2017 and having raised €5 million, French deeptech startup Equium is seeking to provide a more ecological alternative. With this aim, it has developed a novel, acoustic heat pump core that harnesses the energy of sound.
The so-called Acoustic Heat Pump (AHP) can cover a household’s heating needs without the use of refrigerants. Instead, its operation is based on the phenomenon of thermoacoustics — the convergence of thermics, acoustics, and fluid mechanics.
The core works with a high-fidelity (Hi-Fi) speaker powered by electricity, which generates an acoustic wave in tubes filled with helium — a neutral and non-toxic gas that accelerates the propagation of sound. The acoustic wave causes the gas to compress or expand, producing heat or cold, respectively. It remains confined within the system, which allows the machine to be silent.

According to Equium, the heat pump isn’t just greenhouse gas-free, but also made from 100% recyclable materials, boasting overall a very low carbon footprint. At the same time, the machine’s ecological mode of operation is claimed to provide the same efficiency of a conventional heat pump, while increasing energy savings and overall cost.
A big part of that is the pump’s modulation, which allows users to increase or decrease the speaker’s volume to achieve the desired power output. Apart from that, the system is easy to install, doesn’t require maintenance and has a lifespan of around 30 years — about twice as long as a conventional heat pump.
As per the startup’s founder, Cédric François, for an equivalent cost and size, the AHP’s advantage translates to a 50% lower CO2 impact and a 20% lower energy consumption.
Equium’s aim is to sell its acoustic cores to heat pump manufacturers, seeking to develop a French acoustic HP industry. The first integration will be processed by the startup’s strategic partner Arkteos, a regional manufacturer. The company is currently conducting field tests and expects to market its product in 2024.
To date, the young French startup has only one competitor in this brand new market: Netherlands-based BlueHeart Energy. But hopefully, more companies will start tapping into the capabilities of thermoacoustics to revolutionize heat pump technology.

Your laggy WordPress site is annoying customers — here’s how to speed it up,Andrea Hak,2022/12/12,"
In an age when consumers expect products and services on demand, there are very few things more annoying than a sluggish website.
And for businesses that fail to keep their website at optimal performance, there’s a big risk: it kills the customer experience. Studies show that just two seconds of additional loading time can increase bounce rates by 103%, meanwhile 100 milliseconds of load time can cause a 7% drop in conversion.
Site speed is also a factor in Google rankings on desktop and mobile. Poor performance can reduce your site’s visibility on search engines, killing your traffic.
But, you’re in luck — if your website runs on a WordPress site, there are six things you can do to make sure it performs at tip top speed.
1. Identify the problem
This may seem obvious, but figuring out why your website is performing slowly is the first step.
This could be anything from issues with your site’s web hosting provider to slow WordPress plugins and themes. Figuring out which issue is causing sluggishness is key to figuring out the optimizations you should prioritize.
Start by running a page loading speed test using an online tool like GTmetrix, Google PageSpeed Insights, or WebPageTest. Keep in mind that load times should be less than one second.
Each tool has its own performance metrics that can give you better insight as to why your website is lagging in the first place, such as the web page’s speed index or network payloads, which can be due to excessive CSS, page content, or unoptimized images.
WordPress users should also specifically test their themes and plugins for performance issues. This requires disabling one theme or plugin at a time, and carrying out the aforementioned page loading tests. This way you can narrow down if any of these add-ons are the root cause.
2. Choose a lean theme
In the world of WordPress, you’ll hear this pretty often: choose the theme for the look and feel, and choose the plugins for functionality. But when it comes to themes, it’s not all about looks.
Themes have different sizes, in terms of both page size and the number of requests — or number of files it has to load. The size of the theme will have a huge effect on your website’s loading time.
Again, you can test out themes on your website by doing a page loading speed test (as mentioned above), It only takes a few minutes.
3. Optimize images
Similarly to how a theme’s size affects speed, the images on your webpage will also have an impact. By optimizing and compressing images, or shrinking their file size down, you can speed site performance up.
The quickest way to go about this is by using an image compression plugin. But, you can also resize the image so it uses fewer pixels, or serve images through a content delivery network (CDN), which is essentially a server that hosts the images, videos, and CSS, and delivers them quickly to your page as it loads.
Finally, you can also try cleaning out your WordPress library. As you build pages, images, videos, and other files tend to accumulate, taking up storage. Even if you delete, for example, the blog post that hosted these images, they stay in your WP library.
Before cleaning out your WP, make sure you have a backup of your WordPress site in case things go wrong.
4. Only show text extracts
If you’re looking to host a blog feature on your website, another hack for speeding up overall site performance is to only show short snippets of the posts on the homepage, or elsewhere.
By default, many WordPress themes show full posts on a site’s blog, home page, and archives, which can create a major lag. It can also negatively impact search engine performance, because it acts as duplicate content on your website.
When choosing your theme, make sure to check if full blog posts or excerpts are the default option. If so, you can change the settings. WordPress also allows users to customize excerpts, so you can create a catchy bit of text to drive better engagement.
5. Choose the right WordPress host
Hosting your WordPress site in an isolated environment could mean both faster speed and better security as the provider takes care of both the maintenance and security of the site.
WordPress providers, like IONOS, endeavor to make life easier for WordPress users as they provide all the features of a secure server infrastructure for a small monthly fee (you can try IONOS’ “Grow” package for as little as $1 a month when starting out).
IONOS also comes with a free caching plugin, which can help boost loading speeds by using a full page cache to store HTML. For example, the company claims its latest version has made loading three times faster.
6. Fine tune your website
After you’ve taken care of steps one through five, there are several smaller adjustments you can make to fine-tune the speed of your WordPress site.
First, break up longer posts into smaller pages. While readers may enjoy a nice long read on a single page, this could hurt your site’s load times.
Next, reduce the number of external HTTP requests on your site. WordPress plugins and themes often load a whole bunch of content and files from other sites, such as images, scripts and stylesheets. If your WP plugin is making too many requests, it could kill your speed. One way to avoid this is by activating GZIP compression, which compresses all the files being sent to your site. Check out these code shortcuts to help you out.
Believe it or not, most WP sites also come with an extra JavaScript file for emojis. If you don’t actually use or think you’ll ever need to use emojis, disabling them could help speed up your site.
Also, consider lazy loading. This means images and videos load only when they appear on the user’s screen as they scroll through your site, rather than all at once. WordPress users can implement lazy loading with the Lazy Load by WP Rocket plugin.
When you’re competing against thousands of other websites to prove your product or service is the best on the market, every second counts. Don’t let load times get in the way of your success.

Dutch students unveil ‘world’s most efficient’ hydrogen car,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/05/15,"
At the beginning of May, a student team from Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands unveiled what could be the world’s most efficient hydrogen car. 
Dubbed ERXII, the vehicle is slated to cover over 2,000km on just 1kg of hydrogen fuel — equivalent to the distance between Amsterdam and Kyiv.
This claim will be tested in June at Shell’s Eco-Marathon event in France. Eco-Runner will go head-to-head with student teams from across Europe to break the world record for the longest distance driven on hydrogen without refuelling. 
This year the number to beat is 2,056km, set by a methanol fuel-cell-powered Renault Zoe in 2022.

The 80kg carbon fibre vehicle has been designed to be as aerodynamic as possible. With a constant speed of 45kph, the ERXII should be able to cover 2,056km within three days.  
This is one of several hydrogen cars developed by Eco-Runner in recent years. 
“Efficiency and reliability are the main focus of this year’s project,” said team leader Julian de Klerk. “While the previous concept proved efficient, this year, we aimed for improved reliability for the record we’re trying to set. And well, it’s quite futuristic looking.”
Eco-Runner sees its tiny hydrogen car as a vision of a future where “all cars are smaller, lighter, and aerodynamic,” with the focus being  on “shared mobility” as “people deal with transport more sustainability and efficiently.”

This comes at a time when Europe is transitioning from fossil-fueled vehicles to more sustainable alternatives. While most of the emphasis in the passenger car segment has been on EVs, the team at Eco-Runner believes that hydrogen-powered city cars also have a place on the tarmac. 
“Electric cars are also part of the solution for sustainable mobility, but the electricity grid is already filling up,” said operations manager Eliane van Boxtel. “Electrifying the whole world is not an option. Hydrogen and electric cars go hand in hand. There is no one big winner.” 
For now, the students have their sights set on June, as they look to take home first prize and set another record for hydrogen-powered travel.

Spain’s Crowmie empowers everyone to invest in green energy,Jill Petzinger,2023/05/15,"
This profile is part of the main prize of the Pitch Battle at TNW Valencia 2023 won by Crowmie. Want your company to get featured as well? You’ve only got a few days to join the startup contest at TNW Conference in Amsterdam on June 15 & 16! 
Valencia’s hottest green-fintech startup is on a mission to break down the high barriers to investment in the energy sector and make it easy for everyone to fund renewable projects.
Crowmie, which launched February last year, is jumping into the micro-investing space by allowing anyone with as little as €100 to spend the chance to invest directly into renewable energy projects in Spain, and see monthly returns. 
Tech-wise, Crowmie has built a platform to create digital security tokens (STO, Security Token Offerings) for the total amount of each project they want to finance. This automated process means all investment transactions are registered in the blockchain. 
The 12-person startup, led by founders Fernando Dávila (26), Pablo Valverde (29) and Joshua Cleveland (29) won the Pitch Battle at TNW Valencia in March this year.
“The jury was impressed with the team’s vision and goal of making it easier to invest in renewable energy,” said Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten, co-founder of TNW and jury member of the Pitch Battle. “This is such an amazing opportunity that people like you and I can now finally get active in. This is one of those startups that you hope become very successful, not just for the team, or the investors but for the whole world.”
Crowmie (the name is a mashup of “crowd” and “homie”) has received €300,000 in pre-seed funding so far and is going after a €1.5 million seed round this year. The company will deploy the funds towards marketing, tech, opening up the investment platform to people in the US and building a presence in Mexico and Colombia. 
Tokenised investment inspiration
CEO Dávila, who studied astro-engineering in Valencia before becoming a founder, told TNW that innovation in property tech was one of their main inspirations.
“The idea came about because we saw an incredible trend in the tokenisation world, especially in the real estate sector,” Dávila said, citing RealT in the US and Reental in Spain as two pioneering companies in real-estate tokenised investments. 
The trio thought that the same model of fractional, tokenised investment could totally work in the renewable energy sector too — and no one was doing it in Spain. 
“Right now only those with high amounts of capital can invest in the renewable energy vertical, and we want to do it with tokenisation, because impact investment is growing now and will grow much more in the future,” Dávila added.

“We are really digitising a completely traditional sector like investment, using blockchain technology that allows us to open the doors to anyone from anywhere in the world, making it easy to invest in renewable energies, which until now was completely impossible.”
Spain is a promising base for green-energy initiatives. Just over 42% of the country’s electricity was generated from renewable sources in 2022, and it wants to increase this share to 74% by 2030.  
According to a Reuters report from December 2022, Spain has the largest solar pipeline in Europe, with so many solar projects in planning that the government is struggling to get all the permits issued. 
Zero-hassle investing
Getting up and running on the Crowmie app is simple, according to Dávila. Once someone signs up and completes the legal verification steps, they just need to select which of the Crowmie energy projects they want to invest in, and how much. 
They then receive a minted token for that monetary value giving them economic rights to the project. They can resell their tokens with one click any time.
Crucially, Crowmie’s business model is not purely about facilitating investment and financing the projects, as they actually own the installations and plants themselves. Once they’ve built an energy plant, typically for a large company or factory, they sell the energy from it to the customer, and distribute the money to all investors. 
Two solar plants are up and running so far, with, Dávila says, a total of 66 investors from multiple countries on board, with an average investment ticket of €2,000.

— Crowmie (@crowmie_es) April 10, 2023

Crowmie’s photovoltaic plant supplying the TYPSA factory in Zaragoza was financed with €114,000 and started operating in February this year. Investors started getting dividends from the first month of operations and it is expected to deliver a return of 7.5% per year for five years for investors, and save 1,365 tonnes of CO₂ per year.
The startup also makes money by taking 5% of the value of tokens that they mint on the platform (giving them 5% of the economic rights of any one project) and a 2% processing fee. 
Chickens and eggs
“Our biggest challenge is to balance the projects and the investors – it is chicken and egg,” said  Dávila. “You have to balance the volume of investors on the platform, and the volume of projects that you have, in order to finance that project fast, really timing when the projects are coming, then creating FOMO among those investors that they are going to miss this opportunity.”
“We have three kinds of investors,” he added. “On one side, we have professional investors, who invest between €10,000 and €50,000. Then there are retail investors, who go in for about €2,000 a ticket. The third level is those who put in between €100 and €2,000.” 
Compliance and due diligence across finance, technical and legal before they sign contracts with clients for the energy projects is the expensive part of doing business for Crowmie, and needs to be outsourced.  
For now, the founders are cutting their teeth on projects in Spain, but they’re already looking at expanding into Mexico and Colombia, where their partners have other energy projects. These 25 partners, Dávila said, have already created a pipeline of 40 potential projects for Crowmie to the value of €20 million.

"Biohack me, baby: Why I can’t wait for Teemu Arina’s talk at TNW Conference",Thomas Macaulay,2023/05/12,"









Teemu Arina will be speaking at TNW Conference, which takes place on June 15 & 16 in Amsterdam. If you want to experience the event (and say hi to our editorial team!), we’ve got something special for our loyal readers. Use the promo code READ-TNW-25 and get a 25% discount on your business pass for TNW Conference. See you in Amsterdam!
I often fantasise about biohacking my useless brain. At TNW Conference, my dreams could finally be fulfilled.
On day two of the event, biohacker Teemu Arina will immerse attendees in the fascinating realm of human enhancement.
Arina is one of the world’s leading authorities on the movement. He co-authored the bestselling Biohacker’s Handbook and founded the Biohacker Summit — Europe’s leading conference for optimising human performance. He’s also the co-founder of Biohacker Center, an independent think tank that researches peak performance, health, and well-being.
Naturally, Arina meticulously biohacks himself. Initially, I imagined this would involve drilling brain chips into his skull. But biohacking is closer to DIY biology.
Arina’s website provides a more detailed description:
“Biohacking is the art and science of optimizing your body, mind, and performance with systems thinking, technology, and biology — in other words, better living through science.”
Arina entered the field after he was afflicted by a chronic illness. Biohacking provided a route to recovery. That led him to further optimise his health and performance with biological and technological tools.
Some of these tools are surprisingly accessible. Arina uses activity trackers to manage stress, a headset to measure brainwaves, a muscle scanner to guide fitness training, and a blue light device to synchronise his circadian rhythm.
At TNW Conference on June 16, Arina will unravel the next phase of biohacking — and how it can unlock human potential. He promises to share his pioneering techniques for enhancing physical and mental performance.
To my decrepit mind and body, that sounds like an unmissable offer. And just in case Arina wants to ramp it up, I’m bringing my brain and scalpel.
Teemu Arina’s biohacking tips are merely one attraction of TNW Conference. You can find more on the event agenda — and remember: for a 25% discount on business passes, use the promo code READ-TNW-25.

Northvolt to build gigafactory in Germany after state aid pledge,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/05/12,"
Northvolt, Europe’s biggest battery maker, has confirmed that it will build its next gigafactory in Heide, Germany, following the federal government’s pledge to provide state aid.
The announcement comes after several months of uncertainty. In March 2022, the Swedish manufacturer and the German state of Schleswig-Holstein signed a memorandum of understanding to construct a factory in the region. But in October 2022, Northvolt said it might postpone the plan and priotirise a US expansion instead — unless the EU was willing to match the IRA’s loftier subsidies for green technologies.
In response, the German government has now confirmed it’ll fund the gigafactory under the Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework (TCTF) — a new EU state-aid plan, designed to support the development of green projects in view of the US’ respective subsidies and Russia’s energy monopoly.
The funding needs to be approved by Brussels first, but the federal government said it’s already “in the first constructive discussions” with the European Commission.
“Backed by this commitment of the federal government, Northvolt has decided to take the next steps towards our expansion in Heide,” said Peter Carlsson, founder & CEO of the company.
The gigafactory will have a 60GWh annual production volume of battery cells, aiming to supply approximately 1million EVs. It’s expected to unlock a multi-billion euro private investment, and create 3,000 direct jobs with thousands more estimated in the surrounding industry and service sector.
“With the next steps regarding Northvolt, Germany can look forward to one of the most significant lighthouse projects of the energy and transport transition,” said Robert Habeck, Germany’s deputy chancellor and economy minister.
In addition to the Commission’s approval, the gigafactory still requires preparational on-site work for construction and the final building permission. Deliveries of the first battery cells are expected in 2026.

Fairphone unveils user-repairable wireless headphones,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/05/12,"
At a time when the electronics industry is constantly luring consumers into buying the latest and most advanced devices, Amsterdam-based Fairphone has made a name for itself by doing the exact opposite.
Best known for its sustainably-made, modular, and repairable (DIY style) smartphones, the startup is now applying the same ethos to another product segment: headphones.
The newly-launched Fairbuds XL are a pair of over-ear wireless headphones, priced at €249. Much like the company’s smartphones, they’re sold mainly in Europe, although some authorised resellers ship to other parts of the world as well.
The Fairbuds XL come with a 30 hour battery life, 40mm dynamic drivers for sound quality, and active noise cancellation. They also feature a USB-C connector for charging, a 10m Bluetooth range, and smart assistants capabilities.
But their most impressive element is undoubtedly the design. The modular headphones consist of nine components/potential spare parts: battery, speaker to speaker cable, earcap covers, headband, ear cushion, headband base, speakers, and headband cover.

Customers can order any of them on the company’s website or the Fairbuds app, and easily replace or repair parts that are broken or worn over time. The headphones come with a two-year warranty, which means that within this period the components’ cost will be most likely covered by the startup.
To further boost their positive environmental and societal impact, the Fairbuds XL are made with 100% recycled plastics, aluminium, and tin solder paste to the maximum extent possible, while the startup claims it’ll pay $0.55 per headphone to fill the living wage gap of the production line workers.
Fairphone’s overall ethos aligns with the EU’s goal to drastically reduce e-waste and move towards a circular economy by 2050. Upcoming policies such the Right to Repair and the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products could give a significant regional boost to the startup’s approach.

Sweden to pave world’s first permanent e-road for EV charging while driving,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/05/10,"

As countries across Europe scale up efforts towards fossil fuel-free mobility, Sweden is working on the world’s first permanent electric road — allowing electric cars and trucks to charge while driving.
The project is led by the Swedish Transport Administration, Trafikverket, which has selected the E20 highway. Specifically, it will build the electric road system (ERS) on the 21km route from Hallsberg to Örebro, located between the country’s two largest cities, Stockholm and Gothenburg.
The e-road is now at the procurement and final planning stage, while Trafikverket expects to complete and introduce it to the public in 2025/2026.
How will it work?
Trafikverket has yet to determine which technology it will use for the ERS. Currently, there are three types available: overhead conductive, ground-based conductive, and ground-based inductive charging.
In the first type of charging, power is transferred from overhead wires to a vehicle through a pantograph — much like how trams operate. This technology, however, is only suitable for heavy-duty vehicles that are high enough to reach the electric lines.
The other two ground-based options work in a similar way. In conductive charging, power is transferred from special rails or tracks placed below or on the road. The vehicles charge with the help of a mechanical arm or stick that touches the rails. In the inductive system, the power transfer takes place between coils embedded in the road and the vehicles.
Sweden’s bet on electric roads
The ambitious electrification of E20 follows a series of successful ERS pilot projects in the country. From 2016 to date, Trafikverket has tested all three road charging technologies in various parts of the country, including Lund, Gotland, and Sandviken.
Most of the focus has been on trucks and buses and for a good reason. Electrifying the road network that connects the country’s biggest cities would reduce emissions of heavy duty vehicles by 1.2m tonnes in 2030, research estimates.
But, in 2018, Sweden began testing road charging for both commercial and passenger EVs as well on a 2km route between Stockholm’s Arlanda airport and a logistics area in Rosenberg.
The government’s plan is to deploy 2,000km of ERS on public roads by 2030 — the same year it has proposed to ban new fossil fuel-powered cars. But whether betting on e-roads constitutes a fruitful strategy remains a controversial topic.
On the one hand, electric road systems will enable longer distances to be traveled between charging station visits, increasing the adoption rate of EVs and, in turn, reducing carbon emissions.
A recent study by the Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg has further found that e-roads would also lower the demand on the grid during peak times, working as an alternative to home charging. The team also suggested that combining home (static) and on-the-go (dynamic) charging can reduce the battery size by up to 70%.
“This would reduce the need for raw materials for batteries, and an electric car could also become cheaper for the consumer,” said Sten Karlsson, co-author of the study.
There is, however, an important counterargument: the lofty investment and maintenance costs for a nascent type of infrastructure that, in the long run, may prove obsolete as battery development accelerates.
But according to the study’s findings, the risk doesn’t seem that high. The team estimates that only 25% of the national and European roads would need to be electrified for the system to work.
Sweden is not alone in developing e-roads, with Italy, France, Germany, and the UK testing the technology as well. In fact, Europe’s interconnectivity might indeed give a winning chance to an electric road network.

Swiss startup edges closer to first-ever space trash collection,Thomas Macaulay,2023/05/9,"
The first active removal of space debris has moved closer to lift-off after a new deal was inked on the landmark mission.
Swiss startup ClearSpace and French rocket giant Arianespace today announced that a launch contract has been signed for the assignment.
The mission, named ClearSpace-1, aims to capture and deorbit a chunk of garbage weighing over 100 kg. To start, the trash-collecting spacecraft will be released into a sun-synchronous orbit by the new European light launcher Vega C. 
After commissioning and critical tests, the spacecraft will be raised to the target litter, which will be disposed of through an atmospheric reentry.  
The launch is scheduled for no earlier than the second half of 2026.

Luc Piguet, the CEO and co-founder of ClearSpace, hailed the new deal as a crucial step for the project.
“This secures ClearSpace’s access to space for our trailblazing space debris removal mission,” Piguet said in a statement.
“The ClearSpace-1 mission demonstrates a turning point in the space industry as we urgently need to bring solutions to a fundamental problem: we are putting objects into space quicker than they are being removed.”

The deal between two European players also marks another milestone for the continent’s space ambitions. It comes a month after Europe was found to have surpassed the US in private spacetech investment for the first time.
More importantly, the contract brings us closer to solving a growing problem in space. At present, there are over 34,000 pieces of space debris larger than 10 centimetres — as well as about 6,500 operational satellites in orbit, a number expected to exceed 27,000 by the decade’s end.
All these objects are increasing the risk of collisions with satellites or space stations. If the build-up of trash continues at this rate, some regions of space could become unusable. And for those of us on Earth, the litter’s ruining our views of the cosmos.
If all goes to plan, ClearSpace-1 will set a benchmark for making our solar system a cleaner place.

"8 in 10 German companies still fax, study finds — but, umm, why?",Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/05/9,"
In the age of digital communication, fax machines seem as outdated as using a rotary dial phone or a cassette tape. Think about it: if a colleague asked you to fax them a document, you’d probably give them an incredulous look. But in Germany, fax machines haven’t been relegated to the history books just yet, research shows.
Digital advocacy group Bitkom surveyed 505 companies across the country and found that a whopping 82% of them still fax. Notably, one-third of the respondents said their use of the 180-year old technology is “frequent” or “very frequent.”
The intensity of use, however, is gradually declining. Last year, it was at 40%, down from 62% in 2018. Correspondingly, half of the companies now send faxes only rarely or occasionally, while 16% have stopped altogether. According to Bitkom, this data shows that faxing is — slowly but surely — nearing its end in the business world.
To fax or not to fax?
But regardless of the declining trend in use, one question still remains: why use fax machines — well beyond their heyday — instead of simply emailing or cloud sharing?
“What is most valued about the classic fax machine is above all its ability to clearly trace whether something has been sent,” said Nils Britze, Bitkom’s head of digital business processes.
Britze pointed to another factor as well: “Once a channel of communication has been established, it usually takes a while before it is completely replaced — even when much more comfortable and safer means of communication have emerged.”
From a business perspective this translates to the challenge of digitisation. According to Bitkom’s previous research, larger companies find it easier to go fully digital compared to small ones with less than 100 employees. Specifically, 42% of large companies surveyed had digitised their business processes in 2021, while 94% of smaller companies were still using paper.
From a personal perspective, postponing the fax machine replacement refers to what Jonathan Coopersmith, History Professor at Texas A&M University, calls “comfortable inertia.” That is, the people’s tendency to stick to the familiar, and in turn, their reluctance to change technologies.
So it seems that classic ol’ faxing still has some good years before becoming a relic of the past — at least in Germany.

Spotify cracks down on AI-generated music streaming fraud,Linnea Ahlgren,2023/05/9,"
According to Spotify founder Daniel Ek, the value of a company is “the sum of the problems you solve.” 
The problem of bot farms playing the same tracks over and over to manipulate streaming data may not be entirely new. However, as generative AI tools become increasingly mainstream, it is taking on a new dimension for the music industry. 
This will require streaming service providers to vigilantly predict and plan ahead not to be left playing a game of reactive whac-a-mole, desperately beating down issues as they arise. Otherwise, apart from dealing with obvious copyright controversies, they may end up paying large sums of money for millions of bot-boosted “fake streams.” 
According to a report in the Financial Times, Universal Music Group (UMG), which controls about a third of the global music market, has been sending takedown requests “left and right.” Stockholm-headquartered Spotify has obliged – at least to some degree. 
Last week, the music streaming giant temporarily ousted hundreds of thousands of songs generated on the AI platform Boomy. The California-based startup’s tool lets users create tracks by picking from a selection of styles, such as Lo-Fi or EDM, and then customise them and either record or add vocals, before uploading them to streaming services. 
However, this is not a case of making Drake rap on your track – the vocals must belong to the user. As such, the tracks were not greyed out because of copyright infringement concerns, but due to the discovery of widespread “suspicious listening activity.” 
Meanwhile, this does not mean that Spotify has completely blocked Boomy users and forbidden them from uploading new tracks. Indeed, the AI platform announced this weekend that “Boomy artists” had their curated delivery to the streaming giant re-enabled.

We are pleased to share that curated delivery to Spotify of new releases by Boomy artists has been re-enabled. 
Supporting our artists and creators who use the Boomy platform is our top priority, and we greatly appreciate your patience these past few days.
— Boomy – Create AI Music (@boomy) May 6, 2023

 
Reportedly, the two sides are still in negotiations over the reinstatement of the rest of Boomy’s catalogue. 
Fake stream farms an industry-wide issue
Spotify’s crackdown is part of an ongoing battle against bot streaming farms. Essentially, this is when a bunch of digital devices are logged in on various platforms, and simply play music 24 hours a day, often playing the same track over and over again. 
Obviously, this impacts the number of listens, directly generating revenue for the owner of the track. Meanwhile, it also affects data driven features such as charts and playlists. 
According to the streaming giant, “Artificial streaming is a longstanding, industry-wide issue that Spotify is working to stamp out across our service.”
Earlier this year, France’s Centre National de la Musique (CNM) released a study on music streaming fraud, in which Spotify participated. However, CNM called out other major streaming platforms Apple, Amazon, and YouTube as “unable or unwilling” to take part in the study. 
The first-of-its-kind study established that, in France, in 2021, between one and three billion streams, at least, were false, i.e. between 1% and 3% of total listening. Of course, plenty has happened since. 
The CNM says it will launch a new study into the matter in 2024, which may better reveal the implications of the recent revolution in access to generative AI  – and the ability of Spotify to mitigate it.
Grimes stands alone in the pro-AI camp
Over the past few months, the music streaming market has experienced a significant rise in AI-generated tracks. According to Boomy, its users have already “created” more than 14 million songs. 
Services such as those provided by Boomy, Aiva, and Soundful leverage machine learning to allow users to generate unlimited tracks and even monetise their creations on streaming platforms, to the chagrin of artists, producers, distributors, and other industry stakeholders. 
Grimes has launched an AI platform specifically for people to use her voice to make new music, stating that “Copyright sucks. Art is a conversation with everyone that has come before us. Intertwining it with the ego is a modern concept. The music industry has been defined by lawyers, and that strangles creativity.” 
Needless to say, she is quite the exception in her pro-generative AI stance in the global artist community.

Not ready for a 4-day work week? The nine-day fortnight could be for you,Suzie Coen,2023/05/9,"
You’ve heard of the four day week. Now, meet its slightly less fun but still a good time younger brother: the nine-day fortnight. It’s taking workplaces by storm, with leaders lauding this new model as a happy medium between burnout and excessive time off.
Its growing popularity is not surprising. The need for a dynamic approach to the changing landscape of the workplace isn’t just advisable, it’s a necessity.
According to an Economist report, 59% of people say they would consider taking a job with a company that offers better well-being benefits than their current employer. But, if the last few years have taught us anything, it’s that there isn’t a blueprint for flexible working policies.
Companies have experimented and continue to experiment with the models that seem best suited to their individual organisations — from the new nine day fortnight to complete location flexibility; a remote-first policy to offering employees flexibility around when they work.
What is a nine-day fortnight?
The nine-day fortnight working pattern effectively means that across 14 calendar days, nine of them are working days and five are days off.
Every other week, employees get an extra day off, often a Friday. Some companies ask employees to work longer hours on the days they’re working to allow for the extra day off, or to take a small pay cut—typically around 10%. Others say this isn’t important to them as long as their output remains consistent.
What are the benefits?
The idea is that it isn’t only a sweet deal for workers, but for employers too. Many of the benefits are similar to those of the four-day week, according to those who have tested it.
Studies have shown that reduced working hours can actually lead to higher productivity, meaning increased company profits, and improved well being among workers.
It could also help to reduce carbon emissions, improve gender equality in the workplace, help tackle unemployment and lead to a better work-life balance.
Where has it gotten substantial buzz?
Worldwide trials of flexible working models have been in operation post-Covid with mostly positive results. In Australia for instance, many workers moved to the nine-day format and took 10% pay cuts in the recession,
The model is also very common in the UK’s public sector bodies. At London Councils, a 9-day fortnight is based on a compressed working week, and allows staff to work nine working days instead of ten over a two week period—as long as the total number of hours worked meets contractual working hours.
And Public Practice, a company delivering services to support the public sector, has just concluded a six-month 9-day fortnight study where it trialled a number of approaches. These included a 10% reduction of working hours, benefits adjustments and flexibility. Once the body conducts an analysis on the impact of the trial, it will take a decision on whether it will be implemented formally.
Why should companies consider a 9-day fortnight?
Bottom line, it’s going to be hard to attract talent if you’re not offering some flexibility. Even for companies that haven’t considered four-day weeks, nine-day fortnights might work best in the long term anyway.
For some workers, four day weeks can feel quite intense. Alternating four and five-day weeks creates a better balance. With a nine-day fortnight, employees are able to switch between working styles and can adapt to how they work based on how many days their working week has, as well as enjoying quality of life improvements.
Businesses should think creatively about what type of adjusted work week works for them. Too often the options are presented as binary (a five-day or a four-day week), but there are lots of potential routes in between.
If you’re striving for a proper work-life balance this year, it’s time to explore new ambitious career paths that also offer more attractive flexible working opportunities.
Employers offering flexibility
If flexibility is key for you, or indeed new to you, it’s worth checking out roles at progressive companies like Improbable on The House of Talent Job Board.
Flexibility is deeply rooted in this British metaverse technology company’s values and culture and the majority of its workforce is hybrid. Right now it has exciting open positions on offer such as Senior Backend Engineer and a Senior Producer, both of which are entirely remote.
If you’re looking to work for a company that’s particularly focused on a hybrid work model, look no further than the European ecommerce platform Zalando with current openings in Berlin for a Senior MicroStrategy Developer and a Project & Talent Development Manager in Ansbach.
Zalando’s hybrid working model is 60% remote per week, as well as a commitment to flexible working hours. The cherry on the cake here is the opportunity to work from abroad for 30 (working) days per calendar year.
Other leading firms like the German engineer company Bertrandt AG are similarly dedicated to promoting a great work-life balance model. Open roles for Squad Lead Software Development in both Ehningen and in Hamburg come with options for mobile and flexible working hours as a standard, plus an attractive assurance of a high degree of freedom in team construction and leadership.

Dutch startup to build floating solar array at North Sea wind farm,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/04/25,"
A Dutch startup has been awarded a contract to install floating solar panels at an offshore wind farm in the North Sea. 
Oceans of Energy secured the contract from CrossWind, a joint venture between Shell and Eneco. The renewable energy startup has been tasked with building a 0.5MW floating array between wind turbines at the 750MW Hollands Kust Noord wind farm, located 18.5km off the coast of the Netherlands.  
According to the startup, which was founded in 2016 by Dutch engineer and entrepreneur Allard van Hoeken, this would be the first offshore solar farm in the world to be connected, installed, and operated within a wind farm in “high-wave conditions”.
The solar panels will be situated in between the offshore wind turbines, providing backup power on sunnier but less windy days. The panels will be moored to the wind turbines and connected to the same cables, transporting energy efficiently to end users. 
Van Hoeken says the project “will function as an example for combined offshore wind and solar parks in the future.”
The solar array will provide energy for around 500 households once it links up to the Dutch electric grid in 2025, two years after the wind farm comes online.  
Until now the startup has mainly relied on subsidies from the Dutch government, of which it has raised €20m to date. Financial details of the new contract with CrossWind, however, were not disclosed.

Oceans of Energy built a slightly larger array in 2019 which it has been using to test the technology and its ability to withstand some of the roughest seas on Earth. The rig is still operational despite being hit by some pretty severe storms over the last few years. 
Researchers from Utrecht University have closely monitored energy production at the pilot array, located around 15km off the coast of The Hague, at a testing zone known as the North Sea Farm.  
“In addition to removing the problem of a land shortage, there are several other benefits to building at sea, similar to those in wind energy,” solar energy expert Wilfried van Sark at Utrecht University, who is involved in the project, told Reuters. “There is more sun at sea and there is the added benefit of a cooling system for the panels, which boosts output by up to 15%,” he said.
According to Dutch research organisation TNO, 200 gigawatts of solar power is expected to be generated in the Netherlands by 2050, 25 of which will be on inland waters and 45 at sea. This is expected to open up many opportunities for Oceans of Energy and other budding startups like SolarDuck, a Norwegian-Dutch venture that is currently building an even bigger floating solar array in the North Sea.

Scania and Northvolt develop battery for electric trucks with 1.5 million km lifespan,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/04/25,"
Heavy truck manufacturer Scania and emerging EV battery powerhouse Northvolt have developed a battery for electric trucks that they say will last as long as the vehicles themselves — about 1.5 million kilometres.
The lithium-ion battery is the product of a five-year partnership between the two Swedish companies that began in 2017. ​​At the time, Scania was on the lookout for more robust, cost-efficient, and sustainable battery cells for its heavy-duty trucks and buses — and Northvolt was poised to deliver. 
“Northvolt’s mission to build the world’s greenest batteries perfectly matched Scania’s purpose to drive the shift towards sustainable transport,” said Scania’s CEO Christian Levin in a statement.
The lithium-ion cell was produced at Northvolt’s Ett gigafactory in north Sweden, which opened last year and runs entirely on renewable hydro and wind power. As a result, the partners estimate the battery has a carbon footprint of approximately one-third that of a comparative industry equivalent.  
The cell’s long lifespan also makes it one of the most durable and long-lasting batteries in the electric vehicle industry. Most EV batteries on the market today are only estimated to last between 150,000-300,000 km. 
“At the outset of this partnership, Northvolt and Scania agreed to an ambitious timeline for the development of a high-performance battery cell which would enable their plans for electrifying heavy transport,” said Peter Carlsson, CEO and Co-Founder of Northvolt. “To have proceeded through extensive development and validation phases, and now be delivering cells from Northvolt Ett which exceed our initial expectations in terms of performance is a tremendous accomplishment for everyone involved.” 
Northvolt’s Ett gigafactory in Sweden’s icy north made Europe’s first ever domestically produced lithium-ion battery in 2022. The factory, which employees around 500 people, covers an area three times the size of the iconic Pentagon building in the US. Credit: Northvolt
Northvolt will start mass production of the truck batteries at its Ett gigafactory imminently. Over the next few years, Northvolt aims to increase capacity at Ett to 60 GWh to supply clients like Volkswagen, BMW, Volvo and, of course, Scania. 
In addition, Scania will open a new battery factory in Södertälje, Sweden, next year, where Northvolt’s battery cells will be assembled into battery packs for the start of production of heavy-duty electric trucks. Developing long-lasting batteries is seen as an important milestone on the company’s electrification roadmap, which aims for electric vehicles to make up 50% of sales by 2030. 
Other automakers in the EV heavy vehicle space include Tesla, which is developing an electric semi truck imaginatively dubbed ‘Tesla Semi’, and Volvo, which is already distributing its electric trucks to customers throughout Europe. Swedish startup Einride, considered a competitor to the Tesla Semi, is taking the tech a step further with its plans to roll out fully autonomous electric trucks. 
While electric heavy vehicles only made up 0.6% of sales in Europe last year, accounting firm PWC predicts that they will account for one-third of all truck sales in Europe by 2030, and 70% by 2035,  due to tightening regulations on fossil fuel-powered vehicles and the falling costs of cleaner alternatives.

How travel businesses can leverage generative AI solutions,Singapore Tourism Board,2023/04/25,"
Everyone is talking about the potential of generative AI as buzzworthy tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E make the headlines. But just what is generative AI and is there actually a use for these tools within the tourism sector?
First of all, it’s important to note that, although ChatGPT is one of the most popular examples of generative AI on the market right now, there are many examples of tools employing this technology. Second, while the adoption of AI in general has been growing, this technology represents a new leap forward. Generative AI is seen as a breakthrough within the AI space because it goes beyond simply identifying and categorising past data, and uses this information to create original content.
For example, DALL-E and Midjourney have taken the design world by storm, being able to generate unique images in just a few clicks.
Generative AI has also helped to improve chatbots. Rather than spitting out simple, formulaic answers, this technology can analyse customers’ queries at a deeper level and generate more personalised responses, increasing both accuracy and response rate.
One important misconception to keep in mind is that these tools are not necessarily free. For example, while a free version of ChatGPT is available, OpenAI (the company behind the tool) recently introduced ChatGPT Plus with unlimited access and additional features for businesses which costs $20 USD a month. Other generative AI ventures, from advanced chatbots to generative design layouts, will likely include a price tag from the startups and design firms employing this technology. However, if used early and strategically, generative AI could help give your business a leg above the competition.
Let’s dive deeper into the specific opportunities this technology could present to the tourism sector including improving customer experience, reach, security, and more.
Leverage generative AI to transform venue design
One way the hospitality, MICE, and attractions industries can leverage this technology is by taking advantage of its generative design capabilities to come up with new layouts and concepts, and design for specific needs like security or minimising congestion.
Whether you want to redesign your hotel lobby to increase foot traffic to the spa and other amenities or you have a sustainability-focused redesign in mind, these smart tools can be used as a jumping off point. By inputting parameters such as square footage, location, target audience, and style, generative AI can be used to automatically create multiple design options for a hotel’s interior and exterior.


By analysing behaviour and purchase history, this tech can create dynamic customer segments.


MICE and attractions planners can also use this technology to design layout concepts that are optimised to encourage traffic flow and minimise congestion or security risks. Using generative AI can help professionals be more time and resource efficient, automating certain aspects of the planning process, while providing a variety of event and attraction design options with visitor demographics and venue characteristics in mind.
Virtual tours can also be developed using generative AI, creating immersive and interactive experiences for potential guests, attendees, and visitors in significantly less time. For example, imagine being able to explore a hotel’s facilities and amenities online before booking.
Generative design studios are just taking off in Singapore. For example, Digital Blue Foam was one of the first that launched a web-based interactive generative design tool in December 2021. Both Nanyang Technological University and Singapore University of Technology and Design are also offering courses in generative design, signalling this trend is only set to grow in the future.
Deliver better service with human+AI collaboration
Chatbots have already entered the scene providing answers to customers’ frequently asked questions in no time, but sophisticated generative AI tools are now helping to take this a step further. Rather than simply answering prepopulated queries, chatbots can now serve as a pocket guide able to provide customers with personalised itineraries, travel tips, and more throughout their trip.
The heightened level of personalisation is something that enhances the experience for customers and saves staff time, especially when dealing with shortages. Generative AI chatbots can also be programmed to respond in a customers’ native language streamlining accessibility for international guests.
In addition to catering to customers’ needs, these tools can analyse data from past interactions and generate deeper insights for a business’ long term strategy. This is beneficial for revenue management, helping businesses optimise their pricing, develop new revenue models for the future, and even automate dynamic pricing to offer relevant rates for customers.
For example, generative AI is being used to advance predictive customer segmentation. By analysing patterns in past behaviour and purchase history, this technology can more accurately create dynamic customer segments. Going beyond this, it can also use this information to come up with personalised offers and other upselling opportunities.


All in all, a human still needs to operate and moderate it.


One company experiencing the success of human+AI collaboration is TUI. Their new AI customer assistant, Louise, has a 95% opt-in rate with around 500-600 customers using the service monthly. Hosted by Netherlands-based startup Zoey, Louise offers an empathy-driven Whatsapp service that utilises AI alongside human expertise. Unlike other chatbots, when asked a question from a customer, Louise searches an extensive database to provide the best personalised recommendations and answers.
Brit Haarmans, Innovation Lead at TUI says, “it feels like talking to a friend, and I think that’s the benefit of using agents in combination with AI.”
With its package holidays, TUI provides physical representatives at its various resort and hotel destinations, however this isn’t offered for other product lines like its city trips. Haarmans explains, “we wanted to add value to our holiday products where we are less present in the customer journey.” With Louise, it’s as if customers have a representative with them at every step of their trip.
Every morning Louise will proactively offer tips for the day based on the traveller (if they’re on a family or work trip for example). Users can then interact with the chatbot saying, “Instead I’d like to go to the beach, do you have some tips for me?” Or, “Today I’d like to visit these attractions, can you give me some background and booking information?” It also connects to Google Maps, and some excursions are directly bookable via Louise, making things even smoother for both the customer and the agent.
Keep in mind that humans will always be needed
While generative AI represents an exciting new frontier of opportunities, the most important thing to remember is that it’s not a replacement for human staff, but a helper. Human prompt generators and moderators will always be needed.
When it comes to using AI chatbots, Haarmans advises: “It takes a lot of time to train AI, especially if you want it to answer in a personalised way.” An AI can’t sense the emotion or undertone in a message in the way a human can, so humans continue to be essential in moderating responses. TUI has a team who moderate and edit Louise’s responses and also feed in additional information when needed to provide more accurate results.
The same goes for predictive design. While generative AI may be able to put out a number of different and exciting layouts in seconds, it’s still likely that it can miss important considerations that haven’t been included in the prompt. For example, creating a perfectly sustainable, modern, and congestion free hotel lobby, but forgetting to include restroom facilities in the layout.
An AI solution might be able to give you answers quickly but, all in all, a human still needs to operate and moderate it, and ultimately make business decisions based on the information it gives them.
All in all human-AI collaboration can provide the best of both worlds: the precision and intel gathered from the AI, along with the empathetic, personalised touch of a human moderator.

Swedish startup wants €1.5BN to build emissions-free steel plant,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/04/24,"
Swedish startup H2 Green Steel has announced its plans to raise more than €1.5bn in equity funding to build steel plants that emit virtually no emissions.
The startup, backed by high-profile investors such as Mercedes, Maersk, and Spotify’s chief executive, is constructing a ‘green steel’ manufacturing plant in Boden, north Sweden. 
Construction of the plant will be financed through more than €5bn in debt and equity. The startup said in October that it had received support from European financial institutions for €3.5bn in debt financing, making it one of the most capitalised climate tech projects in Europe. 
H2 Green Steel confirmed today that it is now in the process of securing the remaining €1.5bn equity funding and is working with advisers from Morgan Stanley, Financial Times reports. 
Traditionally, steel is made by combining iron ore with coke (a type of coal) at extremely high temperatures. The burning coke produces carbon monoxide, which converts the iron ore into ‘pig iron’ — the basis of steel. The only problem is, when the coke burns it produces a lot of CO2. In fact, the steel industry as a whole is responsible for an estimated 8% of global CO2 emissions. 
H2 Green Steel looks to decarbonise steelmaking by replacing coke with ‘green’ hydrogen (hydrogen produced using renewable energy). Hydrogen reacts with the iron ore to create pig iron — but without the emissions. The only by-product, the startup says, would be water vapour.

The hydrogen itself would be made in an electrolyser at the Boden site. The electrolyser would be powered by ​​renewable energy, including hydropower from the Lule River and nearby wind farms. Overall, this process is predicted to slash steelmaking emissions by 95%.    
If successful, the Boden plant will be the first large-scale green steel plant in Europe, with its products used to construct everything from cars and cargo ships to buildings and bridges. The startup expects to roll out the first commercial batches of its steel by 2025 and aims to produce five million tonnes of green steel a year by 2030. 
However, global annual steel production is currently around 2,000 million tonnes, according to figures from the World Steel Association. This would make the production capacity of the Boden plant a mere “drop in the sea,” Ms Lund Waagsaether, senior policy advisor at the Brussels-based climate think tank E3G, told the BBC.  
But the Boden plant isn’t the only one of its kind in the pipeline. H2 Green Steel has already signed an agreement with Spanish company Iberdrola to build a plant powered by solar power on the Iberian peninsula. Hybrit, another Swedish company, hopes to open a fossil-free green steel plant by 2026 in a joint venture with mining operator LKAB, Nordic steel company SSAB, and energy company Vattenfall. GravitHy plans to open a hydrogen-based plant in France in 2027, and German steel giant Thyssenkrupp recently said it aims to introduce carbon-neutral production at all its plants by 2045.
These projects are set to boost Europe’s domestic production of green steel, and could soon have political backing too. The EU is in the process of finalising the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a strategydesigned to make it more expensive for European companies to import cheaper, non-green steel from other parts of the world.

Irish startup and CERN join forces on experimental energy transmission project,Thomas Macaulay,2023/04/24,"
An Irish startup has teamed with CERN to develop a new form of insulation for superconducting cables, which are designed to accelerate the green energy transition.
Named SuperNode, the company has invented energy transmission cables that can transfer immense power across long distances. As the system requires less space and voltage than conventional copper-based cables, the environmental impact is reduced.
These benefits derive from superconductivity. This phenomenon occurs when certain materials are cooled below their critical temperature — typically -180°C for high-temperature superconductors. As a result, superconductors can offer a hefty power density and zero electrical losses.
To harness this potential, SuperNode needs unique scientific resources — which is where CERN comes in.
“In its research, CERN pushes the limit of superconductivity to reach record energy levels and operates one of the largest vacuum systems in the world,” said CERN’s Paolo Chiggiato in a statement.
“In particular, to avoid collisions with residual gas molecules inside the accelerators, we must reach extreme levels of vacuum. Vacuum is also used at CERN as a thermal insulator for our superconducting magnets. We believe that this know-how can be successfully applied to evaluate the technological solutions proposed to insulate the superconducting cables developed by SuperNode.”
To test the tech, CERN will subject candidate materials to temperatures, pressures, and environments that replicate the conditions that the cables will face. CERN will also design and develop a novel test rig to validate scale prototypes. Eventually, the rig will be installed at SuperNode’s Dublin headquarters — dubbed the European Cryogenic Centre for Superconductors.
A study commissioned by SuperNode found that an integrated pan-European energy grid could reduce energy costs by 32%. Credit: SuperNode
The tie-up with CERN caps a busy month for SuperNode. Last week, the company announced that shareholders Aker Horizons and Dr Eddie O’Connor had committed €16 million of extra money towards developing the tech. The new funding followed a previous €14m cash injection made last year.
John Fitzgerald, CEO of SuperNode, believes adding CERN to the mix will provide a further boost.
“To meet increasing electricity demands, future transmission grids will have to reliably transfer bulk electricity over distances of hundreds of kilometres — connecting consumption hubs with areas of production, which are often located far away,” he said.
“We believe that by working together, we can find innovative solutions to improve the world’s energy infrastructure. Without new grid technology, we cannot integrate the level of renewables governments across the world have targeted and we will not achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement”.
SuperNode says its system is more efficient, cheaper, and better for the environment than any other viable alternative. Credit: SuperNode
The collaboration also comes at a historical moment for CERN. The lab has just taken its first steps towards building a 91 km-long particle accelerator. The new system would more than triple the length of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) — currently the world’s largest and most powerful particle collider — which will complete its mission around 2040.
The plans were revealed amid growing competition for Europe’s leading position in the field.
The most notable rival is China, which also intends to build the world’s largest particle accelerator. CERN’s Malika Meddahi told AFP last week that “China displays the same ambition” as Europe.
“Let’s be vigilant and be sure that we are not on the verge of a change in this hierarchy,” she said.
Some concerns have also been raised over the enormous cost of the new collider. Critics worry that the investment in fundamental science would be better spent in applied sciences. But the collaboration with SuperNode is further evidence that CERN’s work can lead to practical applications.

Icelandic startup bags €6M EU grant to fight drug-resistant infections,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/04/24,"
Reykjavik-based Akthelia Pharmaceuticals and the University of Iceland have been awarded a €6m grant by Horizon Europe to combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR). This occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites evolve and no longer respond to medicines, making infections harder to treat.
AMR is listed among the WHO’s most pressing health threats of our time, with the potential to give rise to the next global pandemic as “pan-drug”-resistant strains emerge. It’s also estimated that AMR associated infections already contribute to approximately 5 million deaths per year — more than AIDS/HIV or malaria.
Now, the EU-funded IN-ARMOR project, led by Aktelia and the University of Iceland, aims to tackle this challenge in collaboration with eight other universities and institutes and six companies across Europe.
The project’s aim is to develop a new type of drug that will boost the body’s natural immune response, also known as “innate immunity.” It will address infections caused by bacteria, viruses, and fungi.
IN-ARMOR will tap into Aktelia’s R&D on innate immunity and antimicrobial peptides – short protein chains that play a key role in the immune systems of mammals, including humans. The startup‘s work builds on the research of the University of Iceland, which is one the company’s owners.
The project will develop the new medicine using computer-aided drug design and in-silico approaches. It will harness nanotechnology to target drugs to specific areas within the body, extending their effectiveness and reducing side effects.
Upon completion, IN-ARMOR will move to clinical validation. The team hopes that the new drug could be used not only in combination with other antibiotics, but also by itself.
“By concentrating on stimulating the body’s innate defences against infection, we can avoid the use of traditional antibiotics and develop revolutionary new treatments to tackle multiresistant bacteria. This could save countless lives across the world,” said Guðmundur Hrafn Guðmundsson, professor at the University of Iceland and CSO at Akthelia.
If successful, IN-ARMOR would have the potential to save long-term €107 billion in antibiotics development. Furthermore, it would reduce the global disease burden by 97 million DALYs — the years of life lost due to premature mortality or the years lived with a disability as a result of a disease.

Reddit expands its European operation with a new hub in Amsterdam,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/04/20,"
Following its European expansion in Dublin, London, and Berlin in the past few years, Reddit is now opening its first regional sales hub in Amsterdam.
Centrally located in the wider European market, adjacent to countries with a strong customer base such as Germany and France, and breeding a competitive talent pool, the Dutch capital emerged as the perfect location to further drive the growth the US-based company has seen in Western Europe.
The hub’s mission is to bring together the platform’s EMEA markets in a central location and support a wide array of customers spread across Europe in meeting their advertising goals. It will house over 50 employees in sales and engineering, and serve as the home base for the EMEA Ads Engineering team as well.
According to Susanne Mostertman, EMEA Head of Mid-Market and Small Business (SMB) Sales, who will be leading the hub, the company plans to significantly growth both the sales and engineering teams by the end of 2023, and Amsterdam will be Reddit’s largest office in continental Europe by employee number.
“We know from our research that Reddit users in Europe are open to seeing ads or content from brands on the platform, and are more likely to trust a brand that participates on Reddit than brands they see advertising on other platforms,” Mosterstman told TNW. “By expanding our footprint in Amsterdam — and Europe more broadly — we’re able to better connect Reddit’s audience with brands they’re interested in and care about.”
This new chapter of Reddit in Europe, Mostertman added, enables the platform to focus on the teams and resources that can best attend to its advertisers in the region “with local and country-specific experts ready to provide tailored guidance.”
These efforts will not only support large advertisers such as Google, Warner Bros., and reMarkable, but European startups as well. The Amsterdam hub is already working together with a number of existing partners, including payment provider Klarna and refurbished device marketplace Back Market.
“Partnering with Reddit has allowed us to reach out to a wide variety of communities — from tech to fashion and everything in between — to encourage responsible shopping at the right time,” said Salah Said, Head of Sustainability at Klarna.
Reddit’s new European office will located in Amsterdam’s Plantage neighbourhood in the city centre. Hiring is still ongoing and the company plans to host a recruiting event later this spring.

European mission to explore the dark universe sets sail for launch site,Thomas Macaulay,2023/04/19,"
The European Space Agency (ESA)’s Euclid satellite has taken another step on its journey to explore the dark universe.
On 15 April, Euclid set sail for a port near its launch location in Cape Canaveral, Florida, the ESA announced today. 
The spacecraft is expected to reach the take-off site at the beginning of May. The launch is due to take place on a SpaceX Falcon 9 in July.
After lift-off, Eulic will travel 1.5 million km from Earth to the Lagrange point L2, an auspicious location for studying deep space. From L2, it will start investigating the dark universe.
ESA has grand ambitions for the mission. The agency wants to map the large-scale structure of the universe. It also aims to shed light on the power of dark matter and dark energy, which makes up an estimated 95% of the universe.
To delve into these mysteries, Euclid plans to create the largest, most accurate 3D map of the universe ever. The satellite will observe billions of galaxies up to 10 billion light-years away, covering more than a third of the sky.
The map will offer insights into how the universe has expanded, and how its structure has evolved over cosmic history. It will also reveal more about the role played by gravity, and the nature of dark energy and dark matter.

The prime contractor for Euclid is Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales of France and Leonardo of Italy. The company is one of Europe’s leading satellite manufacturers.
In total, more than 80 European companies are involved in the mission. They include Airbus Defense and Space, which built the telescope — the main instrument of the payload module.


“Every aspect of this project is a real challenge.

.
Before its journey, Euclid underwent a rigorous testing program at Thales Alenia Space’s Cannes plant.
“In recent months, we focused on the thermal vacuum, mechanical, and electromagnetic compatibility tests,” said Laurent Sanna, Assembly Integration and Test Systems Manager for Euclid in Cannes.
“Our main challenge was to perform these tests while staying on the tight schedule and accommodating changes in the baseline launcher. Because Euclid’s performance requirements are so demanding, every aspect of this project is a real challenge.”
After the tests, the satellite was sealed in a transport container, which was flushed with nitrogen to maintain a clean room environment. The temperature, pressure, and humidity will be monitored throughout the journey.
The satellite was then taken by convoy to the port of Savona, Italy. On arrival, it boarded a ship to Florida. From there, the journey into the dark universe will truly begin.

"European VC fundraising on pace for lowest total since 2015, study finds",Thomas Macaulay,2023/04/18,"
It’s been a tough start to the year for tech investments. According to a new report, European VC fundraising is on pace for its lowest annual total since 2015.
Research by PitchBook, a financial data firm, found that European VC funds raised over €20bn in each of the past four years — but only €3.4bn in Q1 2023. Total VC deal value fell 32% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) to €11.8bn. Deal count, meanwhile, dropped 19%.
Pitchbook called the quarter “the first substantial decline” from the pace set in the past four years.
“The VC ecosystem could finally be displaying the effects of the challenging fundraising conditions,” the study authors wrote. “Capital investment into startups has slowed, and if muted exits markets persist, returns will be stifled and long-term capital commitments could be harmed.”
The analysts found that exit activity had also plummeted. Amid adverse macroeconomic conditions and weaker valuations, substantial VC exits effectively ceased in Q1. Pitchbook expects the activity to remain quiet for the next few quarters.
In Q1, the preferred route to exit was via mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Four out of the five largest exits in the quarter were through M&A. Such exits tend to be smaller, but they offer increased security and synergies — which can be crucial for startups facing economic uncertainty.
Public listings, meanwhile, have lost appeal due to the dangers of choppy markets. According to Pitchbook, they’re unlikely to pick up until inflation cools, interest rate hikes cease, and business confidence re-emerges.
In Q1 2023, European VC activity generated only €1.6 billion in exit value — a 69.6% QoQ decline.
Pitchbook’s report echoes the findings of other analysts. According to research by Dealroom, just over 2,300 European funding rounds closed in Q1 2023 — the lowest number since 2016. 
The decline comes amid concerns over high inflation, monetary policy tightening, and the stability of the financial system. In these challenging economic times, investors and operators are prioritising capital efficiency and robust paths to profitability.
With focuses shifting from growth to cost bases, layoffs became extensive in Q1. Pitchbook expects this trend to continue as companies seek to extend runways during 2023.
Despite the gloom, there are signs of hope in emerging areas of tech. Notably, Europe surpassed the US in private spacetech investment during Q1, while quantum computing raised a continental record $220m, according to Dealroom. 
Pitchbook is also confident about the prospects for the resurgent energy sector. Near-term interest and long-term climate targets in Europe are creating new opportunities for backers and startups in the industry.
“We believe deal activity in the clean energy subsector will continue to grow as renewable energy sources are developed globally,” said Pitchbook’s analysts.

EU lawmakers fear AI is moving too fast — and call for global oversight,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/04/18,"
A group of 12 Members of the European Parliament working on the EU’s upcoming AI Act, are rallying for a set of preliminary rules to control the advancement of AI systems. They warn that technological progress is “faster and more unpredictable” than expected.
“The recent advent of and widespread public access to powerful AI, alongside the exponential performance improvements over the last year of AI trained to generate complex content, has prompted us to pause and reflect on our work,” state the MEPs in an open letter.
Correspondingly, they believe that a complementary series of preliminary rules is also needed to regulate the growth and deployment of “powerful” general purpose AI.
The signatories are, therefore, calling on European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and US President Joe Biden to hold a global AI summit where world leaders can decide on an number of governing principles that will steer the development and use of powerful AI, while ensuring it’s “human-centric, safe, and trustworthy.”
The MEPs are also calling on companies and laboratories working on the technology to demonstrate a high sense of responsibility, increase transparency, and collaborate with policymakers.
The letter lands at a time when individual EU members are already trying to manage the operation of advanced AI models  in lack of an overarching legislation. For instance, France, Spain, and Italy have opened investigations into OpenAI’s ChatGPT over data privacy concerns — with the latter even imposing a temporary ban.
The MEPs warn that political inaction “can widen the gap between the development of AI and our ability to steer it,” asking for the mobilisation of industry, research, and decision-makers in Europe and worldwide. But at the same time, the AI Act has been in draft form for nearly two years now.
According to Reuters, the act is currently being debated by a parliamentary committee, which hopes to reach a common position by April 26.
Concerns about AI’s exponential growth have been expressed across the Atlantic as well. In an open letter by the Future of Life Institute (FLI), over 26,000 signatories — including researchers at DeepMind, computer scientist Yoshua Bengio, and Elon Musk — have called on AI labs for a six-month pause in the development of systems more powerful than GPT-4, ChatGPT’s successor. 
And while the EU MEPs find a number of the letter’s statements “unnecessarily alarmist,” they agree with its core message: the rapid evolution of powerful AI requires political attention to prevent challenging future scenarios.
"
Mammoth meatball beef exposes foodtech’s patent problem,Thomas Macaulay,2023/04/6,"
A bitter feud has erupted over who first resurrected the woolly mammoth — as a meatball.
The de-extinct delicacy was unveiled last week at Nemo Science Museum in the Netherlands. Naturally, no mammoths were harmed in the making of this product — and nor were any other animals. In lieu of dead flesh, an Australian startup called Vow produced the meatball from DNA.
First, the team identified the DNA sequence for mammoth myoglobin, a protein that creates a meaty taste. To fill in some gaps in the sequence, they added genetic data from the African elephant — the pachyderm’s closest living relative. Using a low-current and high-voltage charge, they then inserted the gene into stem cells from a sheep. Finally, they multiplied and moulded the cells into a pasty.

It certainly looks the part, but did it pass the taste test? It seems an essential question, but it’s sadly one that remains unanswered. To the disappointment of daring diners, the meatball isn’t ready for human consumption.
That anticlimactic outcome sparked accusations that the whole endeavour was a publicity stunt. But the project team insists that their experiment serves an important purpose: showcasing cultivated meat’s potential to transform the food industry. They note that food production creates copious greenhouse gases and biodiversity loss. Cultivated meat, they argue, offers a sustainable alternative.
“Our aim is to start a conversation about how we eat, and what the future alternatives can look and taste like,” said Bas Korsten, a marketing executive who initiated the project. “Cultured meat is meat, but not as we know it. It’s the future.”
The meatball was created as a launchpad for the tech — and for Vow. With apparent justification, the company now claims it’s rewriting the rules of food. But a rival claims it’s also rewriting the rules of decency.

As Vow was being lauded in the Netherlands, a very different reaction was brewing across the border.
In Belgium, a scaleup called Paleo was considering legal action. The company was enraged by claims that Vow had showcased a mammoth protein for the first time.
Paleo argues that it developed the myoglobin tech two years earlier. The company had also filed patent applications at that time, which Paleo says have been publically available to competitors for almost a year.
Paleo contacted Vow before the event in the Netherlands. According to the Belgian scaleup, Vow’s legal team argued that the mammoth meatball “was not food” and dismissed Paleo’s claims.
“When we learned about the event, we were surprised,” said Hermes Sanctorum, CEO of Paleo. “We sent out a press release nine months ago to announce that we developed the exact same mammoth protein (myoglobin), based on our fundamental research and innovation.
“When Vow claim that no one has tasted mammoth myoglobin, this is simply not true. We developed the mammoth myoglobin and we tasted it in our lab.”

Vow has dismissed the allegations.
“The technology and innovation involved in Vow’s creation and presentation of the ‘mammoth meatball’ owes nothing to any technology or alleged invention by Paleo,” the company said in a statement.
“The ‘mammoth meatball’ was conceived, developed and created entirely by the hard work and ingenuity of Vow’s own scientists (and collaborators) and using a combination of publicly available genetic data and Vow’s own proprietary production processes.”
Paleo expressed some satisfaction with the response. The company said Vow had confirmed that it had not, in fact, showcased mammoth myoglobin for the first time. Nonetheless, Paleo feels that Vow crossed a red line — but the patents could prove difficult to enforce.

According to Vow, it has only been accused of adopting the idea of creating something with mammoth myoglobin. Vow argues that Paleo has no basis to claim that idea as its own. 
In addition, the startup notes that an examiner at the European Patent Office deemed Paleo’s patent application was likely invalid.  The Australian company described the application as an “attempted landgrab of outrageous proportions.”
“Patent rights exist in order to protect innovation and can (if granted and valid) protect truly new, innovative and proprietary ideas; but Paleo do not have any such patent rights,” Vow said in its statement. “Paleo has no granted patent in relation to mammoth myoglobin and therefore has no legitimate claim.”
Vow also criticised the pending application. If granted, the startup warned that the patent would prevent companies from using myoglobin from a wide range of animals — including pig, sheep, cow, chicken, tuna, and, of course, mammoth — as a meat substitute or food ingredient.
The feud will rumble on for now. Regardless of the outcome, the dispute has exposed the complexities of patenting food innovations.

Swedish startup unveils first ‘origami’ e-motorcycle — and €15K price tag,Thomas Macaulay,2023/04/4,"
What do you get when you mix motorcycles with origami? The answer, dear reader, is the Stilride 1.
The unique vehicle is the brainchild of Swedish startup Stilride. The company today unveiled the final design and price for the new electric ride, which is due to launch in 2024.
For €15,000, each customer will get a made-to-order motorcycle that combines looks, performance, and sustainability.
To manufacture each vehicle, Stilride uses a pioneering method dubbed “industrial origami,” which applies the Japanese art of paper-folding to sheet metal. The startup’s software first defines the geometries, which industrial robots and laser-cutting then bring to life. 
For the Stilride 1, the entire process requires a single sheet of stainless steel. As it’s folded instead of welded, minimal pollutants are produced.  To further minimise the environmental impact, the bike is produced locally from a small number of parts. It’s also lightweight, which reduces energy consumption.


“It’s been designed for both the motorcycle enthusiast and the design and sustainability purist.


 Tue Beijer, CTO and co-founder at Stilride, wants the bike to set “a new gold standard” for electric mobility.
“The Stilride 1 is the culmination of many years’ ambition, passion, and experimentation, distilled into a deliciously unconventional lightweight electric motorcycle that isn’t only a feat of engineering, but a work of art,” Beijer said in a statement. “It has been designed for both the motorcycle enthusiast and the design and sustainability purist.”
But does it pass the eye test? You can judge that for yourself in the gallery below:

The aesthetics modernise the previous design, which my colleague Ioanna compared to “an origami duck.” To my eyes, the new model looks more like the steel lovechild of a Vespa and an electric guitar. 
Regardless, looks aren’t everything on the road. In terms of specs, the Stilride 1 features an ultra-lightweight chassis made from recycled Swedish steel, a premium HUB motor system, single shock absorber and multi-link rear suspension, and a braking system that was co-developed with ISR. 
There’s also a compelling connectivity system. The motorcycle’s Electric Vehicle Control Unit (eVCU) powers various features through the Stilcontrol app, which provides theft protection, geographical positioning, service diagnostics, and battery status control. 
You can find further technical details in the image below:
The motorcycles will be built in Stilride’s Stockholm-based pilot production facility.
The specs and price are certainly eye-catching — but will they convince you to splash your hard-earned cash? Let us know via the usual channels.
If your answer’s yes, the launch date for the Stilride 1 will be announced this summer. And if you’re interested in early access, you can get more information on Stilride’s website.

Italy’s ChatGPT ban sets a worrying precedent for EU startups,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/04/4,"
OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which took the world by the storm after its launch in November, is now facing a temporary ban in Italy over “unlawful” personal data collection and the lack of an age verification system for children.
The Italian data protection agency, known as Garante, was prompted to act by ChatGPT’s data breach on March 20, which, according to OpenAI, allowed a number of users to see other users’ information, such as their first and last name, email address, and the last four digits of their credit card number.
Garante accused the US-based AI company of having “no legal basis” that justifies “the massive collection and processing of personal data” it needs to “train the algorithms on which the platform relies.” It also added that the lack of an age verification mechanism exposes children to “inappropriate” responses.
As a result, on Friday, the Italian regulator opened an investigation into OpenAI and has temporarily blocked access to GhatGPT in the country.
In response, OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altam tweeted that GhatGPT has ceased its services in Italy, stating, however, that he didn’t think the company had violated any privacy laws.

We of course defer to the Italian government and have ceased offering ChatGPT in Italy (though we think we are following all privacy laws).
Italy is one of my favorite countries and I look forward to visiting again soon!
— Sam Altman (@sama) March 31, 2023

Open AI has 16 days to respond with appropriate safety measures, or it could risk either a fine of up to €20 million or 4% of its total worldwide annual turnover.
Rising concerns
ChatGPT’s stirring capabilities are breeding growing concerns over the exponential advancement of generative AI.
In late March, the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) called for EU and national authorities to investigate OpenAI’s system.
“For all the benefits AI can bring to our society, we are currently not protected enough from the harm it can cause people,” Ursula Pachl, Deputy Director General of BEUC, said in a statement.
The organisation fears that until the union’s AI Act takes effect, consumers will be at risk of harm from a technology which is not sufficiently regulated, and for which they’re not prepared.
Across the Atlantic, an open letter signed by AI experts and industry executives called for AI labs to immediately pause for at least six months the training of systems more powerful than GPT-4, ChatGPT’s successor.
The signatories — including researchers at DeepMind, computer scientist Yoshua Bengio, and Elon Musk — highlighted the need for regulatory policies, stressing that “powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable.”
Tech industry opposition
The Italian regulator’s move to suspend access to ChatGPT could lead to a loss of economic opportunities in the country, Daniele Servadei, founder of Bologna-based SaaS ecommerce startup Sellix, told TNW.
“It limits the development and growth of the AI and tech sectors, preventing local companies from harnessing the technology,” he said.
Servadei further noted that the ban could have” a chilling effect” on AI development in Italy and beyond, “as developers and investors may fear future bans or restrictions on their products, which could hinder innovation and investment in the sector.”
Simone Basso, Chief Product and Technology Officer at Milan-based travel scaleup WeRoad, also stressed the potential negative impact on local businesses.
“ChatGPT has enhanced productivity for teams at WeRoad and worldwide, but recent decisions in Italy — from banning research on synthetic meat to holding back 5G rollouts — have hindered the country’s technology, innovation, and productivity growth,” Basson told TNW.
Basson added that while consumers can circumvent Garante’s restrictions using a VPN, companies with solutions based on such technologies “face uncertainty” and will be forced to prioritise other markets.
Is Italy setting a precedent for Europe?
While ChatGPT was already unavailable in mainland China, Hong Kong, Iran, Russia, and parts of Africa, Italy is the first Western country to take action against the AI system.
Germany could soon follow Italy’s lead, Ulrich Kelber, the German data protection commissioner, told Handelsblatt.
Meanwhile, authorities in France and Ireland are in contact with the Italian regulator, Reuters reports.
“We are following up with the Italian regulator,” said a spokesperson for Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner. “We will coordinate with all EU data protection authorities in relation to this matter.”
The regulators’ concerns about ChatGPT — along with its popularity, as the fastest-growing consumer app in history — singal the need for co-ordinated and transparent EU policies that regulate the use and development of large language models.
It’s still unclear how ChatGPT and similar models will be impacted by the EU’s impending AI Act, which aims to strike a tricky balance between safety and innovation.

Spain launches space agency in big boost for local startups,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/04/4,"
Spain has officially launched its own national space agency, at a time when Europe looks to establish itself as a global space industry leader.
Plans for the Spanish Space Agency, or Agencia Espacial Española (AEE), were first announced in May 2021, and finally got the political thumbs up last month.
The agency will be based in Seville, near the Arenosillo launch facility in Huelva, which was built in the 60s as part of a collaboration between the Spanish government and NASA. Initially, around 75 personnel will be based at the site. 
The agency will serve to “guarantee Spain’s strategic action in the field of space, both from the point of view of its technological development and the use of space in areas such as security, Earth observation, geolocation, and telecommunications,” according to a statement from Spain’s Ministry of Science and Innovation. 
“Space is a priority and strategic area, essential to help and protect our society in fields as diverse as cybersecurity, navigation, the fight against climate change, or the monitoring of phenomena such as drought or fires,” the statement continued. 
Minister for Science and Innovation, Diana Morant, has allocated the new agency an initial budget of more than €700m in 2023. 
The minister has also made €45m available to fund the development of a domestic microlauncher. This class of launch vehicle, Morant said, is “the commercial future of the space sector.” 
Currently, the most likely contender to receive the funding is PLD Space. Founded in 2011, the Spanish startup has developed a suborbital microlauncher, named Miura 1, that will be capable of delivering commercial payloads to space and back. It is set to launch as early as this month.
Spain has a long history in the space industry. It is one of the founding members of the European Space Agency (ESA) and has a thriving spacetech ecosystem. As of 2019, 12% of the total 400+ investors in the global private space industry — dubbed ‘new space’ — were based in Spain.
In addition to frontrunners PLD Space, startups to watch include Barcelona-based Zero 2 Infinity, which has developed a balloon-borne launcher, Madrid-based ienai GO, a space industry software provider, and Bilbao-based SATLANTIS, which is developing AI-enabled payloads for microsatellites. 
The launch of the Spanish Space Agency is undoubtedly a major boost to these startups and the country’s spacetech industry as a whole, and comes as Europe looks to catch up with the US, Russia, and China in the global space race.

Meet the finalists of the TNW València startup pitch battle,Thomas Macaulay,2023/04/2,"
Some of Europe’s hottest startups arrived at TNW València last week to develop ideas, expand networks, create new leads, and — and most importantly of all — fight.
Not in the physical sense, of course, but in a fiercely-contested TNW València pitch battle. After surviving a series of fiery knockout clashes, eight of Europe’s most electrifying startups were selected for the contest final on Friday.
València provided the perfect stage for the showdown. The region is Spain’s fastest-growing entrepreneurial ecosystem, with the most startups per capita in the country.  It was also bathed in glorious sunshine — but this was no vacation for the contenders. With thousands in attendance, an all-star jury on the front row, and a springboard to success on the line, the stakes were high for all the startups.
To the victor goes an array of spoils, including a 4 square-meter turnkey booth at TNW Valencia 2024 and two business passes for TNW Conference in Amsterdam on June 15-16. But best of all the prizes — and I say this without a scintilla of bias — is a full feature on TNW’s wonderful website by our marvellous media team.
Before we reveal the winner, here are the eight elite finalists who pitched for first place.
Internxt

Many of today’s biggest internet companies are essentially data mining companies. Google, for instance, generates over 80% of its revenue from advertising, which it amasses by leveraging user data for ad targeting.
Internxt has created an alternative model: data storage that respects user privacy.
The València-based startup provides an end-to-end encrypted cloud storage service, which means nobody can see your files. Founded in 2020, the company has positioned itself as a privacy-centric competitor to Google Drive.
“We provide an easy way to manage, share, and store user data in a completely private way,” says Joan Mora, head of data and analytics at Internxt.
Users can get 10GB of free storage. If they need more, premium subscriptions that provide from 20GB to 2TB are available for as little as low as €0.89 per month.
Sophie’s Bionutrients

Sophie’s Bionutrients has reimagined protein production. It’s the first company in the world that uses microalgae to develop 100% plant-based and sustainable alternative protein.
The microalgae is cultivated inside bio-reactors and harvested within days. This rapid process also minimizes the quantity of energy and water that’s required.
Both the idea and name for the company came from the daughter of Eugene Wang, the co-founder and CEO of Sophie’s Nutrients.
“Sophie is allergic to shellfish,” says Wang. “That’s how the whole thing started — I was looking for a way for people to get nutrition from the ocean without using the animals.”
The startup began life in Singapore, before moving its headquarters to the alt-protein hotspot “Food Valley” in the Netherlands. Wang now plans to take the product around the world, in a B2B business model that will first target small and medium-sized food manufacturers.
CAPS
CAPS wants to make urban flights a daily routine. Credit: CAPS
CAPS is developing a product that seems futuristic: an urban aircraft for single passengers. Yet the company expects the tech will soon be available to the public.
“My strong belief is that you will be experimenting with flights in urban areas within the next 10 years,” says Paul Cass, CEO of CAPS. “For that to properly be done, it has to be quiet, safe, and affordable.”
The startup’s founders got the idea after growing sick of their long commute to college. In a garage, they began to assemble a more convenient alternative: a flying car.
Their concept evolved into a driverless aircraft for single-passenger trips in urban areas. Both small and entirely-electric, the vehicle is built for a quiet flight with optimum security. In case of technical trouble or emergencies, a professional driver in the company’s operating centre can remotely control the aircraft.
CAPS  is confident that the design offers the safety, affordability, and practicality needed for mass adoption. With the world’s electric air taxi network scheduled to launch in 2024, the vision could be closer to reality than it first appears.
Wenalyze

Wenalyze is on a mission to protect SMEs, which represent 99% of all businesses in the EU.
In tricky economic times, these companies face mounting challenges. Insurers can provide a safety net, but bad information is reducing the security. According to Wenalyze, insurance companies have 47% of their data wrong, leading to underinsurance and premium leakage.
The Spanish startup wants to reduce the risks. The company uses open data analytics to correct, update, and enrich SME information. As a result, insurers, banks, and financial institutions can offer their clients the right coverage.
To access the enhanced insights, users only need to enter the name and address of the SME. Wenalyze’s system will then analyse open data sources and deliver real-time results.
“By protecting SMEs, we protect our economy,” says Carlos Albo, CEO and co-founder of Wenalyze.
Therminer

Amid a global energy crisis, the vast electricity consumption of data centres has become a pressing concern. But even greater harm to our climate comes from heating, which comprises half of the world’s total energy consumption. That’s roughly the same imapct as electricity and transportation combined.
Therminer has created a system that addresses both concerns: a cooling solution for servers that reduces their energy consumption and recycles the wasted heat to warm buildings.
According to Gonzalo García, CEO and co-founder of Therminer, the system cuts 95% of the energy consumed to cool servers — and recycles 90% of the heat they release. “Our competitive advantage from the data centre perspective is that we can reduce operational costs and our data centres are more sustainable,” he says.
From its base in València, Therminer produce the hardware, installs it in homes, and manages the data centre services. The initial target for the system is single-family homes.
“They can use our waste heat and we can create a decentralised network of data centres and then sell hosting power,” says García.
Chaise Longue
Affordable comfort is an elusive pleasure on flights. Credit: Chaise Longue
Flying economy is rarely a pleasurable experience, but Chaise Longue believes comfort doesn’t have to cost a fortune — and has the chair to prove it.
The Madrid-based startup has created a double-decker airplane seat configuration. The design increases comfort, reduces cabin weight, and provides at least the same passenger capacity. Best of all, it’s made for economy class.
The extra space comes from maximising the cabin’s verticle volume. Overhead luggage compartments are removed, with bags instead stored in bays under seats. The result is bigger recline angles, extended leg room, and more overall space.
The modular structure is designed for swift integration into existing aircraft. According to Alejandro Núñez, Chaise Longue’s founder, CEO, and designer, most leading airlines are interested in the system — and planes are just the start.
“We are also moving into other industries such as trains, buses, and ferries — for the lowest class and for the cheapest tickets,” says Núñez. “We are trying to improve that experience for everyone.”
Nightstream

Twitch enjoyed explosive growth during the pandemic, and still consistently doubles its pre-COVID audience numbers. Many advertisers, however, remain wary of entering the market, which can appear too large and complicated. Nightstream wants to help these brands to grow alongside smaller streamers.
The startup found that brands currently use just 250 streamers to advertise. That means that oer 1.5 million daily viewers — and 95% of streamers — are being overlooked. Nightstream’s software is designed to capitalise on these opportunities.
The company’s tools and services allow brands to connect with streamers that will reach their target audience. Streamers, meanwhile, get the chance to build their audiences, earn money, and win prizes.
Brands are given data dashboards and analytic tools to analyse the performance of each player in the ecosystems. Nighstream also picks moderators for each streamer and brand, which further strengthens the partnership. To increase the streamers’ audiences, the startup rewards viewers as they become part of the communities.
“With our API and software, they can develop and connect directly with brands that don’t have enough money to connect with the biggest streamers,” says Luis Ruiz Climent, co-founder of Nightwatch.
Crowmie

Crowmie has invented a unique approach to sustainability: the first investment platform in tokenised renewable energy projects.
The concept aims to turbocharge the adoption of renewable energy, while democratising investment in the sector. At present, the vast majority of the market is controlled by large energy generators, which are financed by the traditional banking system. Crowmie allows the public to make their own contributions — and get returns.
After registering, the user can invest a minimum of just €100 in any asset on the platform. The user receives tokens in return. These entitle them to monthly rents for the electricity generated and sold by the energy project. Users can also sell the tokens to another investor at any time.
The investment is used to build facilities that produce electricity. Once built, the projects generate renewable electricity that’s sold to the grid. Profits from this sale are distributed among investors according to the number of tokens they hold.
“We have completely changed the way of investing in traditional assets, accelerating the energy transition, supporting the business fabric, and allowing anyone in the world to invest from just 100 euros,” says Fernando Dávila, CEO and co-founder of Crowmie.

The conversations covered everything from funding secrets to sector spotlights, across keynote speeches, startup battles, panel discussions, workshops, fireside chats, and much more. Too much in fact to attend it all  — but don’t worry, we’ve got you covered. Read on for a few highlights.
MC Oison Lunny speaks to a packed audience at the Impact Stage on Day 1 of TNW València
Our MC for the event, the award-winning Oison Lunny, kicked things off with a call for connections across València’s tech sector. “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. If you want to go fast AND far, go as part of an ecosystem,” he said. 


 “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. If you want to go fast AND far, go as part of an ecosystem. 

   
After the opening speech, a battle ensued between Valencia’s most promising startups. There were some seriously impressive pitches, and the winners will now face-off at the finals tomorrow.   
The winners from today’s startup battles will go head-to-head at the finals tomorrow.
The role of ecosystems was a recurring theme on day one. Phill Robinson, the CEO of Boardwave, explained how Europe can replicate Silicon Valley’s famous network effects, while Erwin Verstraelen, digital chief at the Port of Antwerp-Bruges, divulged why he founded ‘The Beacon’, an IOT ecosystem of startups, scaleups, and researchers, to boost innovation.
Many of the startups in attendance harbour plans for global expansion, but the conference speakers stressed that they need local roots. At a talk titled, “Going global: a VC’s guide to preparing for international investment,”  Vanessa Palmer of CaixaBank DayOne said startups need people “working on the ground in that country who understand that market.”

The balance was succinctly summarised by one of the contenders in the startup pitch battle.“Our base is in Spain, but our focus is global,” said Mario García-Granero, CEO and co-founder of Feending.
Amid the rush to innovate and grow, attendees of the event frequently expressed the importance of the tech for the good — particularly around sustainability. “We need to speed up,” said Raquel Espada, sustainability lead at Schneider Electric in Spain. We don’t have time. Climate change is happening, there’s a wildfire near here right now and it’s 30 degrees [centrigrade] in March.” 
No doubt one of the most inspiring moments of the day came when endurance athlete and Barcelona ambassador Alex Roca took to the stage to share his unique perspective on persevering against the odds.

Stockholm is a world-class tech hub: 6 startups and scaleups to watch,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/03/30,"
Once predominantly known for IKEA, Ericsson, and Volvo, in the past decade, Sweden has emerged as one the most valued tech ecosystems in Europe, with Stockholm ranking as the fifth top performer in 2021.
The success of Swedish startups such as Tink and Spotify has turned the capital city into a world-renowned tech hub, attracting the attention of international investors — and for good reason.
Stockholm is home to nearly 3,000 startups and scaleups, and counts 208 VC investors and 101,000 tech employees.
The city has also bred more tech unicorns per capita than any other region in the world except for Silicon Valley — that is, 0.8 per 100,000 inhabitants. Some of those unicorns include the buy-now-pay-later fintech firm Klarna, lithium-ion battery developer Northvolt, and e-mobility provider Voi.
Stockholm’s fertile landscape reflects Sweden’s overall growth in the tech sector. Last year alone, the Nordic nation not only retained its place as the EU’s best-performing innovation leader, but also emerged as Europe’s fourth top ranking country in VC funding per capita, reaching $540 (€504).
To get a closer look at the city’s thriving ecosystem, we’re zooming in on six trailblazing local startups and scaleups.
Let’s dive in.
Exeger
Founded in 2009 by Giovanni Fili, the Swedish deeptech scaleup has developed a unique solar cell, Powerfoyle, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing devices and convert all forms of light to virtually endless energy.
Unlike typical solar cells, Powerfoyle is a silicon-free technology, and thanks to a special dye, it absorbs indoor and outdoor light through a process called artificial photosynthesis.

For Fili, who has a multi-year background in entrepreneurship and the commercialisation of high-tech innovations, looking into the everyday applications of solar power was a natural step.
“We realised after a few years that this had a huge potential because we can screen print this solar cell, which allows a free-form design with different shapes, colors, and textures,” Fili tells me.
Now, 14 years later, Exeger has raised over €180 million across 12 funding rounds, counts more than 200 employees, and owns two solar-cell factories in Stockholm.
Currently, the Powerfoyle is integrated into a range of products, from bike helmets and remotes to headphones such as the Urbanista Los Angeles, the Urbanista Phoenix, and the Adidas RPT-02 Sol.

According to Fili, it’s all about providing consumers with energy independence, while also increasing product sustainability and reducing battery or cable waste.
For Exeger, Powerfoyle’s flexibility and customisable nature means the sky is the limit. The company recently secured a partnership with SES-imagotag to provide an alternative source of power to the electronic labels and IoT devices the company supplies to retailers. The scaleup envisions further applications for its technology in consumer electronics, IoT, and smart workplaces.
Sesamy
Sesamy was co-founded in 2021 by Måns Ulvestam, Karl Rosander, and Markus Ahlstrand — the same trio that founded Acast, the global podcast giant.
Sesamy also operates in the digital media realm, but with a focus on news and magazine content. The company targets publishers who want to offer their readers an option to purchase a single article as a complement to subscriptions.
“Our mission is to enable people to actually pay for good quality journalism, while helping publishers increase their incremental revenue,” Ulvestam tells me. And based on the company’s data, consumers are willing to pay on average €2 per article.
In case a reader purchases three or four articles from the same outlet, Sesamy’s Smart Software can identify whether it would cost them less to become a subscriber and prompts them accordingly, driving further engagement. “Some of the data we have so far are very encouraging; 5.5% of the readers buying a single-purchase article then become subscribers,” Ulvestam notes.

The startup counts eight publisher partners so far, boasting three big Swedish outlets: Breakit, Kvartal, and Nyheter24. Currently, Sweden is the company’s focus market, being “at the forefront when it comes to thinking about how to monetize news,” co-founder Karl Rosander says. Nevertheless, Sesamy is looking into expanding into other European countries as well.
Sesamy’s current business focus is to engage with as many outlets as possible in order to collect enough data on publisher revenue and consumer behaviour and thereby further develop its software — and, in time, for instance, suggest dynamic pricing based on the articles’ length, exclusivity, etc.
Apart from the pay-per-article option, the startup’s software platform offers various interchangeable web components including the integration of services such as payment methods, third-party webhooks, and social media login.
In November, Sesamy raised €3.3 million during its second seed round, bring its total to €7.3 million.
X Shore
The award-winning electric boat manufacturer aims to facilitate the transition to maritime emobility by combining Scandinavian design with technology, innovation, and sustainability.
The startup was founded in 2016 by one of Sweden’s best-known entrepreneurs, Konrad Bergström, but has been reinvented since 2019, when Jenny Keisu took over as CEO.

For Keisu, who has an extensive background in business law and impact investing, achieving price parity with fossil fuel-powered boats while offering high-performance vessels is key to the industry’s net-zero transition. And that’s what X Shore set out to do.
In September 2022, the company launched its second model, the X Shore 1, following the release of its first commercial boat, the Eelex 8000, in 2020. Both models come with a modular design for increased functionality and can be configured with various layouts that accommodate activities from fishing and diving to watersports and socialising — thus reducing the need for multiple boat ownership.
X Shore’s vessels also feature smart boating capabilities, including overboard detection, navigation, and range estimate. This is combined with a respective app and a special captain’s watch — a smart watch which can be used as a remote key to unlock the boat and  as a “person over board” detector. 
The Eelex 8000 is powered by a 170kW electric motor, comes with a 100NM range, and can reach a 30+ knot top speed. Credit: X Shore
Compared to the Eelex 8000, which costs a little over €300,000, the X Shore 1’s price starts at €99,000 — the average cost of a vessel in its category. “Within 48 hours after its launch, we sold out all boats that we could produce in the first half of this year, and we’re also sold out for 2023,” Keisu explains.
The X Shore 1 is powered by a 125kW electric motor, comes with a 50NM range, and can reach a 30 knot top speed. Creidit: X shore
Driving down the price enough to engage with a larger customer base — while maintaining sustainability — was the result of two factors: an EV-oriented design from the outset and in-house production.
The startup manufactures the hull and does the assembly using largely automated processes at its factory in the city of Nyköping, which leaves only the battery and electrical components to be sourced overseas.
X Shore sells its boats in Europe and North America, which currently represents its bigger market. For operators of multiple vessels, it also offers a Fleet Management System for connected X Shore boats. The startup raised almost €50 million in its latest funding round.
Alight
Alight is a leading Nordic provider of solar power-as-a-service, co-founded in 2013 by Dr Harald Overholm, Richard Nicolin, and Wilhelm Lowenhielm. The scaleup develops, owns, and operates solar projects for businesses that want to switch to renewable energy.
Alight helps companies cover their energy needs either with offsite installations in the form of solar farms, or with onsite installations of panels on rooftops, parking lots, or unused land. The scaleup provides energy through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) — fixed term contracts at a pre-negotiated price lasting between 10 and 20 years.
The company’s decision to focus on commercial solar stems from two reasons, according to co-founder and CEO Dr Harald Overholm. First comes the fact that 70% of power worldwide is used by companies. Second, the trio was inspired by the US market, where solar-as-a-service first got traction in the commercial and industrial segment, and shortly after in the residential.

“We had some sort of base hypothesis that commercial solar was a pretty good place to start,” Overholm says. “And we think that the European market is now moving very quickly towards us because government incentives are being rapidly scaled down.”
Alight is developing more than 1 gigawatt (GW) worth of PPA-based projects across Sweden, with a further 170 megawatts (MW) under development across the rest of Europe. It also handles Sweden’s largest operational solar park to date, and is set to have an installed capacity of at least 5GW by 2030. Some of its clients include Toyota, Swedbank, and trading company Bixia.

But the road to success has been no bed of roses.
“People could not understand why we started the company when we did so,” Overholm explains. “And it was also horribly difficult to find investors,” he adds, citing a lack of interest in impact and sustainability projects at the time.
“So when, in 2022, we raised €150 million in equity, with an additional €20 million to €30 million coming in [from] buying out secondaries from previous investors, it was insane.”
Prior to that the company had done two funding rounds — following an initial angel capital injection — raising €2 million in 2015 and €5 million to €6 million in 2019.
Now, Alight is also developing co-located battery storage to mitigate solar power’s intermittent nature and enable its further rollout.
Milkywire
At the age of 31, marketing veteran Nina Siemiatkowski decided to pursue photography in Kenya, where she witnessed first-hand the hurdles local organisations were facing to secure funding and resources in their efforts to address pressing environmental issues.
Siemiatkowski decided to build a company that solves this problem and founded Milkywire in 2018.
The startup provides a smarter and more efficient solution to environmental, cause-driven donation, connecting vetted impact organisations around the world with companies and individuals who want to offer support, but are unsure how to donate effectively.
‘Initially, when I founded Milkywire, the idea was to connect the platform to consumers directly,” Siemiatkowski tells me. “But a year and a half ago we completely pivoted as a business.” Since then, the startup has been implementing a B2B2C business model.

Milkywire’s platform enables companies to take responsibility for their environmental footprint and make a positive contribution by financing high-impact initiatives beyond their immediate value chain. Businesses can select organisations from five different causes, such as wildlife and climate transformation.
The platform also offers transparent and traceable reporting of the companies’ donations and impact metrics, which can be used to engage stakeholders and customers. To facilitate that, Milkyware provides integrated tools that enable customers to contribute to the same causes.
The startup currently counts numerous partner companies, including Klarna, PANGAIA, and Footway. To date, it has raised $25 million (€23.5 million) in donations.
“The timing couldn’t be better for us,” Siemiatkowski says. “There’s massive demand for sustainability solutions and, from what I know, we’re sitting with a quite unique solution.”
Doconomy
Founded in 2018 by Mathias Wikström and Johan Pihl, Doconomy has merged climate tech with fintech, and is on a mission to help banks, brands, and consumers to better understand their environmental footprint through financial transactions.
Since launching the world’s first transaction-based footprint calculator, Doconomy has been building a global ecosystem, with its technology used by Mastercard and world leading banks such as BNP Paribas and Nordea — which translates to over 850 million potential end-users across 30 countries.
Driven by the aim to inspire consumer behaviour change and encourage them into a more sustainable lifestyle, the founding duo was interested in the credit card as an everyday tool that’s connected to consumption patterns.

“We looked at how environmental data could be presented in a tool that you’re willing to use every day, and that, in the end, would motivate behavioural change,” Pihl tells me.
The result was Doconomy’s core solution, a cloud-based environmental impact index (Åland Index), which enables CO2 and H2O calculations for all digital financial transactions.
The Åland Index is complemented by a set of other digital tools, such as the Lifestyle Impact Calculator, helping individuals assess their footprint based on lifestyle choices, and the Product Impact calculator, which enables brands to calculate their products’ CO2 footprints. The startup also offers the DO mobile banking service, which allows consumers to manage their finances and everyday climate action.

Thanks to its data and the ecosystem it’s built, Doconomy has created a standardised language around how impact is measured. But using this language to drive consumer engagement and, in the end, behavioural change, remains “as tricky as ever,” co-founder Mathias Wikström says.
Doconomy is now focusing on achieving exactly this and believes that its recent acquisition of financial well-being fintech startup Dreams Technology will play an integral role in that objective.
What’s the secret to Stockholm’s success?
Stockholm has several unique and powerful ingredients that stimulate startup growth.
For Alight’s co-founder Harald Overholm, the city breeds a culture of entrepreneurship, while a strong network of entrepreneurs, mentors, and angel investors can provide guidance.
The collaboration and advice of like-minded entrepreneurs and expertswas also pointed out by Milywire’s founder, Nina Siemiatkowski, and Sesamy’s co-founder, Karl Rosander, who also added access to capital as an important element of the ecosystem.
“I think collaboration is closer at hand in Sweden than in many different markets,” Mathias Wikström, Doconomy’s co-founder and CEO, says. “There’s a strong social security network, a strong trade labour union, [and] a strong industry and trade labour union agreement dating back to the 40s and 50s. We’re not keeping our success close to our chest. We’re rather sharing it with many, I think slightly more than in other parts of the world.”
Swedish mentality plays a vital role for Johan Ekelin and Christian Ihre — co-founders of Lynxeye, a Stockholm-based strategy consultancy supporting companies in transformative shifts, which has been part of the ecosystem since 1999.

“We’re a bit of a caring nation, you could say, with a more human-centric mentality,” Ekelin tells me. “We want to find solutions to problems, and we try to democratise the offerings, and that’s good for innovation,” he notes, adding that Sweden is characterised by “a high level of social consensus.”
This, according to Ihre, stems from a simplistic survival instinct, the need to “stick together,” due to the country’s weather and climate conditions. Much like the Vikings created their own infrastructure webs and ecosystems, modern society has another kind of ecosystem, where companies, institutions, government, and people know they need each other to survive. “This has transcended our culture for millennia,” Ihre notes.
But this doesn’t mean that Sweden’s business sector is closed within itself. On the contrary, Ekelin believes that creating international brands and companies is one of its biggest strengths.
“Being a small country means that there’s a small home market, so you have to look openly for other opportunities around the world and be informed about what’s going on outside of Sweden.”

How an outsider’s freedom can make a successful startup founder,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/03/28,"
Building a startup in a sector you’ve never worked in might seem a risky move, but it can actually provide a competitive advantage.
That’s certainly proven true for Vivino. Founded in 2010 in Copenhagen, the scaleup has raised $221 million in funding, and become the world’s most downloaded wine app and largest online wine marketplace, with a community of 50 million users.
This success came despite an unconventional background. Vivino’s cofounders didn’t come from a place with a rich history of wine, and neither of them had previously worked in the sector.
For Heini Zachariassen, co-founder of Vivino, and founder and host of Raw Startup, coming from outside the industry adds a big advantage. “You’re free to do whatever you want in any way you want,” he tells TNW.
So how does this freedom translate into founding and scaling a successful startup?
The first important aspect is the ability to bring a fresh perspective to the market, which enabled Vivino to help a customer segment that the industry was neglecting: wine lovers who don’t know much about wine.
Vivino supports these users with crowd-sourced data. When they take a photo of a bottle of a wine label, the app can show them ratings, reviews, and average prices for the bottle.
“If you’re in the industry and somewhat set in your ways, you can have a lot of baggage that influences the decisions you make,” Zachariassen, who will be speaking at TNW València on March 30, says.

The outsider’s position allowed Vivino to steer clear of industry politics that can apply pressure towards a certain direction, or certain standards to live up to.
“We didn’t listen to the industry. We didn’t listen to the wine experts. And we purposely didn’t do so,” Zachariassen explains. “Because we’re not building the product for those two groups. We’re building it for the casual wine drinker.”
This played a pivotal role in product development and design. In its beginning, the scaleup focused its resources on how to solve a specific problem for a specific user group, and how to create a good product to do so.
“This initially left the design looking scrappy,” Zachariassen says. “And that was fine for us. But that’s harder to accept if you don’t have freedom. If you have three generations of winemakers looking at you, for example.”
Having the flexibility to prioritise problem-solving and substance over style in the beginning was also beneficial for the company’s resource management.
“When you build a startup, it’s all about resources, right? Design was always a priority for us, but we didn’t want to do it upfront because we also knew it could kill us,” Zachariassen notes.
At TNW València Heini Zachariassen will speak about how atypical backgrounds can lead to successful founders. Credit: Vivino
At the same time, the freedom to fully focus on a specific target group and think outside the box led to an innovative solution: a user-friendly wine rating system.
The typical rating of wine is based on an 100-point system, which for the scaleup’s team wasn’t relatable to non-experts. “Vivino is not for someone who has a wine cellar. It’s for someone who has five bottles on the kitchen table,” Zachariassen says.
This led Vivino to implement a five-star rating system. As this scale is used in most popular rating apps, the company felt it would be easy for everyone to understand.
There’s also a personal element to Vivino’s success. While Zachariassen was an outsider to the industry, he was an insider to the problem; he was the actual future user. “And that’s probably the key if you’re an outsider, really understanding the problem you’re trying to solve.”

6 biggest tech nightmares to avoid next time you travel abroad,Ebony-Storm Halladay,2023/03/28,"
Drop me on a Balinese coastline with a decent paperback and my smartphone, and I’ll luxuriate for two weeks straight.
But fly me out to the same spot with a Nokia 3310 and a physical map, like the one my dad used to carry, and I’ll probably have a nervous breakdown.
Most of us can agree that we’re hyper-dependent on tech, especially when we’re navigating a new place abroad. And the further or more remote you go, the more likely you are to run into tech breakdowns that can put a damper on your plans to wander freely.
From racking up hidden costs to avoiding embarrassing gaffs, here are some of the top tech nightmares when traveling and how to avoid them on your next trip.
Free to roam… Or not
We’ve all been there. You forget yourself for one minute and enable your data to look something up: “best restaurants in Tel Aviv,” “fastest flight from Bangkok to Chiang Mai,” or “how to dress for Scottish weather.”
Five minutes later, you’ve racked up a hefty roaming charge. Ouch.
While some networks let you roam freely, others aren’t so generous. Before launching his alternative activewear brand, Rusty Martin spent some time travelling by skates. And subsequently paid a small fortune for it.
“I landed in Vancouver after an eight-hour flight and met some local in-line skaters,” Rusty tells me. “When I got back to my mate’s place, I had a bunch of notifications. I’d left my data on, and racked up about £70 in charges.”
Wait! It gets worse: “I didn’t pay the bill for over a year,” Rusty admits. “I was kinda like fuck the corporations, I don’t owe them. I didn’t even actively use my data, I’d just left it on. It all felt very unfair. But then they send debt collection agencies after you and ruin your credit rating.”
Always check your data plan (and your data settings), before you catch your flight. Or better yet, invest in a data plan that has your back.
Travel tech company Holafly eSIM provides eSIMs for people who want a steady and reliable connection without roaming charges. They offer regular data plans in over 130 countries, unlimited data plans in over 45 destinations, and even for entire regions like Europe. So, if you’re on a trip through Europe, instead of buying a plan for each country, you only will have to pay one time to get coverage in various countries. And because it’s a digital SIM, you can activate it in a matter of minutes by scanning the QR code sent to your email. Easy peasy.

Testing local limits
With internet censorship on the rise, don’t be surprised if your beloved apps and websites don’t work in other countries.
Srishti Verma got caught out in Vietnam when she was conducting research on reproductive health and rights for a non-profit based in Atlanta.
“The website loaded at first, but it didn’t work properly. The navigation was poor, things wouldn’t load, and it was affecting my research”, Srishti shares. “No access to related websites had me thinking something was wrong with my internet connection.”
Fortunately, Srishti’s pal reminded her to use a VPN, and all was not lost. But there are plenty of other countries where this solution would have fallen flat on its face. VPN bans and limitations are widespread in countries such as China, Turkey, and the UAE.
With a smartphone tucked neatly in our hands, it’s easy to forget not all countries have the same level of tech freedom.
All WiFi is good WiFi (just kidding!)
WiFi access is so ubiquitous that the thought of being without it is practically unbearable.
Michelle Coulson felt something similar on a recent trip to Portugal. As a digital nomad who helps people get remote jobs, her work was rudely interrupted by a lack of connectivity.
“We’d just gotten to a campsite and discovered there was no WiFi. We couldn’t find a shop open to get our mobile data topped up either — so we ended up driving miles to McDonald’s to use their crappy WiFi!”
At times like this, public WiFi is a godsend. But there’s a catch, often in the form of sacrificing a few personal details to log on. We all crave internet connection, but sometimes a public fix just isn’t worth the risk.
Crafty hackers can create doppelganger WiFi networks that look just like legitimate ones. So while you’re mindlessly scrolling, they’re scrounging for your account details. It’s an easy way to get your identity stolen — or the contents of your bank account.
You don’t even have to leave the airport to find trouble. According to a study by Forbes, 40% of respondents have had their data compromised while using public WiFi — with airport and restaurant WiFi posing the greatest threat.
If you’re using shared or public WiFi, find someone who can confirm you’re on the right network and call on your trusty VPN for an added layer of protection. Keep in mind that, if you’re connecting to a WiFi you don’t know, you also won’t know how they’re going to use the data collected during the session.
To ensure you have coverage without having to mess with dodgy free WiFi hotspots, check out Holafly’s guide to eSIMs.

Adaptors, voltages, and avoiding electrocution
No one wants to watch the light die on their phone screen before making it to the hotel. Forget your travel adaptors and this is the reality.
There are 15 electrical plug types, so make sure you find out which ones you’ll need for your destination country. Type C covers most of Europe (aside from the UK, Ireland, Cyprus, and Malta). But you’ll only get away with using type I plugs in Thailand.
Traversing multiple countries? Get yourself a universal adaptor. And try to find grounded ones — this will lower your risk of getting electrocuted if there’s an exposed wire in your gadget.
Most modern devices have variable voltage, so using them in a range of countries probably won’t get you fried. Gadgets that are designed to be portable — like smartphones, tablets, and laptops — usually have variable voltage. Shavers, hairdryers, and electric toothbrushes tend not to be, so make sure you check the specs on your devices before packing them.
Be prepared to power down 
Was the sun just turned off forever? Or did you get caught in a power cut? I’m guessing the latter.
Power cuts will increase as the climate crisis worsens. And even paradise isn’t immune from a little lights-out action.
Georgie Darling is a digital nomad and travel writer who spent the first seven months of the pandemic stuck on the tiny Indonesian island of Gili Trawangan.
Due to the size and position of the island, Gili is prone to earthquakes and power cuts. Often at the same time.
“They were such a part of my daily life that the only reaction to the ground shaking was an ‘earthquake?’ message in our group chats,” Georgie shares.
“I got caught out a few times when client calls fell around the same time as the earthquakes and power cuts,” Georgie admits. “I quickly learned to keep my laptop and phone fully charged.”
For added protection, arm yourself with an eSIM (as mentioned above) and a couple of power banks. The Zendure Supermini is pocket size but packs a powerful punch. If you need something more heavy-duty, pick up the ZMI PowerPack 20000 — it’ll charge your phone and your laptop via a USB-C connection. And make sure you give clients and loved ones a heads-up about outages when possible.
“It made a good talking point with clients”, Georgie says. “Especially when I told them that the phrase for ‘power cut’ in Bahasa Indonesia is ‘mati lampu’, which directly translates to ‘death to the light.’”
Don’t get lost in translation
Where the risk of embarrassing yourself is low, translation apps can get you out of a pickle. Like checking the menu for meat-free options, or decoding the signs at a train station.
But bad translations can have awkward consequences. If you arrive in France and need a lawyer (un avocat), you could end up asking for an avocado instead (also un avocat). Oops.
Promising research on using Google translate in emergency departments showed that 82.5% of the translations retained their meaning. But results vary significantly between languages, which is a problem if you have sensitive information to share.
The best way to avoid translation app fails is to use them cautiously. Don’t count on them saving your bacon every time — and do some practice on Duolingo before you jet off.
So if you’re not quite ready to trade your smartphone in for a map book, don’t forget to pack your virtual suitcase before setting out on your next globetrotting adventure. Handy travel tech tools like an international eSim, VPNs, and portable power banks will make all the difference when you’re trapped in paradise without a connection (your Insta followers and mom will thank you).

7 unmissable highlights of TNW València,Thomas Macaulay,2023/03/25,"
Ladies and gentlemen, the moment has almost arrived: TNW València is next week! 
In case you’ve been living under a rock (or frequenting another tech site, you traitor), we’re taking our cherished festival on the road. After 16 glorious years in Amsterdam, we’re bringing the show to Spain’s Mediterranean coast — and you’re all invited.
We’re not only there for the sun, sea, and sand — far from it, in fact. València has the fastest-growing innovation ecosystem in Spain, and the most startups per capita in the country. On March 30th and 31st, we’ll showcase the best tech in the region to over 2,000 guests. 
Across the two days, attendees will enjoy inspirational talks, networking events, learning opportunities, and the same festival vibes as our Amsterdam flagship. The entire editorial team will also be there, awaiting your company, ideas, and, of course, abuse.
València is one of the world’s most exciting tech hubs.
In total, we’re hosting over 100 speakers, 75 investors, 90 exhibitors, and 3,000 meetings. Admittedly, this has created one big problem: you simply can’t catch them all. To help find your way through the jam-packed agenda, here are eight highlights at TNW València.
1. The official opening ceremony and party
While the main agenda kicks off on March 30, the fun starts a day earlier, at our opening party.
Our guestlist contains a range of political heavyweights. They include Diana Morant, Spain’s Minister of Science and Innovation; Sandra Gomez, Deputy Mayor of València; Arcadi España García, Minister of Finance of the Generalitat Valenciana; and Borja Sanjuán, Vice Mayor of Economic Development at the City of València.
Join them (and us) for drinks, bites, and networking from 19:00 at Zeus València. To register for the party, click here.
2. A game of padel
The opening party is one of 10 side events, offering a healthy mix of learning, networking, and partying. On March 31, you can even join a padel tournament at the València Tennis Center. I’ll be waiting on the court, so you better bring your F-game.
3. Unmissable speakers
We’ve assembled a dazzling array of keynote speeches, fireside chats, panel discussions, and workshops. With more tech luminaries than a PayPal reunion, it’s hard to rank the speakers — but here are five of my favourites:
Heini Zachariassen, Founder and CEO of Vivino
Zachariassen built the world’s most-downloaded wine app and largest online wine marketplace. His company has made wine more accessible — and I speak from experience. My use of Vivino has become alarmingly frequent, but at least it’s finding me quality plonk at bargain prices.
Our speakers will shine lights on sustainability, AI, deep tech, and much more.
Katica Roy, Founder and CEO of Pipeline Equity
An award-winning economist and former Global 500 executive, Roy founded Pipeline Equity in 2017. At València, she’ll discuss how to close the innovation gap.
Miguel Ángel Leal, Chief Technology and Innovation Officer at LaLiga
As a digital chief at LaLiga, Ángel injects innovation into a  legendary football league. His role combines the best of both tech and sports, which sounds like a dream job for me — other than my position at TNW, of course.
Jen Carter, Global Head of Technology at Google.org
Carter leads the pro bono initiatives at Google.org, the Big G’s philanthropic arm. Having spent six years at the organisation, and a decade in Google’s Trust and Safety team, Carter has a unique understanding of using tech for good.
Alex Roca, Ambassador at FC Barcelona
It’s not only tech leaders that are taking the stage. One of our most intriguing speakers is Alex Roca, who recently became the first person with a 76% physical disability to complete a marathon. At TNW València, he’ll give his first public speech since achieving the feat. 
4. The FT Power Hours
Our beloved overlords at the Financial Times are bringing their best brains to València. At a series of sessions dubbed FT Power Hours, they’ll discuss tech’s hottest business trends with industry leaders.
5. The Startup Pitch Battle
It’s not all fun and games. While we don’t condone violence at TNW, we do love a pitch battle — and this one’s sure to be fiery. Some of the world’s most exciting startups will be presenting their ideas to our distinguished jury.
The startup stakes will be high.
The challengers will compete for the attention of top investors, a collection of prizes, and — most importantly of all — a profile by your favourite editorial team. I mean us, by the way.
And if you need to sharpen your skills, check out the startup pitching workshop at 12:30 on Thursday.
6. A ride on the TNW Ferris wheel
It wouldn’t be a TNW festival without our cherished Ferris wheel. As well as offering fun rides and stunning views, the carriages are the perfect place for private meetings — partly because your interlocutor can’t leave.

Europe’s ports are using tech to navigate ‘the perfect storm’,Jill Petzinger,2023/03/10,"
Cargo ports are vital transport hubs in the world economy. Around 90% of all globally traded goods by tonnage is transported by sea and in 2021, a whopping 3.5 billion tonnes of freight passed through EU ports alone.
Antwerp was the second-largest port in Europe — spreading across 120km² — before a merger with Bruges in 2022 created a combined port area of 160km² and the biggest chemical cluster on the continent. 
València’s expanding port is the largest on the European Mediterranean in terms of container traffic — and dates back to 1491. Its port authority, Valènciaport, is responsible for València, plus Gandía and Sagunto ports along the coast.  
Ahead of their talks at TNW València in March, we spoke to Erwin Verstraelen, Chief Digital and Innovation Officer at the Port of Antwerp-Bruges, and Juan Manuel Díez, Strategy and Innovation Director at the Port Authority of València, about how they are pursuing the newest advances in tech to transform their ports.
“Ports are not just logistics hubs, they’re also becoming the industrial and energy hubs for Europe as part of the European Green Deal, so we are in a complete transformation of our core activity and digital innovation plays a significant role in that,” Verstraelen told TNW. 
Verstraelen was appointed CDIO at Port of Antwerp-Bruges in 2017.
Ports ecosystems are facing what Verstaelen calls the “perfect storm” at the convergence of geopolitics, digitisation, mobility, sustainable growth, and the energy transition.
Zero-emissions
“We have a very ambitious goal: we want to be carbon neutral in 2030,” València’s Díez told TNW in his office overlooking the cargo terminals. “Already all the electricity that is consumed in the port comes from renewable sources — we buy it with this condition – but we have our own plans to produce electricity here in the port.”
València’s 300-plus annual days of sun will be put to good use, with the first of three solar plants in the port already launched. Gandía is on track to become the first energy self-sufficient European port, according to Díez.
“We have been thinking for many years now about installing windmills in our breakwaters but the technology wasn’t there,” said Díez. “Now it is advancing and we have plans for our own wind farm in the coming years.” 
Díez has spent over 12 years working for the Port Authority of Valencia.
The new cargo terminal in the port of València will be 98% electrified and the remaining 2% will use hydrogen, he added, making it “the most sustainable terminal in Southern Europe for sure.”
Getting to zero emissions means mobilising the whole port community. Valènciaport recently launched a pioneering project to test the use of green hydrogen for moving machinery inside the port, with an H2 storage tank and mobile hydrogen generator. The next stage will be to test hydrogen-powered prototypes of a container stacker and tractor.
Digital twins
Access to instant information is essential for ports. Both Antwerp-Bruges and València are investing in sophisticated “digital twins” of their port areas.
In València, the digital twin includes a Port Collaborative Decision Making (Port CdM) System, which could reduce a ship’s average call time by 10%. 
The digital twin of the Port of Antwerp-Bruges is a virtual copy of the port area with real-time information.
“Arrivals in a port are not on a precise clock, but by having and using timely information, the port can prepare in advance, e.g. by letting a ship know there is no mooring available at that moment so it can slow its speed, use less fuel, and reduce emissions,” said Díez.
The Port of Antwerp-Bruges is one of the first in the world to have a digital twin of its territory, according to Verstraelen. 
“By equipping the entire port area with sensors, cameras, drones, we create a digital nervous system on top of the physical port,” he said. “And if you bring all these data feeds together in what we call a digital twin, the people responsible for safety and security will be positioned or alerted if something is taking place in the port the moment it happens and can act immediately upon it.” 
Sensors monitor the port’s air quality to detect not just CO2 and other gas emissions but also volatile organic compounds like benzene and toluene — vital intelligence considering the size of the Antwerp-Bruges chemical cluster.

Once an air quality monitor triggers an alarm, different data sources offer information on wind speed and direction to indicate where an emission is coming from, and the location of ships in the port based on their automatic identification system (AIS) tracker. The data is then filtered to show tankers and turn cameras in the direction of the emission. 
“In real-time, you see that there is for example an illegal or an accidental degasification of a tanker ship taking place,” Verstraelen said.
By applying algorithms to AIS data, they not only create situational awareness but also prescriptive awareness about something that will need looking at from a safety, security, or operational perspective. 
The last step will be predicting what will happen a few hours ahead and acting on it in terms of allocating tugboats and pilots, knowing how the wind is going to change or if a storm is coming.
‘Outside-in’ innovation
All this innovation is a springboard for fresh ideas. As well as being an active member of Spain’s Ports 4.0 initiative with its €20 million equity fund, València has its own acceleration/incubation program, Opentop. The program, which works with startups focused on many aspects of port operations, will also be exhibiting in the València Ecosystem Pavilion at TNW València.
One of the young startups the port collaborates with is We Are Lab. The company has been developing ways to plant Posidonia, a Mediterranean seagrass that is tricky to grow but awesome for capturing CO2 from the ocean. Posidonia in the port breakwaters can be used to clean the surrounding sea.
Zeleros, the València-based Hyperloop scaleup, is also a partner, and currently trialling a test track in Sagunto to move cargo around the port in an emission-free way.

Up north in Antwerp-Bruges, Verstraelen explains that when it comes to fostering innovation, he cultivates a “what if” mentality, opening up the port as an ecosystem for “outside-in” innovation.
“We decided to open up the port as an innovation platform, inviting promising technologies to come and demonstrate their added value, and allowing them to make themselves market-mature faster,” Verstraelen said. 
One of the noteworthy startups backed by Antwerp-Bruges in 2018 to work on barges is remote-piloting technology startup SEAFAR. The largest concentration of barges in Europe is in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany and they account for around 40% of all cargo passing through Antwerp-Bruges.
However, with older barge captains retiring and fewer new ones replacing them, the time was ripe for a big change. In light of these trends, the port went “all in” to enable the four-person startup to demonstrate that its tech could remote-pilot one of the port’s ships.
“As a consequence of that they got permission from the regional government to operate ships in a commercial way the year after,” said Verstraelen. “Today, SEAFAR is 30 people, there are barge owners building new ships to be remotely piloted, and they are sailing around commercial cargo with ships that are operated from more than 100 kilometres away.”
A remote pilot, who can handle three or four crafts at the same time, means a reduction in labour costs and more on-board cargo space as there’s no need for living quarters. 
Drones and spills
In terms of new tech, Antwerp-Bruges puts the emphasis on proof of value rather than proof of concept. Service drones are a good case in point as the size and complexity of the port makes it the perfect test ground. 
The idea to have multiple automated drones simultaneously airborne over the port, performing oil spill and litter detection, asset management inspection, and supporting police and fire brigades had been germinating since 2018. However, there was no existing legal framework and it was forbidden to operate automated drones beyond visual line of sight in a no-fly zone like a port.
By demonstrating proof of value and relevant use cases, the government agencies were finally able to okay them and develop legislation for their use in the port.
“We are the fifth largest bunkering [supplying fuel for ships] port on the planet and you can imagine that accidents do happen,” Verstraelen said. “It’s important once we spot an oil spill to see where it is floating and how big it is if we call in the specialised services to clean it up.” Thanks to drones, these teams know what they need to do and what kind of equipment they need before they leave.
The drones have cameras that supply live feeds to central control, and the port is also developing algorithms that can detect spills in the camera feed. “You don’t want a ship going through an oil spill, because then it becomes polluted and it takes the entire thing with it,” Verstraelen said.

Tech is evolving so fast that “the biggest mistake you can make is to say we tried it in the past and it didn’t work,” according to Verstraelen. “If something doesn’t work now, try it again in six months, 12, 18, and 24 months from now.”
He points to speech-to-text AI, which the port tried to use a few years ago to translate very high-frequency (VHF) radio communication between ships. The team hoped to mine the data for sentiment analysis indicating a potential conflict between captains, but the tech wasn’t ready for the task.
“We tried it a month ago, again, with the same sound file… and it was 95% spot on. So in less than two years, it went from completely useless to completely and utterly usable on a daily basis.”
Both ports reflect the leaps that authorities are making to modernise, tackle climate goals, and prepare their ports for the future.
Their efforts are already reaping impressive results. Verstraelen describes his port’s ecosystem as “the most impressive innovation breeding ground I’ve ever seen in my entire life.”

Can AI make better art than humans? We asked IBM’s Seth Dobrin,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/03/2,"
Artificial intelligence has been infiltrating every industry and the world of arts and culture is no exception. In other words, AI art is poised to explode.
AI text-to-image generators such as DALL-E or Midjourney have been creating remarkable visual artworks. ChatGPT has taken the world by the storm with its ability to answer questions, write essays, and summarize texts, among other things. AI-generated art is even being displayed at world-renowned museums.
These examples show just how powerful generative AI can be and bid this pressing question: is AI about to replace human artists?
Seth Dobrin, IBM’s first-ever Global Chief AI Officer, has an answer. We caught up with him at TNW Conference 2022 and talked about the potential of computer-created art.
If you’d like to get his predictions in full, check out the video embedded at the top of this article. Alternatively, you can watch it right here.
AI-generated visual art already exists in various forms. There are examples of artists — such as Refik Anadol — who are the actual creators, but use artificial intelligence to augment their artworks. There are also tools like DALL-E which “are getting there,” although it’s difficult to say whether their works are truly indistinguishable from humans’.
Dobrin has a similar view on news articles, noting that financial news is already being automatically generated to an extent. And while he doesn’t believe that AI-generated text is as engaging as a writer’s would be, he explained that GPT-3 and Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate stories that journalists can use as a starting point.
But when it comes to movies and novels, AI has a longer way to go. That’s because “AI needs to truly learn emotion, really be able to simulate it, and invoke empathy — better than it can today,” Dobrin said. He expects five more years for novel creation, and between five to 10 years for movie production.
But what’s Dobrin’s prediction on classical music? And does he believe that AI will merely augment humans in the creative process — or eventually replace them?

Insect farming startup targets pet food as gateway to human consumption,Thomas Macaulay,2023/03/1,"
Evolving views on food are challenging traditional diets — and not just for humans. Innovative dining options are also being added to the menus of our pets.
Startups have proposed numerous new ways to satiate their appetites. The UK’s Bella and Duke, for instance, caters to animals on raw diets, while Sweden’s Buddy Pet Foods serves natural dry food, and Portugal’s Barkyn personalises their grub.
If none of those excites their palates, our furry friends could try a more avant-garde delicacy: insects.
That’s what’s cooking in the kitchen of FlyFeed, an Estonia-based startup.  The company has developed an automated farming system that turns fly larvae into animal feed. 


“It’s challenging for humans, but a no-brainer for animals.


Arseniy Olkhovskiy, who founded FlyFeed in 2021, said the concept emerged from research into malnutrition. He concluded that insect farming can provide an affordable and sustainable solution to protein shortages. But he plans to feed animals before approaching humans.
“It’s challenging in human food right now, because people don’t really want to eat something connected to insects — but it’s a no-brainer in animal feed,” Olkhovskiy told TNW.
The 24-year-old rattles through a lengthy list of benefits of farming insects: they’re fed reprocessed waste that would otherwise rot in dumps; they grow up to 100 times faster than conventional animal food sources; they’re rich in high-quality nutrients; their production costs are minimal; and they require far fewer environmental resources than traditional agriculture.
Olkhovskiy promises they’re also highly palatable for pets. He says that his own cat is a fan of the flavours.

FlyFeed is not the first startup to turn insects into pet food. Ÿnsect in France has spent over a decade producing ingredients from mealworms, while Jiminy’s in the USA processes protein from crickets. FlyFeed uses another insect: black soldier flies. 
This species has several attractions. The larvae can convert organic waste into edible protein for animal consumption and fertiliser. They’re also suitable for wet food, high in various nutrients, don’t transfer diseases, and have a fast growth rate.
The insects will be reared on agricultural leftovers in vertically-stack crates, which reportedly require 100 times less space than soybean or livestock farming. The facility will also harness data-driven climate control to optimise conditions, and computer vision to monitor the larvae development.
Vertical farming was chosen for its scalability. Credit: FlyFeed
Protein from the farm will be incorporated into comestibles. FlyFeed plans to deliver the first commercial batch of the product next year. Annually, the company aims to convert 40,000 tonnes of waste into 17,500 tonnes of insect products. The output will be split between proteins, fats, and fertilisers. 
If all goes well, the early produce will provide a stepping stone to human consumption. 
“First, we need to scale it,” said Olkhovskiy. “We need to make it cheaper, we need to make it of standardised quality, and we need to also bring it to markets where people actually need it.”
Artist’s impression of the factory. Credit:FlyFeed
According to Olkhovskiy, other insect farming startups have struggled to market their food to humans. He’s chosen to instead focus on the operational and technological challenges. Once they’ve been overcome, Olkhovskiy plans to distribute the produce in countries where malnutrition is most critical. He expects to drive adoption through a low price point. While a kilo of protein from cheap chicken broilers goes for 4$, he says, a kilo of FlyFeed protein costs under 2$.
In Europe, however, the low prices are yet to create demand. According to a 2020 EU report, only 10% of Europeans are willing to swap meat for insects.
There are, however, signs that attitudes could change. A study published last December found people were more open to eating insects after learning about the environmental benefits.
Regulators are also starting to embrace the possibilities. In January, the EU approved the sale of house crickets and larvae for human consumption.
Still, it seems unlikely that we’ll all be eating flies in the near future. But perhaps our pets can convince us to give them a try.
"
Will non-linear work days be the new hybrid working?,Aoibhinn Mc Bride,2023/02/28,"
For a long time, the concept of work-life balance felt like an unattainable myth; all it took was a global pandemic and the ensuing government-enforced lockdowns to show employers that their staff could work remotely and still get the job done.
In fact, studies show that remote employees work more hours overall than those based in an office for part or all of the week—remote workers put in an extra 8.7 hours per week on average compared to their office-based colleagues who average 6.5 extra hours.
Post-pandemic a vast number of organisations have come around to the idea that flexible working conditions should be a permanent fixture.
And research shows that adopting a more flexible approach to where we work has not only improved work-life balance, but our mental and physical wellbeing too.
However, for some remote workers, real flexibility doesn’t pertain to physical location only. There’s an increasing shift towards non-linear or asynchronous working styles, which essentially allow remote workers to work on their own schedule, instead of following the traditional 9-5 model.
What is a non-linear work day?
The premise of a non-linear workflow is simple: remote employees focus on outcomes rather than the tasks they must complete by a certain date or time, for example hitting weekly or even monthly targets, or driving revenue per quarter instead of focussing on projects or a daily workflow.
Why are some employees seeking it?
From the parents who wish they had more time to spend with their children during the day to the marathon runner who needs to train for up to three hours, non-linear work allows employees to segment their days, manage their own schedules, and fit work in around the things that matter to them.
Neurodiverse workers may also benefit; those with ADHD often find they are most productive at night, and therefore sleep later in the morning.
What are the pros and cons and which companies are open to change?
The benefits of non-linear work are manifold: not only does it empower employees to work when they’re most productive, it gives team members the autonomy to do so. And while some employers might baulk at the idea of giving their staff free rein, non-linear work can make teams more efficient, allow employees to thrive and frequently show more dedication and discipline towards their work.
However, there are some challenges that can’t be overlooked. Non-linear work requires organisation and communication, especially if teams need one member to complete a task before another can start their piece of the work. There’s also the danger of disengagement, something that all remote workers can struggle with when they don’t see team members face-to-face on a regular basis or by having regular check-ins.
The good news is that many organisations are already leaning in to the idea of non-linear work and for good reason: according to a recent study, 37% of European employees are prepared to decline a job if flexible hours are not offered, and just over two thirds (69%) would accept a pay cut in exchange for flexible hours.
Looking for true flexibility when it comes to work-life balance? Discover three jobs below that offer flexible hours.

New sensor promises to bring ‘true colour’ to smartphone photos,Thomas Macaulay,2023/02/27,"
In the fiercely contested smartphone market, photography can be a key battleground. Alongside the insatiable desires for better batteries, durability, storage, and processing, camera quality consistently ranks as a key factor when choosing a phone.
At CES 2023, Spectricity, a startup based in Belgium, unveiled a new entrant to the competition: the S1 chip. 
Spectricity claims the S1 is the first truly miniaturised and mass-manufacturable spectral image sensor for mobile devices — and the company is targetting sector dominance. Within two years, Spectricity boldly predicts the sensor will be inside every smartphone.
The bullishness derives from a singular focus: measuring “true colour” in smartphones. According to Spectricty, this is something that even the best smartphones still can’t do. 
The problem stems from shortcomings in their white balance software, which is used to remove unrealistic colour tones. Our natural vision system does this remarkably well. When we see a white wall under sunlight or a fluorescent lamp, our brain adjusts the colour temperatures to make both scenes appear white. Smartphones attempt to do the same thing, but the results are often disappointing.


“None of these cameras can recognise true colour.


Limited by the three RGB colour channels of red, green, and blue, their auto-white balancing algorithms struggle to correct unnatural colour temperatures. As a result, photos taken under incandescent bulbs can appear more orange than under sunlight, while shady areas can look bluer.
“Even though there’s a lot of processing power behind these cameras, none can recognise true colour,” Spectricity CEO Vincent Mouret tells TNW.
To resolve this issue, the S1 sensor uses additional filters to analyse the spectral signature of an object. After sensing the light source in an image, the system corrects the colours accordingly.  
Mouret (left) was CEO of several semiconductor startups before joining Spectricity founder Jonathan Borremans’ (right) team.
Spectricity showed TNW the effects in a live demo. Under different lighting conditions, the pictures produced by the S1 were compared to photos taken by high-end smartphone cameras.
Although the results of demos aren’t always replicated in reality, the colours rendered by the S1 appeared far more consistent under diverse illuminations.
“With our solution, you can have the same colours whatever the lighting condition,” says Spectricity application engineer Michael Jacobs.
Spectricity expects the first smartphones with the S1 to be released in 2024.

The ambitions for the sensor extend beyond better photos. As the S1 can capture the full visible and near-infrared range at video rates, the imager could enhance numerous mobile applications. Spectricity envisions using the sensor for remote cosmetics, e-commerce, ID verification, skin-health analysis, and even smart gardening.
A key component of these plans is the S1’s improved rendering of skin tones. Smartphone cameras are notoriously bad at capturing darker skin, which limits the inclusivity of photos. It also inhibits any apps that use skin analysis, from melanoma detection to virtual makeup. 
The S1’s recognition of darker skin could broaden access to the benefits.
Biomarker analysis can be incorporated in personalised skin care.
Smartphone giants are also ploughing fortunes into colour fidelity, but Specriticity says they still can’t compete with the S1 sensor. This confidence emanates from a long and narrow scientific focus. 
Spectricity began life as a spin-out of the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre (IMEC), a research lab for nanoelectronics and digital technologies. This connection has helped the startup amass 19 granted patents and 66 active applications, as well as 13 PhDs in their team. 
To commercialise the innovations, Spectricity has set up a high-volume manufacturing line at the X-FAB foundry — which is now ready for mass production.
The S1 is currently under evaluation by major smartphone makers. Amid a global decline in mobile sales, Spectricity is betting that the sensor offers them an irresistible edge.

Adapting to technological advances is a defining part of 21st-century life. But it’s not unique to us: it’s been part of the human story since our earliest written records – even featuring in the plotlines of ancient myths and legends.
While ChatGPT threatens to change writing (and writing-related work) as we know it, the Mesopotamians, who lived 4,000 years ago (in a geographical area centred in modern-day Iraq), went through this kind of seismic change before us. Their civilisation is credited with the invention of writing.

Living in changing times
Just two months after launching in November 2022, OpenAI’s ChatGPT has already reached an audience of over 100 million people.
The large language model (LLM), sometimes called “autocomplete on steroids”, has drawn attention for its capacity to create human-like answers to queries. Its work has received passing grades on university law and business exams, and been used in a Colombian court to help decide a legal ruling.
Responses to ChatGPT and its competitors have vacillated between recognising the potential risks of the chatbot and extolling its possible benefits. We’re flooded with theories on how new advances in AI may change how we work, study and live.
Ancient Mesopotamia was home to many of civilisation’s early developments. Its people were world leaders in adapting to technological and cultural change.
Mesopotamians invented the wheel and agriculture, and pioneered advances in mathematics, urbanisation and transportation. These breakthroughs are reflected in cuneiform literature, one of the oldest known forms of writing.
The history of cuneiform writing is complex, but it seems to have initially developed to record economic data, such as debts that were owed. Over time, however, the Mesopotamians widened their use of signs inscribed into clay tablets to record a variety of information, in numerous languages. New uses covered everything from diplomatic correspondences to omen texts, to some of the world’s oldest literary masterpieces.
Tech-assisted heroes
In the world’s earliest known written epic, Gilgamesh, the eponymous hero is shown inventing and using technologies, such as diving weights and a sail, to further his journey to the edges of the world – and beyond.

As noted by Assyriologist Andrew George, the young hero develops new technologies to help his quest for fame and immortality. These advances allow him to engage in previously unknown activities, such as sailing and deep-sea diving.
Another royal hero from Mesopotamia, Lugalbanda (sometimes known for his super speed) is also credited with technological advancement. Lugalbanda improves the technique of fire-starting by using flint to spark embers and bake bread. The heroes’ use of new tools emphasises their exceptionalism.
Inventions and ambiguity
Mesopotamian epics don’t present cultural and technological advances as unambiguously and uniformly beneficial. In Gilgamesh, the benefits of civilisation and urbanisation, such as advances in wall-building technology, are juxtaposed with their costs – such as environmental destruction and alienation from the wild.
Indeed, the epics often represent new technologies being harnessed in the service of human conflict – and disproportionately serving the interests of those with high social status. In the Sumerian epic Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta, the heroic king defeats his enemy by inventing and using superior technology: the ability to write on clay tablets.
This invention is also thought to be referenced in the Epic of Sargon, where Sargon appears to dodge a murder attempt through his epic reading skills. The text notes that while writing on tablets had been developed at that stage, the use of envelopes to hide their contents had not (perhaps luckily for Sargon).
In some ways, the representation of new technologies in cuneiform literature echoes contemporary concerns about AI: fears of increasing social inequalities and its potential use in cyberwarfare.

The future of history
Studying the past can deepen our understanding of how humans have adapted to modern technology over thousands of years. Conversely, modern technology continues to broaden our understanding of history.
In recent years, AI – the newest form of writing – has been used to decipher the oldest: cuneiform literature. The Fragmentarium project, for example, uses sophisticated algorithms to determine which fragments of shattered cuneiform texts belong together; these algorithms predict the text that once filled the missing sections.
AI will likely continue to alter the way historians analyse the past. This will require new considerations around familiar issues – such as how to represent the past accurately in light of possibly biased evidence, and the need to critically evaluate sources of information.
In the broader field of academia, the boundaries of how AI may be used have not yet been clearly explained. In January, for example, a top international AI conference banned the use of AI tools for writing scientific papers – though its use in editing papers was accepted.
Considering the limits of technology
Even those early tech adapters, the Mesopotamians, ran into problems the technology of the day could not address.
Climate change is thought to have resulted in the downfall of the Akkadian Empire, sometimes called the world’s first multi-national political entity. And even the crafty Gilgamesh couldn’t escape his own mortality.
Humans have been grappling with how to invent, use and adapt to technology since our earliest civilisations. In Mesopotamian epic literature, new technology helps heroic individuals travel beyond accepted limitations and develop new skills. But the technology and resulting knowledge are not always evenly distributed.
Knowing how we adapted to changing technology in the past helps us more fully understand the human condition – and may even help us prepare for the future.

Plan to build UK’s first battery gigafactory falls out of British hands,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/02/27,"
Britishvolt, a prominent UK battery startup, had generated enthusiasm over its plans to build the country’s first battery gigafactory. But after filing for administration in January, it has now been bought by Australian firm Recharge Industries.
Launched in 2019, Britishvolt had planned a £3.8 billion battery plant near the Port of Blyth in Northumberland, promising 300,000 batteries per year, the creation of 3,000 direct jobs, as well as a significant boost to the region’s economy and the UK’s production of EV batteries.
Despite gaining a funding pledge by the government and partnering with major companies like Aston Martin and Glencore, in January, the startup filed a court notice to appoint administrators, after failing to secure sufficient funding. Consequently, Britishvolt terminated its employees, the plant’s construction was halted, and no commercial battery was ever produced.
Now, battery maker Recharge Industries has won the bid to buy Britishvolt out of administration. The Australian startup is owned and run by a New York-based investment fund, Scale Facilitation.
“Our proposal combined our financial, commercial, technology, and manufacturing capabilities, with a highly credible plan to put boots and equipment on the ground quickly,” David Collard, founder and CEO of Scale Facilitation, said in a statement.
As he told the BBC, Britishvolt will maintain its name, but will follow a different direction. It will now focus on batteries for energy storage with the aim to commercialise them by the end of 2025.
This leaves the UK with only one existing battery plant, next to the Nissan factory in Sunderland. The plant is owned by Chinese company Envision AESC.
But it’s not just takeovers by overseas companies that threaten the UK’s plans to build a competitive battery production sector. According to 2022 EU data, some 20 battery gigafactories are being developed across the bloc alongside 111 industrial battery projects.

These are the next 6 industries that are ripe for tech disruption,Emily DSilva,2023/02/17,"
When it comes to investing in innovation, certain industries have flourished over others. Those that haven’t are now facing a do or die situation to keep up with the demands of a modern society, the ever-prominent concern around the climate crisis, inflation issues, and an aging population.
Looking at the global stats Tracxn collected from 230+ sectors between 2013 and 2023, it’s clear which industries — education, hospitality, agriculture, industrial manufacturing, real estate and construction, and commercial airline — have fallen behind, received less funding and seen less successful startups being founded. Whether it’s been down to high costs, difficulty in securing funding due to risky innovation and uncertain ROI, or other financing issues, these industries will require more of a focus moving forward.
As our colleague Arno Nijhof, who leads the company’s innovation arm TNW Programs explained, the move towards more circular and transparent sustainability practices, plus recent supply and demand issues have put increased pressure on many of these industries to adopt new solutions now:
Corporate innovation is more and more focused on providing a positive impact on the world with many looking for new solutions to decarbonize and, at the same time, build a more resilient supply chain. TNW Programs works with a lot of parties, corporates, and companies to identify these opportunities by scouting and analyzing new technologies, startups, and markets. The world is asking for change and its new technological developments that will create the solutions we need to reach those goals.
Here’s a closer look at the industries in question, together with some of the startups challenging the status quo.
Education
Over the last few years, our lifestyles have changed significantly and so have the ways we work, interact, and communicate with each other. However, education has failed to adapt and align with people’s behaviors, tendencies, and society as a whole, with very few long-lasting technological disruptions over the last decade. For example, although 90% of students say they prefer learning online, rather than through traditional methods, the education sector only accounts for 21% of the global learning management systems (LMS) market.
Cloud-based platforms capable of engaging remote students globally are in greater demand. Equally, there is greater understanding that a one-size-fits-all approach doesn’t work when it comes to education, but there’s still so much more educators, parents, and policy makers need to understand to better tailor methods to different types of learners. Digital tools and advanced analytics are needed to assess and track learning progress for educators to have an ongoing insight into what methods are resonating well, and where there’s room for improvement.
Many companies are also starting to look at using VR/AR to enhance the learning process. Startups like Belgium-based Altheria provide VR training experiences that companies can use and tailor to their specific needs.
When it comes to edtech, according to Tracxn there are around 36,600 startups providing technology solutions to businesses and consumers in the education industry. Of that, only 5,500 companies have been funded over the last 10 years, receiving $31.9 billion in 5,850 rounds of funding. More is needed to allow these businesses to flourish and deliver the modern solutions our schools and educational institutions need.
Hospitality
The hospitality industry has been faced with a number of challenges in recent years, from the sudden loss of revenue during the pandemic to a shortage of staff to meet increasingly high demand. At the same time, hotels and vacation rentals are feeling the pressure to improve their sustainability practices as travelers’ preferences for eco-friendly accommodation grow.
Few hotels and vacation rentals are currently employing digital tools to their advantage, for example using AI to automate sharing information and answers with customers before and during their stay, or installing a smart in-room setup that connects to customers’ mobile devices can significantly enhance the customer experience.
Collecting and analyzing data at all touchpoints throughout the customer journey can help proprietors create a more detailed customer profile. Making use of a cloud-based property management system (PMS), such as Germany-based Apaleo, will help automate processes and allow staff to focus on the personalized, high-touch aspects of the customer journey.
With only 3,420 startups and just one unicorn launched in the last 10 years, the hospitality industry is in need of a sprucing up. There’s so much missed opportunity and need for a complete digital transformation, from both the customer experience side of things, as well as the proprietor’s side.
Agriculture
As the world’s population continues to grow, feeding everyone in a sustainable, affordable way is more challenging than ever. The global population and demand for food will increase 70% by 2050, which will continue to put a strain on agriculture and food production.
The biggest challenge we now face is how we can scale up global food production in a way that reaches the entire population, without causing irreparable damage to the planet. Of the 20,600 startups providing tech solutions to the agriculture and food industry in the last 10 years, 2,410 have unfortunately been deadpooled.
5,560 agritech startups, however, have received $52.4billion in funding, and 22 unicorns have been created. Investment is received from many sources: “For example, TNW is working with Rabobank to find innovative solutions that will help its agricultural sector clients to decarbonize,” says Nijhof.
One startup that’s created an interesting product, which is already available to the general public, is Beewise. Based in the Netherlands, the startup uses modern technology to monitor beehives and support healthy pollination and efficient honey harvesting. Anyone can order their own smart Beehome and easily track its progress using an app.
Industrial Manufacturing
Now more than ever the manufacturing industry needs to transform to increase operational efficiency, scale smart factory initiatives, improve supply chain resiliency, and improve sustainability with innovative new materials and processes. Within the next year, 62% of manufacturers plan to focus on robotics and automation, which will likely begin to address some of these needs.
Startups like Mecuris are pushing the boat out by reimagining traditional techniques into digital tools that are intuitive and easy for users to operate when designing orthotic & prosthetic products.
When it comes to developing and working with more sustainable materials, the industry can reduce its reliance on finite materials and energy. There is additionally greater potential for modern materials to allow manufacturers to create products with a longer lifespan, further improving efficiencies, and reducing the need for frequent upgrades and replacements. Finally, adopting a more circular economy allows materials and products to be repurposed, reducing production costs as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
However, while manufacturing has seen some progress, there’s still a lot more potential for the industry to grow and develop. The industry has seen just 970 funded companies, and only 36 series C+ companies. Nevertheless, there is a lot of opportunity for development, and 61% of manufacturers are already planning to partner with specialized tech companies to help drive their growth strategy in the next year.
Real Estate and Construction
Similar to industrial manufacturing, stakeholders in real estate and construction are expecting to see more sustainable solutions being implemented.
However, to make the industry truly sustainable, more transparency is needed, with standardized grades across different countries, as well as accurate traceability of maintenance, analytics, and reporting.
The whole market, process of sales, and construction and renovation needs to evolve, innovate, and increase its digital maturity for professionals to be able to operate more efficiently. 41% of real estate firms admit that keeping up with technology is their biggest challenge, while 30% worry about competition from emerging virtual firms.
Making use of the tools provided by startups like EagleView, which enables greater accuracy and access to property data through the use of autonomous drones, is a good place to start.
In the last 10 years, the industry has had 5,410 startups receive $68.8billion in funding. A significant increase in digital innovation will ultimately be needed for the industry to become more efficient and reduce both monetary and environmental risks and costs.
Commercial Airline
Air and airport congestion continue to be a challenge, but smart technology could help to ease this and enable more user-friendly flight and luggage tracking. Equally, things like ML and AI have the potential to improve efficiencies within the aircraft, to spot faults quicker and help to maintain the health of its components and infrastructure. And, like most other industries, innovation is needed to improve the environmental standards of aviation, for example improving fuel efficiency, in the face of climate change.
Having received the lowest amount of funding since 2013, and $490million in aviation IT and $2.9billion in aerospace tech, the industry has only seen 1,380 startups developed. There’s a lot of opportunities, particularly for companies offering software solutions to the aviation industry and providing tech-based solutions to aircraft manufacturers to transform and improve the industry.
Startups like UK’s Hiiroc have already developed an efficient method for producing zero CO2 emission hydrogen through use of Thermal Plasma Electrolysis technology, which lowers both costs and emissions for commercial airlines.
As each of these industries continues to evolve, more investment, and innovation will be needed to give them a boost. For more insights, strategies, and tips on how to boost innovation within your organization, contact our team here.

7 key takeaways about the Dutch tech startup ecosystem you need to know,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/02/16,"
The Dutch tech startup ecosystem has been steadily flourishing over the past five years, establishing itself as one of Europe’s most vibrant hubs. Yet, there are still hurdles the Netherlands needs to overcome in order to reach its full potential and successfully compete on a global scale.
That’s according to the annual State of Dutch Tech report by TechLeap, a non-profit organisation which helps quantify and accelerate the ecosystem in the Netherlands.
Here are seven key takeaways from the report you need to know about:
The Netherlands houses the EU’s most successful ecosystem
In 2022, the Amsterdam-Delta region was the leading ecosystem in the EU, overtaking Paris and Berlin. Globally, it ranks on the fourteenth place, behind cities in the US, Asia, and the UK.
However, the combined valuations of Dutch startups stagnated, with
the tech sector in the country dropping from the fourth to the sixth position globally at €0.4T in aggregate public market cap. The Netherlands is still the leader in the EU thanks to tech giants ASML, Prosus, and Adyen.
Fintech and healthcare were the dominant startup sectors in the country, with the first producing the greatest number of scaleups as well. The Netherlands also welcomed one new unicorn in 2022, bringing its total to 1.4 unicorns per million inhabitants. This places it above France (0.7) and Germany (0.5), but below Sweden (2.4) and the UK (1.7).
The tech sector is also growing outside the Amsterdam-Delta
Although the North Holland region remains the largest startup centre in the country, generating 38% of startups jobs, other local hubs are also growing thanks to regional specialisations and mutual cooperation.
For instance, North Brabant showed a 27% year-on-year growth in deeptech jobs, Utrecht increased its numbers of startups by 900, and Gelderland has become a leader in foodtech.
Job creation increases, but attracting talent remains a challenge
In 2022, startup-generated jobs reached 135K, rising from 109K in 2020 and 130K in 2021. Attracting tech talent, however, presents to be challenging for many startups.
Specifically, the percentage of hard-to-fill tech jobs has increased to 59%. On average, these types of vacancies stay open for more than 60 days.
This phenomenon occurred in other ecosystems as well, including Sweden, Germany, France, and the US.
Dutch startups struggle scaling up mainly due to lack of funding
The startup to scaleup ratio in the Netherlands (22%) is lower compared to other European hubs, such as Germany (37%), the UK (30%), and France (26%). That’s mainly because of insufficient capital.
In 2022, total VC funding in the Netherlands was €2.6 billion with the average funding being €0.26 million per startup. This was significantly lower than other major EU startup ecosystems. For reference, Sweden’s average was €0.9 million per startup.
Despite the Netherlands’ prowess in scientific and academic research, deeptech is amongst the underinvested sectors with €0.7 billion in funding in 2022 and a 23% startup to scaleup ratio.
On the brightside, investments on impact startups are on the rise with over €1 billion raised in 2022. And investments in all sectors overperformed pre-pandemic levels.
The gender gap
The gender gap is still a problematic issue within the industry. Just 10% of Dutch tech startups are run by women, and funding for female entrepreneurs is similarly insufficient. Only 0.7% of venture capital investments have been raised — since 2019 — by businesses with female founding teams, lagging behind the UK (2%), Germany (1.5%), and France (1.2%).
The potential for further growth
According to the report, the Dutch tech ecosystem has a massive potential of growth. In particular, it could add 250K jobs and €400 billion in value by 2030. This could be done by supporting the growth and impact of university spin-offs, bridging the talent and diversity gap, and cultivating a more resilient and internationally-embedded VC market.

UK scientists discover method to reduce steelmaking’s CO2 emissions by 90%,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/01/27,"
Researchers from the University of Birmingham have developed an innovative method for existing furnaces that could reduce steelmaking’s CO2 emission by nearly 90%.
The iron and steel industry is a major cause of greenhouse gasses, accounting for 9% of global emissions. That’s because of the inherent carbon-intensive nature of steel production in blast furnaces, which currently represent the most-widely used practice.
In blast furnace steel manufacturing, coke (a type of coal) is used to produce metallic iron from ore obtained from mining — which releases large quantities of carbon dioxide in the process. According to Dr Harriet Kildahl, who co-devised the method with Professor Yulong Ding, their technology aims to convert this carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide that can be reused in the iron ore reaction.
This is realised using a thermochemical cycle which performs chemical reactions through changes in temperature. That way, the typically damaging CO2 is turned into a useful part of the reaction, forming “an almost perfect closed carbon loop.” This drastically reduces emission by the amount of coke needed and, subsequently, lowers steelmaking’s emissions by up to 88%.
As per the researchers, if this method was implemented in the remaining two blast furnaces in the UK, it could save £1.28 billion in 5 years, all while reducing the country’s overall emissions by 2.9%.
“Current proposals for decarbonising the steel sector rely on phasing out existing plants and introducing electric arc furnaces powered by renewable electricity. However, an electric arc furnace plant can cost over £1 billion to build, which makes this switch economically unfeasible in the time remaining to meet the Paris Climate Agreement,” Professor Ding said. “The system we are proposing can be retrofitted to existing plants, which reduces the risk of stranded assets, and both the reduction in CO2, and the cost savings, are seen immediately.”
University of Birmingham Enterprise has filed a patent application covering the system and its use in metal production. It’s currently looking for partners to take part in pilot studies and deliver this technology to existing infrastructure, or collaborate on further research to develop the process.

How startups can protect their IP: 8 tips from a patent attorney,Thomas Macaulay,2023/01/25,"
For tech startups, the most valuable assets are often invisible.  While businesses were traditionally built on physical resources, the contemporary economy is increasingly driven by intangibles. The chip firm Arm, for instance, earned a $40 billion valuation and a reputation as the UK’s leading tech company — despite never manufacturing a single chip. Instead, the company designs the processor architecture that’s used in countless devices.
This intellectual property-based business model has transformed stock markets. In 1985, under a third of all assets in the S&P 500 were classed as intangible by 2020, that proportion had risen to around 90%. Startups, however, can overlook IP protection in their initial plans.
According to Robert Lind, a patent attorney at IP firm Marks & Clerk, they’re taking a major risk. Lind recently wrote an e-book on how to protect and monetize their intellectual property. He shared his top tips with TNW.
1. Start your research ASAP
According to Lind, tech firms often neglect IP until their business is exposed to creative and financial peril. He advises them to start their research before they really need it.
Naturally, Lind suggests their study material includes his e-book. But he doesn’t recommend relying on professional advisors at every turn.
“Arm yourself with the knowledge at the outset, so you know when to bring in the experts — and when you don’t need to bring them in,” says Lind. 
For tech startups, patents are the primary form of IP that can be protected. Founders should educate themselves on what a patent is, how to get them, how they’re enforced, and how third-party patents can be interpreted.
2. Keep it confidential
It should go without saying that your brilliant idea should be kept private, but that’s easier said than done. 
“​​Going public doesn’t just mean selling a product,” says Lind. “It could mean presenting a conference paper, publishing an article in a journal, or putting some information on your website. Be very careful about publishing your ideas before you’ve taken a view on whether something’s patentable.”
3. Diligently identify your innovations
Innovations are the lifeblood of patents, but they’re not always easy to identify. Many researchers and engineers don’t realize that their work could be valuable IP. 
“It’s very important that you have regular reviews internally and milestones in your project plans to consider what innovations have been made and whether or not they should be patented,” says Lind.
Lind has spend 24 years as a patent attorney at Marks & Clerk. He graduated from Glasgow University with a BEng in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, and followed this with a PhD in Bioelectronics.
Once you’ve identified an asset, you can get professional advice on whether or not it’s something you could patent.
4. Protect your rights
Experienced investors are savvy about the value of IP. Venture capitalists will use patents as evidence that a company is well-managed, at a certain development stage, and with a market niche. Their due diligence will likely differentiate between filing an application and receiving a granted patent.
Startups, however, often prioritize investing in R&D over protecting their IP. Lind recalls this issue emerging at a green tech company. The team had a very slim IP portfolio, which raised questions about its value to investors. 
“It’s the protection that really crystallizes the value in the R&D that you’re doing,” says Lind.
5. Devise a clear IP strategy
An IP strategy should begin with clear objectives. Broadly, this will involve maximizing value at a desired point of exit or investment, while remaining within the confines of financial prudency. 
Registered rights are territorial, so you’ll need to identify where to register your IP assets. This analysis can incorporate the territory’s size, potential, costs, and effectiveness. 
A cautious strategy can defer costs and commitments, but bear in mind that the registration process can be slow. To avoid delays, file early in the key territories, respond quickly to objections, and embrace opportunities to discuss issues with patent examiners. Careful cost forecasting and budgeting will help cover any pitfalls that emerge.
“You should pursue your strategy quite aggressively,” says Lind. “But unless you know where you want to get to at the start, you’re probably not going to get anywhere useful.”
6. Map your IP to your business — and the future
You need to make sure your IP maps to the tech you can sell. According to Lind, it’s surprisingly easy to get patents granted that don’t align with your most valuable assets.
“Make sure your patents actually cover what the efficient and clever parts are — that’s very important,” he says.
The e-book is available as a free download from the Marks & Clerk website.
Your IP should also be future-proofed, as the end product can be very different to the original vision. One of Lind’s previous clients, DNANudge, raised $60 million after building a portfolio of patent rights with diverse potential. While the company already sells a consumer product, its IP could also be integrated into various other devices or apps.
“Make sure your IP is broad enough in scope to cover not just what you’re doing now but also what you’re doing in the future,” suggests Lind.
7. Keep building your portfolio
Lind advises startups to look beyond those first few patents for their big idea. After all, each patent only lasts for 20 years.
“A slow-burn startup might take 10 years to get its product to market, which only leaves them with 10 years left on the patent,” says Lind. “They’ve got to keep innovating and keep patenting so they can keep that pipeline going.”
8. Resolve your ownership issues
The cooperation of staff can be crucial to registering IP. Signatures from inventors, designers, directors, and owners may all be required on legal documents. If you can’t get a name on the dotted line, you could have major problems.
To escape this fate, Lind recommends obtaining the necessary agreements while everyone is happy and cooperating.
“Make sure you clear all that ownership up and keep proper records all the way through the process,” he says. “And do it while everybody’s still friends — and before you start making money.”

EU unveils data-driven plan to make shipbuilding faster and cheaper,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/01/17,"
The EU-funded Smart European Shipbuilding (SEUS) project launched this month, aiming to improve the shipbuilding process via computational tools.
The launch arrives as the maritime industry’s increasingly embraces digitization and automation, facilitated by rapid advancements in data science and software development.
SEUS is backed by a consortium of eight organizations from five European countries, representing different technologies and parts of the design and shipbuilding industry: computational tools development, industrially applied research, and end-users (i.e. shipyards).
These partners will work together to create a framework for data-driven shipbuilding. According to the project’s description, this will be realized through the development of a new integrated platform that incorporates “early and detailed ship design solutions,” “data management,” and “collaboration software.”
Specifically, the platform will build novel practices for human-centric knowledge management, data-driven AI design elements, intelligent technology, and an Industry 5.0 concept for shipbuilding. It will also reinforce the growth of a European workforce that is highly skilled in the integration and deployment of these new technologies.
The project’s ambition is to cut down engineering time by up to 30% percent reduction as well as achieve an up to 20% reduction in the time needed for assembly and construction at EU shipyards. If it succeeds, it’s expected to not only accelerate shipbuilding’s digital transformation, but also provide shipbuilders in the Union with a strong competitive advantage through cost- and time-savings in the design and production stages.
Finland’s Cadmatic, Contact Software in Germany, and Netherlands-based Sarc BV will be contributing to the technological expertise. Ulstein Group in Norway and Astilleros Gondan in Spain are the two joining shipyards. And three research institutes, the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Turku University in Finland, and NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences in The Netherlands, represent the academic partners.
SEUS is being funded by Horizon Europe, the EU’s flagship research and innovation program. The Union is providing approximately €7 million for its implementation.

Brainy UK scientists create robust optic fiber that may unlock our quantum future,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/01/16,"
Optical fibers have become the foundation of modern data transmission, used for everything from telecoms and internet services to governmental and space applications. This is because they’re capable of transmitting larger amounts of data at faster speeds and over longer distances, compared to other technologies.
The structure of optical fibers, however, can occasionally lead to network failures, as any twisted or bent cables can hinder the information transfer. To address this issue, scientists at the University of Bath in the UK have designed a new type of fiber, aiming to enhance the robustness of these networks.
A regular optical fiber consists of three elements: the core, the cladding, and the coating.
The core is at the center and provides a pathway for light (the medium through which data is transmitted) to travel. The cladding holds the light inside the core and controls the direction in which it travels, bouncing along as though reflecting off a mirror. Finally, the coating works as the primary buffer and a jacket encases the entire structure.

“Whenever you fabricate a fiber-optic cable, small variations in the physical structure of the fiber are inevitably present. When deployed in a network, the fiber can also get twisted and bent,” Physics PhD student Nathan Roberts — who led the research — said.
These distortions can hinder the light’s optimum pathway and lead to information degradation as it moves between the sender and receiver.
“One way to counter these variations and defects is to ensure the fiber design process includes a real focus on robustness. This is where we found the ideas of topology useful,” Roberts added.
Topology is the mathematical study of the properties of geometrical objects that remain unchanged despite deformations, twistings, and stretchings. It has already been applied to physics and light research, but the Bath scientists are the first to use it in optical fibers.
The physicists have created a fiber that employs topological principles by adding several light-guiding cores in the fiber, linked together in a spiral. Light can still travel between these cores, but, thanks to the topological design, it remains trapped within the edge. These so-called “edge states” are shielded from disorder in the overall structure.
“By adopting optical fibers with topological design, researchers will have the tools to pre-empt and forestall signal-degrading effects by building inherently robust photonic systems,” Dr Anton Souslov, co-author of the study, explained.
Currently, the researchers are looking for industry partners to further develop their concept, which could benefit not only existing communications, but also future quantum networks.
“We have shown that you can make kilometers of topological fiber wound around a spool. We envision a quantum internet where information will be transmitted robustly across continents using topological principles,” Roberts noted.
Compared to conventional computers, quantum technology is expected to be vastly more powerful when it comes to storing and processing information, while promising an unparalleled (so far) level of data security — a potential game changer for information networks.
However, the quantum states of light with transfer information can be easily affected by the environment, presenting a significant challenge. This study may pave the way towards using topological design to preserve quantum information in optical fibers.

Quantum computing startup eyes mainstream adoption after £30m investment,Thomas Macaulay,2023/01/14,"
Quantum computing has immense potential but incredible complexities. While zealots claim it will cure cancer and save the planet, critics warn their promises are far from being fulfilled.
One of their key challenges lies at the very heart of the field: ​​quantum bits, or “qubits.” These information units are the quantum analog of binary bits in classical computers. To make quantum computers useful, the qubits have to be reliably controlled and manufactured at scale.
It’s a requirement that still confounds the world’s leading computer scientists. The likes of IBM and Google made impressive strides by building qubits into their quantum chips, which have to obey the laws of quantum physics at temperatures near absolute zero. 
One issue with this approach is that it requires million-dollar refrigerators. Another is that just a single atom in the wrong place on the chip can cause computing mistakes.
Oxford Ionics, a startup based in the UK, applies a different technique. The company uses a proprietary technology called Electronic Qubit Control (EQC) to control the qubits. This system applies different voltages and currents on a traditional microchip, which create magnetic fields in the surrounding space. 
The quantum bits in this system are comprised of individual atoms. In their natural state, these atoms don’t tend to stay still long enough to perform a computation. To stabilize them, one of their electrons is removed to make an ion. These ions have an electrical charge, which enables the electromagnetic field to “trap” them less than a hair’s width above a chip.


“We have perfect qubits.


Dr Chris Balance, who co-founded Oxford Ionics in 2019, compares the effect to toys that use magnets to suspend objects in the air.
“This gives us the best of both worlds: we have a chip that can be made just like a normal computer processor and which can run at room temperature, and we have perfect qubits made from single ions hovering above the chip,” Balance tells TNW. “Not building the qubits means we can’t build them wrong. Nature guarantees each individual atom is perfectly identical to any other.”

Unlike other “trapped-ion” exponents, Oxford Ionics doesn’t rely on lasers to control qubits. According to Balance, laser-controlled devices are effective for small systems, but extremely difficult to fabricate and integrate at chip scale. They also become error-prone as the size of the processor and the number of qubits grows.
In tests, the Oxford Ionics system has shown seemingly superior results. The ​​technology currently holds a range of records for quantum computing performance, speed, and error rates, Ballance’s research was also cited in the scientific release that accompanied this year’s Nobel Prize in Physics. 
These achievements have caught the eyes of investors. Last week, Oxford Ionics announced that it had raised £30 million in Series A funding, which will be used to grow the team and bring the tech to market.


“We are entering the discovery phase.


Balance is now looking forward to solving real-world problems.
“Over the next few years, we are entering the discovery phase of quantum computing: up to now we have not had quantum computers that solve problems we can’t solve any other way — now we do!”
Balance doesn’t expect to integrate Quantum Ionics’ tech into general-purpose chips. Instead, he envisions the company’s quantum chips running in parallel with classical semiconductors.
“Think GPUs alongside CPUs,” he says.
It may likely still take years for killer apps to emerge, but Oxford Ionics could push quantum computing closer to the mainstream.

Sweden discovers rare earth metals — and that could redefine Europe’s relationship with China,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/01/13,"
Swedish company LKAB has discovered what’s claimed to be Europe’s biggest deposit of rare earth metals, promising a critical boost in the continent’s trade security and green transition.
“Rare earths” are a group of 17 chemical elements composed of scandium, yttrium, and lanthanides. Contrary to their name, rare earths are actually abundant; their rarity stems from the complexity of their extraction, separation, and refining, which can generate toxic and radioactive waste, negatively impacting the environment.
But despite their environmental hazards, they are crucial for the manufacture of numerous high-tech products. This ranges from household goods (TVs, computers, and smartphones) to medical equipment (X-Ray and MRI scanning) and defense systems (jets and night vision tech, among others).
Most notably, they’re also key for the clean energy transition, as they are components of the magnets used in EVs and wind turbines.
With no mining of its own, the EU imports 98% of its rare earth metals supply from China, which houses the majority of the world’s reserve and is the biggest global supplier.
LKAB’s discovery, however, could be a game changer. The state-owned company said that it has found a deposit — named Per Geijer — of over one million tons in the Kiruna area, located in Lapland within the Arctic Circle.

“Electrification, the EU’s self-suffiency and independence from Russia and China will begin in the mine,” Sweden’s Minister for Energy, Business, and Industry, Ebba Busch, said in a statement.
“We need to strengthen industrial value chains in Europe and create real opportunities for the electrification of our societies. Politics must give the industry the conditions to switch to green and fossil-free production,” she noted.
Reducing reliance on foreign supply chains and ensuring access to critical raw materials is an integral focus of the EU agenda as well as Europe’s aim to become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.
“Lithium and rare earths will soon be more important than oil and gas,” EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stressed during a speech in September. “Our demand for rare earths alone will increase fivefold by 2030,” she added, highlighting the imperative to avoid becoming dependent as on oil and gas.
In the same line of thought, EU Commissioner Thierry Breton underlined the need for action. “Take China, with its quasi-monopoly on rare earths and permanent magnets and prices rising by 50-90% in the past year alone,” he wrote. “Supply of raw materials has become a real geopolitical tool.”
While LKAB is already investing heavily in the project to move forward, President and Group CEO Jan Moström emphasized that there’s a long road ahead. He expects that it’ll take several years to investigate the deposit, assess its profitability, and evaluate the sustainability and environmental impact of the mining process. Following that, LKAB can proceed with an environmental review application and a permit application.
“If we look at how other permit processes have worked within our industry, it will take at least 10 to 15 years before we can actually begin mining and deliver raw materials to the market,” Moström explained.
Providing that LKAB finds a way to mitigate the environmental cost entailed in mining, the Per Geijer deposit could provide Europe with the impetus in needs to ensure domestic supply of critical raw materials and facilitate its green transition.

Concrete is one of the world’s most harmful materials. Graphene could change that,Thomas Macaulay,2023/01/11,"
Concrete has been described as the most destructive material on Earth. After water, it’s the most used substance in the world, with twice the usage of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminium combined.
To manufacture all this concrete, more than 4 billion tonnes of cement are produced every year. According to the Chatham House think tank, that creates around 8% of all CO2 emissions — more than what’s caused by all the trucks across the globe.
Cement makers urgently need to reduce this footprint. To meet the requirements of the Paris Agreement on climate change, the industry needs to cut emissions by at least 16% by 2030. At the same time, the sector faces growing demand from rapid urbanization and population growth.
It’s foreboding problem. But engineers believe that graphene offers a solution.


“Just 0.01% of the material is required.


First isolated at the University of Manchester in 2004, Graphene’s 2D nature provides a unique combination of strength, flexibility, lightness, and conductivity. These properties caught the eye of Nationwide Engineering, a British construction business. 
The firm’s memorably-acronymed R&D subsidiary, NERD (Nationwide Engineering Research and Development), was tasked with turning the “wonder material” into a new additive: Concretene. 
The substance has already formed floor slabs in the UK. Credit: Concretene
Concretene consists of graphene that’s produced at Manchester University. Small quantities of the liquid formulation are added during the concrete mixing process. 
The graphene provides both mechanical support and an active surface for the chemical reactions that occur during the cement hydration and hardening.
“Very low dosages of the material, in some cases less than 0.01%, are required to deliver substantial performance gains,”  Alex McDermott, the co-founder of Concretene, tells TNW.
“This means that Concretene is commercially viable with wholesale costs to be in-line with existing additives already used in the concrete industry.”

 
According to McDermott, Concretene used in real construction projects was up to 30-50% stronger than standard concrete. Subsequent lab tests have shown strength gains that surpass 100%. As a result, the volume of cement required can significantly reduce without impairing performance. 
Costs, shrinking, and cracking can also be trimmed, while increases in density cut concrete’s porosity.
“These factors will enable engineers to reduce the volume of concrete required in designs going forward, further reducing the CO₂  impact,” says McDermott.
Ultimately, he believes Concretene could be used in more than 99% of concretes worldwide.
McDermott’s team worked with the University of Manchester’s Graphene Engineering Innovation Centre (GEIC) to develop Concretene. Credit: Concretene
Initial tests of Concretene have produced promising results. 
In 2021, NERD laid the world’s first graphene concrete slab across the floor of a new gym in England. Further trials followed at a roller disco and a residential development.
In total, more than 1,000 tonnes of Concretene have now been poured in real-world projects. The next target is pushing the product into the mainstream.

Graphene has been challenging to produce at speed and scale, but recent breakthroughs have made mass-production a more realistic prospect.
These developments have restored faith from investors. In December, Concretene raised £8m from a VC funding round led by LocalGlobe. The cash will be used to accelerate the commercialization plans.
Concretene will now turn to collaborations with Heathrow Airport, Network Rail, Yorkshire Water, and the Environment Agency. Work will also soon begin on the first road trial of Concretene with National Highways
“Concretene is being put through ‘live’ trials in the places where it can be used most,” says McDermott. “This is a key step to achieving industry adoption.”
That could be good news for both the construction sector and the environment. Because despite the claims of British shock jocks, you can’t actually grow concrete — but you can grow graphene.

"Wind, solar, and hydrogen: How energy will get more sustainable in 2023",Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/01/10,"
Both the EU’s ambitious 2030 climate target and the current energy crisis have highlighted the need to accelerate the transition to renewable energy.
And while wind, solar, and green hydrogen are already on the rise, there are still important steps to be taken the coming year to increase their sustainability — and improve what they’re capable of.
To find out how this will work, TNW spoke with three experts.
Wind power
Floating offshore wind is a “game changer” for the renewable energy industry and a “key technology” against climate change, Felipe Cornago — Commercial Director Offshore Wind, at BayWa r.e. — told us.
That’s because it has the potential not only to take advantage of areas with higher wind intensity, but also to open up markets previously incompatible with bottom-fixed technologies.
Compared to fixed installations, floating offshore wind farms also come with reduced environmental impact in maritime ecosystems, as well lower construction costs.

But despite accelerated development in recent years, as Cornago noted, there are still numerous challenges to be addressed.
“This is why industry and government efforts in 2023 should focus on a number of areas, including the establishment of clear regulatory frameworks as well as improving grid connection and grid planning,” he explained.
As per Cornago, focus should also be placed on the standardization of technological and commercial solutions. Currently, there’s a gamut of different designs and manufacturing methods, all of which drives costs up.
Finally, he believes that the lack of expertise in developing floating offshore wind platforms will start being mitigated in the coming year. This will be done “by tapping into pre-existing infrastructure and knowledge from the development of bottom-fixed offshore wind,” as well as “adapting existing supply chains.”
Solar
According to Frank Jessel — Global Director of Solar Trade at BayWa r.e. — 2022 has seen a rapid expansion in the adoption of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems and their accompanying energy storage solutions.

Jessel expects this trend to continue in 2023 “with the endorsement of renewables within the residential and commercial PV market higher than ever, and the price of PV systems in particular falling mid-term due to technological improvements, decreasing freight prices, and economies of scale.”
However, there are still challenges that hinder accelerated growth and require solutions, he added. These are disruptions in supply chains and a shortage of skilled workers regarding the installation of PV systems.
Green hydrogen
Green hydrogen, powered by renewable sources such as wind and solar, is a clean and promising alternative to fossil fuels.
But for the industry to achieve efficient production, it’s necessary to recognize the vital role of digitalization, David Hall, VP Power Systems at Schneider Electric UK & Ireland, told TNW.
“The challenges in the scaled production of green hydrogen can be addressed largely by using new digital technologies available today,” he explained.
For starters, digital twin technology and 3D modeling allows the simulation of data throughout the entire lifecycle of a green hydrogen plant, reducing costs, risks, and time.
Secondly, Hall highlighted the importance of an “overarching” Energy Management System that will indicate the optimal times to use electricity from the grid and forecast power generation, to ensure hydrogen’s required volume production on a low-cost basis.
Finally, he noted the need for a Unified Operating Center. This translates to the use of a Pi system — a software that collects and analyzes operational data — that can bring together all the different assets to allow for better decision making, optimal performance, and reduced downtime.

Facilitating the faster adoption of wind, solar, and green hydrogen requires our efforts beyond 2023, but starting to apply some of the above measures definitely marks a significant start.

French startup uses Hi-Fi speakers to develop eco-friendly heat pumps,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/01/9,"
Amidst the climate and energy crisis, heat pumps have emerged on the housing heating market as a technology that can replace gas and oil, while lowering the energy bills. Yet, their air compression systems require refrigerants to work. These refrigerants, also known as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), are amongst the most potent greenhouse gasses.
Founded in 2017 and having raised €5 million, French deeptech startup Equium is seeking to provide a more ecological alternative. With this aim, it has developed a novel, acoustic heat pump core that harnesses the energy of sound.
The so-called Acoustic Heat Pump (AHP) can cover a household’s heating needs without the use of refrigerants. Instead, its operation is based on the phenomenon of thermoacoustics — the convergence of thermics, acoustics, and fluid mechanics.
The core works with a high-fidelity (Hi-Fi) speaker powered by electricity, which generates an acoustic wave in tubes filled with helium — a neutral and non-toxic gas that accelerates the propagation of sound. The acoustic wave causes the gas to compress or expand, producing heat or cold, respectively. It remains confined within the system, which allows the machine to be silent.

According to Equium, the heat pump isn’t just greenhouse gas-free, but also made from 100% recyclable materials, boasting overall a very low carbon footprint. At the same time, the machine’s ecological mode of operation is claimed to provide the same efficiency of a conventional heat pump, while increasing energy savings and overall cost.
A big part of that is the pump’s modulation, which allows users to increase or decrease the speaker’s volume to achieve the desired power output. Apart from that, the system is easy to install, doesn’t require maintenance and has a lifespan of around 30 years — about twice as long as a conventional heat pump.
As per the startup’s founder, Cédric François, for an equivalent cost and size, the AHP’s advantage translates to a 50% lower CO2 impact and a 20% lower energy consumption.
Equium’s aim is to sell its acoustic cores to heat pump manufacturers, seeking to develop a French acoustic HP industry. The first integration will be processed by the startup’s strategic partner Arkteos, a regional manufacturer. The company is currently conducting field tests and expects to market its product in 2024.
To date, the young French startup has only one competitor in this brand new market: Netherlands-based BlueHeart Energy. But hopefully, more companies will start tapping into the capabilities of thermoacoustics to revolutionize heat pump technology.

Your laggy WordPress site is annoying customers — here’s how to speed it up,Andrea Hak,2022/12/12,"
In an age when consumers expect products and services on demand, there are very few things more annoying than a sluggish website.
And for businesses that fail to keep their website at optimal performance, there’s a big risk: it kills the customer experience. Studies show that just two seconds of additional loading time can increase bounce rates by 103%, meanwhile 100 milliseconds of load time can cause a 7% drop in conversion.
Site speed is also a factor in Google rankings on desktop and mobile. Poor performance can reduce your site’s visibility on search engines, killing your traffic.
But, you’re in luck — if your website runs on a WordPress site, there are six things you can do to make sure it performs at tip top speed.
1. Identify the problem
This may seem obvious, but figuring out why your website is performing slowly is the first step.
This could be anything from issues with your site’s web hosting provider to slow WordPress plugins and themes. Figuring out which issue is causing sluggishness is key to figuring out the optimizations you should prioritize.
Start by running a page loading speed test using an online tool like GTmetrix, Google PageSpeed Insights, or WebPageTest. Keep in mind that load times should be less than one second.
Each tool has its own performance metrics that can give you better insight as to why your website is lagging in the first place, such as the web page’s speed index or network payloads, which can be due to excessive CSS, page content, or unoptimized images.
WordPress users should also specifically test their themes and plugins for performance issues. This requires disabling one theme or plugin at a time, and carrying out the aforementioned page loading tests. This way you can narrow down if any of these add-ons are the root cause.
2. Choose a lean theme
In the world of WordPress, you’ll hear this pretty often: choose the theme for the look and feel, and choose the plugins for functionality. But when it comes to themes, it’s not all about looks.
Themes have different sizes, in terms of both page size and the number of requests — or number of files it has to load. The size of the theme will have a huge effect on your website’s loading time.
Again, you can test out themes on your website by doing a page loading speed test (as mentioned above), It only takes a few minutes.
3. Optimize images
Similarly to how a theme’s size affects speed, the images on your webpage will also have an impact. By optimizing and compressing images, or shrinking their file size down, you can speed site performance up.
The quickest way to go about this is by using an image compression plugin. But, you can also resize the image so it uses fewer pixels, or serve images through a content delivery network (CDN), which is essentially a server that hosts the images, videos, and CSS, and delivers them quickly to your page as it loads.
Finally, you can also try cleaning out your WordPress library. As you build pages, images, videos, and other files tend to accumulate, taking up storage. Even if you delete, for example, the blog post that hosted these images, they stay in your WP library.
Before cleaning out your WP, make sure you have a backup of your WordPress site in case things go wrong.
4. Only show text extracts
If you’re looking to host a blog feature on your website, another hack for speeding up overall site performance is to only show short snippets of the posts on the homepage, or elsewhere.
By default, many WordPress themes show full posts on a site’s blog, home page, and archives, which can create a major lag. It can also negatively impact search engine performance, because it acts as duplicate content on your website.
When choosing your theme, make sure to check if full blog posts or excerpts are the default option. If so, you can change the settings. WordPress also allows users to customize excerpts, so you can create a catchy bit of text to drive better engagement.
5. Choose the right WordPress host
Hosting your WordPress site in an isolated environment could mean both faster speed and better security as the provider takes care of both the maintenance and security of the site.
WordPress providers, like IONOS, endeavor to make life easier for WordPress users as they provide all the features of a secure server infrastructure for a small monthly fee (you can try IONOS’ “Grow” package for as little as $1 a month when starting out).
IONOS also comes with a free caching plugin, which can help boost loading speeds by using a full page cache to store HTML. For example, the company claims its latest version has made loading three times faster.
6. Fine tune your website
After you’ve taken care of steps one through five, there are several smaller adjustments you can make to fine-tune the speed of your WordPress site.
First, break up longer posts into smaller pages. While readers may enjoy a nice long read on a single page, this could hurt your site’s load times.
Next, reduce the number of external HTTP requests on your site. WordPress plugins and themes often load a whole bunch of content and files from other sites, such as images, scripts and stylesheets. If your WP plugin is making too many requests, it could kill your speed. One way to avoid this is by activating GZIP compression, which compresses all the files being sent to your site. Check out these code shortcuts to help you out.
Believe it or not, most WP sites also come with an extra JavaScript file for emojis. If you don’t actually use or think you’ll ever need to use emojis, disabling them could help speed up your site.
Also, consider lazy loading. This means images and videos load only when they appear on the user’s screen as they scroll through your site, rather than all at once. WordPress users can implement lazy loading with the Lazy Load by WP Rocket plugin.
When you’re competing against thousands of other websites to prove your product or service is the best on the market, every second counts. Don’t let load times get in the way of your success.

5 tips for writing amazingly jargon-free product copy,Built In,2022/07/22,"
This article was originally published on Built In by Alexander Lewis. 
What is jargon, anyway? In a literal sense, jargon is simply a word or phrase that requires specialized knowledge for the reader to understand. For our purposes — which include helping people at technical companies write clearly about their offerings — that definition isn’t practical. Most of us only think of the word “jargon” in a negative sense. It’s something we’re supposed to avoid in our writing at all costs.
But that’s not quite accurate. After all, good writing and technical writing are not antonyms. If the audience on your website has specialized knowledge, then there’s nothing wrong with using some industry parlance to communicate your offering.
So where do we draw the line between jargon and necessary parlance?
I believe what we’re really trying to solve is how to write about a technical product in a way that sticks in the reader’s mind. We want our copy to be memorable and clear, without being dumbed down. That’s why in this article, I’ll break down my own more practical definition of jargon and five tactics for how to find the right replacement words and phrases.
A copywriter’s definition of jargon
When it comes to writing for a business, I find it helpful to define jargon as any business word or phrase that lacks a visual component to stick in the reader’s head. Non-visual words are forgotten almost as soon as they’re read because there’s nothing visual, emotional, or otherwise sticky about them.
Consider a phrase like “business solution.” When used in a sentence (“ABC Corp. delivers best-in-class business solutions”), you lose the reader. There’s nothing about the phrase to cause it to stick in the reader’s mind. Asking a reader to visualize a “business solution” is like asking them to grab fog.
Fortunately, there are several easy shortcuts you can use to find clearer, simpler, and “stickier” words.
How to write memorable, jargon-free copy
Tactic #1: Trade vague for visual
A lot of jargon is the result of speaking in generalities instead of specifics. The carwash down the street isn’t marketed as “a water-based transformation solution for vehicles.” The operation is called a carwash. It’s the clearest, simplest, and most visual term for what is being offered.
When you’ve written a sentence about your product or company, do the visualization test. Look at each word in the sentence and determine if your words have a visual counterpart. As soon as you do this, words like “synergy,” “solution,” or “tactical” are the first to the chopping block.
Tactic #2: 1 point per sentence
Don’t try to impress with long, comma-packed sentences. If you have multiple points to make, save each of them for their own sentence. It’s easiest to remember the details of something we’ve read when the finer details are broken down into individual sentences.
Just think about it: Long sentences are often filled with extraneous detail, and they drag the reader on, and on, and on until they’re just skimming your words, speed reading your copy, or skipping to the next section to avoid the long-winded mess before it exhausts them.
Instead, slow down. Keep sentences short. Simple is more memorable.
Tactic #3: Write in an email, not a doc
Even for experienced writers, a blank document with a flashing cursor can be deeply intimidating. Word and Google Docs cause many of us to write like self-important professors, thinking only of lofty words instead of short, crisp ones.
Just change your context. Start writing about your product in the body of an email or in a physical notebook. It may even help you to start with an introduction like “Dear Mom” to help you take things less seriously. This practice gets you out of your own head. It puts your mind at ease, allowing you to write using a more conversational tone.
Tactic #4: Read reviews of your product
You know who almost never uses jargon when talking or writing about your products? Customers.
If you’re looking for inspiration for easy words and phrases to use in your copy, just read some online reviews. Better yet, get on the phone with one of your best customers.
This is the first place I turn when starting a new website copywriting project. Customers have the best language for talking about your product because they’ve never been influenced by all the technical specs, years of meticulous product development, and marketing-speak that you have.
Reading customer language saves you time and nine times out of 10 will produce better copy than anything you’d write on your own.
Tactic #5: Answer ‘What’s in it for me?’
One of the most common causes of jargon is simply writing about details your customers don’t care about. This comes down to what many marketers call the difference between features and benefits. Features are specs. Benefits are how your features positively impact the customer.
This is the famous iPod slogan, “1,000 songs in your pocket,” in action. While other music players were talking about gigabytes and storage, Apple cut to the chase. They named what mattered to their customers: being able to listen to all their favorite songs, wherever they go.
So the next time you write a sentence or paragraph about your product, imagine your best customer could read that line. Would they get excited about what you just wrote? Or would they grimace and ask, “What’s in it for me?”

"Influencer is a popular career choice for young people, but it has a dark side",The Conversation,2022/07/21,"
A 2019 poll found that children would rather be YouTubers than astronauts. It made headlines and led to plenty of grumbling about “kids these days”. But it’s not surprising that young people – up to 1.3 million in the UK – want to make their income by creating social media content.
The global influencer market was estimated to be worth $13.8 billion (£11.2 billion) in 2021. Individual influencers such as Zoella and Deliciously Ella are worth around £4.7 million and £2.5 million, respectively. Some 300,000 people aged 18-26 are already using content creation as their sole income source.
The lifestyles we see advertised on social media are enticing, but is influencing a viable career path? Underneath the glossy exterior lies precarious income, pay inequality based on sex, race and disability, and mental health issues. In my research with travel influencers and content creators, I have observed these impacts, which young people hoping to become influencers should be aware of.
Successful influencers will be the first to claim that anyone can make it in the industry. Love Island contestant-turned-influencer Molly Mae Hague was criticized for saying that everyone “has the same 24 hours in a day” because in reality, few people “make it” financially as influencers.
Social media economy expert Brooke Erin Duffy researches the careers of fashion bloggers, beauty vloggers, and designers. In her book (Not) Getting Paid To Do What You Love, she uncovered a huge gap between those who find lucrative careers as influencers and everyone else. For most people trying to become an influencer, their passion projects of content creation often become free work for corporate brands.
In an April 2022 report, Parliament’s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee identified pay disparity as a key issue in the influencer industry. There are pay gaps on the basis of gender, race, and disability. The DCMS report referred to a 2020 study from MSL Group, a global public relations firm, which found a racial pay gap of 35% exists between white and Black influencers.
Adesuwa Ajayi, senior talent and partnerships lead at AGM Talent, started an Instagram account called Influencer Pay Gap to highlight these disparities. The account provides a platform where influencers anonymously share stories about their experiences of collaborating with brands. In addition to racial disparities, the account has also exposed pay gaps experienced by disabled and LGBTQ+ influencers.The DCMS report also noted a “pervasive lack of employment support and protection”. Most influencers are self-employed, often experiencing inconsistent income and a lack of protection that comes with permanent employment – such as entitlement to sick pay and holiday.
The risks of self-employment are exacerbated in the influencer industry by an absence of industry standards and little pay transparency. Influencers are often forced to assess their own value and determine fees for their work. As a result, content creators often undervalue their own creative labor, and many end up working for free.
Power to the platforms
Influencers are also often at the mercy of algorithms – the behind-the-scenes computer programs that determine which posts are shown, in which order, to users. Platforms share little detail about their algorithms, yet they ultimately determine who and what gains visibility (and influence) on social media.
In her work with Instagram influencers, algorithms expert Kelley Cotter highlights how the pursuit of influence becomes “a game of visibility”. Influencers interact with the platform (and its algorithm) in ways that they hope will be rewarded with visibility. In my research, I found that influencers shared increasingly intimate and personal moments of their lives, posting relentlessly in a bid to stay relevant.
The threat of invisibility is a constant source of insecurity for influencers, who are under constant pressure to feed platforms with content. If they don’t, they may be “punished” by the algorithm – having posts hidden or displayed lower down on search results.







Mental health crisis
Constant online presence ultimately leads to one of the most pervasive issues of the influencer industry: mental health concerns. Influencers can connect to their platform workspaces and audience at any time of day or night – for many, there is no longer a clear separation between work and life. Coupled with the fear of losing visibility, this can lead to influencers working excessively and facing mental health issues such as burnout.
Online visibility also places content creators at risk of significant online abuse –- both in relation to how they look or what they do (or don’t post), but also negative perceptions of influencing as a career. The potential of online abuse can lead to mental and physical health issues, including depression, anxiety, body dysmorphia, and eating disorders.
Although becoming an influencer may look appealing to more and more people, the industry’s dark underside needs to be made visible and improved through enhanced employment regulation and industry-led cultural change.
If you are struggling or feel you could benefit from mental health support, please speak to your GP, and/or try contacting supportive organisations such as The Seasonal Affective Disorders Association, The Samaritans or Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM). There is also information on wellbeing and support via the NHS website.

The tech community has the power to drive change — it’s time to use it for good,Rachel Gilley,2022/07/19,"
As a communications professional with more than 20 years in the industry, I can say with certainty that one of the most refreshing and hopeful changes I have seen in the past few years is the increasing authenticity and focus on social activism from tech organizations big and small.
It’s one of the reasons why I was excited to see impact at the forefront of TNW Conference 2022, bringing together leaders and changemakers to convene on topics on how tech firms can make changes that will lead us to a more inclusive and equal industry.
The world needs CHANGE
At Clarity, we are firm in our belief that businesses have a responsibility to act as citizens of the world — we cannot expect individuals to act to make change if we don’t do the same at an organizational level.
Increasingly, consumers are not taking a back seat and waiting for businesses to take a stand. They’re poking holes in corpspeak and demanding genuine change — with their dollars, their voices, and the decisions of where and how they work. For businesses to survive, they must listen to these myriad voices asking for change.
This year’s TNW Conference was of course the place to be inspired with the likes of Boyan Slat, who dropped out of university to found The Ocean Cleanup, or by Greenpeace CTO Priscilla Chomba-Kinywa, who shared her vision on delivering inclusive technology to the Global South, without falling into traps of bias and digital colonialism.
Or take TNW Startup Pitch Battle winner Swap-studio, who want us privileged Western consumers to stop shopping so much, because buying less is better than buying “green.” So why not buy NFT-traceable second-hand or end-of-life products and save a lot of H2O and CO2?
It was also heartening to see that change is not the sole purview of the young or disenfranchised, but supported by people of all generations and levels of privilege. At 67, Sir Tim Berners-Lee is aiming to ‘fix’ what went wrong with that little invention of his: the World Wide Web. Through his new company, Inrupt, and a new open source technology called Solid, he is adamant about returning data ownership to the users of the web.
Taking responsibility
Companies fixing past missteps (intentional and unintentional) and righting wrongs is what their audiences require of them. This is why we’ve moved on from ‘brand authenticity’ to embrace ‘brand activism’. It no longer serves to passively share your values and pay lip service to good causes. Companies need to walk the talk.
It’s why we need companies like Accion at the vanguard; its CEO Michael Schlein spoke at an illuminating fireside on how fintech can disrupt a global financial system that is currently failing three billion people living in poverty. We take for granted that we have credit cards, that we can buy a home, start a business. Our bills and income come on a monthly basis. For many of us, that is the norm. But think of the many farmers in vast areas of the world who get paid only once or twice a year at harvest time!
But now, “we live in a revolution of innovation,” as Schlein says. “When you’re dealing with financial services for the poor, the argument used to be that distances were insurmountable or transactions would be too small.” Technology has changed all this. Fintech companies with the right activist mentality can bring security, visibility, and opportunity to people hitherto ignored by the tech industry.
In a world that is increasingly looking like it’s in crisis, economically, politically, societally, and environmentally, we should be looking to the tech industry to help shape our future and build a cleaner, healthier, and more equitable world. Those are the companies that we work with at Clarity. Because stories that engender positive change need to be heard. We’ve already had too many negative stories about technology changing things for the worse. Let’s amplify the stories that make things better.

Pay compression is widening the gap between new and existing employees,Amanda Kavanagh,2022/06/27,"
Business owners have known the value of loyalty for a long time. From customers collecting stamps for retail loyalty programmes, to Air Miles, coupons, plastic cards and mobile apps, the mechanism has changed but the rationale remains: repeat purchases are key for growth in almost all businesses.
Similarly, businesses also know that employee loyalty will help a company advance. From driving positive customer experiences to improved productivity and production, the benefits of employee loyalty are also well documented. So why then did a recent social media post on rewarding existing employees cause such a stir?
The LinkedIn post in question was posted by Robert Sweeney, CEO at Facet and former Netflix employee, who detailed how he had been only working at Netflix a few months when the company hired someone new into the same position but at a higher salary.
Netflix increased his salary to match, a practice Sweeney has carried through at Facet. He wrote:
“If you have to pay more to hire new employees that means the market has gone up and your current employees need a raise to match. Don’t punish loyal employees for sticking with you by allowing their compensation to fall behind the market.”
Seems pretty right on, right? Well, reactions were mixed to say the least. While loyal employees commented in agreement and praise — with one eye on the rising cost of living. Others argued against the practice, saying that in this difficult hiring market, companies need to offer above market rates to attract talent and that, when it stabilizes, they’ll be at a competitive disadvantage to those that didn’t hire during this time.
Resentment festering
The reality is, it’s demotivating for loyal employees to see a newbie breeze in on a higher salary, especially if it’s in a role with less responsibility. That annual 3% salary bump loyal employees get — if they’re lucky — is hard-earned. Resentment can fester and grow quickly in this environment.
A Jabra report also says that, since the pandemic began, 48% of all employees surveyed have considered changing jobs. In one short year, we’ve bounded from The Great Resignation to the Great Layoff, with 17,000 tech workers laid off in May 2022 alone. Meanwhile, a Microsoft survey of more than 30,000 global workers earlier this year found that four in 10 were likely to consider changing jobs in 2022.
For those companies who are hiring, particularly into remote roles, there is a lot of strong talent available at the moment. And at the same time, between inflation, investment freezes as interest rates rise, and looking ahead to a looming recession, many companies are acting cautiously.
The consequence of these elements is what labor economists call “salary compression.” As companies tighten their belts on current salaries, they’re also paying higher salaries to attract new talent, causing the gap between the two to widen.
On paper, your salary is meant to align with your experience, results, and skills, but that isn’t always the case. Job hunters have always known that being a new recruit is the most powerful position to negotiate a better salary. If you are demotivated by salary compression in your workplace and feel undervalued, it may be time for a change.
List and put in order your priorities for a new role and consider: flexible working, salary, title, benefits, management, progression, hours, company mission, and company culture. Then hit up the TNW House of Talent Job Board to see what’s out there. You’ll find good starting salaries at plenty of organizations. We’ve got three to check out below.

We need to remove the stigma around leadership burnout,Samantha Johnson,2022/06/27,"
When it comes to leadership in today’s startup world, founders, and CEOs are chained to their work more than ever before due to high investor demands, increasingly blurred lines between personal and professional life thanks to remote work, and tech that enables them to be reached — and reach out to employees — 24/7.
But this always-on approach can also lead to higher risk of stress and even burnout. While, since the pandemic started, employee burnout has been put in the spotlight, leadership burnout still remains taboo.
“Particularly in technology, the spirit of entrepreneurship is fast becoming one of toil, long hours, and self-sacrifice,” writes James Routledge, founder and mental health author, in The Guardian.
Angel investors, accelerators and venture capitalists (VCs) encourage startups to work harder, move faster, and, in some cases, ‘sleep faster’. The yardstick has seemingly become hours worked, and who can leave the office the latest. What began as a journey for work-life balance has descended into the rat race most were aiming to avoid.
70% of tech startups fail — no wonder leaders are chained to their Slack.
The truth is that, while more and more leaders are promoting mental health and burnout awareness amongst their employees, by failing to address their own mental health, harmful practices can trickle down throughout the company culture.
So how can we identify leadership burnout and prevent it from happening?
The warning signs
In order to avoid burnout, the first step is being able to recognize the symptoms, which can be a huge challenge in a pressure cooker startup environment.
“Burnout is the combination of three emotions: exhaustion, negativity, and ineffectiveness,” says Cavin Benton, founder and CEO of Spill, a startup that offers a message-based therapy app to improve workplace well-being.
The feelings of negativity and ineffectiveness are what differentiate it from regular tiredness or exhaustion. And it’s different from depression in that it’s purely work-related — you don’t burn out from relationship issues or life stressors, for example.
Benton says leaders should ask themselves the following questions to identify burnout in their workers:

Do they seem more irritable, or regularly exhausted?
Do they tend to point out the worst in everything that happens or is suggested?
Are they quicker to shoot down other people’s ideas?
Do they give off the idea that any work you’re giving them just feels like a burden?
Are they dropping the ball at work when they usually wouldn’t?
Are they producing less ideas, or being slower to respond?

But when it comes to identifying burnout in yourself, it can get a bit trickier, as many startup leaders have trouble setting the same boundaries for themselves as they do their workers.
In Techleap’s new video series, All In, they interview several of the Netherland’s most well-known founders, from Swapfiets’ Richard Burger to Fairphone CEO Eva Gouwens. When asked how much they are their work, nearly all respondents answered similarly:

“I think I’m 100% my work,” says Lieke Pijpers, founder and CPTO of secondhand fashion platform The Next Closet.
Willemijn Schneyder-Valbracht, CEO and founder of manufacturing performance platform Swipeguide, says:
I am my work, and my work is me.
“Swapfiets is a large part of my identity because I started at a very young age (22) and, seven years later, this has been a quarter of my life,” says Richard Burger, founder of Swapfiets.
One big sign that leaders could be heading towards a burnout is feeling “used up” at the end of the workday — nearly 60% of leaders reportedly do.
Mark-Jan Harte, cofounder and CEO of healthtech Aidence says,
If I work too much, then after a couple of weeks, I just crash and I can’t keep it up. And so if it’s something that I can’t do, I can’t ask anyone else to do that either.
Even those who were skeptical at first are now becoming more aware of the effects that overwork can bring. In the All In video series, Ugnius Rimsa, cofounder and CTO of Lalaland, which develops virtual inclusive fashion models, told Techleap:
“I was always a big nonbeliever of burnout. I was like okay this is not really possible or it’s kind of like made-up.” But the fast-paced life of an entrepreneur shifted his thinking. “I wouldn’t say I reached burnout, it was more of like you get a creative barrier where you’re not really creative anymore. That’s what happened to me.”
While the symptoms are becoming more clear, in order to prevent it, it’s important to take a deeper look at some of the causes.
What’s passion got to do with it?
In a study published in the Harvard Business Review, researchers found that passion and destiny beliefs (the belief that a successful entrepreneurial career is “meant to be”) make entrepreneurs more or less likely to experience burnout.
Job passion was divided into two types:
Harmonious passion, or when entrepreneurs are motivated by their job because they’re passionate about the subject and it’s an important part of who they are.
Obsessive passion, or entrepreneurs who were motivated by status, money, and other rewards.
As one might guess, entrepreneurs who are motivated by status or money are more likely to experience burnout.
This comes through quite clearly in some of the successful leadership teams that have grown in the Netherlands. For example, Michiel Roodenburg, CFO at Crisp, an online-only supermarket focused on fresh produce, told Techleap:
I have a strong opinion about food. I like discussing it with my family. I even visit suppliers with my kids. It’s part of my personal life.
Destiny beliefs added yet another layer to the cake. If you’re familiar with psychologist Carol Dweck’s fixed vs growth mindset, the researchers found that entrepreneurs who believe that entrepreneurial success is meant to be or not were more likely to experience burnout. Meanwhile, those with a more flexible mindset were less likely to report feeling burned out.
Of course, burnout can happen even to entrepreneurs with a harmonious passion for their job and a flexible mindset. This happens most often when harmful workplace behaviors seep into the company culture.
The “burnout-proof” workplace
When it comes to “burnout-proofing” the workplace, nearly all experts say the same thing — empathy is key, and founders should lead by example.
Jennifer Moss, a workplace expert and author, says that empathetic leadership can be demonstrated by making sure workers are taking time off, knowing their workforce (for example: are they parents? Do they have financial struggles?), and, as Covid-19 continues to play a factor in peoples’ everyday lives, keeping them physically safe in the workplace.
The way leaders treat workplace communication often sets the tone for the rest of the organization.

In another episdoe of All In, Swapfiets founder Richard Burger tells Techleap he used to feel he could text or email an employee at any time of the day:
I didn’t really care about when I worked, it was also a bit maybe egocentric to get it out of my head — then it was gone. But then you’re just putting it in someone else’s head. So I used to do it but I stopped as long as it’s not urgent.
And while a manager might not expect their employee to respond in the middle of the night, they could be unknowingly putting pressure on them, something Swipeguide’s Schneyder-Valbracht says could be down to cultural differences:
There’s a lot of differences in work cultures. So if I send over a message in the middle of the night, I don’t expect someone to read or respond to it. But if you come from a different culture or social setting, you might feel like you have to answer because that’s the environment you were raised in.
Eva Gouwens, CEO Fairphone, says the pivot to remote work had her rethink how often she was reaching out to employees:
I changed a bit in that sense last year. Many people needed to work from home and you saw that those boundaries were less clear and everything blurred a bit. So I got a bit more strict around this.
Making sure to take time off themselves is a good way for leaders to not only prevent their own burnout, but also set a good example for their employees. Several of Techleap’s featured founders said that setting boundaries for their after hours is key:
“The rule in our house is that phones stay downstairs. No one has a phone in the bedroom, and you don’t pick it up until the morning,” says WeTransfer’s Bradfield.
“I try to turn off my phone or at least not be actively working with it when I come home,” says Swapfiets’ Burger.
Ultimately, burnout culture is something that can sneak up on anyone — and while founders may be tempted to work long hours, send midnight emails, and skip vacations, what they do sets an example for the rest of the company.

How to bootstrap your startup with €50K – €200K of European funding,Alejandro Tauber,2022/06/27,"
In my previous job at a startup based in Amsterdam, my job description was – how to put this – ‘flexible’. As a non-technical member of a company developing a new kind of scalable, real-time graph database that was still under development, possibilities for marketing were limited, sales would be preliminary, and branding was still dependent on positioning.
As any early-stage startup member, I had to find something to do that would contribute to the company. I had a vague inkling that the European Commission had made vast quantities of funding available to SMEs for innovative ideas, but no idea where to start looking.
This led me on a bureaucratic quest to find out how we could get a slice of that pie. And let me tell you, it was not easy. Which is exactly why I want to share what I learned with you, because finding EU funding can be a great stopgap between bootstrapping and more serious financing rounds –– or just building your way to revenue without dilution.
Let me tell you about cascade funding.
For this article, I spoke to many people involved at some point in the cascade, and all of them agreed this type of funding is shamefully unknown and hard to navigate as a time-strapped startup employee, while still offering significant financial and business support to fledgling projects.
What is cascade funding?
Under the Horizon 2020 program, the European Commission earmarked around €800 million for a “mechanism to distribute public funding in order to assist beneficiaries, such as start-ups, scale-ups, SME and/or mid-caps, in the uptake or development of digital innovation.”
This mechanism is officially known as Financial Support for Third Parties (FSTP), but is colloquially called cascade funding. The idea is that instead of startups entering into a funding agreement directly with the European Commission or affiliate organizations, funding would be distributed to consortia of companies that act as intermediaries to distribute funds.
These consortiums in their turn set up open calls to which startups or scale-ups can apply, and provide (mostly) equity-free grants for participants of those programs.
Funding in these schemes starts at €5,000, but can go up to €500,000, and is normally coupled with business support services for selected startups – either in a type of accelerator, free services like security audits, or by offering access to a network of similar companies and organizations.
All of this might sound great, but rather vague, so let’s look at some examples of how this actually works.
Let’s look at some examples
In April 2020, a consortium consisting of an education non-profit, an accelerator organizer, and a funding platform launched IMPACT EdTech. The hybrid incubator/accelerator is designed to help European EdTech startups build out prototypes into viable products.
After an initial pitching round, 17 startups were selected to receive about €80,000 as an equity-free lump sum payment and mentoring services to develop an MVP. With this MVP, startups would again go through a selection process, with seven of them continuing to the next round.
In this phase, startups received an additional €90,000 as an equity-free grant, and got help introducing their innovation to “relevant education ministries, investors and potential partners.
This whole cycle was repeated three times between April 2020 and July 2022.
In a similar vein, programs like STADIEM for startups in the media tech industry, BlockStart for blockchain companies, AI4Europe for AI companies, ROBOTUNION for robotics, IMPACT Connected Car for connected mobility, NGI Assure for cryptography and security startups, and S+T+ARTS for art and technology projects all offer different levels of funding, prizes or support for European companies.
What kind of startup programs are there?
In general, there are a few different types of programs. Accelerators like STADIEM offer grants in combination with business support programs, and usually higher levels of funding. Others, such as NGI Assure, offer a lump sum of up to €50,000 to startups or individual developers. Some consortia offer vouchers for international travel and collaboration. And finally, there are prizes which clock in at around €20,000.
The big advantage of these cascade funding schemes is that the application process is usually manageable in terms of time invested. Unlike large-scale funding programs like the ones organized by the EIC, applications take days to prepare rather than months.
As an example, the application form for the recently launched NGI0 Entrust program for ‘privacy and trust enhancing technologies’ consists of 13 open fields –– and those include name, email address, and phone number. Initial funding starts from €5,000, but according to Michiel Leenaars, Director of Strategy at NLNet, can go up to €500,000 for projects that prove themselves important in the initial stage.
“I think that we have proven that passing on the responsibility of allocating funding to socially responsible organizations can create huge benefits,” Leenaars says. “In some of our programs, 95% of participants have never received funds from the European Commission (EC).”
Another benefit he mentions, is that you are not dealing with a faceless EC entity, but rather a group of people invested in your success as a startup –– and with that, their success as a funding distributor.
The EC also sees the benefits of delegating fund allocation to consortia that actually care about their mission and know about the industry they’re investing in.
How do startup founders feel about cascade funding?
Overall, startups seem to be very happy with these cascade funding programs.
Thomas Ketchell, of education startup Sutori, told us that they “were fortunate to get the support of ImpactEdTech that provided us with three pilot schools, one in Italy, Czech Republic and Slovakia to pilot Sutori and see if we can get traction with European schools. The funding enabled us to translate the platform and grow the platform.”
This is in stark contrast to the EIC Accelerator debacle that’s playing out as this article is written.
Under its most ambitious scaleup investment program, the European Commission set up the European Innovation Council to find and fund the most promising European deep tech companies –– with grant funding up to €2,5 million and equity investments up to €15 million.
As it turns out, the EIC is having some trouble in managing and distributing the funds, with scaleups that signed grant agreements back in July 2021 still not having received funds, and EC commissioners threatening to cut the program if this is not fixed soon.
The cascade funding scheme is set to continue under Horizon Europe, the successor program to Horizon 2020. It’s still unclear how much of the €95.5 billion fund will be allocated to cascade funding, but the success of the previous programs will inform the level of funding.
For those who are not faint of heart in the daunting face of European bureaucracy, the Funding and Tenders portal now offers an option to filter by cascade funding. Beware though, if you google ‘cascade funding tenders,’ then you’ll get a result called ‘Competitive calls and calls for third parties,’ which does not include all cascade funding opportunities currently available. Fun, right?
From my experience, there are tons of consultancies and services that offer guidance for these types of grants –– but also from my experience, you don’t really need them for cascade funding. With a little bit of practice, anyone can penetrate the Funding and Tenders portal’s obtuseness and find that bit of cash or support that might just help kickstart your startup. And if you still have questions, hit me up on Twitter, happy to help out.

7 successful product development strategies team leads can steal from big tech companies,.cult,2022/06/23,"
This article was originally published on .cult by Yasas Sri Wickramasinge. .cult is a Berlin-based community platform for developers. We write about all things career-related, make original documentaries, and share heaps of other untold developer stories from around the world.
All the successful product engineering teams have one common practice: a winning product development strategy. But, it is not realistic to find a universal product development strategy for different product teams.
This article presents seven different yet successful product development strategies so you can create your own plan or improve the existing strategies inspired by these practices.
1. Purpose-driven independent squads: Spotify strategy
The world popular music streaming platform, Spotify, has a speciality in their organizational hierarchy. Instead of having a conventional management structure, Spotify maintains different groups called Squads, Tribes, Alliances, and Guilds. This is entirely new labelling of group structures is inspired by the “Growth Mindset.”
Together with this different organizational structure, they’ve developed the “Spotify Model,” their own version of product development.
This model gives each product team (“Squad”) freedom to pick their preferred project management frameworks such as Agile Scrum, Kanban, or others.

Each team in the same organization performs in their way. However, the Spotify model encourages Squads to work together on high-level objectives. When multiple Squads are together to address high-level goals, that composite group structure is called a “Tribe”.
The next category is the “Chapter”, which is an independent entiry with extremely advanced specialization in specific areas such as Quality Assurance, User Experience, Application Security, etc. Usually, chapters include senior leads or architects, and they help each Squad level up their product.
In addition to these fundamental roles, there are more classifications in the Spotify Model, and you can explore more from here.
If you are a tech lead looking forward to inspiring your team to fasten the development process while keeping inter-team collaborations simple, the Spotify Model is worth a look.

2. Work backwards: the Amazon strategy
This is a pretty interesting tactic mastered by Amazon. The main idea is to reverse engineer the product, starting from the customer’s point of view.
Amazon’s Working Backward Model

Interestingly, they propose to start directly with a press release, announcing the product to the market. Initially, it sounds strange, but the main goal is to evaluate the market opportunity straightway. If the product is not a good fit, this strategy is the fastest way to know about it.
If the product idea seems a market hit, then the remaining steps in this strategy are executed in a manner that the process comes outside to internal working teams.
This more customer-oriented strategy is ideal if you focus on developing an entirely new product.
3. Product playbooks: Typeform’s strategy
The term “Playbook” is common in American Football, which refers to a book that holds team strategies, tactics and plays.
The Playbook holds hundreds of ways of previous experiences of team, what went well and worked out for them.
Like the Playbook concept in sports, Typeform adapted this to their product development strategy and improved their processes to the next level.
Artwork by Henrik Kniberg of Spotify
Artwork by Henrik Kniberg of Spotify
According to the Playbook concept, the main focus is to deliver testable, usable and lovable products as fast as possible.
The Playbook Strategy has 2 separate main paths as Discovery and Delivery to achieve that.

Discovery — Brainstorming a precious product idea that can create a high-value proposition solving an existing problem in the market.
Delivery — After discovering the product, delivery contains actionable steps to scope the project, execution process and measuring the delivery artefacts.

However, it is worth mentioning that this strategy is not linear but more toward an iterative process, which allows everyone to go back and forth and continuously improve the product.
Suppose you plan to develop a product development strategy that helps the organization in the long run. In that case, it is worth digging deep into this strategy and grabbing what works for you.

4. Maximize customer adaption and retention: Netflix’s strategy
As a movie streaming service, Netflix has the ultimate goal of attracting more subscribers to their platform and retaining them as long as they can. Their product development strategy is tailor-made to achieve this ultimate goal under 4 main subcategories.

Personalization
Original Content
Watching Experience
Interactive Storytelling

These focus areas help them build a unique product with a highly accepted market brand, which keeps them ahead of the competition. All the development work is identified under the above 4 categories and performed quarterly. Hence, every product update release addresses all of those aims, providing a better customer experience at the end of the day.
This strategy inspires companies that are looking forward to maximizing customer engagement.
5. Product and service diversification: product development strategy of Google

From productivity tools, entertainment services to hardware devices like Pixel phones are produced by this tech giant, Google. Therefore, it is interesting to sneak a peak at their product development strategy.
Google’s main objective is to create an eco-system that captures users, retains them, and consumes more Google Products.
Due to their continuously improving eco-system, the company is generating more and more profits and unbreakable brand awareness and attractive new internet users.
When growing the product portfolio of Google, the below 2 sub-strategies they follow are noticeable.

Company and Product Acquisition — As a tech industry leader, Google sometimes acquires rising talent as a product or company acquisition. Then they further develop that newly acquired product under their branding.
Vertical Integration across various Industries — Google is not limited to information technology or internet services. Still, also they work together with other industries such as computer hardware manufacturing, marketing and entertainment. They sell their services to different sectors through specialisations and generate more revenues.

Google’s product development strategy might not directly relate to small or medium-scale software companies. Still, the way they execute their product expansions inspires growing product teams to follow.
6. Concept testing: Booking.com Strategy
The main objective of this strategy is “Fail Fast, Learn Faster”, which is pioneered by booking.com. They engineer multiple prototype versions/conceptual products, deploy to the public, and gather data to understand customer preferences and engagement with their products.
When there are slightly different versions of the same concept, this strategy (also known as AB Testing) is handy to experiment and pick the best one.
The concept testing approach especially helps when you have an initial product in place, but still you have multiple concepts to improve the existing product or more state-of-the-art features which you are not very sure about the usability aspects.
7. Product mindset: the winning product strategy
The winning product strategy is another product specialization strategy tailor-made to the software industry. The core of this model is the “Product Mindset”.
Image source: Winning product
This strategy is an all-rounder in the software product development lifecycle covering the ideation to product retirement phases, focusing on being ahead of the competition.
There is a community behind the Winning Product Model. They have unveiled a Winning Product Toolkit that provides a canvas and strategy tools.
Suppose you are looking for a more sustainable, low-risk software product development strategy to try out. In that case, the Winning Product Strategy is worth a look.

Final thoughts
Product development strategies are unique and not clearly exposed to the outer world. Still, it is worth studying the available information related to some popular organizations.
However, I believe I could present some insights about some successful strategies to you from this article. I wish you all the best with implementing your own version of a product development strategy taking your product to the next level!
“Great Products Don’t Happen By Accident”
"
Experts explain how to recruit the right C-suite for your scaleup,Alejandro Tauber,2022/06/23,"
The line between startup and scaleup can be quite murky, but most agree that a startup becomes a scaleup once the “growth chasm” is crossed –– meaning they’ve solved challenges like market research and development, and have identified a scalable business model.
According to academics, a scaleup is, “a high growth firm whose accelerated cycle of growth and wealth creation is fundamentally based on the scalability of its business model.”
But having solved those initial problems, new problems arise. Techleap.nl, a team dedicated to empowering Dutch tech companies, recently released a series of video interviews in which they ask successful scaleup founders about the biggest issues they’ve encountered while growing. Hiring the right people and maintaining a close-knit community was one of them:

This is especially the case for your leadership team. As Skype founding management team member James Bilefield told McKinsey:
At the heart of every successful scaleup you need a great mix of skills, attitude, and resilience in the founding team, who make the time in their crazy schedules to attract, develop, and retain the very best talent.
While a certain drive is needed in a founding team to go from concept to startup. Sometimes new skills are needed to lead the bridge between startup and scaleup. This is typically the time when a company needs to bring onboard external CFOs, CTOs, CMOs, CPOs, COOs, and even CEOs with experience in managing the challenges faced by much larger and growing organizations.
But how do you know when you need to start looking? And who should you be looking for? We put these questions to some seasoned experts in the field to find out how to successfully hire into the C-Suite, without ruining your company on the way.
How to know when to start looking
Simple: “If things are not growing, that leads to problems.” Guido van Nispen, who has served in executive roles at corporates, public institutions and non-profits, held supervisory board positions across a broad range of companies, and founded a startup in the cybersecurity insurance industry, has pretty much seen it all.
According to him, the process of deciding to hire a new member of the C-suite is not something that happens overnight.
“Every phase of an organization has stakeholders, and those stakeholders ask for a type of management in the C-suite,” he says. For a startup, generalists are normally well suited people who are comfortable with ambiguity and can easily switch from customer service to pitching.
But when a company starts growing, this changes. “First you have no board. Then you might get investors. Then you get a board at the scaleup level. And once you land serious financing, you also get serious oversight,” van Nispen says. And that oversight can reveal that certain roles need to be created, or existing people need to be replaced.
This is also the phase when cracks in the founding team start to show themselves seriously. Before becoming founder of VC firm CapitalT, Eva de Mol, conducted research on psychological traits that can lead to these fissures. She says:
Moving into a scaleup, you need specialists. And that can be hard, because sometimes people who founded the company just don’t fit anymore.
Sometimes they just like being generalists, or the culture might have changed, and they no longer like working at the company.
Whatever the reason is, whether it’s to replace someone who’s not happy in their newly minted role as CFO after doing both finance and marketing, or because sales growth simply isn’t meeting expectations, this is when it’s time to start looking.
How to start looking
Once you know that it’s time to hire someone into an executive role, get ready for a process that can take a considerable amount of time.
First of all, the final decision to replace someone can often take six months or more.
“If you say we’ll grow 100% and become the market leader in two new countries in the next two quarters, then that’s what the board will be expecting,” van Nispen says. Often, the board will give the responsible department head a few board meetings to catch up.
“But if you see that things aren’t improving or keep being unpredictable,” van Nispen says, it’s time to put feelers out for possible replacements.
While there are many recruiters who offer executive search services, the search normally starts through the board according to van Nispen. Board members don’t only have a wide network at their disposal, they also know the company intimately and can introduce candidates who might be a good fit.
Two things are important to have clear before setting out to find a new candidate. First, a company needs to know the cause of the initial problem.
“Maybe the finances were a mess, but if you don’t know if that was because the current CFO was not great with spreadsheets or if the CTO consistently spent too much without oversight, you’re not going to solve the problem,” says van Nispen.
Second, you need to have a clear and unanimous strategic goal.
Say you want to conquer the German market in the next year. This market has its particularities, and if you hire someone who has to learn all of them, instead of someone who has expanded to Germany before, that’s a big risk.
How to attract experienced C-suite material
Now, let’s say you’ve set your goals and identified the problems. How do you attract suitable candidates?
Everyone is aware of the ongoing ‘war for talent’ facing scaleups. A seasoned CFO can have their pick of exciting companies to work for, so why should they choose you?
Good compensation is probably not the (only) answer. C-suite roles at scaleups all offer similar salaries, stock, and benefits.
There are some tweaks you could make in offering shorter vesting schedules, and tying incentive packages to clear growth paths — e.g. more shares after raising a next round, or at a certain revenue milestone, depending on the role you’re filling.
But van Nispen is convinced: “the most important thing is that you have to really sell the company and its mission.” It has to be an exciting opportunity that fits within their background and experience, and offers challenges that fit well with their personality.
Who should you look for
De Mol’s research focused on how different types of entrepreneurial passions in people work together to create better performing companies — or dysfunctional ones. She says:
It’s all about people. You can have great plans and amazing financial forecasts, but the people have to execute those. And that’s hard. So the team is incredibly important.
De Mol conducted research into the role of passion in entrepreneurship, and developed a model that scores passion intensity in three distinct categories.
First, there are entrepreneurs who are passionate about founding. They love setting up a business, scaling it, selling it, and doing it all over again. Second, there are people who are passionate about inventing — creating new, better products and innovations. And finally there are people who thrive on developing things like team-building, culture, and are more people-focused.
While her research focused more on early-stage startups, she found leadership teams that differed too much in their type of passion, “led to negative effects on fundraising, number of employees, and longevity.”
Difference in intensity of passion was another indicator of success or failure. Leadership teams that had some people scoring very high, and others very low often didn’t succeed in leading a company effectively.
She mentions that more and more VCs are taking these types of personality tests along with due diligence processes. So even for scaleups it can be useful to map out how the current leadership scores, and how potential hires fit in.
But most importantly
Everyone we spoke to agreed that one thing is most important in hiring into the C-suite: strategic alignment.
Having clear goals allows scaleups to determine what a new CTO, CFO, CPO, CCO, or even CEO needs to be good at, and what they need to focus on. This in turn creates a clear job description, with actionable challenges the company is facing. Ultimately, this leads to better communication with the board, allowing a company to make full use of its most experienced contributors.
Now whether the goal is to become a market leader in Germany within the next year, to gain the financing needed to scale to 1000 employees in two years, to create new products based on customer feedback, or, like Skype’s Bilefield “to become a verb,” it’s paramount that everybody involved agrees on these goals.
De Mol told us that with unanimous strategic alignment, even differences in type of passion can be overcome, and even be a strength, as complimentary passions leading to the same goal can strengthen each other.
Van Nispen also stressed that it might be wise to agree on what happens if those goals are not met — even before hiring a new leader. Doing that makes it clear for everyone what the steps are before having to go through the whole process again.

"Forget the remote vs in-office debate, we need a personalized approach",Ben Marks and Leanna Lee,2022/06/22,"
Work-life balance or integration? Remote, hybrid, or return to office? In the past few years, tech companies have tried to redefine the best approach to work. But as groundbreaking as some of these new ideas are, many still miss the point: there’s no one-size-fits-all solution in a post-COVID working world.
Work-life debaters generally fall into two main camps: the separators (or balancers) and the integrators. Separators tend to want strong boundaries between work and life, like keeping set hours and “clocking” out of the office at the end of the workday. Integrators, on the other hand, go for a more blended approach and may compromise by taking work calls during family time or bringing their kids to the office. Crucially, both of these perspectives have been largely based on in-office work.
Then came 2020, when millions had to work from home. Suddenly, employees found themselves juggling work and family life in the same spaces, often homeschooling kids and taking Zoom calls from their kitchen tables. Full-time workers began reporting longer workdays and increased stress and burnout, leading many to wonder if remote work would mean the end of work-life balance as we know it.
And in some ways, it has.
Individualization, the next post-pandemic work challenge 
At a recent roundtable hosted by #WorkAnywhere, WeWork, Zoom, and Remote met with European Parliament and Commission members to discuss the future of work-life balance.
Remote quoted Ivanti’s 2022 Everywhere Workplace report, which states that 71% of workers would prefer to work from anywhere, anytime, while 43% had seen better work-life balance due to remote work.
WeWork shared the importance of combining face-to-face interaction with hybrid solutions. According to their recent survey with Economic Impact, 75% of workers desire flexibility to work between home, an office, and a ‘third space’. Zoom added that flexibility in the workplace leads to widespread cost savings, better mental health, and reduced dependence on large urban centers.
The consensus: companies need a range of flexible work-life management solutions that support individual needs and work styles.
Two people, two approaches to work
There’s no better way to illustrate the importance of individual approaches to work than by looking at our own careers. On the surface, we are two campaigners in the future of work space with similar interests and goals.
But dig a bit deeper and you can see how different our approaches have been.
Separating work and life
Ben was a success-crazed overachiever who adjusted to a healthier way of living and launched the #WorkAnywhere campaign.
Ben: By 24, I’d already sold a company, and was Head of Innovation for one of the world’s biggest media brands. I had everything I ever wanted, except that my anxiety disorder was escalating, and I even developed scary physical symptoms like extreme fatigue, headaches, and nausea. Since doctors had no clue what was going on, I turned to CBT, a therapy which is based on the concept that one’s thoughts, feelings, physical sensations, and actions are interconnected. My therapist helped me to identify my work addiction — and the chronic stress this caused — as the root of the problem.
To stay “sober”, Ben’s taken a more rigid approach to separating his work and personal life by setting strict boundaries for himself, like no work in the evenings or on weekends, and no phone before 7am.
Here’s what Ben’s average workday looks like:

Before 9am: Exercise, meditation/therapy techniques, and reading (no breakfast due to intermittent fasting)
9am-1pm: Work until midday, hour break for lunch (“deep work” in the morning and meetings in the afternoon)
1-6pm: Work again for a few hours, long walk, wrap up work

While his schedule can vary, Ben’s main goal is to avoid falling into the workaholic’s trap of “making up” the extra time he spends on his personal life. Rather than shooting for perfection, he aims for 70% productivity each day. The temptation to slip back into the old ways is always there. But hopefully Ben has learnt his lesson.
A more flexible, integrated schedule
Future of work and wellbeing writer and digital nomad Leanna has been self-employed her whole professional life, choosing to create her own work structure for mental health reasons.
Leanna: I’ve lived with PTSD, anxiety, and depression for over 15 years and learned early on that the traditional workplace wouldn’t be a great fit. After a variety of freelance gigs and part-time work after university, I started my own freelance business in 2016 (also finally got myself into therapy). In the past 6 years, I’ve set plenty of healthy boundaries for myself, but since my mental health is a daily issue for me, complete separation is not an option. Flexibility is, quite literally, what keeps me alive.
Leanna’s energy levels and ability to function can change drastically day-to-day. So while she has an ideal schedule in mind, heightened anxiety and depressive episodes dictate when, how, and how long she can work.
On a good mental health day, her workday looks something like this:

Before 7:30am: Tea, reading and start work
7:30-10/10:30am: Work and take calls for at least two hours
10:00/10:30-4pm: Breakfast, time with husband, lunch and chores, sometimes with short bursts of work in between
4-8pm: Errands, long walk and back to work for a few hours, depending on the day

On bad days when she still has to be productive, Leanna works 7 days a week (instead of her regular 5-6) for a couple of hours a day, combining short bursts of work with long breaks. Instead of a set schedule, her boundaries revolve more around the types of projects and clients she takes on, her workload, deadlines, and managing her energy day-to-day.
No more separation vs integration
Together, our personal choices have helped shape two different, yet healthy approaches to work. Now, you could argue that Ben prefers work-life balance, while Leanna is more of an integrator, but the reality is not that simple.
The danger of taking sides in the work-life separation or integration debate is that most people don’t fit comfortably into one box or another. In fact, a 2016 study shows that there is a wide spectrum within work-life separation and integration and the majority of people fall into four different work boundary style groups, not just two.
If one side were to “win” the debate today, we would both lose out. Because ultimately, having the freedom and flexibility to create our own schedules is equally important to both of us: it allows us to work and live well.
Shaping the new world of work
The world of work has come a long way since 2020, but we’ve got a ways to go. Hybrid and remote work, though both great concepts, are still more work-life management battlegrounds than actual solutions. We need to think further forward, giving employees the power to decide when, where and how they work.
So, where should tech companies begin? How about turning the concept of work-life balance on its head:
“We’ve been saying ‘work-life balance’, but life comes first, then work,” says Remote’s VP of Special Operations, Filipa Matos. “…this is something we’ve been advocating at Remote: work is a part of life, not the other way around.”
Here are a few ways businesses can support personalized life-work management:

Create a range of flexible work policies that address main areas of friction for workers like work scheduling, work locations, and paid leave.
Build a work culture that supports employee ownership.
Advocate for government policies that build on individual rights in and outside of the workplace.

Remote is a great example of a company thinking forward about work-life management. Their list of employee benefits includes company self-care days, home office and coworking allowances, and generous leave offerings as well as flexible scheduling. More importantly, though, they’ve created a work culture that encourages employees to shape their workdays.
Remote’s company values state, “We trust you to do what is in the best interest of the company… It’s up to you to decide how you do your job at Remote.” Their public handbook also helps managers and workers alike navigate a more flexible working life, breaking down each benefit in-depth with examples and communication guidance.
Every company has a take on what work should look like. But by refocusing employee benefits and work culture to center around individual needs, we can not only encourage workers to live healthier lives, but empower them to do so.
After all, there is no one “right” way to work, but many.

"Avoid these common startup funding mistakes, say 3 founders-turned-investors",Cate Lawrence,2022/06/20,"
There are plenty of VCs keen to impart their knowledge on how to get funded, but what if you could gain insights from investors who have first-hand knowledge of seeing investment? 
At this year’s TNW Conference, three VC partners who’d previously made the jump from successful founder to investor presented a panel on the crucial efforts they learned along the way. 
The panelists were:

Bryony Cooper, Managing Partner, Arkley Brinc VC: The company encompasses and hardware VC Fund and an acceleration program with the goal of investment.
Johan van Mil, Co-founder and Managing Partner, PEAK. The company invests in a broad range of marketplace, platform, and SaaS companies across a range of verticals. 
Jan Miczaika, Partner, HV Capital: HV’s funds invest early with initial tickets between € 500k and € 5m. The company focuses on transportation, logistics, supply chain, and storage. 

During the session, the panelists not only provided an insight into their journey from founder to investor, but offered great insider perspectives, with a whole lot of tangible takeaways for startups looking to get their company funded. 
What are the biggest differences between the experience of a founder and an investor?
The roles of founder and investor are vastly different. Miczaika described an investor’s experience as being “one step removed.” The position requires you to have a broad market view, and there’s plenty of time spent talking to interesting people, but you “don’t really do anything anymore.” 
Van Mil described the experience of a founder and investor as having fundamentally different energy and work prioritization. Startups have sprinting marathons, while “as an investor, it’s more like a marathon where you also have to sprint.” 
Here’s what startup founders get wrong in seeking funding from VCs:
The panelists have collectively connected with hundreds, if not thousands, of startups seeking funding. They shared some of the most common things that startups get wrong: 
 1. Not doing homework 
Your pitch deck is a vital tool for promoting your startup and the investment opportunity. Miczaika gets at least four-pitch decks daily by email. So you need to compete for his attention. 
Details matter, according to Van Mil and Cooper. Investors are busy people, and much like when you complete a job application, you need to provide all the necessary information in a compelling way. 
Van Mil asserted that using MailChimp to send investors the same mass email is bad, especially when you get their name wrong. 
Cooper advises companies seeking funding to be well-prepared with up to date documentation. Your financials and desired milestones should be documented and organized. “Otherwise, as you grow, things get really messy really fast.” 
In most VC companies, different team members focus on specific verticals. So, reaching out to the investor whose interests represent your company is important. Otherwise, as van Mil notes, “it’s a wasted step in the journey that could have been faster.”
2. Selling your idea but not your company to VCs
Van Mil shared that you should not just seeking funding but collaboration with the VC fund most suited to your business and industry. Think about where the VC stands in your timeline: “Ask them what their successes are. For example, is their focus early-stage or more established companies?”

3. Not understanding your market or product community
Part of doing your homework is understanding what you are trying to achieve and where it sits compared to existing and up-and-coming tech. Miczaika asserted, “We want to invest in groundbreaking ideas. Is there traction? Is there someone willing to pay?” 
Building community is also vital. For example, in the case of software, getting developers already using your software and providing feedback. The more evidence you have that there is a market for your product, the better. 
4. Lacking people skills 
VC invest in people, not just products
One of the most important attributes a founder can have is people skills. 
Funders are investing in people, not just an idea, and in many sectors, investors may introduce you to your very first clients, especially in the B2B space. 
Cooper stressed the importance of emotional intelligence over IQ, discussing the need for good communication skills to convince customers and partners to come on board. A strong sense of entitlement or ego won’t endear you to anyone. As she shared: 
“If you can’t convince me in fine minutes that you are likable, you won’t convince people to buy your product.”
What about the impact economic downturn on investing? 
After a bull market, it’s a difficult time for many startups. The pandemic, invasion of Ukraine, increases in energy prices, and supply chain woes have left some sectors in a downtime. 
However, Cooper stressed: “The downturn is not in all sectors. There’s never the right time to make any life-changing decisions, whether having a baby or starting a new business. What are the needs of my company in this market?” She notes that venture investment is not the only option, with companies at different stages having success with crowd and angel investing. 
Seeking investment means going all in
Sourcing money is time-consuming, and challenging. It can be a tricky balance between being charismatic and being your authentic self. Everyone you meet might be a potential investor or in a position to provide you with a warm introduction to one. 
But it’s also an opportunity to get feedback on your business idea, connect with people in your industry, and potentially gain board members and advisors. 
Many industries are in a state of flux right now or even downsizing. Therefore, building relationships with people investing or focused on your industry, especially with people with first-hand experience weathering capable situations, is more valuable than ever. It should be a top priority in taking your company to the next step.

We’re in the age of hybrid working: How to make it work for your team,The Conversation,2022/05/17,"
After more than two years of disruptions, lockdowns and uncertainty, employers are facing a new reckoning in 2022: getting staff back into the office.
Dubbed by some the “great hybrid return to work”, employers across a range of industries are being forced to consider what the work environment will look like for staff.
In an environment where labor is tight, just how much can businesses prod employees to come back into the office? And how can bosses design a solution to meet the needs of the collective after more than two years of work-from-home flexing where individual choice has reigned supreme?
This reckoning isn’t isolated to New Zealand, with stories from the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia painting a picture of a world that has fundamentally shifted, and the dawn of what may well become the work-from-home decade.
Granted, not all employees can work from home. Some never have, as they’ve continued to show up on the front line in hospitals, grocery stores and emergency response call outs. But research suggests those who got a taste of working from home are hungry for more.
Placing emphasis on coordination
A 2022 report from Stanford University heralds the benefits of a hybrid approach to work, acknowledging that most – but not all – staff benefit from a bit of time at home and a bit of time in the office.
The Stanford recommendation is to coordinate the return to the office with agreed days (for example, Tuesday through Thursday in office, Monday and Friday at home) and reassess at the end of the year to create a long-term plan.
This copy and paste plan certainly won’t work for all workplaces but it suggests there is some merit to a coordinated approach.
During the global pandemic, working from home became a necessity. Many workers now prefer the work-from-home option, with businesses unsure how to get them back to the office. Image: charlesdeluvio / Unsplash
Fairness as key
Social connection isn’t the only reason some researchers are advocating for a hybrid working model where teams come in on the same agreed-upon days.
This approach can maximize fairness and equity, thereby boosting diversity and inclusion. Having teams in one place at the same time ensures equitable information transfer and opportunities for development and promotion.
This could be especially pertinent for working parents, who may already face difficulty or discrimination from working flexibly or taking parental leave, and for minority groups that have traditionally been pipped at the post for promotions or mentoring opportunities.
Fairness, one of the key protective factors against burnout at work, helps to offset feelings of cynicism, anger or indignation.
Decisions about returning to the office should be transparent and clearly communicated. And while individual approaches may be necessary, plans for work should equally advantage all groups – senior leaders and entry-level graduates alike.
Ask, don’t assume
What works for some won’t work for all, so employers should talk to their employees. This simple advice applies as much to the general well-being of employees as it does to the structure of the work week.
By engaging in genuine conversations with staff and including them in the decision making process, leaders can build and maintain a level of trust that is essential to a strong culture of well-being in the workplace and can ensure the diverse needs of employees are met.
While everyone is neck deep in the process of discovering a new normal, employers should take the opportunity to really tap into the specific wants and needs of their employees by implementing a consultation process.
This may mean providing various options for people to give input, such as informal check-ins (face-to-face, text or otherwise) or more formal meetings and forums; this formal and informal communication can be complemented by anonymous employee surveys to capture opinions that some people may find hard to give in person.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to launch a new way of working that meets the needs of employees and allows them to participate in the process of strengthening support and well-being in the workplace.
While cubicles have long been the norm in modern offices, research shows the format can have a negative impact on collaborative work. Image: Thought Catalog / Unsplash
Build back better
While many leaders may bemoan the reluctance of their employees to return to the office, citing a reduction in collaboration and information sharing in the work-from-home setup, it’s worth asking whether pre-COVID office spaces really that much better.
Open plan offices, the norm for many modern workplaces, can actually increase stress responses in the body and, paradoxically, reduce collaboration, well-being and engagement.
How do businesses strike a balance between opportunities for collaboration and information sharing, while protecting an employee’s individual well-being?
With the aim to build back better, employers need to consider adapting office space in a way that is fit for connection as well as focus, with multiple breakout spots, intentional collaboration opportunities and quiet working zones.
Businesses should harness the power of hybrid working too – perhaps utilizing work-from-home days for deep work, with a “no meetings” rule and reserved in-person office days for collaborative working and catch-ups.
The next six months will undoubtedly be a period of trial and error for many businesses as they look to encourage workers back to the office. Following the simple rules – “ask, don’t assume” and “keep it fair” – may go a long way to ensuring the return to the office is helpful for employees and organizations alike.

The future of marketing is hyper-personalization,Callum Booth,2022/05/17,"
While marketing’s purpose has remained (relatively) static since its inception, the way this is achieved is in a constant state of flux.
Fundamentally, marketers want to convince their target audience that their product or service is worthy of their attention. The way professionals go about it has changed dramatically over the years.
30 years ago, you may have reached consumers through local papers and physical mail. Now? You may be looking at TikTok and Spotify.
To try and get a handle on what the current trends in the marketing business are — and what skills professionals need to cultivate — I spoke with Oscar Höglund, CEO and co-founder of Epidemic Sound, a music tech company that provides royalty-free soundtracks.
First off, Höglund told me that personalization, particularly that with “the use of visuals and music,” will become even more important in the coming years.
“Historically, marketers have tried to appeal to the masses,” Höglund said, but this is set to shift.
To illustrate this, he told me a story about the Super Bowl. Previously, the strategy for such an event would be to create a single advert — one designed to reach millions of people — and hope it lands well.
Personalization will change this. With the right technology and approach, Höglund said, you can create “hyper relevant content that attracts different target groups.”
A Super Bowl advert could become 40 different pieces of content, the soundtrack replaced by many songs in different genres that appeal to a range of target groups.
“Although the product and the core message will remain the same,” Höglund told me, “companies will need to make more personalized content in order to appeal to customers.”
If the marketing industry is going to evolve to be more personalization-centric, it makes sense that professionals in the space will also need to change. I put this to Höglund, asking what skills people in the sector will need in a decade.
“In the future, marketers [will] need to constantly analyze their customer needs,” he told me. “They need to map out and appeal to the different parts of people’s identity.”
Expanding on this, Höglund believes that the combination of analyzing data and learning about each individual’s preferences can help marketers give people perfect suggestions, recommending them things they’d never previously considered. To put it another way, to almost know them better than they know themselves.
Ultimately though, Höglund thinks the future of marketing “really boils down to understanding humans.” Computers will improve and take on the brunt of analysis, meaning marketers will have to get closer to people.
As Höglund put it: “In the future, marketers will move from being mathematicians to becoming anthropologists.”

Here’s what your avatar’s first day of work will be like,The Conversation,2022/05/12,"
In the context of work, the digital divide has become less about access to devices and connectivity and more about skills and mindset. Many experienced professionals have never learned more than the rudimentary basics of email, web search and Microsoft Office. Instead, they lean hard on nearby colleagues or the IT helpdesk when things go wrong.
By contrast, young people have already demonstrated a competitive edge in the virtual workplace. They come equipped with a more intuitive grasp of digital technology and the initiative to troubleshoot problems via YouTube tutorials, social media, and subreddits.
As a generation, they’re also bigger gamers. As more and more work takes place in virtual reality (VR) – and one does not have to share the somewhat eccentric vision of the metaverse Mark Zuckerberg articulated at the 2021 Connect Conference to believe that it will – being familiar with massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) like Fortnite and Roblox, not to mention the ability to manage multiple digital identities, is set to make that edge keener still.
Much of the metaverse is still to be built. VR, of course, has long been used in training for certain physical jobs, from astronauts and pilots to law enforcement, surgery, and manufacturing. When it comes to specialist machinery or complex locations, the relative safety and cost advantages of training virtually are obvious. But it is in knowledge work – from software engineering to law to design – where the changes will be most profound.
How virtual workplaces can improve communication
For most people, remote working during the pandemic has been characterized by alt-tabbing between communications apps and videoconferencing platforms such as Slack, Teams, and Miro. And there is certainly a lot of room for improvement there.
Academic studies have found that collaborative work between colleagues suffers when they work remotely. Exchanges over email or Slack increasingly replace real-time in-person conversations, hampering communication.
Google itself has claimed that informal chats at coffee machines and lunch tables on its campus were responsible for innovations such as Street View and Gmail. But, with remote working, this kind of serendipitous encounter all but disappears.
And of course, there are costs to remote working, in terms of individual wellbeing too. Stanford researchers have found that so-called “Zoom fatigue” is driven by a combination of intense eye contact, lack of mobility, self-consciousness about one’s own video feed, and the cognitive demands of needing to give exaggerated feedback to signal understanding, agreement, or concern.
Technological advances mean solutions to these problems related to remote working are becoming possible. Collaboration software such as Meta’s Horizon Workrooms and Microsoft Mesh, which allow colleagues to meet as avatars in VR or take part in a real-world meeting as a photo-realistic hologram, are already available.
The metaverse 1.0 will no doubt see organizations creating persistent VR workplace environments, in which employees can interact in real time as embodied avatars. VR versions of office spaces can be designed to encourage chance encounters and corridor chats.
Imagine, for example, if going from one remote meeting to another involved leaving the conference room and crossing a bustling virtual atrium. That might sound far-fetched but bear in mind that Korean PropTech company Zigbang has already opened a 30-floor VR office called Metapolis. Employees choose an avatar and navigate to their desks via elevators and corridors. When they meet a colleague’s avatar, their webcam and mic are activated so they’re able to have a conversation. The webcam and mic then turn off automatically as their avatar walks away.

Employees in the Korean VR workplace, Metapolis, can do large presentations, give speeches and work in small groups.
Meanwhile, the ability to use and read body language and actively participate in group discussions by scribbling post-it notes or drawing on a virtual whiteboard should make remote meetings in VR more engaging and less sedentary. They require much more active use of the neck, shoulders, arms and hands than a typical hour on Zoom.
How to work as an avatar
It seems likely that a new set of workplace norms will emerge as the metaverse develops. Team games, including virtual bowling nights and virtual ping-pong tournaments, might supplant Zoom drinks as the default remote working social event.
When it comes to hiring, meanwhile, VR could bring distinct benefits. “Blind” auditions have been shown to significantly increase the representation of female musicians in symphony orchestras. It follows that interviewing as an avatar might diminish the effect of bias –- unconscious or otherwise –- against people on the basis of their gender, age, or appearance.
Just as custom “skins” (outfits) are a feature of many MMOs, in the virtual world of work, there may well be demand for creativity in virtual fashion and accessories too, as people seek to express their personal brand within the constraints of professional dress codes for avatars. Gucci has already sold virtual hats, handbags, and sunglasses on the MMO platform Roblox.

Gucci is one of the first fashion brands to sell accessories for avatars.
Young people have been the worst affected by the disruption COVID has caused to the job market. While some struggled with working productively from a shared house or their parents’ homes, others were scammed into joining companies that did not even exist.
Nonetheless, the pandemic has also brought exciting glimpses of how remote working might evolve. Due to public health concerns and climate pressure, the latter is here to stay. As it develops into the metaverse, it will continue to bring capabilities that are concentrated among younger people to the fore.

How to grow your D2C business — 4 tips from a successful founder,Trinny Woodall,2022/05/11,"
Did you know Trinny Woodall is speaking at TNW Conference this summer? Check out the full list of speakers here.
There’s no doubt that the pandemic encouraged consumers to rethink their shopping habits, with over half now preferring to buy from brands directly. In fact, market growth of D2C in the US is expected to reach just under $175 million by 2023.
As the market continues to grow and become increasingly competitive, a strong D2C growth strategy has never been more important for a brand to stand out.
At Trinny London, we’ve worked hard to ensure we’re much more than just a makeup brand. We have a community of customers who share our values of authenticity and inclusivity, and our multi-pronged D2C strategy has paid off. Since founding the company in 2017, our revenue soared to £55 million by the end of 2021.
Here are my top four tips for building a successful D2C strategy:
1. Trust your gut – it’s your most valuable advisor.
When raising capital for Trinny London, I initially faced skepticism from male investors who believed a digital-first beauty brand wouldn’t work for our initial target market: women over the age of 35. Traditionally this audience preferred testing products at a beauty counter before purchasing.
Instead of being knocked back by their doubts, I stuck to my guns. I’d been in this position once before, when I launched my first business at the height of the .com bubble in 1999.
This time around, I knew the best person to rely on was myself. I was confident that there was a strong demand for the inclusive and personalized D2C brand I was creating, having spent over 20 years of my career speaking to thousands of women.
Remember: when you’re in front of investors, it’s likely they’ll be bringing their previous experience into your meeting. But what worked for their last investment might not work for you — you need to stand your ground. And for me, trusting my gut paid off; in 2017 we raised £2.4m and used the capital to…
2. Invest in tech.
If you want to join the world’s biggest D2C brands, you have to be able to offer customers a seamless and personalized digital shopping experience.
We worked with data scientists to create an industry-leading personalization service, Match2Me. The service enables customers to purchase makeup that suits their unique combination of skin, hair, and eyes. Now 75% of customers are using Match2Me when purchasing.
Not only is Match2Me hugely valuable for the customer experience, it’s also an incredibly useful tool from a business growth standpoint. Instead of guessing at the counter, these customers now have the confidence to shop online, and this confidence is integral to building consumer trust which we know is the key to success — 61% of UK customers are willing to pay more to purchase from a trusted brand.
What’s more, the customer data we retrieve from both Match2Me and instore from pop-up store experiences allows us to follow the journey of each customer from the very start.
We’ve now extended the capabilities of our Match2Me to include skincare, which will give us far more in-depth knowledge of our customer. For example, if we’re able to see how many of our customers have oily skin, we can ask ourselves if we’re doing enough to support this group of people and give them the products they really want and need.
The key is to collect data in a way that it can be analyzed with ease. We took time to build a data team so when we launch something new, the data points we need are embedded in the build. A strong data team is non-negotiable for an effective D2C strategy.
3. Strength is the ability to adapt.
The world of business is full of risk and instability — with globalization, new technologies, and extraordinary events like the Covid-19 pandemic on the minds of CEOs, being nimble has never been more important.
In order to adapt, it’s essential that your D2C strategy includes the monitoring of changes in the industry and wider world. If detected, act quickly by assessing your business model and current resources, and identify ways in which you can reshape them to fit the new demand.
Trinny London was quick to adapt when the world began locking down in March 2020. It was one of the first beauty brands to offer virtual appointments to customers (in fact, on the launch day 3,000 appointments were booked).
We now have a 24-hour booking schedule with professional makeup artists able to provide customers with a personal service from the comfort of their own homes — no matter what time zone they’re in.
As a result of our adaptability, Trinny London grew by 330% in 2020, with the number of new customers more than doubling from 95,000 in 2019 to 260,000 in 2020.
4. Don’t underestimate the power of community.
Without a doubt, the most valuable asset for a D2C brand is community. But don’t be fooled, a true ‘super’ community is more than just your social media following or customer base — it’s a group that provides genuine connections and enables a brand to make informed decisions that really move the needle on everything from product development to marketing spend.
Trinny London’s community, the Trinny Tribe, now has over 100,000 members in over 30 countries worldwide, and acts as a place for customers to not only discuss upcoming product launches and beauty tips, but also to make lifelong friendships.
And an online community can be powerful in more ways than one — recent research from HBR reveals that, amongst other benefits, resolving questions within a community is 72% cheaper than support channels.
Trinny London’s Facebook groups have had a massive positive impact on both the growth of the business and our product development strategy. In 2019, we made it our mission to take our Australian market revenue to 12% (which at the time was at about 6%). Thanks to a particularly inspiring tribe in Sydney, whose word-of-mouth was incredibly strong, we exceeded targets hitting 16%.
We hear our Tribe members loud and clear, and recently launched our 2-in-1 Lash2Brow as a direct result of Facebook comments requesting a Trinny London mascara. The product has been one of our most successful launches to date, highlighting the value of nurturing brand communities.
I believe Trinny London’s success is down to the strong relationship each customer is able to form directly with the brand. As a founder, take time to think about how the community becomes your customer and build a meaningful and lasting relationship with your brand, beyond the product or service you’re offering. That’s when you’ll see real success in D2C.

Video calls make us less creative — but that’s no reason for your boss to force you back to the office,Natasha Nel,2022/05/3,"
Video conferencing is making us dumber and less creative — and that’s according to science.
A laboratory study by Columbia Business School’s Melanie S. Brucks and Stanford’s Jonathan Levav found that “video conferencing inhibits the production of creative ideas.”
How’s that for a great excuse to keep your video turned off on your next Zoom call?
The study found that “video conferencing hampers idea generation because it focuses communicators on a screen, which prompts a narrower cognitive focus.”
To put that another way, the results suggest that the cognitive load used in virtual interactions hamper the amount of bandwidth we have for creativity.
Apparently, when you look at a screen, the narrowing of your vision “constrains the associative process underlying idea generation,” in which your mind branches and pulls on disparate information, forming new ideas in the process.
The study, conducted across five countries, explains: “as virtual communicators narrow their visual scope to the shared environment of a screen, their cognitive focus narrows in turn.”
But don’t sweat just yet — this doesn’t mean we should all head back to the office five days a week.
Telling Mike to unmute himself is here to stay, “but there’s a tension”
These findings back up the concerns laid out by Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky when he announced its new hybrid WFH policy last week.
Credit: Airbnb co-founder Brian Chesky on Twitter
His solution? Quarterly in-person meetings.
Chesky isn’t the only founder making a post-pandemic move to a hybrid WFH policy.
A survey conducted by Harvard Business Review in August 2021 said 75% of US employees reported “a personal preference for working remotely at least one day per week.” A research paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research — entitled Why Working from Home Will Stick — affirms HBR’s predictions, with an estimate that “20% of US work days will take place at home, after the pandemic ends.”
Nobody is saying you have to go back to the office
Video conferencing may make creativity more challenging, but, on the other hand, it appears to make prioritization and project management easier.
As the science says: “when it comes to selecting which idea to pursue, we find no evidence that video conferencing groups are less effective (and preliminary evidence that they may be more effective) than in-person groups.”
Unfortunately though, this isn’t universally agreed upon.
Another study conducted by Carnegie Mellon University’s Maria Tomprou et al. in March of 2021, however, suggested that videoconferencing not only hampers creativity, but “reduces collective intelligence”. Yikes.
Turning off our cameras may make us smarter and more creative in meetings
The Carnegie study suggests that the central blocker to collective intelligence and productivity in virtual communication is video access.
Their reasoning? “Teams without visual cues are more successful in synchronizing their vocal cues and speaking turns, and when they do so, they have higher CI.”
CI, or, collective intelligence, is defined here as the ability of a group of humans to work together to solve problems.
Contrary to popular opinion on the value of video in enhancing remote relationships and collaboration, Carnegie Mellon’s researchers propose that limiting time spent with your video turned on may lead to more equal and collaborative communication — as well as improved problem solving capabilities — likely because without video, there are fewer visual stimuli and less distractions.

"Airbnb joins Twitter, Reddit, Dropbox; finally admits remote work wins",Natasha Nel,2022/04/29,"
Airbnb CEO and co-founder Brian Chesky on Thursday announced the company’s 5-point plan to enable employees to live and work anywhere, all the time.
Ostensibly because “The world has become more flexible”, and “We also had the most productive two-year period in our company’s history — all while working remotely” (presumably, also: massive decrease in operating costs; consequent increase in profit margins).
More highlights from Chesky’s thread include the ability to move anywhere in the US without any change in compensation; in-person team gatherings facilitated quarterly; and the implementation of a multi-year roadmap with two product releases per year, to “keep us working in a highly coordinated way”.
Credit: Twitter CEO Brian Chesky on Twitter.
This remote-led policy will impact the lives of Airbnb’s 15,000-ish employees — around 6,000 of whom are US-based — and comes more than two years following the initial wave of pandemic-induced remote work policies being implemented by many other tech multinationals, including Reddit, Twitter, and Dropbox.
What sets Airbnb’s announcement apart somewhat is its decision to standardize pay regardless of location. As noted by Mitchell Clark for The Verge, “employees at Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft will have to take a pay cut if they want to move to an area with a lower cost of living, according to reports like this one by the BBC.”
Some online forums predict a mass exodus of employees from more expensive cities to Nashville, for example — where Airbnb’s San Francisco-level salaries would be “game changing” [sic] — signaling, once again, this now mighty scaleup’s sustained influence over global housing and migration trends.
If there are any lessons in this story for startups, it’s probably in how much positive press you can generate when you give laptop-bound adults the freedom to choose where they want to live and work. Plus, with more countries catching on to the idea of “Digital Nomad” visas, it’s easier and more cost-effective than ever before to build your dream team, entirely remotely.

"Hiring friends and family might be good for business, research suggests",The Conversation,2022/04/29,"
Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta/Facebook, recently remarked in a podcast interview that when it came to hiring new staff, his preference was people whose “values aligned in the things that you care about”. This, he said, was akin to “choosing a friend or a life partner”. He went on to state that many young people were too “objective-focused” and “not focused enough on connections and … people”.
This speaks to one of the eternal questions for managers in deciding who to hire: do you choose the candidate who has objectively higher ability or the one whose values are more in common with your own?
While some would unambiguously select the higher ability candidate, others like Zuckerberg might weigh differences in candidates’ abilities against the extent to which they share the values of the employer. Some would go further and hire family or friends.
Many firms actually promote this with employee-referral incentive schemes that encourage hiring individuals of similar characteristics – or at the very least those who move in the same networks. The stated purpose of such schemes is to reduce the costs of hiring, increase employee retention rates and improve employee engagement. There are even guides dedicated to helping managers who hire their friends.
On the other hand, such a buddying approach to recruitment seems to contradict anti-discrimination laws. These have been enacted around the world to ensure that certain groups of individuals are not treated more poorly than others. For example the UK’s Equality Act 2010 makes it unlawful to discriminate on the basis of age, gender, religion, race or sexual orientation (among others). The US equivalent, the Equal Employment Opportunities laws, similarly aims to reduce workplace discrimination.
The problem with hiring your friends
Broadly speaking, anti-discrimination laws promote diversity, while prioritising hiring friends, family or those with shared values seems to do the opposite. The American psychologist Gordon Allport, in his 1954 work The Nature of Prejudice, noted a distinction between hiring based on negative prejudices (discrimination), and hiring based on positive prejudices (factors other than ability). He claimed that while hiring based on negative prejudices created social problems, hiring based on positive prejudices did not.
Gary Becker, the American economist, made a similar distinction in his 1957 book The Economics of Discrimination but reached a different conclusion. He termed hiring based on negative prejudice as discrimination, and hiring based on positive prejudice as nepotism, and he argued that both led to economic inefficiencies. This was because both involved hiring workers for reasons other than ability, which he reasoned was the greatest predictor of output.
The role of human behaviour
But why would many companies explicitly focus on recruiting friends and family if it were really bad for business? Could it be that hiring decisions that don’t prioritise a candidate’s abilities might lead to lower output, but having employees with shared values is still better for an organisation overall?
In a recent paper myself and two research colleagues, Catherine Eckel and Rick K. Wilson, sought to find out. We conducted a controlled laboratory experiment with a sample of university students with strong social ties at Rice University, Texas. Upon admission, students at Rice are sorted into “residential colleges”, which are essentially housing where they typically stay throughout their studies. Students of the same college live together, eat together and compete against other colleges in a variety of activities, inculcating a strong college-based identity and shared values.
In our experiment, we got the students to play a famous two-player game that economists use to measure trust. This simulates a manager-employee relationship by first giving an individual in the role of a manager a small sum of money – usually US$10 (£7.66).
They are then asked how much they would like to transfer to an individual in the role of an employee. Whatever they transfer is then multiplied, usually by three, and given to the employee. The employee must decide how much to give back to the manager. Both are trying to end up with as much money as possible. Hence the manager is investing in the employee and trusting them to return some of the investment. The employee chooses how much to send back to the employer, which is a measure of reciprocity/effort.
In our version, managers had to choose between investing in an employee from the same residential college (meaning they had shared values), and one that was not. They were also made aware that different employees had different “abilities”, in the sense that the multiplier that determined how much money they received from the investment would be smaller – for example, 2.5 instead of three.
In some cases, the employee with the shared values was “lower ability”. This meant that the manager would need to trust them to give back a higher proportion of their money than the alternative choice would give back.
When faced with employees of equal ability, 80% of managers chose the one from their college. Even when their fellow college member was “lower ability”, 40% of managers still chose them. In other words, while at least some managers were choosing partners based on ability, a significant proportion incorporated college membership into their decision.
Employees from the same college exerted more effort for their managers (meaning they returned a larger share of the money) when they were “lower ability” than the other candidate. This suggested that “lower ability” group members compensated for their handicap by increasing their effort. On average, when managers with a choice of candidates of “equal ability” went with their college mate, they made 10% more money. And among those offered a “lower ability” college mate and a superior outsider, they made 7% more by going with the college mate.
These results imply that focusing on ability alone ignores the contribution to output of behavioural factors such as engagement, trust, motivation and effort. As long as differences in ability are not too large, hiring from within employee networks would appear to be a profitable strategy. Becker had it wrong, in other words.
So while it was previously thought that hiring based on network or familial ties was mainly altruistic, our research suggests otherwise. It may still bring up managerial challenges, such as having to tell these employees what to do, or calling them out when they don’t meet expectations. But employers trust employees more when they share their values, and the employees may compensate for their lower ability by working harder, benefiting the organisation as a result.

Founders! Europe’s SpaceTech scene is hitting lightspeed — and here’s the inside scoop,Andrea Hak,2022/04/28,"
Are you a would-be founder looking for the right industry to build, grow, and scale? Are you an engineer looking for a new challenge? Do the words ‘earth observation’ and ‘geospatial data’ get you going? Then SpaceTech might be the next frontier for you.
In the past, space was dominated by missions run by big space players, the US, Russia, and China. But the EU has set its sights to the skies, announcing a 20% increase in the European Space Agency’s budget at the end of 2021 — the largest the agency has seen in 25 years. Meanwhile, its upcoming ExoMars and JUICE missions are set to explore the mysteries of the red planet, Jupiter and three of its icy moons.
It’s an exciting time for the European Space Agency, but it’s an even more exciting time for the bloc’s burgeoning SpaceTech ecosystem.
TNW spoke with five up and coming SpaceTech startup founders who recently took part in the European Commission backed X-Europe accelerator program.
Here are some of the hottest and fastest-growing areas within the EU’s SpaceTech industry at the moment:
Building space technology infrastructure
“Space technology will be the basis of an unprecedented transformation of humankind that we will witness this century — namely, humans settling on other worlds for the first time in history. Europe must be at the forefront of these efforts, and this can only be achieved with a vibrant, powerful space tech ecosystem,” said Zdravko Dimitrov, CEO of Sfera Technologies.
However, much like the transition to EVs, we won’t be able to access the full benefits of space technology without building up the necessary infrastructure. As Dimitrov explained:
Space infrastructure makes it possible for a much broader user base to tap into the benefits of space — from data to hardware or services — thus making the space industry much easier to integrate with the rest of the global economy.
Sfera Technologies’ first product, HomePort, is a ground segment infrastructure for earth observation data. In other words, with an increasing influx of earth observation data, HomePort’s ground station network is set up to receive and process this data in a fast, secure, and efficient manner.
Accessibility, but also sustainability
Earth observation data promises to provide a new economic boom in terms of business creation, revenue, and job growth. According to a recent survey, in 2020 the EU’s Earth Observation industry experienced a 24% growth in the number of companies, a 24% increase in revenue, and a 17% rise in employees, compared to 2019.
But many businesses still lack the skills and resources to take advantage of this growing opportunity.
“Earth observation missions are key to fighting climate change, improving crops, wildfire monitoring, and other major challenges. But to build and put satellites in optimal operational orbits is complex. ESFERATROS is offering in orbit delivery services to empower companies to access optimal operational orbits faster, safer, and at a competitive cost,” said CEO Leopoldo Martinez.
However, he offered one important caveat. While the push to make earth observation data more widely available will stimulate business growth and address the impact of climate change here on Earth, we cannot ignore the buildup of pollution in space.
Space debris is putting current missions and human lives at risk in low earth orbits, and if nothing concrete is done, we can reach a point of no return, limiting access to space for current and new players in the industry. Even though the problem is well known, many players in the industry still think space is too big and are not willing to take concrete actions toward space pollution.
Luckily, as Martinez explained, the EU and ESA are committing more resources to tackle the problem. ESFERATROS in particular is working on non-invasive solutions to mitigate space debris.
A long term vision for the future
“Personally, as a co-founder of a European space startup, I can see that the European space sector has stepped up its game on the global space map. The new iteration of the EU Space Programme of €14.8 billion strives to strengthen European strategic autonomy, security, and its role in the space sector. With the introduction of the GOVSATCOM initiative and the Space Situational Awareness program, there is a huge potential for the development of the new upstream and downstream markets, and an increased European presence in the space sector,” said Artem Axelrod, COO at Mission Space.
However, he admitted that as a co-founder of a startup that represents the newly established SSA program, specifically space weather monitoring and prediction, he faced a lot of challenges securing funding.
Mission Space set up a satellite-based space weather intelligence system. Its solution can detect, predict, and gain advanced warning of solar storms and space radiation risks. Solar storms have the potential to short the circuitry on satellites and disrupt telecommunications infrastructure and power grids. For any government or business sending equipment or missions into space, this could cost major sums in damaged equipment, not to mention the danger astronauts could face. According to Axelrod:
Since the space weather market is still emerging, and we are one of the first ones to operate in that market, corporate investors do not see an immediate return, and, rather than focusing on the bigger picture and long term investment to boost the development of the EU’s newly established SSA program, they prefer to pass and look for companies that operate in a more understandable market segment for them.
Nevertheless, Axelrod shared that there is huge support from various state-based and corporate-based accelerators and programs, such as:

X-Europe: a European space tech accelerator aimed to facilitate the shared development of the European deeptech startup ecosystem
Fit 4 Start: an accelerator program initiated by the Luxembourg Ministry of Economy and managed by Luxinnovation
Space Founders: European Space tech accelerator program that is jointly initiated and run by CNES, the National Centre for Space Studies, and the Entrepreneurship and Intrapreneurship Program at the University of the Bundeswehr Munich
Seraphim Space Camp: UK accelerator program by Seraphim Space Capital

“With their help, we at Mission Space were able to close our pre-seed round of €250,000, book our first flight for January 2023, close contracts worth €1.5 million, and become eligible to apply for the €150,000 non-equity grant from the Luxembourg Ministry of Economy,” Axelrod said.
Innovation in materials
One thing that will be essential to driving down costs for SpaceTechs will be innovation in material design and components. Indeed, components are one of the biggest costs a SpaceTech startup might encounter. That’s where innovation is continuously needed to build materials that are cheaper, more efficient, and scalable for a growing market.
“Some of the hottest topics in EU SpaceTech are related to sustainable propulsion systems from new kinds of chemical propulsion systems to a wide array of innovative electric propulsion products,” says Elias Bögel, Project Engineer at Neutronstar Systems.
Neutronstar Systems has developed a first-of-its-kind electric propulsion thruster aimed at pushing human-space activities further, faster. Their SUPerconductor based Readiness Enhanced Magnetoplasmadynamic Electric Propulsion thruster (or simply, ‘Supreme Thruster’) is built using alternative materials (such as Argon and Ammonia) that make it more efficient, cost-effective, and scalable.
For Bögel, one of the biggest advantages of being a SpaceTech firm is the funding programs being sponsored by the bloc, and the collaboration opportunities with businesses and universities.
We are extremely excited that the EU is now providing more and more funding for ambitious space projects, especially for startups. For example, through the Horizon 2020 program or external projects. A prime example of this is the MEESST project, a collaborative research project made up of startups/SMEs and academia, all funded under Horizon 2020.
SpaceTech startups are also helping to create safer materials. Engineering service provider ADOTT solutions specializes in designing products that can be used in explosive atmospheres. In particular, the use of electric batteries and x-ray shielding has a higher risk of causing fires or explosions in space. As Endre Surinya, Head of R&D explained:
There is a boom in the number of satellites around the Earth, and these satellites use batteries as an energy source. However, the safety of lithium batteries is below expectations, and the more batteries there are, the greater the risk of issues, as well as the amount of space debris. ADOTT Solutions’ BLueDoTT battery is delivering an alternative solution that is ultra-safe, having already been tested in the oil and gas industry.
What excites Surinya most about the space industry at the moment is that plucky startups are leading the charge in innovation:
New technologies allow for new practices that could potentially enhance the quality of human life on Earth. These technologies are now coming more and more from startups, rather than from governmental organizations as was the case before.

Startups are leading the way in agtech and food innovation,Cate Lawrence,2022/04/27,"
Right now, agtech and new food startups are hot in terms of funding, technical innovation, product development, and ROI. Today Startup Genome, in partnership with the Global Entrepreneurship Network launched 
the Global startup ecosystem report (GSER):Agtech and new food edition. And it’s definitely worth a deep dive.
Looking for the latest trends or need to know information for your own startup or even your next investment? The GSER provides comprehensive, data-driven research on startups, with 280+ entrepreneurial innovation ecosystems and 3 million startups. 
Let’s look at some of its findings and profile some cool startups in the agtech and new food space. 
COVID 19 as a catalyst for change
The report shares that the COVID-19 pandemic, spiraling fertilizer costs, supply chain disruption, climate change awareness, and recent geopolitical events have brought new urgency and mainstream attention to the issue of food security.
Whether through editing crop genes, rethinking logistics, or producing plant-based foods, startups are drivers of real change in the sector. And I am all for it.
What are the key areas in agtech and new food? 
The depth and breadth of the space is abundant. Agricultural technology captures the use of technology in agriculture, horticulture, and aquaculture to improve yield, efficiency, and profitability through information monitoring and analysis of weather, pests, soil, and air temperature. 
There’s a strong focus on improving agricultural efficiency and sustainability, including field sensors, drones, farm-management software, robotics, vertical farming, and more. 
“New food” employs innovation to optimize food design, creation, diversity, distribution, and utilization. This includes apps and services that provide access to food, including direct-to-consumer food delivery platforms, meal kit and grocery delivery services, and products and services that innovate food processing and ingredients.
New food also refers to next-generation food and drinks, including cultivated meat, plant-based meat and milk, insect-based products, and fermented foods. Also part of the equation is waste management and food packaging. 
What are some of today’s biggest trends and investments? 
Plants not meat
The GSER report finds that fake meat is hot hot hot, so say goodbye to your chicken nuggets. (Not convinced? Check out Thomas’ review of plant-based filet mignon)

Specifically, investments in alternative proteins grew to a record-breaking $5 billion, up 60% from the prior year.
Grocery deliveries 
Gorillas are Germany’s fastest unicorn. Credit. Gorillas
Due to shifts in consumer behavior (largely thanks to COVID-19) and rapid innovation, food and grocery delivery deals have climbed steadily in recent years. 
In 2021, food delivery accounted for 11% of the $1.6 billion invested in agtech and new food, up from just 2% of the total dollar amount invested in the sub-sector in 2017 and 6% in 2020.
North America and Asia dominate 
The most successful agtech and new food startups and funding are in North America and Asia. If you are a startup in the space, you need to read this report. 
Any savvy startup should comb this report with a fine-tooth comb, then work your networks for warm introductions.
In particular, the report provides a deep dive analysis into the most funded sectors and the best places to position a startup.I won’t replicate all the data here, but the top five Agtech & New Food ecosystems are Silicon Valley, New York City, London, TelAviv-Jerusalem, and Denver-Boulder. 
Not convinced that agtech and new food are the innovators of the future? 
Reading through the report inspired me to make a little listicle of some of my favorite agtech and new food startups. Some are in the report, some are companies I’ve previously interviewed, or have been following for a while: 
Centaur Analytics (US/Greece)
Even when stored in silos, crops can be at risk of spoilage and insect infestation. Centaur Analytics has developed proprietary wireless sensors designed to “sniff” crop storage conditions inside shipping containers, grain bins, and storage bunkers. The sensors enable crop monitoring in various scenarios, including ship carriers and transportation, which may take weeks or months. 
Behind the scenes, entomological models are applied to the data stream. Predictive analysis helps farmers with proactive measures like fumigation and pest control.
Farmobile (US) 
Credit: Farm Mobile
Today farms are a hotbed of data analytics that enables farmers to gain critical insights to assist with precision agriculture, including planning, water, fertilizing, and yield optimization.
Farmobile has created the world’s first online marketplace for agricultural data for farmers to sell their data to seed suppliers, farm machinery manufacturers, researchers, and others, as well as fairly compensate farmers for their digital assets. 
Infarm (Germany)
Credit: Infarm
Traditional indoor farming usually involves large outer city warehouses of plants where plants are grown, then picked and transported to shops and restaurants. Infarm has developed a unique indoor vertical farming solution. 
The modular farms stack to fit any given space, from supermarket aisles and restaurant kitchens, to distribution warehouses. Crops are ready to be picked and sold without the need for excess transport miles or a delay between picking and distribution.
Tortuga (US)

Employee shortages hit farms and agricultural businesses hard. Tortuga builds robots to perform farm services, including picking and packaging.
By automating mundane, difficult tasks, workers on the farm can dedicate themselves to higher-value work. The robotics also capture never-before-possible plant-level data that turns into valuable information for growers. 
Live Green Food Group (Chile)
Credit: Live Green Food Group
Ever bought vegan food only to find that the ingredients aren’t all that healthy, or come from some far-flung destination?
Live Green Food Group is building a proprietary AI platform, called Charaka. It discovers plant-only ingredients that replace all animal ingredients as well as the synthetic and ultra-processed additives in food products. It also considers local availability and sustainability parameters like zero waste, and land, water, and energy consumption.

Lego’s digital transformation targets your inner child,Natasha Nel,2022/04/22,"
“Becoming a digital consumer goods company is our ambition,” says Atul Bhardwaj, Chief Digital and Technology Officer of The Lego Group, in a not entirely predictable statement statement — coming from the world’s most valuable manufacturer of physical toys.
“We’ll always be anchored in the physical — just to be clear — but digital needs to come in and augment that physical build process,” Bhardwaj clarifies. “Our business has scaled a lot in the last two years; we need to make sure that our platforms and our systems also scale.”
The Lego Group’s earnings for 2021 saw revenue grow 27% year-on-year (to $8 billion), while consumer sales grew 22%. CEO Niels B. Christiansen said in September that Lego’s strong financial performance would allow the company to accelerate investments in digitalisation.
“The Lego Group is making a significant strategic investment in digital transformation; it’s a multi-billion DKK (Danish krone) investment,” confirms Bhardwaj. “We’re trebling the size of our digital teams and accelerating our presence and our capabilities here [in Copenhagen], but it’s all part of a much broader digital agenda.”
Having led digital transformation for MediaMarkt and Tesco before being hired by the Lego Group 18 months ago, Atul Bhardwaj knows a thing or two about turning what he calls turning a “traditional IT team” into a “digital technology team”.
When asked whether he thinks the pandemic was the real driver of Lego’s growth over the past couple of years, he’s adamant its success is driven by great narratives created around great products.
“There’s a lot of excitement around our build experiences,” Bhardwaj insists, which begs the question: how is the magic of Lego’s IRL user experience being effectively augmented by digital products, largely built for adults?






Lego’s video gamified take on the Star Wars franchise.
“When you build digital products, you think first about who you’re building these products for,” says Bhardwaj, “We’re asking ourselves: ‘What are the digital needs of each of our key user groups?’ We want to be product-led, engineering-led, and architecture-led in everything we do; so, we’re introducing the concept of digital products to the Lego ecosystem.
“And we’re doing this for all of our user groups,” explains Bhardwaj, going on to outline the four key user segments his digital transformation efforts are focused on: “consumers, shoppers, partners, and colleagues”.
Because Lego’s consumer group comprises both kids and adults, they’re building separate “engagement platforms” for each audience. One of the objectives of these platforms is to gamify and support “co-building” between family and friends. Naturally, these new formats present various challenges Lego’s digital teams are tasked with solving: “How do we make sure kids can engage with us digitally, in a safe way? And how do we build great communities for adults – some of whom are very experienced, and some of whom are new to building?”
When asked for a couple examples of digital transformation projects being prioritized at Lego’s new “digital hub” in Copenhagen, Bhardwaj says, “The difficult thing is for me to pick just one or two.”
Credit: kottke.orgWith its building instructions app nearing 10 million downloads, DX at Lego is now focused on automating supply chains, unifying their on- and offline shopping experiences, and building gamified “engagement platforms” for both children and adults.
With the consumer-centered mobile app that took Legos building manuals online already on 9.7 million downloads, Bhardwaj is now focused on creating a “seamless” online-offline experience for shoppers: “How do we bring together the experience you have on lego.com with the experience you have in our stores? What does that look like?”
From a partner perspective, Bhardwaj is tasked with digitizing and automating Lego’s B2B interactions at scale, which means significantly upgrading the experience for resellers by revamping orders and tracking via “Partner Portal” webshops.
Likewise, for the colleagues user segment (referring to the people working in Lego’s offices and factories around the world), Bhardwaj says the focus is on automating “as much as possible”.
“We’re moving to the cloud. We’re building modern APIs so that our systems can talk to each other in a more modern way; and we’re also replacing all of our networking in all of our sites across the world – quite literally laying out new cables to renew all of our infrastructure,” Bhardwaj says. “A lot of interesting problems to solve. It’s a challenging and exciting time to kick-off a career in digital transformation at Lego.”

CTOs share how to move from a dev role to the C-suite,.cult,2022/03/20,"
This article was originally published on .cult by Mikaella C. .cult is a Berlin-based community platform for developers. We write about all things career-related, make original documentaries and share heaps of other untold developer stories from around the world.
Have you ever wanted more control over the direction of your company? When is it time to rethink your role?
One study from Honeypot found that many developers become less satisfied with their working environment and company culture as they age, describing an increased risk of ageism from 29 onwards. As we grow more accustomed to working life and professional responsibilities, it’s common to become frustrated with elements that might feel outside your control as a single developer.
Some issues might be set by management or a C-level team, which you have little say in. And while there are all kinds of ways to negotiate for and manage a better working life, some developers choose to change up their own role dramatically — perhaps even by building their own company.
The path from developer to CTO isn’t straightforward, but it is well-paved. And there are all kinds of reasons to pursue it, and different ways to get into the role. Maybe you were the first developer on the ground at a company; maybe a friend approached you with a big deal. Or you might be actively searching for that big C-level role.
Whether you’re dreaming about the future or ready to start pursuing that role right now, there are strategies you can use to build yourself into the best (and most hirable!) CTO you can be. Take a page from other developers who have done the same thing.
1. Move beyond your standard toolkit
The best developer in the world isn’t going to make a good CTO if that’s all she can do. As Reiner Kraft, CTO of Yunar explains, there are three main fields when it comes to a CTO’s responsibilities:
Business (crunching the numbers and income), product (what we want to deliver) and technology (how are we going to make the product we want to deliver). Eventually, you’ll need to focus on orchestrating these three together. Become both the visionary who sees the big picture and the catalyst who makes things happen.
These three fields cross over so many different spheres of work and responsibilities that, to a certain extent, the exact nature of a CTO’s role is decided by the CTO (and the company they work for) themselves. Greg Brockman, former CTO of Stripe and now the co-founder and CTO at OpenAI, writes that while every CTO he spoke to, “viewed themselves as the facilitators of the technology organization,” the way this actually functioned differed:
Sometimes this was about connecting senior engineers. Sometimes it was mentoring. One thought-provoking case for me was a CTO who was effectively head of product.
This flexibility and breadth of responsibility means that you need to broaden your toolkit to look beyond software and programming. As a CTO, you’ll be responsible for huge swathes of a company’s work, from culture to recruitment to business and more. You’ll want to get involved in some of these areas as soon as you can. There’s lots of small but valuable ways to take on more responsibility at your current company:

Help plan a company party
Sit on the hiring committee for the next engineer to join your team
Help out a designer ordering new team t-shirts

Don’t be afraid to ask if you can shadow someone in a role or team that might not have a lot to do with your day-to-day workload. Put your hand up to work on projects closely linked to business development and administration, where you can learn by osmosis as you go.
Most companies are excited to see an employee interested in their own professional development and this extra activity might even come in handy around promotion time, but it’s also part of the territory of being a CTO, so it’s important to see everything as a long-term effort. Assess your own capacity, find your areas of deficiency and make slow and steady efforts to build out your skillset.
You might also decide to pursue a Master’s degree at some point, which will give you a thorough and verifiable claim to expertise. One of our surveys found that over two-thirds of Berlin’s CTOs have a Master’s in a variety of fields including Computer Science, Business Admin, Physics, and even Art! But the most common Master’s was in IT which includes IT Management, Business Information Systems, Business IT and, in Germany, Wirtschaftsinformatik ​(Business Informatics), all of which offer a useful link between technical and business knowledge.
But that still leaves a third of CTOs who don’t have a Master’s degree, meaning that if you build your skillset through practical and professional experience, you may not need further education to reach that role.
2. Find a community
‘Try to network’ can be vague and intimidating advice. It might conjure memories of awkward conversations or forced friendliness. At the same time, it’s important as a wannabe CTO to keep an eye out for opportunities, like-minded people and exciting ideas, because as a CTO or co-founder you’ll want to get in on the ground floor.
Rather than thinking of it as networking, try to expand your opportunities to encounter any of the above in situations that you find genuinely interesting and are comfortable with. In most major cities there are plenty of meet-ups and tech conferences where you might be able to socialize with other people interested in the same industries and companies you are. Or try going to a hackathon, where a fun project for a day might just turn into a company.
If you’re not much for events, extend your energy online. LinkedIn is an obvious avenue for professional engagement. Make your page an active one that people will recognize. Here’s a few ideas to get you started:

Write short blogs (Is there a fun problem at work you solved? Did you just go through a hiring process and have thoughts on how it could be improved? Have you got a new favorite hack you want to share with others?).
Share articles you found interesting.
Make memes related to your field (remember to keep it professional!).
Liking and commenting on other people’s posts can also go a long way towards improving your presence on LinkedIn, making you a digital face that others might remember.

It’s also okay if LinkedIn isn’t the place for you: there are still other options. Investigate Reddit, Twitter and even Discord, where there are also fun and engaging communities. The important thing is to put yourself out there, engage with the world and make it easy for anyone who has that burgeoning idea for an amazing company to find you, their next CTO.
3. Get ready to lead
In the end, any great C-Level position is about one thing above all else: people. Greg Brockman, co-founder and CTO at OpenAI shared:
I had a very strong vision of the environment I wanted to be a part of, and I was willing to go out of my way to make it exist. I was faced with a choice: the technical route or the people route. I’ve never found anything I loved more than writing code, but at the same time I knew we had a responsibility as an organization to support the amazing people we’d hired.
Brockman’s responsibility to support his employees came from the position of CTO at Stripe, but you don’t have to wait until you’re a CTO to start working to improve and understand the lives of your colleagues. You could start simply by talking to your colleagues and asking if they need help. By engaging with work beyond your own, not only will you become a friend to your colleagues, you’ll get a clearer picture of the problems your company is addressing.
You could also start thinking and reading like a C-level professional well before you reach that stage, giving yourself a leg-up amongst the competition as well as a taste of what’s to come in the real life of a CTO. Books can also impart useful leadership strategies and communicative techniques which will make you a better CTO when the time comes.
Joel Beasley, who began writing code at the age of 13 and sold his first tech at 18, became a CTO who works with startups and billion dollar enterprises alike. He highlights the importance of communication:
You’ve got to be able to communicate in life, it’s enormously important. Schools, to some extent, under emphasise that. If you can’t communicate and talk to other people and get across your ideas, you’re giving up your potential.
Along with Beasley’s book, you could try leading tech and entrepreneurial authors including Ben Horowitz, Rorie Devine, Mark McCormack, and more. And if you struggle finding the time to read, consider an app like Blinkist, which digests non-fiction into easily accessible bite-sized ideas.
If it feels like this work is leading you away from your first love — coding — that’s something to keep an eye on. But Reiner Kraft warns that this might be part of the job:
The one who conducts the orchestra doesn’t play the instrument. Similarly, being a CTO is really about helping others to grow.
4. Learn to let go
A lot of CTOs say that, for better or worse, their role involves stepping back from their first love — developing.
Sometimes becoming CTO might mean that, from day one, you’re no longer coding. Other times it happens slowly, over time. When describing his own journey, Airbnb’s co-founder and former CTO Nathan Blecharczyk said:
In [my] first one-and-a-half years I did write every single line of code myself. In the next three years, it was all about hiring a team: I spent most of my time screening candidates and trying to convince the outstanding ones that it’s worth joining Airbnb on this journey. As CTO, I did not only run engineering, but also data science, the data-driven aspects of online marketing, as well as our payments team.
Many CTOs make an effort to keep coding as part of their life. “I still code and program daily because it is important to make sure these skills are relevant and up to date in order to work with my team of developers and lead them appropriately,” Chalmers Brown, CTO of Due, says. “Plus, I enjoy doing this aspect of work.”
Others find new ways to stay close to code; when Arash Ferdowsi was still CTO at Dropbox, he was famous as a “chief debugger”, where Forbes reported on, “his propensity to file bug reports at all hours —3 a.m. missives [were] not uncommon. While he no longer codes, he [was] still the one making sure the company’s growing family of products remains unified and retains a simplicity of design and ease of use.”
And even when you’re still working close to code, you might have to move away from the kind of complicated, rewarding work that makes up part of a developer’s day-to-day life. An important part of being a CTO, says HeidiPay CTO Alistair Stead, is being:
… the person who sees a wider picture and thinks one or two steps ahead. Early in my career, I realised that technology exists only to serve business needs. Developers live to solve complex problems, yet finding the simplest solution to a business need (so the business can move forward) should be the imperative.
Whether you work to keep coding part of your working life or not, it’s certainly true that CTOs have such a wide scope of responsibilities that you’ll be doing a lot less coding than a developer would. As a developer seeking to move into a C-level position, this is worth reflecting on. Would you be truly happy taking on a role that is more about leadership, business strategy and company culture than coding? Would you be ready to spend more time in meetings than at your computer? More time imagining than building? It’s fine if the answer is “yes, definitely!”; it’s also okay to say “yikes, no thanks!”
Higher doesn’t always have to mean better. But if you do decide the CTO path is the one for you, it’s a fascinating and exhilarating experience with a lot to learn along the way. Try to enjoy the journey as much as you do the outcome.

The next big cybersecurity threat is connected SaaS platforms,Built In,2022/03/18,"
This article was originally published on Built In by Aner Gelman.
Text notifications about new messages on Slack. Linking Trello boards to Microsoft Teams. Using Boomerang to control a busy inbox. These apps and platforms — and their connections with each other — are all part of daily life in many companies today. They not only help make remote and hybrid work possible, but are key to building and scaling companies and products.
But the communications between thousands of SaaS platforms are also an emerging threat to corporate cybersecurity. Most existing cybersecurity solutions still do not offer adequate protection or a convenient way to monitor the communications between these apps and platforms, leaving companies vulnerable to cyberattacks and unable to effectively know or control which parties have access to sensitive corporate or personal data.
A handful of high-profile attacks — including a data breach at cybersecurity provider Imperva Security, in which attackers stole an API key that allowed the software to work on Amazon’s cloud, which ultimately permitted the attackers to gain access to sensitive customer data — have resulted from taking advantage of how SaaS platforms communicate with each other. In order to effectively protect themselves, companies need to understand how SaaS platforms are becoming increasingly vulnerable, what’s at stake, and what steps to take.
Current Cloud Security Options Don’t Protect SaaS-to-SaaS Communications
Cloud-based SaaS platforms have been growing rapidly for two decades, as they provide a convenient and affordable way to get tech services for both work and personal use. By now, most modern consumers are familiar with popular platforms, many of which can be customized, like Gmail and Salesforce.
Because SaaS is cloud-based, traditional cybersecurity measures, like firewalls that protected on-premise networks, data, and software, are no longer effective. So the market soon developed CASBs, or cloud-access security brokers, which are intermediaries between cloud-based services and their users or on-premise services. These can be software or hardware-based. But ultimately, they only protect connections between SaaS products and their users. This was fine — until more SaaS products started communicating with each other, doing things like sending a Slack message when a customer opens a support ticket.
More recently, SSPMs, or SaaS Security Posture Management solutions emerged. These have become popular, with research and consulting company Gartner naming them as a top tool in the future of cloud and SaaS security. While these do monitor more aspects than CASBs, they are only available for certain services, and even though they take a cloud-first approach, they are missing additional features, like overseeing the ubiquitous SaaS-to-SaaS communications.
Interconnected Apps Mean More Opportunities for Hackers
Slack popularized the notion of connecting different platforms to work together, and now most SaaS apps are communicating with each other. Each action a user takes, whether it’s sending a message or updating a calendar, may result in several other automatic actions and notifications in connected platforms, and other add-ons and apps for SaaS platforms require access to even more data on the platforms.
This means that if a hacker gains access to one platform, they potentially have access to all of that users’ different SaaS platforms and connected applications. In an age of increased cyberattacks, like recent supply chain attacks that often target organizations in order to gain access to more numerous or valuable targets — like what happened with the well-known SolarWinds attack — this leaves a lot of information extremely vulnerable.
What Can Companies Do to Protect Their Information?

Invest in SaaS security tools
Inventory apps currently in use by employees
Don’t neglect service accounts
Revoke all access from former employees’ linked accounts
Consider establishing an SaaS Operations department
Establish clear policies regarding use of third-party SaaS platforms

Companies need to invest more not just in SaaS security tools, but also in figuring out how many apps their employees are using, and what is being shared on them so that their cybersecurity departments have an accurate and comprehensive understanding of the potential threat landscape.
Organizations are becoming more aware of this, with 55 percent of information security professionals saying the top SaaS security challenge is a lack of visibility into SaaS usage and data. Once gained, they should use this intelligence to write clear policies regarding the use of third-party SaaS apps and platforms that takes into account their employees’ workflows.
Companies should be careful about things like service accounts being neglected, resulting in vulnerabilities like non-used API tokens that can be stolen and used to access privileged information. In addition to the threat of cyberattacks, the web of SaaS products also potentially leaves companies vulnerable to non-authorized users, or former employees, who may, through continuing email or message notifications and add-ons to platforms, have access to sensitive information.
While some automated solutions are emerging to address management of SaaS platforms, one immediate step companies can take is to dedicate a department to SaaS Operations, which oversees the purchase, security, and management of SaaS products a company uses. A recent survey found that 40 percent of IT professionals now see SaaS Operations as a critical new role.

High fashion to high tech: What startups can learn from industry icon François Kress,Alejandro Tauber,2022/03/17,"
Did you know François Kress is speaking at TNW Conference this summer? Check out the full list of speakers here.
Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Bulgari, Prada, Carolina Herrera, Miu Miu. This might sound like a bar from a standard rap song, but it’s actually a list of companies where François Kress has held leadership positions in his long career in the luxury industry. Then, an unexpected but welcome opportunity presented itself.
“I was really suffering from luxury fashion fatigue, and decided to move on and start this project,” he tells TNW over Zoom.
At the invitation of a friendly venture capitalist, Kress joined Feelmore labs as co-founder and  CEO, to develop a unique, category-defining type of wearable: Cove. It’s a wearable device that relies on the science of neurostimulation, sending specific vibrations to specific sensors behind your ears to “help you feel calm and emotionally balanced,” according to the website.
Curious about his switch from high fashion (“There was a time I had two secretaries and obviously a driver and everything”) to high tech (“Now I have to change the toilet paper at the office myself”), and what experience he took along with him, we spoke to Kress from his apartment in New York about the lessons tech can learn from the most luxurious of luxury brands on the planet.
Dressed in a casual navy blue long-sleeve with perfectly coiffed silver-gray hair and thick-rimmed glasses, it’s easier to see Kress managing Fendi than a high-tech wearable company. But looks, in this case, are deceiving.
Kress’ background, before being recruited by Bernard Arnault of LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy), was in theoretical physics, with a special interest in topology — hardcore math describing complex dynamic geometric problems.
“For me, it was like going back, because after high school I studied intense theoretical stuff for 8 years.”
Move slow, do things well
During his career in luxury, Kress was sucked into tech when he was offered a board position at a biopharmaceutical company, and was surprised by the fast pace of tech companies.
“Coming from big luxury groups, which have hundreds of years of history and where everything is very slow and very careful, to this fast-paced biotech world and startups and VC money was a shock.”
After meeting some VCs through his board position, he agreed to co-found Feelmore Labs, where he could finally bring together his experience in rigorous science from his science degrees, and dedication to craftsmanship from his career in luxury. This also allowed him to bypass some long-held beliefs about the pace of business that many founders face
“Just put an MVP on the market. Even if it’s crappy, you know, you will learn as you iterate,” he says was something he’d hear often. “But I was very determined not to get rushed, or half-bake the technology for the sake of this kind of iterative process.”
Listen to your customers less
The iterative process couldn’t be more removed from the process in high-end fashion and luxury, Kress tells us.
“It’s the opposite of what you hear in luxury and fashion, at least at the top end of those products. There, it’s ‘don’t listen to your customers, they don’t know what they want.’ If you ask customers what they want to see on the runway, you will always see the same black dress coming out of every workshop. So for me, that was a complete shift.”
Haute couture by fashion designer Iris van Herpen
Kress says he’s trying to find a middle ground between not listening to customers at all, and letting customers determine the whole product. “I think like everything in life, there is a middle point, right? We could bring a little more finesse into tech. Apple is a good example of a brand which had very strong aesthetic content and a strong vision, which was not purely based on practical aspects.”
Not everything needs to be practical
A total focus on practicality can be a flaw, he thinks. “It sometimes makes me sick when all I hear is like, ‘Oh, what is the problem, what is the solution.’ That’s cool, and you can make nice little projects that way. But you’re never going to build greatness out of solving practical problems.”
Kress believes firmly that for building a new category of wearable, one that actively affects your mood, versus one that just registers your vital signs, you need to do more than just focus on the functionality. To do this, you need to look at the whole picture, and build the brand holistically from the get-go.

“If you look at the functionality of fashion, like a bag is to carry your stuff from point A to point B, then there is no reason to spend thousands of dollars on that, because you could do it with a plastic bag, right?”
The attractiveness of a product goes way beyond the functionality of the product, he tells us. Although he’s the first to admit that Cove is still far from being acknowledged as an item with more intangible value. “We are too young, the category is still too young,” he says.
Perfection, perfection, perfection
Another lesson Kress brought along from luxury brands is the obsession with quality and perfection. In the case of Cove, Kress says they spent way more time and money on first proving the science of the device, and then perfecting the device itself than strictly necessary.

“We added little hinges in the design to accommodate potentially wider heads, we added a heart rate sensor, a motion sensor, which an MVP probably could have lived without. All these things made the whole design and mechanical engineering much more complex, but they add a marginal impact, which people may not even see. There are a lot of subconscious signs that you send in luxury that overall build the dream.”
Their goal for Kress was to build something users forget they’re wearing, and that has perfected “even things you don’t see, because I think in luxury the value is in execution. Everything in luxury is overdone, look at the stores, they are just perfect. So we spent time perfecting the device.”
Don’t price yourself too cheaply
While Cove is not a luxury device per se, it did not come cheap. The launching price was 490 dollars, in a market where most wearables set you back around 300.
“We were widely criticized for that, to be honest. As an unknown entity, it’s hard to start at that price. But we decided to do it anyway,” he says. Obviously, there was a reasoning behind the price point.
“There is a psychological barrier to price in general that you can never go up in price, right? If you start low just for the sake of moving merchandise, you will stay there,” he says. 
But there’s more to it than just keeping margins up. “First of all, for a neuro-product, which relies certainly on the placebo effect, I believe that the price matters. It’s like when you go to the shrink, we all know that paying is part of the therapy. I think the price is part of the reflection of the seriousness of the product — within limits, obviously.”
Service is everything
Kress did mention that Cove would soon be offered as a monthly subscription service soon, partly to reduce the sticker shock of the high price. But it’s also to reflect that the company offers exceptional service — which is another lesson he brought along from luxury. 
“Since we are in the mental wellness field, service is difficult sometimes. People who call us don’t only talk about the functionality, you get people who want to talk about their problems. And no, we don’t offer therapy, but we hire people who are subtle enough to address all that. We have been praised a lot for that, that’s super important.”
The company also prides itself on being lenient on return and replacement policies, which come at a cost, but “that’s the least we can do for people who have the courage to try a new technology and take a leap of faith to try something unknown.”

Will the metaverse replace offices? Not by a longshot,Samantha Johnson,2022/03/14,"
Covid-19 has opened the world’s eyes to the benefits of remote and flexible work, and many aren’t looking back — according to a survey by workplace platform Envoy, 71% of employees would choose a hybrid work model, only 12% want to work remotely every day, and just 16% want to work full-time in the office.
Until now, technology hasn’t quite been able to keep up with this change of attitude — we can agree that video conferencing software sucks and a Zoom call doesn’t really cut it as an office party replacement. But conversations around the promises of the metaverse and web3 have businesses and employees excited about the possibilities.
The metaverse promises to solve hybrid workplace obstacles — but is it really the silver bullet solution?
So why are companies so excited about the metaverse?
Working in the metaverse  would allow workers to be 100% remote, while still allowing for social interaction. For employers, this means a limitless talent pool, as workers from Michigan to Mozambique can interact together in a virtual, hyper realistic world. And for employees, this means they would get the freedom and flexibility of working from anywhere they want.
A metaverse workplace could also make for a more equitable workplace helping to level the playing field between the employees managers see every day and those who have to or want to be remote, for example if they’re a single parent, disabled, or just can’t afford to live near the office.
Health and safety also come into play. A recent survey also found 43% of office workers, either hybrid or full-time, are more worried about exposure to and transmission of Covid than remote workers. For employees of color, 21% lose sleep over it compared to just 11% of their white coworkers.
A metaverse office means anyone can come in, whether they’re vaccinated, unvaccinated, immunocompromised, positive or negative.
And then we get to the actual offices themselves. Think of a metaverse office where real estate is cheaper, and you can design it at the top of a skyscraper or inside the belly of a whale — without the hefty price tag (or whale guts).
Desk space in the metaverse is infinitely scalable. Size up or down based on your needs. It’s the ultimate customizable space. Virtual meeting rooms or communal lounge areas will be configured for the type of work people are doing — heads down work or creative team brainstorming.
Metaverse real estate companies like The Sandbox are already cropping up to stake their claim in this new frontier, and businesses like UK media company VCCP and Mediahub have already set up their metaverse offices.
Ultimately, employees want flexibility, freedom and the ability to socialize and easily collaborate — and the metaverse could conceivably offer it all.
The metaverse won’t replace the physical office any time soon
Of course, this is all theoretical at this point. Until we actually have long-term business use cases, we won’t be able to measure the opportunities or understand the potential downsides. Some questions we’ll need to consider for example are: How long can people really wear a headset for? Are there detrimental impacts on physical and/or mental health to spending your 9/5 in ‘The Matrix’?
What’s more, we’ve seen some interesting innovation in metaverse gaming, but adoption is still low and whether this could translate to the world of work is still unproven.
So the question is, when will we get a chance to have a chat around the virtual water cooler?
While the Big Five are already planting their flag in the metaverse, and new startups are cropping up to push the metaverse further, not everyone is convinced we’re as close to a true “meta” metaverse as we think. According to Envoy’s CEO and founder, Larry Gadea:
Yes, anything’s possible so it could eventually replace reality. Now, is this happening anytime soon? No. Is this going to happen all at once? Absolutely not. For the metaverse — it has to be believable, or it won’t work. In-person interactions are so fundamental to who we are. It’ll take generations for us, along with the metaverse, to develop and evolve. And right now the technology just isn’t there yet.
Gadea founded Envoy to make workplaces work better for employers and employees alike. As the world plunged into lockdown amidst Covid-19, it became more urgent than ever to create workplace products that would help bring people back to the office safely.
During the pandemic the company launched Envoy Protect and Envoy Desks, apps that gives employees an overview of who is working in the office and when so they can sync work schedules and optimize time in the office, reserve work desks and, most importantly, certify their health status — users can upload proof of vaccination, a weekly negative Covid test, or fill out a daily health check.
In January, Envoy raised $111m in a Series C funding round, which Gadea says will be put towards building out its product offering further to help make hybrid workplaces even more flexible, thoughtful, and a better experience for employees. And while the metaverse isn’t a major focus for Envoy yet, they’re keeping a close eye on it.
Bringing people together IRL
Even when we have the technology for a truly realized metaverse, Gadea says, offices will still play a crucial role.
The world never does everything at once and it’s not going to, no matter what the benefits are. So there will always need to be a bridge between that world and the physical world.
Socializing, for example, will always be a key reason why the metaverse won’t replace an IRL office anytime soon — or even at all. Gadea added: “It’s very hard to have memorable moments that you’re going to be like, oh, yeah, I remember that. That person spilled a drink on this other person… That’s how you remember moments in life. The challenge is figuring out how to recreate human interactions in a virtual environment. Spontaneous conversations in a virtual hallway. Mimicking a real-life meeting where people can have multiple conversations going with folks.”
Besides the obvious mental health benefits, having candid moments with colleagues IRL is proven to increase creativity, productivity and problem-solving. And when it comes to the metaverse, you can’t really have a “water cooler moment” if you can’t actually drink the water.
So what does the future office look like? “I think we’ll get some cool new technologies. We’ll have video conferencing that’s even better. We’ll have meeting rooms that are much more inclusive of remote people than they are today,” Gadea says.
But at the end of the day, people being together is one of the most important things that can happen. And that’s one of the biggest things that was taken away from us with COVID.

"Zoom etiquette: Yes, it’s OK to mute your face",Zapier,2022/03/12,"
We’re now years into this great experiment in remote work. It started off as a Zoom, but now it feels more like a plod. Our work lives are lived on camera all day, every day—and it’s time to let people take a break.
Face-muting is ok
Communicating remotely isn’t new. For ages, we corresponded by mail. Then we added telegraphs, which increased the speed of communication. Then came telephones, which allowed us to communicate beyond cables. Fax, email, instant message—the communication options continued to grow.
We didn’t see each other’s faces, yet business still thrived.
Video calls are great for a lot of things, like screen sharing and picking up on non-verbal cues. But it doesn’t mean we always have to stare each other in the face. Because, let’s be honest, it’s exhausting.

We all know it’s ok to mute. But I want to make it clear that it’s just as ok to face-mute—to turn your camera off—especially in certain situations.

When eating. On days when I’m slammed with back-to-back meetings, I often eat during calls. To avoid turning the meeting into a mukbang session, I turn off audio and video.
When multitasking. Not all parts of all meetings I’m at are relevant to me. If folks are talking about something that doesn’t pertain to me, I use that time for busywork, like checking Slack. I don’t face-mute to hide my multitasking—it’s a good use of time—but if I had my video on, it’d be noticeable and distracting to others to see me doing something else.
In large group meetings. If no one’s going to see you anyway, feel free to give yourself a break, so you don’t have to worry if people noticed the weird way you itched your ear.

When you don’t have your game face on. We’re not camera-ready 100% of the time. While time-shifting to accommodate time zones, I’ve popped into 5 a.m. meetings. I’m not getting up at 4:45 a.m. to get my game face on, and believe me, you don’t want to see my face at that hour.
And there’s one more big one: face-mute whenever you feel like it.
How to encourage people not to face-mute
Yes, it’s ok—and sometimes important—to keep your camera off during a video call. But it’s also nice to see people’s faces sometimes, and the visual aspect of synchronous communication has obvious benefits.
Instead of issuing a hard edict, you can encourage attendees to show their faces by implementing a few strategies.

Have an agenda and share it ahead of time. It lets those who are multitasking know when something will be relevant to them. Instead of defaulting to camera-off the whole time, they can turn their camera on when it’s a pertinent agenda item.
Keep things concise. It’s easier to put your game face on if it’s a shorter meeting, and people might be more open to camera-on for 15 minutes than 45. Don’t schedule a one-hour meeting just because it’s the calendar default.
Ask engaging questions or use breakout rooms for small group discussions. People are more likely to show their faces if they’re actually participating.
Don’t record the meeting unless it’s really necessary. Being on camera all day is tiring enough. Knowing that it’s going to be recorded and live forever in the bowels of Skynet—uh, the internet—adds another layer of pressure. If a recording is necessary, add timestamps so people can easily skip to relevant sections, and enable closed captions and/or transcripts so people can get the context without staring at everyone’s recorded faces. As an added bonus, it’ll make your meetings more accessible.

I concede that meetings are sometimes (I repeat—sometimes!) necessary, but you can decrease the burden of being camera-on all the time. It may not be a full zoom anymore, but see if you can at least turn that plod into an amble.

This righteous bot trolls hypocritical brands posting about International Women’s Day,Cate Lawrence,2022/03/8,"
It’s that time of year again: inspiration porn is everywhere, image libraries are seeing huge downloads of diverse females in suits, and women are organizing their own celebrations without pay.
Yes, it’s International Women’s Day.
But what happens when we look behind the sickly efforts of corporations? The back-patting social media posts? The tokenization?
Well, you’ll find a fucking huge gender pay gap.
Introducing… the Gender Pay Gap Bot
The Gender Pay Gap Bot
Today some anonymous activists launched a campaign on Twitter to raise awareness about the gender pay gap. It explains:
Employers, if you tweet about International Women’s Day, I’ll retweet your gender pay gap.
That’s right: it uses a bot to name and shame. Excellent. 
It’s a mighty, powerful fuck you to corporations and their carefully curated social media posts, and I like it. Some choice examples: 

In this organisation, women’s median hourly pay is 68.6% lower than men’s. https://t.co/Vk45EVqON4

In this organisation, women’s median hourly pay is 37% lower than men’s. https://t.co/ZbCVRKW5Dx
— Gender Pay Gap Bot (@PayGapApp) March 8, 2022

The bot is using data sourced from a UK government database.  This is great, especially when you consider the state of women in the UK government.
The UK is governed by a conservative government, where women make up just 33% (225) of the elected representatives in the House of Commons, and only six ministers in the current Cabinet (27%) are women. 
On top of that, only 28% (229) of members of the House of Lords are women. And no, I don’t understand how the House of Lords can exist in 2022 either. 
One thing’s for certain though: that’s a lot of men making decisions on behalf of women. 
Fortunately, the campaign also highlights some companies that are doing things right:

In this organisation, men’s and women’s median hourly pay is equal. https://t.co/cdUZTXY2kl

In this organisation, women’s median hourly pay is 16.5% higher than men’s. https://t.co/iG1tVB07es
— Gender Pay Gap Bot (@PayGapApp) March 8, 2022

Great to see!
A day doesn’t make up for a year of gender discrimination 
However, the reality is that equality and inclusion go far beyond an event or campaign. I haven’t been at TNW for long, but I’m pleased to work for a company where pay rates are the same regardless of gender. 
This is achieved by having a salary house assign a wage level (or two) to a role based on experience and qualifications, meaning each person gets paid the same amount for that role. 
The company hasn’t always been blameless when it comes to speaker representation or remuneration. However, TNW is currently working to ensure that half of our conference speakers are female or gender diverse. 
I’ve written about the lack of gender diversity at tech conferences before. Many of us are familiar with attending events where we feel unwelcome, such as through the use of marketing gimmicks like “booth babes.”
Yes, this is still a thing, even in Berlin, a city where International Women’s Day is a public holiday.
So please take a closer look at all the companies blasting out about their great female employees today. 
Ask yourself, how many women are in management? How many are board members? Do they foster an inclusive workplace culture? What practices do they have to deal with workplace sexual harassment, bullying, and discrimination? Do they provide maternity and paternity leave? 
We’re privileged to work in tech, the wealthiest industry of all, but there’s still a lot of work to do. Fixing the gender gap takes more than a day each year.

Stop obsessing over Elizabeth Holmes’ voice — it’s sexist,The Conversation,2022/03/4,"
There is a scene in Hulu’s new series, “The Dropout,” where Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, wearing a white blouse, stands in front of a mirror and practices saying, “This is an inspiring step forward.” With each iteration, her voice deepens.
As the world has learned about Theranos’ web of deception – whether through John Carreyrou’s bestselling book, “Bad Blood,” Apple’s podcast series “The Dropout” or Hulu’s streaming series of the same name – Holmes’ supposed attempt to alter her voice is a detail that captivates audiences. The behavior might strike some people as bizarre, even sociopathic.
But because of my training in vocology, the study of vocalization, and my interest in speech biases, I’m intrigued by why Holmes may have felt compelled to change her voice in the first place. I see the story of her voice as part of a broader cultural fixation on the way women speak and sound.
Reactions to Holmes’ voice
Whenever Holmes is in the news, some questions always come up:
What’s with that distinctively low voice? Is she faking it?
I have not been able to find definitive proof, in the form of video or audio recordings, to show that Holmes’ voice is noticeably different in its current form than at some previous time.
One video claims to capture Holmes shifting between two very different voice modes. During this interview with Elizabeth Holmes, commenters highlight a vocal switch between the 1:28 and 2:08 marks.

However, it could have been easily edited. And dramatic, sustained pitch changes in speech can be associated with heightened emotional states without indicating a put-on voice. At the same time, people who know Holmes have claimed that she changed her voice in order to cultivate a persona as a Silicon Valley wunderkind.
Only a clinician like a laryngologist can make a voice-related medical diagnosis. But since I can’t definitively answer if Holmes’ voice changed intentionally, it is worth considering what natural or medical processes could cause a similar effect. Hormones directly impact the voice, including pitch and the perception of roughness or hoarseness. Women’s voices tend to decrease in pitch range during menopause.
Holmes’ young age at the time she became known for her voice may rule out an age-related hormonal voice change, but a similar effect could be found with certain hormone therapy. There are also several voice disorders that impact pitch range.
If she did it … how?
There are all sorts of reasons people seek voice therapy or coaching to address vocal insecurities. Whether they’re concerned about their voice range or simply seeking skills to become better communicators, the voice is resilient and can be developed with training. There are also wonderful resources available for gender-affirming voice support for transgender people.
So what is the physiological process at play when someone intentionally lowers their voice.
Engaging a tiny laryngeal muscle called the thyroarytenoid causes the vocal folds, which are housed inside the larynx (or “voice box”), to relax and become shorter and thicker. Imagine decreasing tension on a rubber band. These shorter, thicker folds vibrate at a lower frequency, resulting in a lower-pitched voice, just as a thicker or more lax guitar string has a lower pitch.
It is likely the singular nature of Holmes’ voice is related not only to its low pitch, but also its resonance, the unique tonal quality, and placement of the voice. Holmes might adjust her resonance by consciously lowering the larynx. Doing so creates a longer space above the larynx, which boosts the deeper, darker tones in the voice.
Women’s voices subject to scrutiny
In my role as a theatrical voice coach, I’m sometimes asked to help women actors lower their voices. I’ve encountered directors and producers with a significant distaste for higher-pitched women’s voices, especially when this pitch range is combined with nasal resonance.
In movies and on TV, characters with high-pitched voices are often portrayed as comical, dim-witted, and generally undesirable. Think of Lina Lamont, the character from “Singin’ in the Rain” memorably played by Jean Hagen. Her high, piercing voice became a source of consistent laughs.
Might sexist attitudes about women’s voices cause women in leadership roles to feel pressured to adjust their pitch range down?
Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, nicknamed the “Iron Lady,” famously down-shifted her voice to burnish her stature. Research on perceptions of pitch in women’s voices shows higher ones are associated with physical attractiveness, while lower voices are associated with dominance.
Meanwhile, many women radio and podcast hosts are barraged with negative listener feedback about “vocal fry,” the creaky mode of speaking made famous by Kim Kardashian.
Yet physiologically, to create this sound, the vocal folds must vibrate at a low frequency, associated with low pitch. This much-maligned vocal feature is at one end of the pitch spectrum. But there’s another equally hated speech feature that is achieved at the other end: the high-rising terminal intonation pattern, or “uptalk.” This feature is noted for the dramatic upward pitch at the end of each thought, which can make statements sound like questions.
The insistence that women in media change the pitch of their voices often comes with little concern for the anatomical and physiological factors that will limit how much pitch change is ultimately possible. My current research is investigating perceptions of women’s speaking voices in the performing arts and considering whether it’s time to part ways with some old aesthetic preferences.
Either way, the delicate dance of trying to strike a happy medium – the Goldilocks voice profile, where one can be taken seriously as a leader without being perceived as inauthentic, grating or patronizing – seems to be elusive. Women’s voices are the subject of endless scrutiny at both ends of the range – it seems they just can’t win.
If everything about this story were the same except the gender of Theranos’ CEO, I wonder whether his voice would even be remarked upon. If it were, might the same vocal qualities be perceived as positive traits befitting a capable, serious-minded leader?
Elizabeth Holmes undoubtedly lacks the practical skills and moral compass to be a great leader. But all the noise about her voice, and the potential that she changed it to get ahead, just may reveal a sexist double standard that women seemingly can’t escape.

"Tech loves to talk ‘diversity,’ but some firms are actually moving backwards",The Conversation,2022/03/3,"
The U.S.tech sector is growing 10 times faster and has wages twice as high as the rest of the economy. This industry also wins the race for high profits and stock returns.
At the same time, the tech sector’s professional, managerial and executive labor forces are overwhelmingly white and male.
It is not surprising, then, that the field is under a great deal of pressure to diversify its labor force.
As researchers who study inequality, we examined the data to go beyond the picture of diversity in the tech sector as a whole. In our most recent research, we looked at which types of tech firms increased their workforce diversity, by how much, and for which groups of people. What we found surprised us.
Our research used machine learning techniques and firm-level data on employment diversity for 6,163 tech firms employing 2,582,342 workers. We used a clustering algorithm to identify groups of firms with similar changes in diversity between 2008 and 2016.
We focused in particular on professional jobs – the programmers, engineers, and designers who are the core source of innovation in the sector. We also looked at the managers and executives responsible for human resource practices. We don’t identify specific firms because this data was originally collected by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and our ability to analyze it requires strict confidentiality.
Diversity trajectories
We found that 80% of firms displayed a pattern of very minimal increases in diversity in their professional labor force, primarily driven by small increases in the employment of Asian men and Asian women, with declines among non-Asian women and no change among other minority men. We also found that this widespread pattern reflects much slower movement toward employment diversity in this sector than in the rest of the U.S. labor force.
Our findings for the remaining 20% of firms surprised us. We found some firms with rapid increases in diversity among professional jobs, and others where diversity declined substantially. In about 10% of firms, we found rapid increases in the proportion of white male professionals, in most the percentage of women fell, but in some, mainly Asian men were displaced. This latter small group of firms also saw growth in all other groups, even Asian women. This pattern permitted white male dominance at the expense of Asian men while making room for all other groups.
More hopefully, we observed a rapid growth in diversity of the technical labor force in two types of firms. In both, the percentage of white men declined by about a quarter. In the larger of these two groups, about 7% of tech sector firms, white male professionals were primarily replaced with white and Asian women, although Hispanic and Black men and women saw gains as well. The second group of firms was smaller, representing only 2% of tech firms. In these, white men were replaced by Asian men and Asian women, while all other groups declined as well.
We found similar patterns at the managerial and executive levels. Most firms showed little change, but there were small groups with rapid increases in diversity, and others with rapid decreases.
White male executives declined across the sector by 5.9%, and we discovered significant increases in the representation of all other groups, even Hispanic women, in the top jobs. It appears that the most common tech response to the pressure to increase diversity was to move more women and minorities into executive positions. This pattern has been described in previous research as being primarily a defensive response to diversity demands rather than a commitment to promoting employment diversity.
When do firms become more inclusive?
We also wanted to figure out which types of firms showed a pattern of rapidly increased diversity. Here we have two more hopeful findings.
Firms where professional diversity was growing rapidly also tended to be among those with rapid overall employment growth. Diversity looks to be good for business – or perhaps innovative, well-run businesses are better at hiring more diverse labor forces.
We wondered whether increased diversity among managers who do the hiring and executives who set the tone was associated with having a rapidly diversifying professional labor force. Here we found that those firms with strong increases in managerial diversity also tended to embrace strong increases in professional diversity. In contrast, strong increases in executive diversity did not reliably raise the chances that a firm would have strong diversity growth among its core professional labor force.
Window dressing or diversity now?
It looks to us as though the recipe for increasing diversity in the tech sector is at least in part to increase diversity at the managerial level. It also looks like increased diversity is good for business, although it is also possible that well-run firms hire more diverse labor forces. Unfortunately, this combination is not widespread. Dramatic improvements in employment diversity are confined to only 10% of firms.
We believe that most of the technology industry is stuck in a low-inclusion rut, and a disturbing set of firms are moving backward. However, a handful of firms demonstrate that diversity is possible now.

How to build high-tech tools for low-tech industries,Blanka Szamos,2022/03/3,"
The past two years have provided some extreme dynamics for technology and innovation. Business and industries were shaken up and some were forced to adapt to digitization faster than planned.
2021 was the year to refine goals and adapt to a new reality. However, 2022 has the potential to become a year of even bigger changes.
When experts discuss fast-growing trends in technology, eCommerce is one of the leading examples. No surprise there, we’re talking about an industry with a tremendous growth history. Not to mention its ability to adapt to challenges (and world-wide pandemics) is faster than the wind.
But, instead of rushing to adapt to new technology, some industries are considered late adopters — or so called “laggards” in the technology adoption cycle. These are industries with long histories and a workforce which is often less tech savvy than in emerging industries. While many had been able to resist digital transformation in an ever evolving digital world, the pandemic made it necessary to kick tech adoption into high gear.
There’s now high demand for user-friendly tools that can help less tech savvy users adopt change quickly. But how do you go about designing tech tools for these industries? Can we use the same processes?
We interviewed two entrepreneurs from the latest batch of Techleap.nl’s Rise Program, FeedbackFruits and RoomRaccoon, who are set to shake up the (slightly more traditional and less tech savvy) education and hotel industries with innovative ideas and approaches.
From helping teachers design digital learning experiences to giving small-scale hoteliers a tech boost, here are five things you should know about designing tech tools for late stage adopters.
Speak their language
Education and students were hit hard through the different COVID-19 waves and variants, leading to a rapid and often not fully prepared switch to online education. A McKinsey report expanded on the effect that “unfinished learning” can have on students. It also notes how technology could provide the boost the education system needs to bridge the gap.
FeedbackFruits is on a mission to transform the education system through EdTech. Founder and CEO, Ewoud de Kok, designed tools that are easy to use, and understandable for both teachers and students. For him, having an open mindset to EdTech and new methods, can move the adoption cycle faster.
But how can you help your users develop an open mindset to new tech?
First, as Ewoud explained, you need to make it as close to the user’s current reality as possible.
During FeedbackFruits’ 1.0 version of the product, pedagogy and online education still had a long way to go in technological adoption. Ewoud and his team spent a lot of time and energy to properly understand their users and make adjustments to create a more seamless solution.
An insider-tip he shared was to focus on terminology.
You should invest time into explaining your product using their vocabulary. When it comes to educational institutions, we learned it was best to use terms like “learning objective,” “activity,” or “method,” which are commonly used by educators.
When you design a tool for late stage adopters, simply taking the time to learn how to speak your users’ “language” will make user education and adoption much easier and faster.
What if you’re already on your 2.0 version? Well, take that extra mile to get even closer to your users and design an even better 3.0 version. Optimization is an always-on approach.
Have an outstanding customer service experience
This is strongly connected to the previous point. It seems simple, yet it has a domino effect.
When you keep polishing and tweaking your product, users will have different interaction points with it. Some can adapt to it fast, some can get confused. And when confusion and frustration sets in, this is often the point when less tech savvy users will give up and go back to the old way of doing things.
Remember that your overall user experience is connected to how your users receive help when they feel stuck or have an issue with the experience. Hiring a team of patient, easy to understand customer support professionals (who, again, know how to speak your users’ language) will give late adopters a stronger sense of security when diving into the world of tech. Ewoud explained:
Our support team saved us several times! When you guide your user properly and help with their problems, you create a supporter and a follower.
Motivate the hell out of your users
The hotel industry’s adoption of technology has certainly quickened during the COVID-19 pandemic. This means several businesses had to improve their approach, and rethink their strategy to get the most out of their internal systems, while keeping their guests happy. The demand for new technology in the industry is exceptional. In the past two years, RoomRaccoon grew its team by 210%.
There are so many tech tools being created everyday, but the trick to getting users to choose yours over others is to, not just solve your users problems, but to go beyond by showing them new opportunities and possibilities they may not have thought of before.
Co-founder Tymen van Dyl explained that hoteliers in general are not the most tech-savvy people, and they’re aware of it. Thus, one of the key factors for designing your tool is user experience and motivation.
RoomRaccoon is a platform that helps hotels automatically optimize their rates according to room-sell-probability in real-time. Beyond this, it also offers a solution to automatically upsell room upgrades and extras to guests.
Van Dyl’s team provided an incredible amount of content to help educate users about their tool and new traveltech trends. Their aim is to activate their users, while keeping human interaction alive.
Hoteliers don’t click around that often, so we are putting extra energy into explaining and motivating them to try out new things on our interface. We provide a lot of extra customer and user communication by providing additional content, webinars, and live training.
Localization plays a huge role in this. When you’re active in multiple markets, providing localized content and interface help for your users around the world speeds up the process of trust-building and adaptation.
Be agile and flexible
Always be looking for new opportunities to develop your product and be ready to adapt to new customer pain points.
During the pandemic, the hotel industry faced major changes in dynamics. With travel agencies like Booking.com giving bookers preference when making cancellations, many hoteliers realized just how dependent they were on such agencies.
Challenges like this can be seen as opportunities to re-prioritize. When direct booking became more popular, and the dependency on travel agencies changed, RoomRaccoon’s team introduced Google Hotels integrations, which boomed during the pandemic.
Additionally, gamification became a new trend in customer experience and employee engagement. On the hotel-side, customer support started using gamification to keep employees engaged and motivated by helping them “level up” and gather points for rewards based on their achievements. Meanwhile, gamification provided new ways to engage customers via loyalty programs and reward-systems, giving fast moving brands a competitive edge.
As Van Dyl explained:
You can’t look too much ahead into the future, so be agile and flexible enough based on the market. Keep on communicating with your teams, set your priorities and respond to new events in the industry.
Tech adoption is about enrichment, not replacement
Finally, it’s important to address one of the biggest fears that often hinders tech adoption: the fear of being replaced. During the pandemic, social distancing protocols forced many industries to replace human contact with technology. In the hospitality industry, this meant contactless check-ins.
But, as van Dyl explained, once restrictions were lifted, many hoteliers found that travelers actually wanted to be welcomed by someone at reception — even if they were still using a contactless check-in system. There will always be a need for human interaction. First and foremost, as van Dyl explained, technology should be considered as “enrichment, instead of replacement.”
There you have it, with these five insider tips it’s time to go forth and build your products. All you have to do is listen to the voice of your users, provide outstanding customer experience, motivate like you are reaching for the stars, and be flexible. Keep an eye on what’s happening in the industry and transform it into an opportunity. Finally, don’t forget the human factor. It’s important to stress to your customers, especially late adopters, that technology won’t replace people, it should only enhance your offering.

Why people are leaving your company and how to get them to stay,Ebony-Storm Halladay,2022/02/28,"
When you first heard about The Great Resignation, what did you picture?
Was it an army of white-collar workers hurling their monitors out the window, tearing up contracts and trashing their swivel chairs?
Because the reality is a little less cinematic. People are burned out, miserable, and racking up more hours than ever before. For many, resigning was their last resort.
The Great Resignation concept gets some things right, and many things wrong. Workers are quitting in high numbers, but they’re not all leaving their jobs for the same reason.
Healthcare workers are burned out; exhausted by long hours and limited resources amid the ongoing pandemic. Knowledge workers are sick of spying bosses and shitty progression paths — they’re looking for better opportunities elsewhere.
Both situations suck, but they’re hardly comparable. Is a nurse experiencing the same Great Resignation as a marketing exec at a startup?
Over the course of the pandemic, many of us have restructured our lives, taking advantage of remote working to spend more time with our families, or on our side hustles.
White-collar workers got a taste of what it’s like to be a remote worker. And businesses discovered that work could continue outside the office, something the digital nomads have known for years.
With the perks, came the pitfalls. The toxicity that silently pervaded the office resurfaced remotely. Bosses installed mouse trackers while they lamented the old days of presenteeism. Trust between employers and employees reached an all time low.
So, with worker protections eroded, trust decimated, stagnating wages, and the fear of catching covid ever-present in the workplace, is it really that surprising that people left their jobs?
If The Great Resignation highlighted one thing, it’s this: there’s an overwhelming gap between what employers provide, and what individuals need from work. And bosses need to rethink not just their hiring practices, but their entire company culture to accommodate the transition.
We spoke with two recent cohorts of Techleap’s Rise Programme for fast-growing scaleups to find out more. As experts in the HRTech-recruitment space, they’ve seen the pitfalls and best practices when it comes to recruiting and retaining talent during these uncertain times.
Respect the shift
There are certain benefits workers will want to hold onto post-covid, like flexible hours and remote working. Other parts, like cramming a monitor into their box-sized home office and working 25% longer each week, need to stop.
To close The Great Resignation gap, employers have to respect how work has transformed in the eyes of their teams.
Niels Arntz, cofounder of gig platform Temper, which connects independent workers to shifts in their area, has seen firsthand how both colleagues at HQ and platform users are engaging with the new world of work.
“The years dominated by the pandemic have stimulated awareness,” Niels told me. “People are realizing it’s actually quite nice to have freedom and flexibility during the work week. People had the chance to explore meaningful questions too, like: Is my work important? Does my manager trust me?”
According to a report by McKinsey, 52% of workers want flexible working options post-pandemic. Before the pandemic, only 30% of workers did.
If you want to attract and retain people, you can’t throw down an Uno reverse card and demand that people work the way that they did before. There’s no going back, baby.
Talk to your staff about the parts of pandemic working that work, and the stuff they don’t like so much. Then build your policies and benefits package based on their ideas.
What’s more, you might not even need to hire anyone at all. There are plenty of experienced freelancers (or FreeFlexers, as the Temper team calls them) out there to help you plug the gaps in your team. A roster of reliable independent workers might even be preferential — you won’t need to add anyone to payroll, just pull in a contractor when you need an extra pair of hands.
Capitalize on ‘raw’ talent
Do you really need a world-leading software designer, or is that your ego speaking? Companies struggling to hire would do well to capitalize on raw talent. Instead of pitching for the people everyone else fights for, seek out skilled recruits from parallel industries.
Otto Verhage is chief of operations at TestGorilla, a pre-employment testing platform that champions candidate experience. He sees first-hand how employers unintentionally create obstacles for great candidates.
“Businesses tend to hire purely based on experience. Employers should look to identify talent where others don’t. They’ll have a better chance of finding someone because there’s less competition.”
The strategy is tried and tested (pun intended) at TestGorilla. Otto mentions that employees don’t need industry experience to secure a role at the company.
“We let everyone apply to our jobs, irrespective of their background. Our skill assessments identify promising candidates that we may not consider if we just use CVs. They open our eyes to diverse candidates.”
Niels also emphasises the benefits of a skills-oriented approach. “When I picture the future of work, I imagine a labor market that’s accessible to everyone. Covid has shown us the importance of flexibility. Let’s embrace it, and empower more people with opportunities.”
In which case, maybe it’s time to stop requesting 10 years of experience for a junior developer role. Be real, pal.
Make every day a learning day
In the UK, 43% of adults jumped on the lockdown learning bandwagon. People are continually seeking out opportunities to test their squiggly little skull organ. Employers that are proactive will get one step ahead of the game and start providing these options themselves.
And when businesses deliver on L&D, they can hire less experienced folks and make them brilliant. People are clearly willing to learn. You just need to give them the opportunity.
According to Otto, “when employers seek candidates outside of their usual scope, they have a better chance of hiring someone. But if you want to turn a maths teacher into a data scientist, there’s quite a lot you’ll need to teach them.”
Businesses that make learning and development an integral part of their offering can also boost retention. According to Gallup’s American Upskilling study, 61% of US workers consider upskilling opportunities as an important reason to stay at their job.
If you’re using a platform like Temper to find experienced independent workers, make sure you’re also including them into the learning opportunities you provide for full-timers.
Although they’re growing in number, freelance and flex workers often get forgotten when it comes to company perks, so it makes a huge difference when employers are willing to provide that for them. But keeping these workers engaged and taking the time to train them in how your business operates can ensure you have a skilled pool of temporary workers to call on when needed.
According to Otto, “The speed of technological development and labor market shifts mean people have to learn all the time. The pandemic created the urgency to keep learning to stay relevant.”
Take it back to basic (needs)
In a sea of employee stocks, stationary stipends, and flexible Fridays, basic employee needs get lost.
Sometimes you just want to hear “great presentation!” or “well done for figuring out how to remove the potato filter!” A little bit of praise goes a long way.
Otto identified this with one of TestGorilla’s pre-employment tools. The platform provides candidates and businesses with a motivation test that assesses if the job matches what the candidate is looking for. They also have a separate test to assess culture add which measures value alignment.
“We know for a fact there’s a list of about 10 job characteristics that are incredibly important to candidates. Things like: Do I have enough autonomy in my job? Do I get enough recognition? Can I work on something end to end? Those things are super important.”
Until employers can meet those basic human needs, they probably shouldn’t aim for the bells and whistles anyway. It’s time to get real about what you want and need from candidates.
While you’re at it, don’t fish from the same talent pool as everyone else. Don’t write off raw talent if they have transferable skills. And for crying out loud — do not list Zoom socials as a perk of the job.

"People no longer accept shitty jobs, and it’s fuelling the Great Resignation",The Conversation,2022/01/20,"
“Do what you love,” is no longer just advice.
High school students learn early on that their future careers should be passion-driven. Self-help books counsel job searchers to start with reflection on what they love. And Hollywood films teach people, in romantic fashion, to aspire to work that is intrinsically satisfying and expresses our authentic selves.
Researchers call this way of thinking about work the passion paradigm, and studies show it has become pervasive in modern societies.
The passion paradigm emerged in the 1960s. During this time, there was widespread questioning of social and cultural norms — especially among youth — which helped develop a new way of thinking about the role of work in human life.
This trend was spearheaded by the scholarship of humanistic psychologist Abraham Maslow, who applied his theory of the “hierarchy of needs” to the modern workplace. In Eupsychian Management, Maslow argues that work should be thought of as a key source of personal growth and self-actualization.
Maslow envisioned a world where individuals derive deep satisfaction from their working lives, and who treat their work as a sacred activity.
Since early 2021, I have conducted interviews with over 90 professionals and managers in Toronto, to learn how they think about work. Although there are exceptions, what the data shows, in general, is that Maslow’s theory has increasingly become common.
The downsides of the passion paradigm
Because the rising popularity of the passion paradigm has coincided with both increasing economic inequality and a steep decline in the power of unions, it has attracted a host of criticism.
Sociologist Lindsay DePalma contends that the passion paradigm encourages workers to romanticize their work while blinding them to the unequal distributions of power that characterize their working lives.
In her book Work Won’t Love You Back, journalist Sarah Jaffe argues that loving your job is a bad idea because it is a recipe for (self)exploitation.
Derek Thompson, a staff writer at The Atlantic, maintains that the passion paradigm has fuelled a new religion — “workism” — which is responsible for causing burnout and depression even among high-wage earners.

It’s not just managers who take part in the Great Resignation.

These commentators rightly fear that the passion paradigm can (and does) lead workers to accept harmful working conditions, poor treatment from their employers, and unrealistic expectations from themselves — basically to put up with what they shouldn’t.
When people aspire to love their work, they may prioritize work at the expense of other important aspects of life — family, friends, and hobbies. An overvaluation of work can lead people to see those who cannot work as lazy, stupid, or undeserving of concern.
And yet, despite these evident pitfalls, the passion paradigm can also have the opposite effects. In fact, I would argue that it is one cause of what has been dubbed the “Great Resignation.”
The Great Resignation
In August 2021, 4.3 million American workers quit their jobs, the highest ever recorded. And similar waves have hit the U.K.
In Canada, it’s not clear whether the Great Resignation is taking place with equal intensity, but some studies show that Canadian workers are increasingly considering leaving or switching jobs.
There are many factors causing the Great Resignation. Among the most notable are wage subsidies which have given workers more freedom to choose the kind of work they want to do, the added work stress caused by the pandemic, the need to stay home with young children, and the shift to remote work.
However, I think another reason has to do with the expectations workers have around work — expectations that derive from the passion paradigm.
The passion paradigm and the Great Resignation
By disrupting people’s routines, the pandemic has reawakened in many the deep-seated desire for a job they actually enjoy — a desire that has long been suppressed.
My interviews make it clear that many Canadian workers are looking at their jobs and asking themselves, “Is this really what I’m passionate about?” “Do I want to spend the majority of my waking hours doing this?” “Does my job bring me meaning?”
And this isn’t just managers. The highest number of resignations in Canada have taken place within the accommodation and foodservice industries. And as a recent article in The Atlantic put it, “this level of quitting is really an expression of optimism that says, ‘We can do better.’”
In a sense, the passion paradigm is paradoxically fuelling the demand for better, more satisfying, and more meaningful work. It is because workers expect more that they are no longer willing to put up with the status quo.
The passion paradigm requires a strong safety net
Of course, none of this could have happened without the government supports that reweighed the balance of power between workers and bosses.
Since the 1980s, workers have had less and less power to negotiate. So, while the passion paradigm may have grown in popularity, it grew in economic conditions that were largely determined by employers, not employees.
But in the wake of the pandemic, this has slowly begun to change. Faced with labor shortages, employers are forced to take workers seriously when it comes to demands around pay, flexibility, autonomy, and scheduling. They are receiving the message that “business as usual” is no longer acceptable — and, in some cases, they’re caving.
The crucial takeaway is that the passion paradigm can fuel demands for better, more meaningful work, but this is only possible when it’s accompanied by a strong social safety net.
Workers don’t need to stop loving their jobs. But they should ask whether their jobs are themselves loveable. And this is easier to do when you have real economic freedom.

Northern Europe’s founders lack ambition — here’s what we should do,Alejandro Tauber,2022/01/18,"
All in all, 2021 has been a great year for European unicorn creation with some media speaking of a ‘European unicorn boom’. To date, more than 70 European private companies have boasted a $1 billion plus valuation, bringing the total number of unicorns produced since 1990 to 296, slightly more than China.
But there’s still a long way to go. While Europe may be pulling ahead of China in terms of fresh unicorns, the US managed to mint 184 in the first eight months of 2021, with more on the way in the months after.
What’s one thing that could hold Europe back from competing in the unicorn market? A lack of ambition.
A recent report by Techleap.nl, a Dutch organization that strives to build a “thriving Dutch startup ecosystem,” and the University of Utrecht, found a startling paradox. Using data collected by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, they concluded that while the country has a high number of entrepreneurs, few have ambitions to grow their business on a larger scale.
The researchers behind the report posit:
Is the Dutch culture of ‘just act normal, that is crazy enough as it is’ limiting us? The Netherlands has become one of the best startup ecosystems in the world, but few startups transform into scaleups and unicorns.
“Ambition is something the country is going to have to attack if the goal is to grow more unicorns,” said Joe Wilson, a US native and CEO of Dutch company Risenu. He’s now one of Techleap.nl’s entrepreneurs in residence, providing mentoring for the organization’s Rise program cohorts.
Being from a country where ambitious (and at times cocky) founder personalities are the norm, Wilson provides a unique perspective on the very different Dutch ecosystem. He shares a story a Dutch scaleup founder shared with him that illustrates the problem with ambition in The Netherlands.
If you open one pizza shop, everybody in the room is excited. They’re like, ‘wow, that’s so great. Nice job.’ You open two pizza shops, and they’re like, ‘you’re doing so well. We’re so proud of you.’ You open three pizza shops, and they’re like, ‘why are you so fucking greedy?’
This isn’t a purely Dutch problem either. His Danish counterpart Nicolaj Christensen, Director of Digital Operations at Digital Hub Denmark, agrees, “that mindset shift is something that we’ve been struggling with.”
So how can we solve this success complex? The three gentlemen have some ideas.
Mentorship from previously successful startup founders
Maturity of the ecosystem is something all three national startup cheerleaders mention as part of the cause for the recent success of Europe. What this meant was unclear to me, until Christensen put it in very simple terms.
You had the first generation of founders who had to leave Denmark and go to the US to build their startup, companies like Unity and JustEat. They went abroad, made it big, and have these massive success stories. Then they came back home, reinvested their money but, more importantly, they also reinvested their knowledge. This helped reinvigorate the whole ecosystem.
Now we’re also seeing a second wave of founders doing the same thing. They’re CEOs who are still operational, still building, but they’re also taking the time out to go help the next generation of founders.
This reflects some pretty decent academic research, which concludes that knowledge imparted by investors, advisors, other entrepreneurs, and, in particular, corporate venture funds, are more important than the money they bring into the company due to the operational value they add. And the inspiration, of course.
Wilson sees this in the Dutch ecosystem as well:
I think the money is almost less important than these CEOs sharing their experience. Every time we have one of these guys talk at Techleap.nl, everybody’s eyes light up with the possibility that there isn’t a ceiling for success. Every time a great technical Dutch company breaks through, it’s a sign that it can be done.
He continues, “the key is that we recognize and shine the light on those people who are willing to take a chance, who are willing to show their ambition. We should celebrate ambition rather than criticizing it.”
Good education
This feeling can be even stronger when a founder’s personal proximity to a fellow founder who reached unicorn status is smaller – like if they went to the same university.
Both Wilson and Christensen share the view that a strong academic foundation breeds more innovative companies with huge potential.
“I think there’s a real specialty in the Netherlands around deeptech, like biotech. And your love of academia does create pockets of super cool developments. There’s plenty of cool shit being created in this country. I think the ideation to MVP is probably per capita one of the best in the world,” Wilson gushes, while also raising two big issues.
The first is that connecting the initial innovation to a successful business model doesn’t always happen as smoothly as it could. And second, there are just not enough students enrolling in areas with high unicorn-potential.
As Christensen puts it:
Talent, talent, talent, right? When we talk to the startups and scaleups and ask them what is really hindering their growth right now, it’s the lack of talent.
There’s no such thing as doing too much in this space, because the demand here is so big, and it’s only going to get bigger. It’s hindering companies’ growth today, will continue tomorrow, and become even bigger in the future. So we can never do ‘too much’ in terms of talent attraction and education.
Take a global perspective as soon as possible
Christensen thinks that part of the success of Denmark’s ecosystem is thanks to ambitious startups being forced to quickly take a more global outlook. “You need to go wherever it suits your business model,” he says. “That could be the Nordics, UK, or Germany, depending on your market. We could still be better at that. We can still go abroad much, much earlier.”
When it comes to The Netherlands, Wilson says, “I really believe that the Dutch have this great ability to start interesting things, but for some reason they don’t try to explode their business across the planet.”
Red tape might be one reason startups don’t more readily expand abroad. Multiple startup organizations mention that startups sometimes skip over expansion in Europe to move to the US, simply because complying with regulations in 27 different countries is way more of a hassle.
While this might sound like a nightmare, Wilson actually sees this as an opportunity.
“So I mentioned ChannelEngine, they wanted to run a European business first. There are different rules and languages in each country, and they just went out and mastered those. Then, when they wanted to expand to South America, the US, and Australia, they already had structures in place to learn and adapt to different cultures, regulations, and languages.”
But you don’t have to go so far away to make it big, he adds. “I do think there is a growing number of companies that believe you can make a unicorn in Europe, and you don’t have to go to the US. We’ve seen Polish companies who created a unicorn just in the domestic market.”
This is what I imagine the EU is aiming for with the newly announced Startup Nations Standard, a set of practices to create a “growth friendly environment,” which includes a bunch of things from this article as well. But also some points we have not touched on, like equity.
Stocks for everyone!
Both the German and Danish startup reps wouldn’t touch this policy detail on the record, but in most European countries it’s basically bad news to give your employees stock. Options or actual stock are treated as possessions by tax authorities, even though the valuation of the stock is completely virtual and the ‘possession’ is totally illiquid. Which in turn might limit the ambitions of both startup founders, and early employees who could be the driving force for more ambitious outlooks.
Wilson would go on the record saying that this awkward equity taxation, “reverts the compensation systems in the company to being about the salary as opposed to about the shared vision and contribution goal. So you don’t get to promote your belief system quite as strongly as when employees directly benefit from increased valuations.”
Although it does seem some countries, like The Netherlands, are taking a closer look at the current tax policy, it could still be a long time before European unicorns actually mint a bunch of new millionaires – who can then go on and invest their money and knowledge into new startups, creating a flywheel effect.
The Startup Nation Standard does seem like a well thought out document that addresses many of the issues reflected in this article, if adopted by enough European countries.
And maybe, considering Europe’s unicorn growth rate, we’re doing somewhat great already? Ugh, I’m so Dutch I can’t even say it without the question mark.

3 mindset shifts your bank needs for a successful digital transformation,Jamie Tolentino,2022/01/17,"
In a previous article, we discussed how a whopping 78% of enterprises fail on their digital transformation initiatives and that banks experience specific issues like legacy processes, tightly coupled technical systems, failure of innovation labs, lack of proper incentives for being risk-savvy, and underestimation of the scope of change.
There’s so much information out there about creating the right strategies and processes to tackle digital transformation, but what’s often overlooked is the mindset shift that needs to occur to actually make real change happen. The ‘why’ behind all the time, effort, and resources you’ll put towards this needs to be clear or, even the most comprehensive plan will fizzle out and die.
And it can’t just be the senior level, every change agent within your organization needs to understand why the changes you’re making are essential today and not ‘after’ or ‘tomorrow.’
Nick Van Weerdenburg, CEO of Rangle.io, says that, “Digital cannot be developed from the margins as adjacent to the core business. It must become the core business. We’ve seen this scenario play out dozens of times over the years”.
When organizations fail to see meaningful results from their digital investments, it’s often because of a reluctance to change what’s working now, and this usually includes their core business model.
A common but unsuccessful strategy involves implementing ad hoc digital initiatives and side projects that are intentionally kept at arms’ length from the core business. While initially appearing successful, these initiatives ultimately fail once the business attempts to integrate with the existing operating model.
Digital transformation cannot be solved by simply throwing more money or people at the problem. Copying what other businesses do is also prone to failure because your organization’s context is unique, even if it looks similar on the surface. Fundamentally, business leaders must be able to articulate why the business needs to change and what the future of the organization looks like, and this requires a major mindset shift.
Digital has radically changed the nature of the banking game, and there are three important themes to take into account.
Customer experience is significantly different in a digital world
With the emergence of neobanks and fintechs, consumers now know that financial services can exist as a purely digital service. As a result, people in all age groups prefer digital banking over in-person. Almost 80% want to manage some or all their finances digitally, and more than half use digital banking once a week or more. Furthermore, 32% of customers are more likely to change banks if they encounter technical issues when banking online.
This change in consumer expectations is likely brought on by increased digital usage since 73% of customers say that one extraordinary experience can raise their expectations of other companies. Regardless of the catalyst, 75% of consumers now expect companies to use new technologies to create better experiences.
But it’s not just competition from other banks that we need to be worried about. Previously, customers would compare the digital experience of one bank to another bank, but now they compare digital experiences across all industries, making the competition even more fierce.
Essentially, the customer experience is now defined by every experience in your customers’ ‘digital-everything’ ecosystem, rather than just rivals in your area or industry. This is important because 39% of dissatisfied users say that they can’t accomplish everything they intend to in digital channels, indicating that customer expectations regarding digital interactions and services have changed. This results in a lot of pressure for companies to continuously improve and modernize the entire customer experience from end-to-end, making it fast, personalized, and evolvable.
We need to embrace the notion that a world class digital customer experience is not just a nice to have, it’s essential for survival.
The fourth industrial revolution will significantly alter the world
In the past, industrial revolutions have significantly altered life as people knew it. The first used water and steam power to mechanize production, the second harnessed electric power for mass production and the third utilized electronics and information technology to automate production.
Klaus Schwab, author of The Fourth Industrial Revolution, claims that the current revolution we’re experiencing will fundamentally, “alter the way we live, work, and relate to one another. In its scale, scope, and complexity, the transformation will be unlike anything humankind has experienced before.”
The fourth revolution builds on the third digital revolution, this time characterized by a fusion of technologies which blur lines between physical, digital, and biological spheres. The Fourth is distinct from previous revolutions because it is evolving at an exponential (versus linear) pace and disrupting almost every industry, in every country. The Fourth’s breadth and depth has the capacity to transform entire systems of production, management, and governance.
Current innovations brought by the third digital revolution like processing power, storage capacity, and access to knowledge will reach almost unlimited levels, while new emergent technologies like artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, and quantum computing will experience breakthroughs in the Fourth.
For example, artificial intelligence is already pervasive in our daily lives in the form of self-driving cars, drones, virtual assistants, and translation software driven by an exponential increase in computing power and big data processing. Consequently, 62% of customers are open to the use of AI to improve experiences – up from 59% in 2018.
For businesses, this means that new technologies will create completely novel ways of serving existing needs and significantly disrupt existing industry value chains. Those that are slow to adopt this new technology will therefore fall behind fast, meanwhile early adopters could gain a competitive advantage.
Banks will also have to keep up with evolving consumer expectations as physical products and services can now be enhanced with digital capabilities.
Divided, hierarchical organizations aren’t fit for the digital age
The divided and hierarchical organizational structure is no longer fit for purpose when applied in unstable and uncertain contexts, like the digital world and the Fourth industrial revolution, where value is generated through an unpredictable innovation process.
Instead, an adaptive environment is needed where employees feel safe to ask questions, experiment, and apply divergent thinking in order to discover the right solutions for the challenge at hand.
The divided hierarchy, where work is divided and distributed into various zones performing highly specific and well-defined tasks worked well for stable environments like manufacturing, because the work is often routine, repetitive, and knowable. Dividing up the tasks created value because the process maximized efficiency and enabled scale. However, most of the work involved in digital transformation is neither routine, repetitive, or knowable so a different process is needed.
The new organizational structure needs to enable high-quality information flow, cross-functional collaboration, and daily learning. For example, measures can be taken to foster psychological safety, the ability to show and employ one’s self without fear of negative consequences of self-image, status, or career in the workplace. Leaders can frame work as a learning rather than an execution problem, acknowledge their own fallibility, and model curiosity by asking lots of questions.
Divergent thinking, the ability to generate new ideas, can also be practiced more effectively if separated and practiced in a different setting where convergent thinking, the process of thinking about what to do with those ideas, occurs.
Anne Manning states that divergent thinking is akin to reaching up while convergent thinking is akin to reaching down. If you try to do both at the same time, you will end up not doing either, so it’s best to do both actions in separate instances.
Start with why
There are a number of challenges financial institutions need to overcome to get on track with their digital transformation. But Bertrand Karerangabo, Chief Strategy Officer at Rangle.io believes that, “transformation is achievable — in every organization, and within every department and line of business.”
However, it will require, not just new policies, but a shift in mindset and culture. The first thing that needs to be clear for everyone, from the executive level to the newest hire, isn’t how this change will happen but why change is essential and what factors are driving it.

Entrepreneurs! Your social networks should be small and curated,The Conversation,2022/01/10,"
Bigger is always better. Many of us think this is true when it comes to building our online networks of social media friends, connections and followers. But new research suggests the opposite may be closer to the truth: curating small networks of trusted connections may be smarter in the long run. While this may seem counterintuitive, it also comes with a caveat.
We often feel compelled and are even encouraged by social media platforms, to grow our networks. Consider all the prompts about “someone else you might know” and “who to follow.” We all want the sociometrics (that number of friends or followers posted in the corner of your profile) to look good.
Offline and online social networks
Both offline and online, our social networks can function as either prisms or pipes.
As prisms, they broadcast to others our likes, dislikes, opinions, interests, activities, and more. They signal who we are, or want to be, to our network of social connections.
As pipes, they act as conduits through which help and resources can flow. Using our networks as pipes is an important part of how we build relationships. We give and receive advice, advocacy, endorsement, emotional support, and tangible things (like entrepreneurs do, for example).
Studies of face-to-face networks have generally shown that, whether we use our networks as prisms or pipes, bigger is better.
But what about online?
We flock to social media networks like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram because it’s easy to view, share and store our connections, allowing us to communicate with them whenever we want. That’s what makes connecting online and offline so different. We can’t search and find a comment we made six days ago to a friend over coffee. We can, however, find and reshare a conversation we had with our Facebook “friends” three years ago. It turns out that’s a really important distinction.
It’s when we use our online networks as pipes, not prisms, that small matters and seems to be valuable. In a recent study of Canadian entrepreneurs, our team of researchers uncovered this counterintuitive point and shed light on the reasons why.
We think it suggests some broader insights.
Using our online networks
For people to actually use their online networks as pipes for resources and support, three things need to come together. First, we need to believe we have the ability to ask for or give a resource or support (termed exchange). Second, we need to have a way to actually make the exchange happen. And finally, we need to want to conduct the exchange.
All those digital viewing, scanning, sharing, searching and storing capabilities of our social media networks make it really easy for us to believe we have the ability and arrangements to use our networks as pipes. I can quickly and easily ask my online network for something I need and get a quick response. But our research suggests that we don’t always have the willingness to ask.
Through interviews with entrepreneurs, we uncovered that the reason is likely that people are really worried about what others will think. This perceived social judgment risk can get in the way of entrepreneurs getting helpful resources from their online networks. We suspect it’s not just entrepreneurs who are worried about this. That’s because perceived social judgment risk is a product of audience collapse, which reduces our willingness to reach out online.
Audience collapse happens when we add people to our online networks from all aspects of our lives. These might be people we know well and people we barely know; personal connections, work acquaintances, volunteer connections, hometown connections and those with shared interests and hobbies.
By building these varied and oversized networks, and inviting so many different people to join, our willingness to ask for help goes down. With all that searching, viewing and sharing, who knows where our request might land?
Our research reveals that many of us likely perceive a lot of social judgment risk in asking for anything but information from our online networks. We are worried that others will judge our asks as weak, needy, unsure, confused, too personal or otherwise inappropriate, making us less willing to seek help. This dark side implication of bigger is better social media networking is rarely discussed.
If this resonates, what can you do?
To make our social media networks useful as pipes, we suggest creating trust networks. These are purpose-built to stay small — yes, small. Only add people who will support, not negatively judge, and help you  — these are the people you trust.
A trust network is likely to be very high in reciprocity, or the giving and getting of help, because all members feel it is a safe place to ask for and give help. It becomes a really useful pipe network where small, not big, is valuable.
So, if you want to use your online networks as a prism to signal things to the world — stay big. But if you want to give and get help, then create a purpose-built, small trust network on social media. We think you’ll be glad you did.

Your brand needs a Discord community — here’s how to build it,Zapier,2022/01/8,"
My main gig is writing marketing content, but I also wear lots of hats for an independent media criticism site called Unwinnable. I’ve been managing their social media, writing articles for them, and serving as an editor for five years now.
At Unwinnable, we use a classic-turned-modern publishing model. We have online articles, but our main operation is our magazine: a monthly PDF that you subscribe to like a print magazine. So we’re always looking for ways to make our subscribers’ experience better.
Earlier this year, we revamped our subscriber Discord server into a proper community, and I learned a lot working with the Unwinnable team to engage subscribers this way. I’d like to share what I learned—so here’s how you can create a Discord community for your brand.
Decide if Discord is right for your brand
Before you invest time and resources into a Discord community, make sure it’ll be a good fit for your brand. Here are some factors that affect how well Discord could work for your community versus a platform like Slack:
Your industry. Discord tends to suit B2C businesses better than B2B since it’s a casual platform originally meant for gamers.
Audience interests. Age and buyer behavior will affect your audience’s interest in using Discord. Younger, “geeky” audiences tend to use Discord more than older, less tech-familiar groups.
Funnel stage. Discord works well for customers near the bottom of the marketing funnel: people who already know your organization and product.
Message archiving. If you plan on including a knowledge base in your community, Discord lets you search all of your server’s previous messages regardless of how many you have. (Slack limits the number of previous messages that free users can see.)
Audio and video capabilities. Discord’s signature feature is its voice and video chatting, which could serve some communities better than others.
Threading capabilities. Discord has a thread feature, but those threads eventually archive themselves. You’ll need to use Slack for permanent threads.
NFT/crypto support. Discord recently considered adding NFT and cryptocurrency features, which could be positive or negative, depending on your stance.
At Unwinnable, we originally had a Slack community for subscribers, but we switched to Discord because it would more likely be in regular use for our audience, lots of whom are gamers.
Set goals
Before you build your community, give it goals that will guide your community design and moderation. Some popular goals for brand community Discords include:

Connecting your customers
Sharing brand updates
Humanizing your business through a community
Building customer loyalty
Sharing tutorials and offering support for your product
Creating an exclusive community for customers or supporters

Unwinnable uses Discord for the last goal: offering a community as a perk for people who subscribe to the magazine. It doubles as a selling point for potential subscribers and a reason for current subscribers to stick around.
You’ll notice that most of the reasons I listed here aren’t related to direct selling—they’re about building trust with customers.
Create your server and channels
With your goals in mind, you can now create your server and its channels.
To start a new Discord server, click the plus sign beneath your server icons on the left side of your screen.

From there, you can create a server from scratch or choose a template. The templates give you a list of channels to start with that you can edit however you like.

After you choose a template, Discord will ask if your server will be for a club or community or a private group. Discord isn’t very clear about how this question affects your server, so choose the community option or skip it.

Now, for the most important part: your server name and icon. Choose a name that includes your business name and an icon that matches your other brand assets, such as a logo.

Congrats! You have a Discord server. Time to add channels.
Think of your Discord server’s channels as different places to talk about specific topics. You’ll see them to the left of your server’s messages.

Text channels let you communicate with text and photos like other messaging apps. Voice channels allow the people who enter it to talk over voice and video.
Make sure your channels tie back to the goals you set for your community. For example, if you want to build a community for your customers, you could make channels based on everyday discussion topics like pets or TV. Or maybe you want to share brand updates—make sure to give them a dedicated channel.
Since Unwinnable is a pop culture criticism site, most of our Discord discussions happen in channels dedicated to mediums like TV and games. Think about the topics you want your community members to talk about, and make channels that match.
Depending on your objectives, you can make your server a Community server with added promotion features and analytics. If you want to keep your server small and exclusive like Unwinnable, though, you might be better off with a normal server. And you can always start as a normal server and switch to community features once you get the hang of Discord.
Set rules and roles
Community servers have built-in rules pages that members have to read and approve before posting. Your server’s rules should help you facilitate healthy discussions and create a safe space.
Here’s what the Unwinnable Discord community’s rules look like:
Credit: Melissa King / ZapierUnwinnable’s community rules (click for full-size image)
As you can see, they don’t have to be super long to do the job. Find more rule inspiration in Discord’s moderation guide and this quick guide on GitHub (shout out to Unwinnable’s editor-in-chief, David Shimomura, for writing these rules for me to post).
Once you’ve taken care of the rules, it’s time to create Discord roles for your community members. Roles determine a member’s admin permissions, accessible channels, name color, and appearance on your server’s Online list. This Discord support article explains how role hierarchies and permissions work in detail, and it’s worth checking out as you’re getting started.
If you have a normal Discord server, you can use an automation tool like Zapier to automatically assign a role that grants access to your channels after someone reacts to your rules. Zapier can also help you set roles based on members’ interactions with other platforms to give them access to channels relevant to their interests.
Promote your server
Now that your server is ready to go, it’s time to promote it in places where potential community members will see it. If you keep your community open to the public, use your invite link to its fullest potential. To find your Discord invite link, click the arrow next to your server name in the upper-right corner, and select Invite People.

From there, you can share it anywhere potential members will see, including social media, email newsletters, and your website. Anyone who clicks on your link will be prompted to join your Discord community.
Since the Unwinnable server is aimed at subscribers, we share a link to it in every issue release email and advertise it as a perk for subscribers on the site’s subscription page.

Don’t underestimate the power of consistent reminders. Recently, a newer member of the Unwinnable Discord community said they just remembered we had a server. I asked them what reminded them, and they told me the big red “Join us on Discord!” button in their issue release email did the trick.
Nurture your community
A Discord server is an ongoing investment. You’ll need to stay involved in your community to keep it growing.
Assign moderators or administrators to handle any issues in your community or help members with Discord features. When your community is small, you don’t have to hire a dedicated community manager, but as it grows, you might consider moderators.
And just like in real life, you can’t expect a conversation in Discord without contributing to it. Ask your team members to take part in community discussions. You don’t always have to have profound things to say. Just have fun, like I did sharing this tweet of the Boss Baby at the Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade:

Once you get a good base of people talking in your Discord community, try running events like giveaways, polls, or get-togethers. You can schedule an event in one of your text or voice channels by clicking the arrow next to your server name and choosing Create Event.
Zapier can also take some of the load off when you’re growing a Discord community. Try connecting it to your blog or shop to send a message automatically when you have a new blog post or product. You can also have Zapier automatically greet new community members when they join.
Revise as needed
After you set up your Discord community, don’t be afraid to make changes based on member activity and server analytics. If a channel isn’t getting much activity, consider deleting or changing it. Add or modify your server rules as needed to keep your community members happy and safe.
Just make sure to update everyone whenever you adjust something. Make an announcements channel at the top of your channel list, and tag everyone when you announce a change.

When I build a chair, I almost always make the same mistake. While I’m working on it, I tell myself: “This is just a trial run, and once I really understand the process, I’ll make another one, and it will be perfect.” But then I never build another one, and I’m stuck with the first version of my chair.
The first time you assemble an Ikea closet, it all fits snugly. But if a few years later, you need to disassemble and then re-assemble the closet, you’ll never get it back together as solidly as the first time.
Now imagine needing an operation, and the hospital gives you a choice between two surgeons. One is young, and the older is old. Which one do you pick? The older one might have more experience, but she also might be tired of her job and behind on newer techniques. On the other hand, the younger one might miss experience but looks at things with a fresh perspective and is still eager to learn and do a great job.
I can’t seem to figure this out. I like working with people with experience, but there’s a lot to be said for youthful exuberance. Some things get better when you do them a lot. And with other projects, you better give it your all the first time because there’s unlikely to be another.
So ideally, you find a surgeon who has the experience but still exhibits the excitement and energy of a young surgeon. And you never take apart that Ikea closet. And every time I’m building a chair, I should treat it as a one-off project from the start. 
But the cold, harsh reality is that you rarely get to pick your surgeon. And when you move to your new apartment, you probably just buy a whole new IKEA closet to save yourself the hassle.
When working with teams in companies, this is yet another argument for diversity. Find people from different backgrounds and skillsets so one person’s experience can be combined with another person’s exuberance.

Instagram carousels should be the center of your 2022 social media strategy,Elena Cucu,2022/01/5,"
Brands are investing a lot of time and money in promoting themselves online, and with this many resources put into it, you gotta make sure the results are paying off.
Now, among all the social platforms out there, there’s one that rules them all when it comes to engagement, and that’s the almighty Instagram.
And because of such a huge interest, the team from Socialinsider, together with Sked Social, conducted an Instagram engagement study, by analyzing 102 million posts, where they compared Instagram’s engagement in 2021 and its values in 2022.
By examining 2021’s trends for Instagram marketing, social media managers can predict what type of content will perform best in 2022 and adapt their strategies accordingly. We have to remember data never lies and it’s any digital marketer’s most important ally.
Apparently, these days Instagram’s engagement tendency is to decrease, for now having an average of 2.02%, going back to its values from 2019.
There were plenty of changes along the way, but with all these ups and downs, you gotta make sure your social media strategy is aligned with the trends to generate the effects you want.
So, here are five reasons to use carousels (and how) to maximize your social media efforts on Instagram, according to the study’s findings.
1. Carousels lead to a higher average engagement rate
When it comes to top-performing posts on Instagram, things aren’t as easy as they may seem, because actually, best practices will be considered depending on the account’s size.
To all Instagram marketers, this is something you should know:

Profiles under 5K have the potential of reaching an average engagement rate of 4.90% when choosing to post more carousels
In the case of medium-sized accounts (between 10K-100K followers) the best option for higher engagement rates is video, with values up to 2.90%
Large accounts (with more than 100K followers) will benefit more from using carousels


2. Using more carousels can help you increase your engagement per impression rate and make you gain more likes
The carousel post wins when it comes to engagement per impression across all profile sizes. This can actually reveal one of Instagram’s strategies, of pushing this type of content into the user’s feeds more.
With this in mind, think about prioritizing this type of content when choosing what to boost on Instagram.

Among the many benefits of choosing to place your bet on carousels is that this kind of post is the one that increases the median number of likes on Instagram.

3. Carousels lead to more comments on Instagram
Having an audience that presents interest in your topics, that’s open to communication and shows involvement is every brand’s dream and every social media manager’s objective.
But this ain’t an easy job, so, just in case you need a bit of help, check out these insights meant to give you a hand to improve your strategy:

For an account under 10K followers choose to post a carousel
In the case of medium-sized accounts (10K-50K), a mix between carousels and videos is the magic combo
When it comes to accounts between 50K-100K, it would be preferable to start pushing videos more
For large accounts (up to 50K followers), an approach of relying more on videos is what you should take into consideration


4. Carousels are more likely to be saved by Instagram users
Depending on your business objectives, there may be better to choose one type of post format to make your followers do what you want.
Let’s talk about generating more saves, for example. In order for you to get as close as possible to this objective, when creating your social media strategy you should consider using more carousels because this is what triggers people to press that save button most of the time.
But of course, there are some exceptions, large profiles (those with more than 100K followers) being the ones here. In this case, relying more on images would be a wiser choice.

5. Carousels increase the chances of a higher reach rate
Each type of post has its advantages and possible gains for your business, so what’s left to be done is to establish your goals and start working towards them, with the right tactics and actions.
Among the multiple benefits of integrating carousels more into your content calendar is that they also generate twice higher reach rates than videos, at least in the case of small profiles (under 5K).
The highest reach rates for carousels are 1.27% for small accounts, but also for middle-sized accounts (1.20%), those between 50K-100K followers.

TIP: Embrace captions with a maximum length of ten words for amplified results
When it comes to the optimal caption length of a post, there are a lot of good debates. But let’s not forget there’s strength in numbers, so data is the most trustworthy source.
What the analysis of 102 million posts showed is that captions of up to 10 words, combined with carousels are users’ favorite type of content to interact with. And that driving away from this formula proved to cause a decrease in engagement with about 0.70%.
Still, for those cases in which you consider a longer copy is needed, to properly deliver your message to your audience, you should take into consideration this formula: pair captions longer than 30 words with videos.

Conclusion
Now, with Instagram being the platform that has won people’s hearts, a closer analysis of what works and what it doesn’t is a gold mine.
Instagram’s engagement can go on mysterious roads, but the good thing is that data helps you be prepared and adapt to whatever may come.
Seeing how Instagram carousels become more and more important in Instagram marketing, and the many benefits they can bring to a brand’s social media presence, it becomes undeniably that in 2022, every business that hopes to be successful on Instagram should for sure become a heavy user of Instagram carousels.

Why banks’ digital transformation strategies fail — and what to do about it,Jamie Tolentino,2022/01/4,"
While digital transformation has been on the agenda for legacy institutions for over a decade, tech adoption has now become a do or die situation for traditional banks. The fintech revolution has brought about worthy adversaries in the form of neobanks and fintech apps that address the needs of a younger, digitally savvy generation. This coupled with the pandemic, which put the transition to digital banking services into warp-speed, has meant banks need to offer something new today or risk losing customers.
And it’s not for lack of trying. In 2018, banks globally invested $9.7 billion in digital transformation initiatives. Yet, today only 36% believe they’re at least halfway there. This isn’t entirely surprising as a whopping 78% of enterprises fail on their digital transformation initiatives.
So just what is still holding banks back?
We spoke with the team from Rangle.io, a tech company that helps banks up their game with mobile and web solutions, to find out what barriers banks are facing and how they can be overcome.
Legacy issues
Banks were late to the digital transformation party because most were concerned about the security issues that came with digitalization. This risk-averse attitude which earned banks a loyal consumer base 20-30 years ago, has carried on into the inherent culture of many banks today.
While the security risks that come with digitalization are real, the customer perspective has shifted since the pandemic. Before the pandemic, banking customers were more tolerant about banks being slow to adopt digital because they understood that the banks were not willing to compromise on security. However, with the pandemic bringing all services online, customers now expect a frictionless experience no matter where they are on the internet.
Suddenly, the challenges executives faced in the past are dramatically different to today’s landscape. However, current executives were still raised in that previous environment, where more conservative bets and a risk-averse approach were rewarded. At a strategic level, while it might seem prudent to steer a course towards that tried-and-true path, this bias in thinking can lead to stagnation in the bank’s value creation.
Nick Van Weerdenburg, CEO of Rangle.io, illustrates this with an analogy of cucumbers (agile leaders) getting pickled in brine (company culture). He says,
You can be the best lean or agile leader in the world, but if you join the most backward traditional hierarchical company, your intuition will slowly change as you pick up the culture. Eventually, the cucumber gets more pickled than the brine gets cucumbered.
Tightly coupled technical systems
Banks still run on antiquated technical backend systems which makes any technological innovation a challenge. Since these legacy systems are not designed for constant change, every change is complicated, has the potential to break other parts of the system and needs developer support to implement. In practice, this means that any change to a bank’s frontend experience takes a lot of time, people and effort, when it should really be as simple as updating your social media profile.
In a system where the frontend and backend systems are tightly coupled, the developers are in charge and create a bottleneck when multiple frontend systems need updating. One of the main reasons a bank can’t provide a frictionless experience for the customer is because the data clients need are housed in legacy platforms that are not designed to communicate with the new frontend systems. Any change to the website will also have to wait until the developers are free to implement the change.
To solve these issues, Rangle.io suggests decoupling the ability to change the frontend, e.g. website or app, from the antiquated backend system. This involves implementing a modern intermediary technical layer which houses data that can talk to both the front and backend system, speeding up data transmission between the two. The result is that simple changes to the frontend would not be subjected to limitations imposed by an antiquated backend system.
With a decoupled system, the bank’s marketing department can create pages on their website in a self-serve manner via a no-code or low code frontend system. Most of the time, the bank’s technological systems are not as optimized as the staff perceives them to be, so there will likely be room for improvement. Accenture claims that 87% of banking executives believe their bank must train their people to think like technologists, using and customizing technology solutions at the individual level, but without highly technical skills.
Failure of innovation labs
Innovation mandates within banks and other large financial institutions are usually siloed into one arm of the organization rather than being made a priority for the whole business to tackle. A lot of banks have started a ‘digital factory’ or ‘innovation lab’ or something similar five years ago, but the reality is that these expensive investments haven’t yielded results. According to a study by Capgemini, innovation labs have not increased revenue or improved the customer experience, resulting in an 80-90% failure rate.
This is because innovation units are usually treated as a separate entity with goals and objectives that don’t connect to the rest of the company. Furthermore, ideas generated from these units did not fundamentally change how the bank was delivering their services.
Rangle.io’s team believes that if you want to do digital transformation the right way, you need to make sure it’s a priority for the whole organization, and that the innovation lab has some connection to other aspects of the company, rather than being treated as a completely separate unit.
Lack of proper incentives for being risk-savvy
If employees in the bank are not incentivized by the leadership team, then nothing changes. Without the right environment where taking risks is rewarded, digital transformation is not going to happen. Therefore, companies must establish the proper means of measuring success in order to ensure their digital transformation is prioritized appropriately.
PWC found that more than four in five (83%) of risk-savvy executives report they are, “ahead or on track with their digital roadmaps,” versus 57% of their more nervous counterparts. In addition, 72% of the risk-savvy enterprises are also, “meeting or exceeding their expectations of improved customer experience,” versus only 45% of those less able to handle risks.
Bertrand Karerangabo, Chief Strategy Officer at Rangle.io claims that:
When enterprise objectives can be accomplished in the absence of a digital transformation, executives will be incentivized to carry on with business as usual. Therefore, measurable outcomes outside of profit are needed to ensure that digital transformation is a priority.
For example, when Nordstrom’s was stuck in their digital transformation journey, the executive team decided to integrate digital transformation goals into their bonus structures in 2016. To receive bonuses for that year, the IT and business leaders were tasked with creating a customer-facing improvement, and demonstrating potential for reducing lead time by 20%. This concrete, measurable goal is a digital transformation-centered goal which functions as an executive level incentive for taking risks.
Underestimating the scope of change needed
A lot of banks have invested in digital transformation initiatives while massively underestimating the scope. Usually, the investments are made in the silo of a department, innovation lab, digital factory, personnel hire, etc. A popular approach is hiring expensive superstar developers who then subsequently leave because of the reluctance to change bad processes and the underinvestment in technology.
This is reflective of banks implementing incremental change tactics when they need a disruptive change strategy. Apple started out as a disruptor when they first came out with the iPhone and the iPad. However, for the last decade they have only been making incremental changes, while other industry incumbents chip away at their market share
On the other hand, Nike heavily invested in digital transformation in 2017 which allowed the brand to overhaul their distribution strategy, resulting in a 33% lift in direct-to-consumer sales in two years. When the pandemic hit in 2020, their direct-to-consumer sales helped them thrive as a brand even when high street retail distribution channels were closed due to lockdown.
Banks need to understand what makes their brand salient with their audience and realize that digital transformation has become a must-have rather than a nice-to-have.
What can banks do to succeed in their digital transformation?
Since the market is too far ahead to put digital transformation off, or to put innovation in a silo like one of those innovation lab projects. It’s important for banks to take small but effective steps in starting their transformation now.
Usually, the scale and complexity often leads to far more questions like Where do we start? How much planning is appropriate? How will we allocate funds and resources? What are the key measures of success? While these are reasonable questions to ask, they are the wrong questions to begin with.
Instead, it’s better to first decide on the destination by defining a future state that is radically different from today. Rangle’s free ebook on transformation principles can be a good place to start.

5 designer’s shortcuts to help your new startup prioritize brand work,Jesse Pyy,2022/01/4,"
Early-stage founders often struggle with prioritizing and structuring their brand work – and admittedly, the feat can seem pretty overwhelming if you’re building your entire visual identity from scratch.
Color choices, fonts, and imagery can seem like petty details when you’re simultaneously building your product, fundraising, and headhunting for key roles, but overlooking your brand can be an expensive mistake for a startup with only one shot to woo a potential investor or customer.
At the same time, no matter what your investor, board member, or brand agency tells you, early-stage startups don’t need to have their ducks in a well-branded row as neatly as Coke or Apple.
Having worked with over 100 organizations on their brand, design, and visual identity, I’ve seen the sweat break on far too many founders’ foreheads as they try to prioritize their limited resources in a world of business cards, merchandise, and fancy brand videos they don’t yet need.
Here are five things every early-stage startup should do to make the most of their visual identity with limited resources:
1. Text logos are underrated (and all logos are overrated), so stop obsessing over them
Early-stage startups often give way too much weight to their logo and its inherent symbolism.
So, I’ll be frank: spending time perfecting your logo is a huge waste of time, creativity, and cash.
The world is so saturated with logos that it’s near impossible to create one that’s completely unique and identifies your startup from the moment it’s created. Much more important than trying to recreate the iconic McDonald’s or Nike symbols for your B2B startup is getting people to remember your name – and for that, simple text logos can bring some much-needed repetition.
If you don’t believe me when I say simple is beautiful, just look at companies like Burger King, Toyota, and Warner Bros who are jumping on the debranding bandwagon and simplifying their logos to their bare bones.
2. Don’t pay for staged photos that look like they’re stock
Meme accounts making fun of stock photos have made us all weary of image banks, but commissioning your own custom photo shoot isn’t always the best option.
Even real photos taken at your office using your own employees often end up looking fake – because let’s be real, no one sits five inches from their closest colleague pointing intently at the same screen.
Instead of paying for a custom photo shoot, there are great free image banks like Unsplash where you can get started, and cropping photos differently or adding colored layers can help customize them for your brand.
But a word of warning: don’t just go through the first five pages ranked by popularity, unless you’re going for the same look as your five closest competitors.
3. Only customize where it matters most
With limited resources for branding, you should focus your efforts on where your visuals can make the biggest impact.
For a SaaS company with a technical product, it’s imperative you have a high-quality image, animation, or video explanation of the real solution and how it works – not an oversimplified cartoon or artsy brand image – whereas a D2C brand will probably want to invest in packaging for the perfect unboxing experience.
And no matter what your brand agency tells you, unless you’re Coinbase or Spotify, you don’t need to pay thousands for a customizable icon bank or fonts (check out existing templates from Google, Streamline, or Fontawesome instead).
4. Buy templates instead of material production
Using an external partner to sharpen your visuals for key materials like pitch decks, your website or product packaging is often a good idea – because even if someone in your founding team speaks fluent Adobe, their limited time is likely better spent on other things.
However, when it comes to repetitive content like visuals for a social media post, paid campaign materials, or one-pagers, you can save a lot of resources and brief time by commissioning templates that someone on your team can reuse and freely modify.
Rule of thumb: if you need more than one version of something, a template is a must. If you need 20 versions of the same design, the first one might take you an hour to get right. The rest should be over in a couple of minutes, and if not, you’re doing it wrong.
5. Accept that your identity will expire in the first 2-3 years
Finally, companies are taught to fear brand renewals (“you shouldn’t change your colors now that customers are finally beginning to recognize you!”) but for startups, changing your visual identity in the first two to three years of your lifecycle often makes good business sense.
Startups tend to have limited resources to start building their brand, so it’s likely that you’ll want to amp up your brand once you have more learnings about your market-fit to do so.
More importantly, startups’ growth cycles are short, so it’s unlikely that the same visual identity will serve its purpose for over three years. As you enter new markets, broaden your focus from early adopters, or introduce new products or verticals, your brand will require a different approach.
Just think about Oura, whose entire vibe recently changed from performance-heavy biohacking to a more wholesome lifestyle approach, or Dropbox, who metamorphosed from a somewhat generic blue SaaS brand to a more consumer-centric and colorful brand.

Don’t let ‘shrinkflation’ affect your software development,Ross A. McIntyre,2022/01/3,"
You might not have noticed, but the products you’re buying at the grocery store are getting smaller. That’s right: They’re shrinking. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which sent raw materials prices soaring, many companies are trying to find ways to cut costs.
So if that box of Cookie Crisp (part of a balanced breakfast, they say) feels a little light, you’re not imagining things; General Mills has decreased its family size boxes from 19.3 ounces to 18.1 ounces.
Economist Pippa Malmgren coined the term “shrinkflation” to describe instances where companies reduce the size of products while retaining prices. However, prices aren’t staying the same. In May 2021, global food prices were the highest they’ve been since 2011.
While the Federal Reserve insists the current period of high inflation is temporary, the ripples are being felt throughout every sector of the economy, including software development.
If you think “shrinking” the amount of effort you put into projects is the best way to keep prices low, you’ll end up harming your company’s integrity and failing to meet client expectations. That’s not the right way to deal with inflation in the software development industry.
The state of professional services
For some C-suite decision-makers, there are few options but to increase the charge for professional services. Firms are grappling with pressure to decrease professional services costs, increased competition and commoditization, and the rising cost of talent. Some of these pressures have been mounting for years, while others directly result from the recent economic downturn.
Thankfully for those of us in the software development space, there were fewer obstacles during the pandemic due to the demand for digital innovation. The surge in remote work made software vital to businesses’ survival.
According to an IBM survey, the pandemic accelerated digital transformation at 59% of organizations. Additionally, the Worldwide Developer Population and Demographic Report indicates that the number of developers increased by 2.5% in 2020 (albeit slightly less than the projected growth of 4%).
The amount of money being poured into digital transformation could balloon to more than $2 trillion by 2022. According to Twilio, 79% of companies claim that COVID-19 increased their budget for the effort. Maybe this will make some of the laggards get off the proverbial pot.
Sidebar: The ridiculous thing about digital transformation hasn’t changed. It’s not a process with a defined end. Business owners will never wake up and discover that — poof! — their companies are transformed. It makes a lot more sense to view it as an ongoing process. (I’ll step down from my soapbox now.)
Organizations still have plenty of work to do, which bodes well for your business despite software industry competition. Your best-in-class digital services are the key to meeting executives’ digital innovation goals.
Cost, which has historically been the main factor impacting business decisions regarding technology investments, should theoretically become a smaller barrier.
However, something about this shift feels different. I’ve been in software development for 15 years. My advice? Make sure you can compete in the modern market.
How to best compete in this market
Researcher Aaron O’Neill estimates 2021’s global inflation rate to be 3.5%, which is significantly higher than 2016’s 2.7%. In the US, professional services experienced an average annual inflation rate of 4.86% between 1961 and 2021.
Considering other professional services are experiencing increased demand — CNBC reports that home renovations will cost more and take longer — it’s safe to assume the inflation rate will rise in the software development space as more businesses invest in digital innovation.
While shrinkflation might work in business-to-consumer industries like food and beverage, it’s not a tactic you should use to combat inflation.
Clients need software products that thoroughly address their pain points and improve existing workflows. If you’re producing something that’s ineffective, you’ll see fewer repeat customers and likely experience a decrease in revenue. No one wants that.
Assuming this pricing spike is inevitable, how should you decrease how much you charge for professional services moving forward? Here are my three tips:
1. Embrace new tech that will attract top talent
Top talent can be 400% more productive, according to a study in Personnel Psychology. And if your workers are more productive, you’ll see increased profits, according to Gallup.
But how do you attract high performers? By focusing on emerging technologies. These technologies can make existing processes more efficient, but they can also act as a draw for talent.
Software developers are looking for companies that are the “next big thing.” Artificial intelligence, blockchain, and more will inevitably shape the world in countless ways. Top talent wants to drive that change.
Increasing investment in and commitment to AI is now a necessity. What looks like magic to your competitors in five years is actually the result of today’s good planning. And AI is not a set of niche technologies — it is most effectively deployed horizontally across an organization.
According to Boston Consulting Group, digital laggards tend to view AI as a standalone solution, which limits its effectiveness in their organizations.
2. Invest in your current employees to keep them around
Workplace culture might be hard to define or quantify, but plenty of studies show that close-knit teams and inclusive office environments are associated with higher levels of employee engagement and productivity. And as I mentioned before, productivity improves profitability.
This isn’t to say you should underpay or overwork your employees. That mistake can result in poor performance and turnover, which is counterproductive to your goal.
Rather, you should make sure your firm values workers’ contributions, rewards them, and continually presents them with new opportunities for personal and professional growth. Nothing beats working for a company that genuinely supports its employees.
3. Put in the work upfront
According to George Cressman, president of World Class Pricing, “Delivering professional services requires great skill in diagnosing customer needs and understanding the relationship between very diverse components of a customer’s business. It requires skill in tailoring a solution to precisely meet a customer’s needs, and communicating that effectively.”
In short, your clients will be far more excited to work with you if you do as much of the discovery work for them as you can. The corresponding savings in software development costs can mitigate the impact of the current inflationary trend.
When you can hand your new partner well-defined personas, highly relevant user journeys, accurate requirements, and in-depth market research, everything moves faster. This upfront heavy lifting won’t eliminate the need to recalibrate once projects are underway, but it can reduce the number of steps from start to finish.
Even though it seems counterproductive, software development consulting rates can keep the overall cost of the project down. Moreover, with a detailed plan in hand before development begins, clients can be assured that you’re building the right thing the right way.
To be frank, software development is expensive. It was expensive two years ago, and it will be expensive two years from now.
Resisting the urge to raise your prices will help you stand out among your competitors. If your work is clever, comprehensive, and cost-effective, your business will reap the benefits of what could be a prohibitive trend for potential clients.

Founder to founder: A guide to scaling a startup,Christopher May,2021/12/13,"
When Henrik Gebbing and I founded Finoa in our shared apartment in Madrid back in 2018, little did we realize that within just three years we’d have team members across the globe with plans for exponential growth in the works.
Obviously, the way we ran things when it was just a handful of us would never suffice now. Scaling our business has meant overcoming some tough challenges in order to build a sustainable organization.
The biggest question I’ve heard from other founders is, “How do I know when my startup is ready to scale?” From my point of view, the answer is, “When you have found a winning business model.” This is a vital point here. You have to have a business model that works.
There’s no point in scaling if your minimum viable product is dysfunctional and you don’t have proof that you can monetize your product in one way or another. In other words, don’t scale if you don’t have customers who are willing to pay for your product.
Once you have a working business model in place and a group of paying customers, then you can think about broadening that client base. There are two ways that you can accomplish this.
One is by expanding into new countries or regions, the other is by expanding into new products. Each of these options will have some specific challenges, but here are my tips for how to prepare your company before scaling, so these challenges don’t derail your growth.
Expansions can fail without processes in place
Scaling a startup adds a lot of complexity — from straddling time zones to adding lots of new lines and boxes on an organizational chart. What happens to your operational processes as you add people in different regions, or at different management levels?
If you’re adding a new product, this adds levels of complexity to your supply chain situation, your billing department, and your development teams, just to name a few affected areas.
For example, if you try to scale a business with faulty project management and sales processes in place, you could end up with sales teams promising delivery of product updates that have not yet been finished and tested.
Management will end up spending too much time extinguishing organizational fires and not enough time making sure the core business itself is functioning properly — or on attracting new investors. This is an area where expansions can fail.
Where is your single source of truth?
The main challenge that scaling presents to internal communications is with the flow of information. When you have a team of five, it’s fairly easy to keep everyone informed about every little (and not so little) thing that’s going on.
With more people on board, it’s tough to ensure that relevant information is flowing to those who need it. Here, you may have to institute internal measures, including all-hands meetings, management meetings, communications tools like Slack, and even emails to everyone in the company when needed.
Remember, too, that internal communications need to be a two-way street: not just top-down, but also bottom-up. Having clear reporting processes in place will also help when you’re scaling into new countries or regions. Efforts in one location might be duplicated in another location, but may proceed in a very different direction.
As an example, if you have regional teams independently building product rollout roadmaps, you could end up with vastly different timelines that are in conflict with the launch plans underway by the marketing manager.
It’s vitally important to have a single source of truth in place, a central medium where all relevant and important info is gathered and shared, so that folks at each location know what the others are doing and who’s in charge.
Since many people are working from home and locations can be vague for some companies, this centralized structure should be set up by the headquarters and leadership so that there is a transparent flow of information within the company.
You can’t approach new markets with the same old messages
When you start to scale your company, you realize that it’s difficult to duplicate your image and brand onto a new product or to directly translate it into a new country. You see that a lot with car companies. They have different names for their vehicles, different ad campaigns.
The more your business grows internationally, the more important it is to align your branding and marketing to the target market, to accommodate for the preferences that customers in these countries might have.
If you’re headquartered in Germany, you would likely know what shows people tend to watch and when. But if you were to then expand into Spain, where you don’t know the market as well, you’d need to invest in support from local PR or marketing agencies who could help you localize your messages to be effective there.
The same applies to startups that scale by adding a new product. You might be selling comfort and usability for your first product, but perhaps the second product requires a completely different customer approach.
Scaling experience matters when it comes to hiring new managers
When you scale, you need to practically double or triple the team size, which will present problems to maintaining the company culture and DNA, especially if you are integrating diverse people across different time zones.
To minimize problems, you need to be sure to get people in management who have experience scaling. If you’re adding products, you need product managers who have experience working with that type of scale-up. They’ll best be able to handle any complications that arise as the new product is integrated into the company’s offerings.
If you’re opening an office in a new country, you need to hire a manager who knows the country, the market, and the local talent. Successful companies hire about 30% of their people from who they know and based on referrals. Therefore, it’s best to first look for a manager already working in your headquarters, who fits the company culture, and who has experience in or is from that country and knows the market.
Once you have a local manager in place, that person will be able to hire the right talent for that market. You can also work with international recruiting agencies that have supported scale-ups. They will have connections to talent and people in their markets.
For new teams in a different country or region than the headquarters, it will be important for leadership to spend some time with them on the ground in the beginning.
You have to really show your face so they know they are considered to be part of the whole company and not just external to it. There needs to be a strong connection here, and I highly recommend inviting these teams to the headquarters often and having in-person company-wide retreats where everybody can be together.
Get comfortable with ambiguity
As Finoa has grown, Henrik and I learned early on how quickly it can become too much for two founders to be responsible for everything. As a founder, you need to give away responsibility and become comfortable with ambiguity.
You are not going to know exactly what everyone is doing every minute of every day. It’s important to remember that you are still in charge of guiding the overall strategy and looking after the big picture, so you should not get bogged down in the nitty-gritty.
To do this, you need to increase the size of your management team and off-load operational responsibilities onto people you trust. Processes come into play here, too, since having these in place will enable you to collaborate with those people and maintain a surface-level knowledge of what is happening.
As I mentioned earlier, expansions can fail if the founders lose focus because they are drowning in work trying to do all the day-to-day stuff as the company grows.
You can’t prepare and scale at the same time
You want to make sure you are instituting systems and processes early on, as your company is starting to grow. Don’t wait until you have your minimum viable product and a customer base to start preparing to scale.
The longer you wait to get these processes in place, the harder it is to institute them with a larger team. By that point, everyone has already developed their own hodge-podge of ways to do things and it’s difficult to get them to completely switch to a new system.
Whether you are expanding into new regions or new product lines, having the above measures in place will help you successfully scale the operations of your startup, while maintaining your company DNA and keeping the big picture directly in your sights.

"Oi, marketers! Stay away from these 5 types of stock photos",Alina Valyaeva,2021/12/10,"
Stock photos don’t a great reputation. They’re cheesy and are easily recognizable, so a lot of marketers avoid using them. But I’d like to argue that stock photos aren’t the issue, it’s how you choose them.
Genuine top-quality stock photos expand your marketing opportunities. So let’s go through some common stock photo concepts that make your content look poor and then some good alternatives to consider.

1. Exaggerated facial expressions
Human emotions are an essential element of photos, which impacts the perception of the whole message you strive to deliver. Having a limited budget on hiring a professional model or finding persons to cover a topic related to them, photographers have flooded stock websites with images of people expressing fake joy or anger.

When picking a photo for your projects, keep track of people’s emotions and facial expressions. Make sure they appear natural, just like the photographer captured them in a real-life scene all of a sudden. This will make the content feel more genuine rather than cheap and staged.

2. Doppelgänger models
There are tons of stock photos out there of people wearing all-too-similar outfits, looking like weird doppelgängers.

Nowadays, more and more photographers aim for photo styling, color schemes, model authenticity, and diversity. When you look at their works, you can imagine what the characters are in front of you, what they like, and what they don’t. They have different stories and backgrounds, which make each photo real and vivid.
But if they’re all wearing the same-ish outfit, those stories will fall flat — so make sure to go for more interesting ones.

3. Ridiculous metaphors and allegories
Although stock photography intends to illustrate concepts and deliver a clear message covering various situations, some photographers generalize the topic and create plain visuals to express an idea.
Using all their imagination and photo editing skills, they tend to produce tons of content that, unfortunately, lacks originality.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not suggesting leaving metaphors and conceptual photography exclusively to professional artists. Many stock photographers are good enough at illustrating creative concepts, but it’s on you to choose the right ones.

4. Over-editing
During the golden age of fashion magazines with flawless imagery, stock photography looked perfectly polished too. Today, things have changed, and photos that look natural have become the new black — which is why you should avoid over-edited gloss pics like the one below.
Credit: Pixabay, Pexels
By choosing real-looking photos with blemishes and imperfections, you have far better chances that your content will resonate with your target audience.

5. Cheesy clipart
You can’t have an article on stock photos without mentioning clipart.
Clipart portrays abstract concepts like ‘leadership’, ‘motivation’, ‘teamwork’ etc. As many stock websites are available for authors of any skill level, who are eager to sell their content, the number of cheesy clipart that portrays a concept in the most obvious way has grown exponentially.
They fail to grab attention and are hardly able to drive action.
Credit: Pixabay
Are there any alternatives? Sure.
Consider choosing more appealing and fresh imagery. For example, take 3D illustrations, which are still not outdated (the keyword is still!), or make a collage with several relevant photos.
But, please stay away from any images demonstrating abstract concepts literally!
Credit: Freepik
So the next time you’re choosing a stock photo for a project, keep these five examples in mind.
But also remember that the golden rule of stock photos is to always think of your target audience and don’t forget about the context. The image you’re going to choose should be a perfect match between your product and clients.
Remember that the right message delivered to the right audience at the right time is a key to a successful marketing campaign.
"
Building an iOS app? Avoid these critical App Store roadblocks,Chris Cardinal,2021/12/9,"
Apple’s App Store is a holy grail for businesses, offering access to an audience of about half a billion people per week, according to the technology giant. But that doesn’t mean landing an app in the digital marketplace is easy.
Apple has said it rejected almost 1 million new apps vying for inclusion in the App Store in 2020, along with nearly a million updates to existing apps. Building an app takes a big investment of time and money, so before you get the wheels turning for your big app idea, it’s worth remembering that Apple alone controls who gets to play in its sandbox.
Ambitious founders and entrepreneurs often hate being told no, but the simple truth is that Apple rules the App Store with an iron fist. Billion-dollar companies like Epic Games and Valve Software might view it as an unjust dictatorship and remove their popular products in protest, but the truth remains that you must play by the rules if you ever hope to get an app in front of Apple’s massive audience.
Unfortunately, even playing by the rules doesn’t always get you in. Indeed, most apps do get through, but there’s simply no way to guarantee acceptance. While Apple does publish a thorough set of guidelines, there are still internal rules they keep under wraps. If having to submit to an unpublished set of rules sounds infuriating, I can assure you it is.
Up against the App Store
My app software development company, Synapse Studios, recently worked with a large publicly traded company to create a fitness app as a benefit for members of certain insurance plans.
Part of the content was for plan members, and the rest was available publicly. Apple, however, insisted that we offer in-app purchases so the public could unlock the “exclusive content.” But that content was an insurance benefit, and our client never charges end users.
What’s more, Apple’s own App Store guidelines don’t even allow for insurance payments through in-app purchases.
We couldn’t win, and after the client spent hundreds of thousands developing the app and content, Apple simply said the business model was “incompatible with the Apple App Store.”
How to better your chances
No one wants to go through this kind of nightmare, and though you never know whether your app will be accepted, it pays big time to do your homework beforehand.
Learn as much as possible about the App Store’s published guidelines, and follow these three steps to give your app the best possible chance of making it to the virtual App Store shelves.
1. Quality assurance is key
Test, test, test. Bugs are one of the top reasons apps get rejected by Apple. App reviewers test your code to make sure the app is usable and secure from start to finish, checking to make sure it doesn’t crash, it’s not nefarious, it doesn’t have some kind of malware, and more.
It’s honestly a good thing that Apple rejects buggy products. What good is the App Store, anyway, if the apps available on it have serious security flaws, scam their users, or don’t function properly?
Still, ambitious leaders often operate under the “move fast and break things” mindset, aiming to get products out quickly and fix them later. But Apple doesn’t want broken things in the App Store.
Implement a thorough app QA testing strategy that includes a checklist of mission-critical items to test before and after deployment.
Many founders assume that developerswill do double-duty as testers, but a dedicated app QA testing team is a worthy investment to maximize the chance of your app getting accepted on the first try.
2. Build your business plan with Apple’s take in mind
The infamous “Apple tax” charges developers a certain percentage of the money that they collect from every transaction for a digital service in the App Store, such as in-app purchases.
It’s one of the reasons Epic Games brought Apple to trial in federal court. While a huge company like Epic might have the means to push back, however, smaller businesses won’t likely be so lucky.
The “good” news is that small businesses now pay 15% instead of the historical 30% fee. But once a company hits its first million in revenue, the 30% fee takes effect. It’s important to factor in just how significant 30% of your revenue will be to your ongoing operations and the prices you’ll have to set.
And trying to skirt the charge is one of the quickest ways to get rejected from the App Store. For now, the only thing you can do is incorporate this number into your cost and return estimates and move on if you can’t make it work.
3. Do something interesting
Apple can still reject you based on the value proposition of your app and not its technical merits. If the app doesn’t produce novel value, or if it’s too similar to an existing offering, expect to be turned away from the App Store. Some 150,000 submissions in 2020 suffered this fate because they failed to sufficiently differentiate themselves.
Apple is the judge, jury, and executioner in this arena, but a good guideline is: if your app could be considered a clone or near-copy of an existing app, don’t expect it to be accepted into the App Store.
One of the most difficult parts of starting a company is tapping into an audience, and the Apple App Store offers incredible access to potential customers in 175 countries around the world. It’s an exciting opportunity, but not one that should not be taken for granted.
Plenty of apps get rejected every day, which is why you should put in the work upfront and maximize your chances of acceptance.
"
Metrics can drive your growth — as long as you’re looking at the right ones,Shams Adly,2021/12/8,"
Working in a startup, regardless of your position, requires close attention to data — there’s just no way around it. So if I could give you just one piece of advice, it would be to learn how to effectively analyze these numbers and metrics.
I’ve been working at Orcas for the past four and a half years. Orcas is an Education Technology platform that gives tutors access to lesson plans and provides students with free assessments. Tutors can offer their 1-to-1 sessions and 1-to-many courses both online or in-person and Orcas provides them with discovery, booking, scheduling, in-app communication, and video-conferencing tools.
Every year, our CEO would gather the whole team and tell us about the target for the coming period, and for us, it almost always seemed impossible to reach. One of these meetings was even called “Mission Impossible.” As the Chief Growth Officer, I felt a lot of pressure and had so many thoughts running through my mind: “How will we reach our goals? What do we need to make this happen?”
However, I quickly realized that the only way we’d get there is by looking at the numbers closely, understanding where we are and which numbers to work on.
The real trick though is not looking at any number or all the numbers, it’s looking at the right data. The metric that will make the difference.
Last year, after one of those yearly growth meetings, we needed to achieve a 4x growth year over year in new customer sales; which at the time seemed very challenging.
But by using the correct data and a properly thought-out strategy, nothing is impossible. I was able to achieve the required growth by following the steps below:

Look at my funnel and understand our current performance
Look at my resources: the team and their strength, my marketing and experimentation budget, and the general conditions of the market — the seasonality of schools and exams has a big effect on our business.
Do a sensitivity test for the funnel numbers to see which numbers, if changed, will have the biggest impact on our sales.
After choosing the metrics we will focus on and our overarching strategy, came the tactics and experiments phase. What are we going to do to make these metrics move?

In our case, we decided to focus on the number of people who search daily on our app. We know that by increasing this number, the top of our funnel will increase and generate more users who place a request on a daily basis and therefore increase our sales — which is what we’re ultimately aiming for.
There was a catch, though: we had to do that while decreasing our Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), so we couldn’t throw money at the problem and spend more on ads to reach our goal.
We had to look at all the possible ways we can acquire new customers. One thing that we were confident in, was Facebook Ads. Unfortunately, we couldn’t only rely on ads because of our budget and how it could impact our CAC, so we had to find other ways.
Here’s what we’ve done:

Optimized the acquisition of new customers through Facebook ads — we worked on our targeting and our messaging (visuals and captions).
Activated old existing users: we defined new customers as customers who are paying for the first time. Luckily for us, we have thousands of customers who signed up and never paid before so we decided to hammer on this pool through push notifications, emails, and SMS — this worked really well! 25% of all new requests were placed by customers who had previously signed up but had never used Orcas before.
Activating new sign-ups: we made sure that every person who signed up received event-triggered emails and notifications to guide them and lead them to place a request. Our customer liquidity ratio doubled from 8% to 16%.

This growth wouldn’t have been possible if we didn’t choose the right metric to monitor closely and experiment often.
I’d look at the number of searchers on an hourly basis and set a weekly growth goal. We’d try different combinations of timings, channels, and messages to see what’s working and what makes users search. We were laser-focused on increasing that number that we even doubled the efforts on slow days.
Not everything we tried worked though… especially when it came to referrals.
As part of our plan to decrease our CAC, we wanted to capitalize on our already existing customers to become our brand ambassadors and get us more customers for a significantly lower cost (especially after conducting a survey with them and discovering that 60% of our customers are using the app because someone they trust told them about it).
We thought we hit the jackpot! We decided to incentivize our customers to recommend us more aggressively to their friends. They would then give their friends a code to use while booking their sessions to get a discount. Alongside that, they’d receive a monetary reward in return for each person who uses their code.
A win-win situation that would work wonders, or so we thought.
Unfortunately, things didn’t go as planned, our satisfied users didn’t want to use their code. They didn’t want to seem like they were recommending us to benefit from their friends, after all, we are a trust business.
Our users are not buying goods or taking one short ride, they’re looking for someone who will enter their home, sit with their children and teach them. They need to trust that person and the company that’s providing them with this service.
Understanding this was key to understanding why our happy customers didn’t want to use their referral codes. They don’t want to lose their credibility, they want to give advice to their friends and relatives without it looking like there is something in it for them.
This finding didn’t demotivate us, on the contrary, it gave us a better understanding of our customer behavior. An understanding that will help us do better in the next trial.
Experimentation is an ongoing process and in my opinion the only way we’ll learn and grow. At Orcas, we celebrate failed experiments because they represent newly learned lessons — and I think you should too.
"
Does having a European HQ still matter in a ‘remote’ world? Absolutely,Brennan O'Donnell,2021/12/7,"
Nearly every company has had to adjust to a distributed working model since the pandemic hit, with workers now dispersed to a wide range of locations and time zones.
One unexpected benefit of this massive paradigm shift is that startups today are better prepared than before to adapt to the demands of becoming a global organization, including those that I invest into as a General Partner at Frontline X, a growth-stage fund for US companies expanding to Europe.
But on the journey to building a global company, there are countless decisions, and a handful has an outsized impact on your growth trajectory. Selecting your European headquarters is one of these decisions, and it’s extremely painful to unwind if you get it wrong.
As a leader on Google’s initial landing team in Europe, I saw this play out first hand at our headquarters in Dublin as we scaled from a few dozen people to over 2,000.
However, many companies are now asking themselves: in our new world of remote working and distributed teams, is choosing a headquarters in Europe still relevant?
Short answer? Yes.
Let me show you why.
The path to go global runs through Europe
At $28.7 trillion, EMEA represents roughly 30% of the world’s GDP and is the largest addressable market outside of America. Europe itself is the world’s second-largest B2B software market, and for more than two decades has been the location of choice when US companies look beyond their own borders.
With the democratization of software distribution, it’s now common for companies to discover 10-12% of their business comes from Europe organically, and by IPO these same companies average 30% of their revenue from Europe. Simply put, the path for any business to grow into a global category leader runs through Europe.
However the region is far from homogeneous, and CEOs must think of it as a collection of many fragmented markets, each with its own unique dynamics.
There is generally a power law distribution to the size of these markets, with the two largest countries, the United Kingdom and Germany, commanding 40% of the addressable European market for most SaaS companies.
The largest cities dominate the economic activity, leading to a strong concentration of customers and talent in a few of these locations.
Even if you are currently working as a distributed team and have no plans to invest in a physical office right away, you still need to think about where your customers are, where the talent you need is concentrated, and where you can best access markets and opportunities for long term growth.
Therefore, selecting the right European headquarters is just as important as ever.
It’s essential to move quickly as well. The European startup ecosystem is flourishing, with nearly $60 billion in venture capital invested into Europe in the first half of 2021, up threefold from 2020, and local competitors being created daily, particularly across B2B SaaS.
Once your company has a repeatable sales process, is seeing European customer demand, and has the right leadership team in place, it’s time to invest in expansion.
A simple framework for choosing your HQ
It’s easy to fall into one of several different traps when selecting an HQ. Companies are often overwhelmed by the decision, overanalyzing all the factors and possibilities. It’s also common to over-index on cost or corporate structure considerations.
Others rush the decision, following a customer to a particular location, making piecemeal hires in Europe, or copying what another company they know has done.
To avoid these and other pitfalls, there’s a simple framework, based on four criteria — customers, talent, cost, and business environment, that CEOs can follow to inform their decision-making process.
Asking where your current and future customers are, what market segments you are targeting, whether your GTM motion is self-serve or sales-led, and what language or regulatory requirements does your product has, should come first.
For talent, CEOs must ask themselves what industry or role-specific talent do they require, at what level of seniority, with which language skills, and how do the employment laws and norms differ?
When evaluating cost, asking yourself questions about the ideal corporate and tax structure, what FDI investment incentives are available, what future real estate costs might be, and what is your talent budget is key.
Lastly, gauging the business environment should be based on how easy it is to do business across Europe from your location, how vital is synchronous working for your team, and knowing how and if geopolitical pieces like GDPR and Brexit matter to your business.
While all of these criteria are important, every business is different and my team’s recent report shows decisions around choosing the right location for you can be nuanced, and errors can be costly.
How these factors are weighted will differ for each company but focusing on customers and employees before costs is always our recommendation to build a successful and sustainable business.
I frequently tell CEOs who are evaluating locations for their HQ that having a low tax rate on a small revenue number does you no good. Costs remain a consideration of course, however that should not be the primary driver.
Where to land when you expand?
20 years ago cost was a primary driver of the decision process for selecting a European headquarters. The tech ecosystem and venture capital markets were far less mature, and very few software companies had reached the scale to move internationally.
As a result, the relevant talent pools were much more nascent and no one location carried much of an advantage over another.
Today, while cost is still important to decision-making, proximity to customers and talent have become the most important drivers for choosing an HQ location.
Proximity to your customer base is always an advantage, but it’s particularly critical for US companies selling into European markets, especially for B2B software companies targeting the mid-market and enterprise segments. This is why most tech companies have located near their customers and talent pools, creating a cycle that reinforces these geographies.
As software companies exploded and grew internationally, clear hubs started to emerge, particularly around Dublin, London and Amsterdam. There are extremely rich tech ecosystems in these three cities, each with strengths in certain areas.
Other cities such as Berlin and Paris also have strong emerging technology and startup ecosystems, however, the reinforcing dynamics that have concentrated customers and talent around the top three cities continue to make London, Dublin, and Amsterdam your most likely shortlist.
Conclusion
Although decision-making has become increasingly decentralized, selecting the right location for a European headquarters remains a critical step on the journey to becoming a global business.
Success is always predicated on being close to your customers, finding the best talent to compete, and scaling your operations in a cost-effective way.
London, Dublin, and Amsterdam each provide a strong foundation across these dimensions — which is why the majority of US companies end up in one of these three cities.
Above all else, spend the time to make a thoughtful decision. Do your research, properly evaluate your options and get advice from experienced leaders who have gone before.

Data centers could cause serious environmental damage — if we don’t regulate them now,Andrea Hak,2021/12/6,"
With the average adult spending 4.2 hours a day on smartphone apps in 2020, our reliance on technology has evolved even more than we might have thought possible. From ordering food to connecting with loved ones or binge-watching the latest series, our data consumption is an integral part of daily life.
As a result, businesses are also consuming more data than ever before, and this trend will only grow. But our tech-loving ways could cause lasting damage to the planet.
While the transition to the cloud has promised to solve many of our data overload problems, data centers are now producing the same amount of emissions as the global airline industry.
As COP26 comes to a close, one of the biggest challenges international leaders have failed to address is setting tighter and clearer regulations for the exponentially growing cloud industry.
The truth about ‘carbon neutrality’
Many tech companies have publicly claimed to be ‘carbon neutral’, but the truth isn’t as clean cut. A lot of them just purchase Renewable Energy Certificates or RECs to offset emissions on paper and don’t provide proper transparency in their emissions calculations. And that’s a big problem.
Without clear, transparent, and universal reporting standards, we can’t know what percentage of green energy is being used to power data centers and what percentage comes from purchasing REC offsets.
RECs are fine as a band aid to emissions, but it’s by no means a long-term solution.
We can’t repair the damage of the climate crisis after the fact, so it’s important that we instead focus on building data centers that are actually better for the environment.
Lack of reporting standards doesn’t just mean we miss out on recording greenhouse gas emissions, it also leads to the glossing over of other harmful factors.
According to the Uptime Institute’s 2021 Global Data Center Survey, while many report on power consumption, the electricity and water resources needed to keep data centers cool often aren’t being tracked or accounted for. Neither is the e-waste created by the need to continuously replace servers.

For example, in the Netherlands data centers use an average of 1 million cubic meters of water per year — the equivalent of 19,230 one-person households.
Earlier this year there were reports that residents of North Holland could experience water shortages due to data centers. While this claim was later disputed by the local government, it has raised concerns over the impact that increasing water consumption by growing data centers could have in an ever warming climate. Can sustainability and technology thrive together?
Our reliance on tech to power our businesses and daily lives proves that our data processing needs will only grow.
Although data consumption and sustainability might appear to be at competing ends of the spectrum, momentum is shifting towards the idea of greener, more sustainable forms of cloud computing. More and more consumers are demanding companies take a proactive role in reducing their emissions, putting the spotlight on big tech companies and cloud providers to address the issue.
While consumer awareness and activism are important to put pressure on companies, it’s governments that will need to set stricter emission reduction targets and transparent reporting standards.
The European Union has been a leader in this area with its ambitious Green Deal, which also includes a call for data centers to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030.
With more businesses looking for ways to lower their carbon footprint, this may pave the way for EU based data service providers to take the lead.
Across Europe, countries like Finland — that are heavily invested in renewable energy — are seen as examples of green tech innovators and serve as inspiration for those seeking greener energy consumption. In France, new legislation is putting pressure on cloud providers to decrease their energy consumption.
Some cloud providers are also going further to measure their impact. Cloud provider Scaleway is developing a Real Data Centre Efficiency measure to provide customers with an objective take on their environmental impact. By doing so, the tech firm gives consumers the transparency and information they need to make the best choice for themselves.
But, in order to hold global data centers accountable for progress on sustainability, there needs to be clear, comparable standards across the board, not just for power consumption and PUE, but also for other factors like water consumption and e-waste reduction.
While we have pressure from consumers and new legislation for data centers, there needs to be more pressure on companies to choose green cloud providers. At the moment, while companies are being pushed to lower their carbon footprint, they aren’t being held accountable for emissions generated by data stored on external cloud servers.
It’s important to note that, as of 2023, new legislation will oblige EU based companies with more than 250 employees to report on their environmental impact, just as they report their financial results.
While there are plenty of concerns world leaders need to consider when it comes to climate change, with ever increasing data consumption, taking action to push for greener cloud services isn’t one we can afford to overlook.
Here are a few ways they can do this:

Set clear, universal environmental reporting standards for data centers
Include water consumption, IT or data center carbon emissions, and e-waste in calculations
Provide incentives for data centers to invest in green tech adoption and research (particularly in new cooling techniques)
Make companies accountable for emissions tied to their external data and provide incentives to choose green data service options

"
Want to improve your e-commerce metrics? Focus on your QA score,Nathan Resnick,2021/12/3,"
I think most of us are aware of the fact that customers are important. Throughout the shift from traditional commerce business to the current focus on e-commerce enterprises, concepts like “the customer experience” and “the customer journey,” continue to ring true. In fact, in many cases, they’re more important than ever.
That is to say, even in the online retail space, there’s no doubt that the customer remains a focal point in all things business. When customers are able to Google everything, customer experience can be a way to differentiate your business and stand out.
Businesses are continually morphing and evolving the various elements of how they operate. Things like managing remote workers, orchestrating complex e-commerce customer service, and scaling along with the steady increase in online shopping are rewriting what the customer experience is in the first place.
And yet, I still firmly believe that quality assurance remains one of the biggest factors impacting every startup‘s or company’s CX. In fact, with so much competition in the e-commerce space, the quality of the experience that you can offer to your clients is one of the biggest differentiating factors any organization can cultivate.
While the customer is key, though, catering to an e-commerce customer can be challenging. If you don’t have solid, customer-related metrics to guide you, creating a winning strategy can be impossible.
That’s where your QA score comes into play.
What is your QA score?
While quality assurance has always been a mainstay in business, tracking traditional QA in a spreadsheet-focused, 21st-century enterprise can be challenging.
The question is, how can you track, analyze, and improve your customer experience?
Traditionally, businesses gauge CX with things like customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores. The problem is, these can be skewed by external factors. They also tend to be simplistic, more often than not merely requesting a general opinion about a customer’s overall experience. This generates data that is non-specific and does not suggest specific areas of improvement…
Enter the QA score.
A quality assurance score is a metric that you can customize to the specific customer experience that your brand is attempting to offer. In addition to using basic CSAT information, a QA score can take into consideration critical elements like:

How your customer service rep is doing in their interactions with customers
If a rep is following your customer service protocols
If a rep is reflecting the tone, voice, and posture outlined in your brand guidelines
Any other company-specific standards or values worth tracking

These additional factors make a QA score much more effective at capturing detailed, relevant interaction data.
By tailoring your QA scorecard to your brand, you can judge the quality of your agent’s interactions with your customers. This can provide specific areas of improvement and growth rather than generic feedback that does little more than reflect initial customer emotions.
The measured difference between CSAT and QA scores
Traditional customer service surveys have been the go-to option for CSAT as they are used as a proxy for quality. However, I’ve found that they can be a bit misleading. In fact, at times, they can even contradict the more accurate data offered by a QA score.
Quality assurance software platform MaestroQA recently conducted an analysis of 265,000 customer support tickets. In the review, the company compared classic CSAT scores with more robust QA scores and discovered that even when only considering interactions with a 90% QA score or higher, nearly a third (31.8%) of the support tickets had negative CSAT scores.
In other words, even when customer service was stellar, more than three out of every 10 tickets looked like a failure from a CSAT perspective.
The critical nature of a QA score
Examples like the one I provided above help to highlight the weakness and overall shallow nature of a customer survey. On their own, these simplistic questionnaires tend to fall flat.
Rather than provide meaningful data, they cloud the problem with emotional responses. If a customer is upset after an interaction, it doesn’t matter how professional an agent was, or whether they followed their training and instructions from their team. The feedback will likely be negative. A case can be made for the opposite to be true, as well.
When you use a QA score, however, it can pinpoint precise areas of both strength and weakness. To reiterate, this is due to the fact that a QA scorecard can be:

Customized to gather specific data
Used to define detailed success and failure points
Used to read into feedback and data and then come up with meaningful changes

Compared to a CSAT score, a QA score provides a robust, well-rounded set of data for understanding whether or not agents are performing to set company standards. It can be tailored to meet each company’s needs, and can provide critical feedback.
Using your QA score to perfect your business
The e-commerce industry comes with many metrics — data in the CX area, in particular, can feel overwhelming at times. If you’re looking for a way to cut through the clutter and pinpoint where you really need to grow, look no further than your QA score.
From personalization to specificity, a QA score provides a quality metric that can redefine both your e-commerce data analytics and, by extension, your customer experience as a whole.

You’ve just been accepted into a startup accelerator — now what?,Andrea Hak,2021/11/29,"
Almost every startup has flirted with the idea of joining an accelerator program. When done right, they can be an invaluable opportunity to learn from experts, get feedback on your product, business, or strategy, and get access to lucrative funding opportunities. But just how beneficial are they?
The answer really depends on you.
Taking time out of your daily operations for three to even six months is a big deal in a startup’s hectic life cycle. There are so many founders who apply to accelerators thinking it’ll be a great opportunity and then, when the program actually starts, it gets pushed aside to tackle other concerns. You miss one workshop here, one mixer there, and the next thing you know it’s over.
In the past, we’ve written about what to consider before joining a startup accelerator, how to choose the right program, and how to actually get in. Now we want to focus on what you should be doing during and after the program ends to keep the momentum going — so let’s dig in!

Luckily, we had access to a batch of cohorts fresh out of the DMS Accelerator for data-centric startups and SMEs in Europe. TNW reached out to some of the most engaged participants to find out how they got the most out of their experience and what they recommend to fellow founders.
Claire Linley, co-founder and CCO at retail technology innovator Delloop, began by sharing her simple strategy:
Participate, participate, participate! Get involved in every aspect of the program.
The biggest benefit of a good accelerator program is the mentoring opportunities. You’re opening your company up to be poked and prodded by experts and mentors who will scrutinize your business plan, question your product-market fit, and may even tell you to ditch your artsy logo.
Keep in mind that your startup isn’t a glass house. Some of the best known tech companies today went through pivots and rebranding to reach where they are now. Twitter was originally a podcasting platform, Airbnb was focused on finding beds for conference attendees, and Youtube started out as a video dating site.
For Manuel Pessanha, CEO of automated fleet and delivery scheduling solution, Synertics, one of the best pieces of advice for fellow founders is:
Be open and constructive to external opinions and ideas and engage with the incredible pool of mentors as much as possible.
This is your chance to see your business from different perspectives and ask as many questions as possible. So be that nerd at the front of the classroom.
Make some friends (or at least long term connections)

After the expert advice, the second biggest benefit of joining an accelerator is the potential connections you can make. Whether it’s with your mentors, fellow founders, guest speakers at workshops, or anyone else you meet along the way.
But it’s all too easy to let these connections fade after the accelerator ends. Faizan Patankar, CEO of industrial ops AI startup, Amygda said:
Build relationships with other founders, because in your journey who knows who might be able to help you with an introduction to a VC or a common connection to a new customer. Keep adding value to founders’ lives even after the accelerator. Just as you need help, the rest of the founder community needs it too!
In fact, Patankar suggests to think even wider than your own cohort:
Search through the existing and past companies in the accelerator. They could be a great source of new business sales or even partnerships.
Take a page from Leila Koenig, co-founder at Dashfactory (creator of the electric Dashbike) who told TNW she made it a habit to connect with every person she met on LinkedIn straight away.
Dashfactory took the best out of it. We really focused on connecting with the people in the program. We connected with everyone on LinkedIn and took part in every session.
Don’t just bring senior people

A lot of startups end up just sending founders or senior level people to accelerator workshops — but that’s a big mistake. Instead, you should think about them like free training sessions that your whole team can benefit from. Whether your marketing team wants to get some external advice on their new campaign or your sales team wants to learn about how they can build their pipeline, there are lots of opportunities for growth. Koenig put it succinctly:
Use those workshops to educate your team. Most startups have a lot of enthusiastic juniors. Take the right people with you to the workshops.
Similarly, Violetta Shishkina co-founder & CEO of blockchain-based CAD sharing solution, CADChain, actually found the DMS Accelerator to be a great opportunity for getting new hires up to speed.
Apart from the obvious benefits of participating in such a program, we were able to get the added benefit of connecting the onboarding process of new employees with their presence at the webinars.
As our startup was growing rapidly at the time, the participation of new employees in the accelerator allowed us to quickly and effectively immerse them into the startup life, providing them with crucial knowledge, great insights, and fresh experience.
Advertise, market, and share

Remember, being accepted into a well-known accelerator is great for your startup’s market cred. But don’t wait for VCs or potential partners to ask you which programs you’ve participated in — make sure everyone knows before they even think to ask.
That’s at least what Patankar believes:
You should share your journey through the accelerator on your website, blog updates, and social media. Build your social proof by being associated with trusted accelerators.
Echoing Patankar’s advice, Linley suggests:
Use all your social media channels to promote the accelerator, your participation, and to support your cohort peers.
Don’t forget to celebrate

Getting into a well-known accelerator is a milestone for your startup; it means the organizers see potential in your idea and your team. For all the ups and downs of startup life, it’s a great confirmation that you’re doing something right. So take the time to celebrate and get your team excited about what’s to come.
Billy Mello, CEO at LAIFE, an AI-based wellness and music company, said:
Being part of the DMS Accelerator was a highlight for our intense year at LAIFE.
Due to the highly skilled contacts, mentors, and training pieces, DMS delivers what it promises.
And the overall program encompasses everything a startup needs to get on track with the development, funding, client and investors relationships and much more.
We had the chance to meet brilliant mentors, committed investors, learned a lot through workshops and classes, but, above all, we felt that LAIFE now is part of a more prominent family, with lots of skilled peers.
There are over 7000 startup accelerator and incubator programs globally, so there’s bound to be a great one out there for your startup’s needs. If you’re a data-centric SME or startup based in Europe, check out DMS Accelerator. The program aims to help these companies overcome barriers in data skills, entrepreneurial opportunities, legal issues and standardization.

Engagement isn’t the future of software — so stop prioritizing it,Wade Foster,2021/11/29,"
When’s the last time you thought about your hammer? Probably the last time you used it.
Physical tools don’t ask for your time — they just do their job. Software, on the other hand, is also a tool, but lately, apps are demanding more and more of humans. Workplace software is just as addictive as consumer software, all in the name of “driving engagement.”
But who is this engagement really for? For most users, it only leads to irrelevant, or worse, distracting work. The constant red dot, the buzzing notification on your phone, and the chime of one more alert calls us to work that may or may not matter.
It’s overwhelming and pointless — so let’s stop doing it.
Don’t let software get in your users’ way
Imagine, if you will, a world in which hammers were optimized for engagement. They could maybe make a sound every day, just to remind you that you have a hammer.
They could have Wi-Fi, with push notifications, letting you know how many nails you drove in one year ago today. Maybe there’s the occasional note about new hammers you could purchase.
It’s a silly idea for a hammer. In a few years, people will also realize it was a silly idea for work software — so you better adapt.
People, and businesses especially, will increasingly look for software that’s less like a social network and more like a hammer. The future of software will be focused on enabling workers, not driving engagement. It’s about putting humans back in the driver’s seat.
People want software that allows them to have leverage over the work they do. To truly be able to do more things, with less. That means creating software people can use to do a job, then stop thinking about.
My co-founders and I founded Zapier on these principles — and I feel all software creators should do the same. We shouldn’t demand people’s time. Instead, we should give users the freedom and flexibility to do whatever they think is most important, while helping them automate the rest.
Let your apps work for you
The best employee is one you can trust to do their job without a lot of oversight. People who save you time, rather than take it up. Software should work the same way. People should be able to hire software to do a job, then trust it to get that job done without a lot of effort on their part.
Automation software is a great example of this. Creating automated workflows takes some time upfront, but after that, it works in the background. It saves users time every month, whether they log in to the website or not.
This is the future of software: apps doing more for us instead of demanding more from us. So if you want to succeed, apply this to the products you make, and help empower the next generation of creators.

From our worst month to our best: 4 lessons my startup learned the hard way,Sebastián Henao,2021/11/25,"
The pandemic was incredibly difficult for many startups, and mine was one of them. As restrictions started, our operations fell by a whopping 81%.
This might not be that surprising, seeing that we work in recruitment. But what might be a surprise is that we made it through this difficult patch and are growing again.
So let me share my learnings and how we got back onto the growth path with a new, faster, and more aggressive mindset.
Before we dive in, let me give you a bit of background. My startup Globalwork was founded in Colombia and operates across Latin America. Our purpose is to build trusting relationships between companies and their talent through background checks, information verification of their applicants, and home interviews.
When we started out in 2017 we worked with medium-sized companies, but over time we’ve begun partnering with large corporations in the region. We built a very solid information platform and a network of 200 professionals in psychology and social work throughout the region to conduct the best possible socioeconomic interviews.
Things were going great. The number of processes asked by our clients was growing 20% month by month… until the pandemic hit.
In Colombia, where we used to have our hand in 5000 hiring processes every quarter, the first months were wracked by uncertainty. Companies didn’t dare to hire new staff, many had to lay off a large part of their team (2.4 million job positions were lost and it’s estimated that Colombia went back 10 years in this regard) and clung to their jobs, so there was no turnover.
So in April 2020, our operations dropped by 81% — our absolute worst month. But only a year later, in March 2021, we had our best month ever, even compared with the b.c. (before covid) era!
I won’t claim that we have some magical solution or that all our decisions were right or fully informed. And I won’t deny the importance that the economic reactivation had on our indicators.
Instead, the truth is simply that we acquired experience during tough times, whose value we’re only now beginning to understand. But we’re using it to define good practices that are now part of who we are and I believe it can be useful for you as well.
1. If to ‘do or not to do’ is the dilemma, always do
The common opinion among our clients and colleagues, even our own opinion, was that the pandemic was going to last a couple of months. We could see how many companies were left to wait and barely reacted when weeks had passed.
We, on the other hand, spent the first weekend of lockdown in a hackathon, building the MVP of the product that I’ll tell you about later on.
A few weeks before, by chance, we had read this great article on the need to start playing offense. I found it to be incredibly important to jump-start our shift into a faster and more aggressive mindset.
2. Take the time to know your customers
As I said, we work in recruitment, which connects us directly with human resources. By calling our clients we discovered that many of them were carrying a heavy burden, as they had to fire people, channel the uncertainty and fear of employees, issue the disabilities of contagions, and even deal with the mourning of employees who lost loved ones.
The emotional burden and uncertainty were overwhelming the companies’ workforces. By putting ourselves in the shoes of our customers, we knew we had a huge possibility on our hands, not to sell more, but to connect at a human level with them.
This gave us incredible feedback on what people really needed and how we could fulfill those needs, but more on that a bit further down.
3. Be aware of your resources
My team has a network of 200 professionals in psychology and social work who conducted our home interviews. But when no one is hiring, and on top of that, if they aren’t even allowed to enter anyone’s home, what could we do with them?
Our decision was to assign psychologists and social workers to what they do best: listening and helping others.
Having previously identified the needs of the companies we worked with, we launched a completely free emotional wellness platform, in which 50 of our collaborators volunteered to participate.
The dynamic was simple: if anyone, whether they were employees of our clients or not, felt emotionally unwell, they could contact us through a landing page and schedule an appointment with one of our professionals.
With this campaign, we made a quick communication plan with our database and media and from one week to the next our website visits doubled, we were published in national media, and weekly we received around 100 requests for emotional accompaniment during three months.
As time went by, this platform became more sophisticated with people analytics, and we started to offer it to companies through a monthly fee so that they could open a space for empathic and professional listening to their teams and obtain valuable information about emotions in their organization.
4. Know the needs of the industries
You spend all day thinking how to make your product better. It is highly likely that you will end up believing that you are the best thing in the world and that the market needs you. Not even close.
While we were trying to sell a service that didn’t have a big demand because of the uncertainty in society, a client of ours, one of the most important companies in Colombia told us: “We are going to send 500 people to permanent remote work and we need a company that makes sure they have the optimal conditions for that. Would you be interested in checking this?”
So, again, we made specific changes in the technology we had already developed, and we assigned our entire logistics network of psychologists and social workers to this new service that implied minimal modifications to the process, but let us keep moving at first, and then, to building a profitable line of business.
These pivots that we had to make at full speed changed our own vision of Globalwork: they showed us that we are not only a background checks and information verification company, but mainly a logistics company that can support HR areas in a wide range of needs.
We now have two new lines of business, emotional wellbeing and verification of remote work conditions, which represent 7% and 6% of our current operation, respectively.
In addition, this dynamic of constant experimentation allowed us to go back to grow 20% every month and prepared us for the economic recovery, strengthening the relationship with our clients to a level we did not expect and teaching us to optimize our commercial processes, which reduced our sales cycles from 4-5 months to 2-3 months.
I don’t want to fall into the cliché of saying that change is the best thing in the world, because it isn’t.
It can be terrifying and super destructive. But it’s something you can’t control. Just remember the inertia law: objects tend to maintain their state, either at rest or in motion. If you are barely moving, any obstacle will stop you easily. If you are moving fast, of course you can be deviated and even derailed, but your inertia will keep you in motion.

5 tips for writing amazingly jargon-free product copy,Built In,2022/07/22,"
This article was originally published on Built In by Alexander Lewis. 
What is jargon, anyway? In a literal sense, jargon is simply a word or phrase that requires specialized knowledge for the reader to understand. For our purposes — which include helping people at technical companies write clearly about their offerings — that definition isn’t practical. Most of us only think of the word “jargon” in a negative sense. It’s something we’re supposed to avoid in our writing at all costs.
But that’s not quite accurate. After all, good writing and technical writing are not antonyms. If the audience on your website has specialized knowledge, then there’s nothing wrong with using some industry parlance to communicate your offering.
So where do we draw the line between jargon and necessary parlance?
I believe what we’re really trying to solve is how to write about a technical product in a way that sticks in the reader’s mind. We want our copy to be memorable and clear, without being dumbed down. That’s why in this article, I’ll break down my own more practical definition of jargon and five tactics for how to find the right replacement words and phrases.
A copywriter’s definition of jargon
When it comes to writing for a business, I find it helpful to define jargon as any business word or phrase that lacks a visual component to stick in the reader’s head. Non-visual words are forgotten almost as soon as they’re read because there’s nothing visual, emotional, or otherwise sticky about them.
Consider a phrase like “business solution.” When used in a sentence (“ABC Corp. delivers best-in-class business solutions”), you lose the reader. There’s nothing about the phrase to cause it to stick in the reader’s mind. Asking a reader to visualize a “business solution” is like asking them to grab fog.
Fortunately, there are several easy shortcuts you can use to find clearer, simpler, and “stickier” words.
How to write memorable, jargon-free copy
Tactic #1: Trade vague for visual
A lot of jargon is the result of speaking in generalities instead of specifics. The carwash down the street isn’t marketed as “a water-based transformation solution for vehicles.” The operation is called a carwash. It’s the clearest, simplest, and most visual term for what is being offered.
When you’ve written a sentence about your product or company, do the visualization test. Look at each word in the sentence and determine if your words have a visual counterpart. As soon as you do this, words like “synergy,” “solution,” or “tactical” are the first to the chopping block.
Tactic #2: 1 point per sentence
Don’t try to impress with long, comma-packed sentences. If you have multiple points to make, save each of them for their own sentence. It’s easiest to remember the details of something we’ve read when the finer details are broken down into individual sentences.
Just think about it: Long sentences are often filled with extraneous detail, and they drag the reader on, and on, and on until they’re just skimming your words, speed reading your copy, or skipping to the next section to avoid the long-winded mess before it exhausts them.
Instead, slow down. Keep sentences short. Simple is more memorable.
Tactic #3: Write in an email, not a doc
Even for experienced writers, a blank document with a flashing cursor can be deeply intimidating. Word and Google Docs cause many of us to write like self-important professors, thinking only of lofty words instead of short, crisp ones.
Just change your context. Start writing about your product in the body of an email or in a physical notebook. It may even help you to start with an introduction like “Dear Mom” to help you take things less seriously. This practice gets you out of your own head. It puts your mind at ease, allowing you to write using a more conversational tone.
Tactic #4: Read reviews of your product
You know who almost never uses jargon when talking or writing about your products? Customers.
If you’re looking for inspiration for easy words and phrases to use in your copy, just read some online reviews. Better yet, get on the phone with one of your best customers.
This is the first place I turn when starting a new website copywriting project. Customers have the best language for talking about your product because they’ve never been influenced by all the technical specs, years of meticulous product development, and marketing-speak that you have.
Reading customer language saves you time and nine times out of 10 will produce better copy than anything you’d write on your own.
Tactic #5: Answer ‘What’s in it for me?’
One of the most common causes of jargon is simply writing about details your customers don’t care about. This comes down to what many marketers call the difference between features and benefits. Features are specs. Benefits are how your features positively impact the customer.
This is the famous iPod slogan, “1,000 songs in your pocket,” in action. While other music players were talking about gigabytes and storage, Apple cut to the chase. They named what mattered to their customers: being able to listen to all their favorite songs, wherever they go.
So the next time you write a sentence or paragraph about your product, imagine your best customer could read that line. Would they get excited about what you just wrote? Or would they grimace and ask, “What’s in it for me?”

"Influencer is a popular career choice for young people, but it has a dark side",The Conversation,2022/07/21,"
A 2019 poll found that children would rather be YouTubers than astronauts. It made headlines and led to plenty of grumbling about “kids these days”. But it’s not surprising that young people – up to 1.3 million in the UK – want to make their income by creating social media content.
The global influencer market was estimated to be worth $13.8 billion (£11.2 billion) in 2021. Individual influencers such as Zoella and Deliciously Ella are worth around £4.7 million and £2.5 million, respectively. Some 300,000 people aged 18-26 are already using content creation as their sole income source.
The lifestyles we see advertised on social media are enticing, but is influencing a viable career path? Underneath the glossy exterior lies precarious income, pay inequality based on sex, race and disability, and mental health issues. In my research with travel influencers and content creators, I have observed these impacts, which young people hoping to become influencers should be aware of.
Successful influencers will be the first to claim that anyone can make it in the industry. Love Island contestant-turned-influencer Molly Mae Hague was criticized for saying that everyone “has the same 24 hours in a day” because in reality, few people “make it” financially as influencers.
Social media economy expert Brooke Erin Duffy researches the careers of fashion bloggers, beauty vloggers, and designers. In her book (Not) Getting Paid To Do What You Love, she uncovered a huge gap between those who find lucrative careers as influencers and everyone else. For most people trying to become an influencer, their passion projects of content creation often become free work for corporate brands.
In an April 2022 report, Parliament’s Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee identified pay disparity as a key issue in the influencer industry. There are pay gaps on the basis of gender, race, and disability. The DCMS report referred to a 2020 study from MSL Group, a global public relations firm, which found a racial pay gap of 35% exists between white and Black influencers.
Adesuwa Ajayi, senior talent and partnerships lead at AGM Talent, started an Instagram account called Influencer Pay Gap to highlight these disparities. The account provides a platform where influencers anonymously share stories about their experiences of collaborating with brands. In addition to racial disparities, the account has also exposed pay gaps experienced by disabled and LGBTQ+ influencers.The DCMS report also noted a “pervasive lack of employment support and protection”. Most influencers are self-employed, often experiencing inconsistent income and a lack of protection that comes with permanent employment – such as entitlement to sick pay and holiday.
The risks of self-employment are exacerbated in the influencer industry by an absence of industry standards and little pay transparency. Influencers are often forced to assess their own value and determine fees for their work. As a result, content creators often undervalue their own creative labor, and many end up working for free.
Power to the platforms
Influencers are also often at the mercy of algorithms – the behind-the-scenes computer programs that determine which posts are shown, in which order, to users. Platforms share little detail about their algorithms, yet they ultimately determine who and what gains visibility (and influence) on social media.
In her work with Instagram influencers, algorithms expert Kelley Cotter highlights how the pursuit of influence becomes “a game of visibility”. Influencers interact with the platform (and its algorithm) in ways that they hope will be rewarded with visibility. In my research, I found that influencers shared increasingly intimate and personal moments of their lives, posting relentlessly in a bid to stay relevant.
The threat of invisibility is a constant source of insecurity for influencers, who are under constant pressure to feed platforms with content. If they don’t, they may be “punished” by the algorithm – having posts hidden or displayed lower down on search results.







Mental health crisis
Constant online presence ultimately leads to one of the most pervasive issues of the influencer industry: mental health concerns. Influencers can connect to their platform workspaces and audience at any time of day or night – for many, there is no longer a clear separation between work and life. Coupled with the fear of losing visibility, this can lead to influencers working excessively and facing mental health issues such as burnout.
Online visibility also places content creators at risk of significant online abuse –- both in relation to how they look or what they do (or don’t post), but also negative perceptions of influencing as a career. The potential of online abuse can lead to mental and physical health issues, including depression, anxiety, body dysmorphia, and eating disorders.
Although becoming an influencer may look appealing to more and more people, the industry’s dark underside needs to be made visible and improved through enhanced employment regulation and industry-led cultural change.
If you are struggling or feel you could benefit from mental health support, please speak to your GP, and/or try contacting supportive organisations such as The Seasonal Affective Disorders Association, The Samaritans or Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM). There is also information on wellbeing and support via the NHS website.

The tech community has the power to drive change — it’s time to use it for good,Rachel Gilley,2022/07/19,"
As a communications professional with more than 20 years in the industry, I can say with certainty that one of the most refreshing and hopeful changes I have seen in the past few years is the increasing authenticity and focus on social activism from tech organizations big and small.
It’s one of the reasons why I was excited to see impact at the forefront of TNW Conference 2022, bringing together leaders and changemakers to convene on topics on how tech firms can make changes that will lead us to a more inclusive and equal industry.
The world needs CHANGE
At Clarity, we are firm in our belief that businesses have a responsibility to act as citizens of the world — we cannot expect individuals to act to make change if we don’t do the same at an organizational level.
Increasingly, consumers are not taking a back seat and waiting for businesses to take a stand. They’re poking holes in corpspeak and demanding genuine change — with their dollars, their voices, and the decisions of where and how they work. For businesses to survive, they must listen to these myriad voices asking for change.
This year’s TNW Conference was of course the place to be inspired with the likes of Boyan Slat, who dropped out of university to found The Ocean Cleanup, or by Greenpeace CTO Priscilla Chomba-Kinywa, who shared her vision on delivering inclusive technology to the Global South, without falling into traps of bias and digital colonialism.
Or take TNW Startup Pitch Battle winner Swap-studio, who want us privileged Western consumers to stop shopping so much, because buying less is better than buying “green.” So why not buy NFT-traceable second-hand or end-of-life products and save a lot of H2O and CO2?
It was also heartening to see that change is not the sole purview of the young or disenfranchised, but supported by people of all generations and levels of privilege. At 67, Sir Tim Berners-Lee is aiming to ‘fix’ what went wrong with that little invention of his: the World Wide Web. Through his new company, Inrupt, and a new open source technology called Solid, he is adamant about returning data ownership to the users of the web.
Taking responsibility
Companies fixing past missteps (intentional and unintentional) and righting wrongs is what their audiences require of them. This is why we’ve moved on from ‘brand authenticity’ to embrace ‘brand activism’. It no longer serves to passively share your values and pay lip service to good causes. Companies need to walk the talk.
It’s why we need companies like Accion at the vanguard; its CEO Michael Schlein spoke at an illuminating fireside on how fintech can disrupt a global financial system that is currently failing three billion people living in poverty. We take for granted that we have credit cards, that we can buy a home, start a business. Our bills and income come on a monthly basis. For many of us, that is the norm. But think of the many farmers in vast areas of the world who get paid only once or twice a year at harvest time!
But now, “we live in a revolution of innovation,” as Schlein says. “When you’re dealing with financial services for the poor, the argument used to be that distances were insurmountable or transactions would be too small.” Technology has changed all this. Fintech companies with the right activist mentality can bring security, visibility, and opportunity to people hitherto ignored by the tech industry.
In a world that is increasingly looking like it’s in crisis, economically, politically, societally, and environmentally, we should be looking to the tech industry to help shape our future and build a cleaner, healthier, and more equitable world. Those are the companies that we work with at Clarity. Because stories that engender positive change need to be heard. We’ve already had too many negative stories about technology changing things for the worse. Let’s amplify the stories that make things better.

Pay compression is widening the gap between new and existing employees,Amanda Kavanagh,2022/06/27,"
Business owners have known the value of loyalty for a long time. From customers collecting stamps for retail loyalty programmes, to Air Miles, coupons, plastic cards and mobile apps, the mechanism has changed but the rationale remains: repeat purchases are key for growth in almost all businesses.
Similarly, businesses also know that employee loyalty will help a company advance. From driving positive customer experiences to improved productivity and production, the benefits of employee loyalty are also well documented. So why then did a recent social media post on rewarding existing employees cause such a stir?
The LinkedIn post in question was posted by Robert Sweeney, CEO at Facet and former Netflix employee, who detailed how he had been only working at Netflix a few months when the company hired someone new into the same position but at a higher salary.
Netflix increased his salary to match, a practice Sweeney has carried through at Facet. He wrote:
“If you have to pay more to hire new employees that means the market has gone up and your current employees need a raise to match. Don’t punish loyal employees for sticking with you by allowing their compensation to fall behind the market.”
Seems pretty right on, right? Well, reactions were mixed to say the least. While loyal employees commented in agreement and praise — with one eye on the rising cost of living. Others argued against the practice, saying that in this difficult hiring market, companies need to offer above market rates to attract talent and that, when it stabilizes, they’ll be at a competitive disadvantage to those that didn’t hire during this time.
Resentment festering
The reality is, it’s demotivating for loyal employees to see a newbie breeze in on a higher salary, especially if it’s in a role with less responsibility. That annual 3% salary bump loyal employees get — if they’re lucky — is hard-earned. Resentment can fester and grow quickly in this environment.
A Jabra report also says that, since the pandemic began, 48% of all employees surveyed have considered changing jobs. In one short year, we’ve bounded from The Great Resignation to the Great Layoff, with 17,000 tech workers laid off in May 2022 alone. Meanwhile, a Microsoft survey of more than 30,000 global workers earlier this year found that four in 10 were likely to consider changing jobs in 2022.
For those companies who are hiring, particularly into remote roles, there is a lot of strong talent available at the moment. And at the same time, between inflation, investment freezes as interest rates rise, and looking ahead to a looming recession, many companies are acting cautiously.
The consequence of these elements is what labor economists call “salary compression.” As companies tighten their belts on current salaries, they’re also paying higher salaries to attract new talent, causing the gap between the two to widen.
On paper, your salary is meant to align with your experience, results, and skills, but that isn’t always the case. Job hunters have always known that being a new recruit is the most powerful position to negotiate a better salary. If you are demotivated by salary compression in your workplace and feel undervalued, it may be time for a change.
List and put in order your priorities for a new role and consider: flexible working, salary, title, benefits, management, progression, hours, company mission, and company culture. Then hit up the TNW House of Talent Job Board to see what’s out there. You’ll find good starting salaries at plenty of organizations. We’ve got three to check out below.

We need to remove the stigma around leadership burnout,Samantha Johnson,2022/06/27,"
When it comes to leadership in today’s startup world, founders, and CEOs are chained to their work more than ever before due to high investor demands, increasingly blurred lines between personal and professional life thanks to remote work, and tech that enables them to be reached — and reach out to employees — 24/7.
But this always-on approach can also lead to higher risk of stress and even burnout. While, since the pandemic started, employee burnout has been put in the spotlight, leadership burnout still remains taboo.
“Particularly in technology, the spirit of entrepreneurship is fast becoming one of toil, long hours, and self-sacrifice,” writes James Routledge, founder and mental health author, in The Guardian.
Angel investors, accelerators and venture capitalists (VCs) encourage startups to work harder, move faster, and, in some cases, ‘sleep faster’. The yardstick has seemingly become hours worked, and who can leave the office the latest. What began as a journey for work-life balance has descended into the rat race most were aiming to avoid.
70% of tech startups fail — no wonder leaders are chained to their Slack.
The truth is that, while more and more leaders are promoting mental health and burnout awareness amongst their employees, by failing to address their own mental health, harmful practices can trickle down throughout the company culture.
So how can we identify leadership burnout and prevent it from happening?
The warning signs
In order to avoid burnout, the first step is being able to recognize the symptoms, which can be a huge challenge in a pressure cooker startup environment.
“Burnout is the combination of three emotions: exhaustion, negativity, and ineffectiveness,” says Cavin Benton, founder and CEO of Spill, a startup that offers a message-based therapy app to improve workplace well-being.
The feelings of negativity and ineffectiveness are what differentiate it from regular tiredness or exhaustion. And it’s different from depression in that it’s purely work-related — you don’t burn out from relationship issues or life stressors, for example.
Benton says leaders should ask themselves the following questions to identify burnout in their workers:

Do they seem more irritable, or regularly exhausted?
Do they tend to point out the worst in everything that happens or is suggested?
Are they quicker to shoot down other people’s ideas?
Do they give off the idea that any work you’re giving them just feels like a burden?
Are they dropping the ball at work when they usually wouldn’t?
Are they producing less ideas, or being slower to respond?

But when it comes to identifying burnout in yourself, it can get a bit trickier, as many startup leaders have trouble setting the same boundaries for themselves as they do their workers.
In Techleap’s new video series, All In, they interview several of the Netherland’s most well-known founders, from Swapfiets’ Richard Burger to Fairphone CEO Eva Gouwens. When asked how much they are their work, nearly all respondents answered similarly:

“I think I’m 100% my work,” says Lieke Pijpers, founder and CPTO of secondhand fashion platform The Next Closet.
Willemijn Schneyder-Valbracht, CEO and founder of manufacturing performance platform Swipeguide, says:
I am my work, and my work is me.
“Swapfiets is a large part of my identity because I started at a very young age (22) and, seven years later, this has been a quarter of my life,” says Richard Burger, founder of Swapfiets.
One big sign that leaders could be heading towards a burnout is feeling “used up” at the end of the workday — nearly 60% of leaders reportedly do.
Mark-Jan Harte, cofounder and CEO of healthtech Aidence says,
If I work too much, then after a couple of weeks, I just crash and I can’t keep it up. And so if it’s something that I can’t do, I can’t ask anyone else to do that either.
Even those who were skeptical at first are now becoming more aware of the effects that overwork can bring. In the All In video series, Ugnius Rimsa, cofounder and CTO of Lalaland, which develops virtual inclusive fashion models, told Techleap:
“I was always a big nonbeliever of burnout. I was like okay this is not really possible or it’s kind of like made-up.” But the fast-paced life of an entrepreneur shifted his thinking. “I wouldn’t say I reached burnout, it was more of like you get a creative barrier where you’re not really creative anymore. That’s what happened to me.”
While the symptoms are becoming more clear, in order to prevent it, it’s important to take a deeper look at some of the causes.
What’s passion got to do with it?
In a study published in the Harvard Business Review, researchers found that passion and destiny beliefs (the belief that a successful entrepreneurial career is “meant to be”) make entrepreneurs more or less likely to experience burnout.
Job passion was divided into two types:
Harmonious passion, or when entrepreneurs are motivated by their job because they’re passionate about the subject and it’s an important part of who they are.
Obsessive passion, or entrepreneurs who were motivated by status, money, and other rewards.
As one might guess, entrepreneurs who are motivated by status or money are more likely to experience burnout.
This comes through quite clearly in some of the successful leadership teams that have grown in the Netherlands. For example, Michiel Roodenburg, CFO at Crisp, an online-only supermarket focused on fresh produce, told Techleap:
I have a strong opinion about food. I like discussing it with my family. I even visit suppliers with my kids. It’s part of my personal life.
Destiny beliefs added yet another layer to the cake. If you’re familiar with psychologist Carol Dweck’s fixed vs growth mindset, the researchers found that entrepreneurs who believe that entrepreneurial success is meant to be or not were more likely to experience burnout. Meanwhile, those with a more flexible mindset were less likely to report feeling burned out.
Of course, burnout can happen even to entrepreneurs with a harmonious passion for their job and a flexible mindset. This happens most often when harmful workplace behaviors seep into the company culture.
The “burnout-proof” workplace
When it comes to “burnout-proofing” the workplace, nearly all experts say the same thing — empathy is key, and founders should lead by example.
Jennifer Moss, a workplace expert and author, says that empathetic leadership can be demonstrated by making sure workers are taking time off, knowing their workforce (for example: are they parents? Do they have financial struggles?), and, as Covid-19 continues to play a factor in peoples’ everyday lives, keeping them physically safe in the workplace.
The way leaders treat workplace communication often sets the tone for the rest of the organization.

In another episdoe of All In, Swapfiets founder Richard Burger tells Techleap he used to feel he could text or email an employee at any time of the day:
I didn’t really care about when I worked, it was also a bit maybe egocentric to get it out of my head — then it was gone. But then you’re just putting it in someone else’s head. So I used to do it but I stopped as long as it’s not urgent.
And while a manager might not expect their employee to respond in the middle of the night, they could be unknowingly putting pressure on them, something Swipeguide’s Schneyder-Valbracht says could be down to cultural differences:
There’s a lot of differences in work cultures. So if I send over a message in the middle of the night, I don’t expect someone to read or respond to it. But if you come from a different culture or social setting, you might feel like you have to answer because that’s the environment you were raised in.
Eva Gouwens, CEO Fairphone, says the pivot to remote work had her rethink how often she was reaching out to employees:
I changed a bit in that sense last year. Many people needed to work from home and you saw that those boundaries were less clear and everything blurred a bit. So I got a bit more strict around this.
Making sure to take time off themselves is a good way for leaders to not only prevent their own burnout, but also set a good example for their employees. Several of Techleap’s featured founders said that setting boundaries for their after hours is key:
“The rule in our house is that phones stay downstairs. No one has a phone in the bedroom, and you don’t pick it up until the morning,” says WeTransfer’s Bradfield.
“I try to turn off my phone or at least not be actively working with it when I come home,” says Swapfiets’ Burger.
Ultimately, burnout culture is something that can sneak up on anyone — and while founders may be tempted to work long hours, send midnight emails, and skip vacations, what they do sets an example for the rest of the company.

How to bootstrap your startup with €50K – €200K of European funding,Alejandro Tauber,2022/06/27,"
In my previous job at a startup based in Amsterdam, my job description was – how to put this – ‘flexible’. As a non-technical member of a company developing a new kind of scalable, real-time graph database that was still under development, possibilities for marketing were limited, sales would be preliminary, and branding was still dependent on positioning.
As any early-stage startup member, I had to find something to do that would contribute to the company. I had a vague inkling that the European Commission had made vast quantities of funding available to SMEs for innovative ideas, but no idea where to start looking.
This led me on a bureaucratic quest to find out how we could get a slice of that pie. And let me tell you, it was not easy. Which is exactly why I want to share what I learned with you, because finding EU funding can be a great stopgap between bootstrapping and more serious financing rounds –– or just building your way to revenue without dilution.
Let me tell you about cascade funding.
For this article, I spoke to many people involved at some point in the cascade, and all of them agreed this type of funding is shamefully unknown and hard to navigate as a time-strapped startup employee, while still offering significant financial and business support to fledgling projects.
What is cascade funding?
Under the Horizon 2020 program, the European Commission earmarked around €800 million for a “mechanism to distribute public funding in order to assist beneficiaries, such as start-ups, scale-ups, SME and/or mid-caps, in the uptake or development of digital innovation.”
This mechanism is officially known as Financial Support for Third Parties (FSTP), but is colloquially called cascade funding. The idea is that instead of startups entering into a funding agreement directly with the European Commission or affiliate organizations, funding would be distributed to consortia of companies that act as intermediaries to distribute funds.
These consortiums in their turn set up open calls to which startups or scale-ups can apply, and provide (mostly) equity-free grants for participants of those programs.
Funding in these schemes starts at €5,000, but can go up to €500,000, and is normally coupled with business support services for selected startups – either in a type of accelerator, free services like security audits, or by offering access to a network of similar companies and organizations.
All of this might sound great, but rather vague, so let’s look at some examples of how this actually works.
Let’s look at some examples
In April 2020, a consortium consisting of an education non-profit, an accelerator organizer, and a funding platform launched IMPACT EdTech. The hybrid incubator/accelerator is designed to help European EdTech startups build out prototypes into viable products.
After an initial pitching round, 17 startups were selected to receive about €80,000 as an equity-free lump sum payment and mentoring services to develop an MVP. With this MVP, startups would again go through a selection process, with seven of them continuing to the next round.
In this phase, startups received an additional €90,000 as an equity-free grant, and got help introducing their innovation to “relevant education ministries, investors and potential partners.
This whole cycle was repeated three times between April 2020 and July 2022.
In a similar vein, programs like STADIEM for startups in the media tech industry, BlockStart for blockchain companies, AI4Europe for AI companies, ROBOTUNION for robotics, IMPACT Connected Car for connected mobility, NGI Assure for cryptography and security startups, and S+T+ARTS for art and technology projects all offer different levels of funding, prizes or support for European companies.
What kind of startup programs are there?
In general, there are a few different types of programs. Accelerators like STADIEM offer grants in combination with business support programs, and usually higher levels of funding. Others, such as NGI Assure, offer a lump sum of up to €50,000 to startups or individual developers. Some consortia offer vouchers for international travel and collaboration. And finally, there are prizes which clock in at around €20,000.
The big advantage of these cascade funding schemes is that the application process is usually manageable in terms of time invested. Unlike large-scale funding programs like the ones organized by the EIC, applications take days to prepare rather than months.
As an example, the application form for the recently launched NGI0 Entrust program for ‘privacy and trust enhancing technologies’ consists of 13 open fields –– and those include name, email address, and phone number. Initial funding starts from €5,000, but according to Michiel Leenaars, Director of Strategy at NLNet, can go up to €500,000 for projects that prove themselves important in the initial stage.
“I think that we have proven that passing on the responsibility of allocating funding to socially responsible organizations can create huge benefits,” Leenaars says. “In some of our programs, 95% of participants have never received funds from the European Commission (EC).”
Another benefit he mentions, is that you are not dealing with a faceless EC entity, but rather a group of people invested in your success as a startup –– and with that, their success as a funding distributor.
The EC also sees the benefits of delegating fund allocation to consortia that actually care about their mission and know about the industry they’re investing in.
How do startup founders feel about cascade funding?
Overall, startups seem to be very happy with these cascade funding programs.
Thomas Ketchell, of education startup Sutori, told us that they “were fortunate to get the support of ImpactEdTech that provided us with three pilot schools, one in Italy, Czech Republic and Slovakia to pilot Sutori and see if we can get traction with European schools. The funding enabled us to translate the platform and grow the platform.”
This is in stark contrast to the EIC Accelerator debacle that’s playing out as this article is written.
Under its most ambitious scaleup investment program, the European Commission set up the European Innovation Council to find and fund the most promising European deep tech companies –– with grant funding up to €2,5 million and equity investments up to €15 million.
As it turns out, the EIC is having some trouble in managing and distributing the funds, with scaleups that signed grant agreements back in July 2021 still not having received funds, and EC commissioners threatening to cut the program if this is not fixed soon.
The cascade funding scheme is set to continue under Horizon Europe, the successor program to Horizon 2020. It’s still unclear how much of the €95.5 billion fund will be allocated to cascade funding, but the success of the previous programs will inform the level of funding.
For those who are not faint of heart in the daunting face of European bureaucracy, the Funding and Tenders portal now offers an option to filter by cascade funding. Beware though, if you google ‘cascade funding tenders,’ then you’ll get a result called ‘Competitive calls and calls for third parties,’ which does not include all cascade funding opportunities currently available. Fun, right?
From my experience, there are tons of consultancies and services that offer guidance for these types of grants –– but also from my experience, you don’t really need them for cascade funding. With a little bit of practice, anyone can penetrate the Funding and Tenders portal’s obtuseness and find that bit of cash or support that might just help kickstart your startup. And if you still have questions, hit me up on Twitter, happy to help out.

7 successful product development strategies team leads can steal from big tech companies,.cult,2022/06/23,"
This article was originally published on .cult by Yasas Sri Wickramasinge. .cult is a Berlin-based community platform for developers. We write about all things career-related, make original documentaries, and share heaps of other untold developer stories from around the world.
All the successful product engineering teams have one common practice: a winning product development strategy. But, it is not realistic to find a universal product development strategy for different product teams.
This article presents seven different yet successful product development strategies so you can create your own plan or improve the existing strategies inspired by these practices.
1. Purpose-driven independent squads: Spotify strategy
The world popular music streaming platform, Spotify, has a speciality in their organizational hierarchy. Instead of having a conventional management structure, Spotify maintains different groups called Squads, Tribes, Alliances, and Guilds. This is entirely new labelling of group structures is inspired by the “Growth Mindset.”
Together with this different organizational structure, they’ve developed the “Spotify Model,” their own version of product development.
This model gives each product team (“Squad”) freedom to pick their preferred project management frameworks such as Agile Scrum, Kanban, or others.

Each team in the same organization performs in their way. However, the Spotify model encourages Squads to work together on high-level objectives. When multiple Squads are together to address high-level goals, that composite group structure is called a “Tribe”.
The next category is the “Chapter”, which is an independent entiry with extremely advanced specialization in specific areas such as Quality Assurance, User Experience, Application Security, etc. Usually, chapters include senior leads or architects, and they help each Squad level up their product.
In addition to these fundamental roles, there are more classifications in the Spotify Model, and you can explore more from here.
If you are a tech lead looking forward to inspiring your team to fasten the development process while keeping inter-team collaborations simple, the Spotify Model is worth a look.

2. Work backwards: the Amazon strategy
This is a pretty interesting tactic mastered by Amazon. The main idea is to reverse engineer the product, starting from the customer’s point of view.
Amazon’s Working Backward Model

Interestingly, they propose to start directly with a press release, announcing the product to the market. Initially, it sounds strange, but the main goal is to evaluate the market opportunity straightway. If the product is not a good fit, this strategy is the fastest way to know about it.
If the product idea seems a market hit, then the remaining steps in this strategy are executed in a manner that the process comes outside to internal working teams.
This more customer-oriented strategy is ideal if you focus on developing an entirely new product.
3. Product playbooks: Typeform’s strategy
The term “Playbook” is common in American Football, which refers to a book that holds team strategies, tactics and plays.
The Playbook holds hundreds of ways of previous experiences of team, what went well and worked out for them.
Like the Playbook concept in sports, Typeform adapted this to their product development strategy and improved their processes to the next level.

According to the Playbook concept, the main focus is to deliver testable, usable and lovable products as fast as possible.
The Playbook Strategy has 2 separate main paths as Discovery and Delivery to achieve that.

Discovery — Brainstorming a precious product idea that can create a high-value proposition solving an existing problem in the market.
Delivery — After discovering the product, delivery contains actionable steps to scope the project, execution process and measuring the delivery artefacts.

However, it is worth mentioning that this strategy is not linear but more toward an iterative process, which allows everyone to go back and forth and continuously improve the product.
Suppose you plan to develop a product development strategy that helps the organization in the long run. In that case, it is worth digging deep into this strategy and grabbing what works for you.

4. Maximize customer adaption and retention: Netflix’s strategy
As a movie streaming service, Netflix has the ultimate goal of attracting more subscribers to their platform and retaining them as long as they can. Their product development strategy is tailor-made to achieve this ultimate goal under 4 main subcategories.

Personalization
Original Content
Watching Experience
Interactive Storytelling

These focus areas help them build a unique product with a highly accepted market brand, which keeps them ahead of the competition. All the development work is identified under the above 4 categories and performed quarterly. Hence, every product update release addresses all of those aims, providing a better customer experience at the end of the day.
This strategy inspires companies that are looking forward to maximizing customer engagement.
5. Product and service diversification: product development strategy of Google

From productivity tools, entertainment services to hardware devices like Pixel phones are produced by this tech giant, Google. Therefore, it is interesting to sneak a peak at their product development strategy.
Google’s main objective is to create an eco-system that captures users, retains them, and consumes more Google Products.
Due to their continuously improving eco-system, the company is generating more and more profits and unbreakable brand awareness and attractive new internet users.
When growing the product portfolio of Google, the below 2 sub-strategies they follow are noticeable.

Company and Product Acquisition — As a tech industry leader, Google sometimes acquires rising talent as a product or company acquisition. Then they further develop that newly acquired product under their branding.
Vertical Integration across various Industries — Google is not limited to information technology or internet services. Still, also they work together with other industries such as computer hardware manufacturing, marketing and entertainment. They sell their services to different sectors through specialisations and generate more revenues.

Google’s product development strategy might not directly relate to small or medium-scale software companies. Still, the way they execute their product expansions inspires growing product teams to follow.
6. Concept testing: Booking.com Strategy
The main objective of this strategy is “Fail Fast, Learn Faster”, which is pioneered by booking.com. They engineer multiple prototype versions/conceptual products, deploy to the public, and gather data to understand customer preferences and engagement with their products.
When there are slightly different versions of the same concept, this strategy (also known as AB Testing) is handy to experiment and pick the best one.
The concept testing approach especially helps when you have an initial product in place, but still you have multiple concepts to improve the existing product or more state-of-the-art features which you are not very sure about the usability aspects.
7. Product mindset: the winning product strategy
The winning product strategy is another product specialization strategy tailor-made to the software industry. The core of this model is the “Product Mindset”.
Image source: Winning product
This strategy is an all-rounder in the software product development lifecycle covering the ideation to product retirement phases, focusing on being ahead of the competition.
There is a community behind the Winning Product Model. They have unveiled a Winning Product Toolkit that provides a canvas and strategy tools.
Suppose you are looking for a more sustainable, low-risk software product development strategy to try out. In that case, the Winning Product Strategy is worth a look.
Your tool kit to build a winning software product
Final thoughts
Product development strategies are unique and not clearly exposed to the outer world. Still, it is worth studying the available information related to some popular organizations.
However, I believe I could present some insights about some successful strategies to you from this article. I wish you all the best with implementing your own version of a product development strategy taking your product to the next level!
“Great Products Don’t Happen By Accident”
"
Experts explain how to recruit the right C-suite for your scaleup,Alejandro Tauber,2022/06/23,"
The line between startup and scaleup can be quite murky, but most agree that a startup becomes a scaleup once the “growth chasm” is crossed –– meaning they’ve solved challenges like market research and development, and have identified a scalable business model.
According to academics, a scaleup is, “a high growth firm whose accelerated cycle of growth and wealth creation is fundamentally based on the scalability of its business model.”
But having solved those initial problems, new problems arise. Techleap.nl, a team dedicated to empowering Dutch tech companies, recently released a series of video interviews in which they ask successful scaleup founders about the biggest issues they’ve encountered while growing. Hiring the right people and maintaining a close-knit community was one of them:

This is especially the case for your leadership team. As Skype founding management team member James Bilefield told McKinsey:
At the heart of every successful scaleup you need a great mix of skills, attitude, and resilience in the founding team, who make the time in their crazy schedules to attract, develop, and retain the very best talent.
While a certain drive is needed in a founding team to go from concept to startup. Sometimes new skills are needed to lead the bridge between startup and scaleup. This is typically the time when a company needs to bring onboard external CFOs, CTOs, CMOs, CPOs, COOs, and even CEOs with experience in managing the challenges faced by much larger and growing organizations.
But how do you know when you need to start looking? And who should you be looking for? We put these questions to some seasoned experts in the field to find out how to successfully hire into the C-Suite, without ruining your company on the way.
How to know when to start looking
Simple: “If things are not growing, that leads to problems.” Guido van Nispen, who has served in executive roles at corporates, public institutions and non-profits, held supervisory board positions across a broad range of companies, and founded a startup in the cybersecurity insurance industry, has pretty much seen it all.
According to him, the process of deciding to hire a new member of the C-suite is not something that happens overnight.
“Every phase of an organization has stakeholders, and those stakeholders ask for a type of management in the C-suite,” he says. For a startup, generalists are normally well suited people who are comfortable with ambiguity and can easily switch from customer service to pitching.
But when a company starts growing, this changes. “First you have no board. Then you might get investors. Then you get a board at the scaleup level. And once you land serious financing, you also get serious oversight,” van Nispen says. And that oversight can reveal that certain roles need to be created, or existing people need to be replaced.
This is also the phase when cracks in the founding team start to show themselves seriously. Before becoming founder of VC firm CapitalT, Eva de Mol, conducted research on psychological traits that can lead to these fissures. She says:
Moving into a scaleup, you need specialists. And that can be hard, because sometimes people who founded the company just don’t fit anymore.
Sometimes they just like being generalists, or the culture might have changed, and they no longer like working at the company.
Whatever the reason is, whether it’s to replace someone who’s not happy in their newly minted role as CFO after doing both finance and marketing, or because sales growth simply isn’t meeting expectations, this is when it’s time to start looking.
How to start looking
Once you know that it’s time to hire someone into an executive role, get ready for a process that can take a considerable amount of time.
First of all, the final decision to replace someone can often take six months or more.
“If you say we’ll grow 100% and become the market leader in two new countries in the next two quarters, then that’s what the board will be expecting,” van Nispen says. Often, the board will give the responsible department head a few board meetings to catch up.
“But if you see that things aren’t improving or keep being unpredictable,” van Nispen says, it’s time to put feelers out for possible replacements.
While there are many recruiters who offer executive search services, the search normally starts through the board according to van Nispen. Board members don’t only have a wide network at their disposal, they also know the company intimately and can introduce candidates who might be a good fit.
Two things are important to have clear before setting out to find a new candidate. First, a company needs to know the cause of the initial problem.
“Maybe the finances were a mess, but if you don’t know if that was because the current CFO was not great with spreadsheets or if the CTO consistently spent too much without oversight, you’re not going to solve the problem,” says van Nispen.
Second, you need to have a clear and unanimous strategic goal.
Say you want to conquer the German market in the next year. This market has its particularities, and if you hire someone who has to learn all of them, instead of someone who has expanded to Germany before, that’s a big risk.
How to attract experienced C-suite material
Now, let’s say you’ve set your goals and identified the problems. How do you attract suitable candidates?
Everyone is aware of the ongoing ‘war for talent’ facing scaleups. A seasoned CFO can have their pick of exciting companies to work for, so why should they choose you?
Good compensation is probably not the (only) answer. C-suite roles at scaleups all offer similar salaries, stock, and benefits.
There are some tweaks you could make in offering shorter vesting schedules, and tying incentive packages to clear growth paths — e.g. more shares after raising a next round, or at a certain revenue milestone, depending on the role you’re filling.
But van Nispen is convinced: “the most important thing is that you have to really sell the company and its mission.” It has to be an exciting opportunity that fits within their background and experience, and offers challenges that fit well with their personality.
Who should you look for
De Mol’s research focused on how different types of entrepreneurial passions in people work together to create better performing companies — or dysfunctional ones. She says:
It’s all about people. You can have great plans and amazing financial forecasts, but the people have to execute those. And that’s hard. So the team is incredibly important.
De Mol conducted research into the role of passion in entrepreneurship, and developed a model that scores passion intensity in three distinct categories.
First, there are entrepreneurs who are passionate about founding. They love setting up a business, scaling it, selling it, and doing it all over again. Second, there are people who are passionate about inventing — creating new, better products and innovations. And finally there are people who thrive on developing things like team-building, culture, and are more people-focused.
While her research focused more on early-stage startups, she found leadership teams that differed too much in their type of passion, “led to negative effects on fundraising, number of employees, and longevity.”
Difference in intensity of passion was another indicator of success or failure. Leadership teams that had some people scoring very high, and others very low often didn’t succeed in leading a company effectively.
She mentions that more and more VCs are taking these types of personality tests along with due diligence processes. So even for scaleups it can be useful to map out how the current leadership scores, and how potential hires fit in.
But most importantly
Everyone we spoke to agreed that one thing is most important in hiring into the C-suite: strategic alignment.
Having clear goals allows scaleups to determine what a new CTO, CFO, CPO, CCO, or even CEO needs to be good at, and what they need to focus on. This in turn creates a clear job description, with actionable challenges the company is facing. Ultimately, this leads to better communication with the board, allowing a company to make full use of its most experienced contributors.
Now whether the goal is to become a market leader in Germany within the next year, to gain the financing needed to scale to 1000 employees in two years, to create new products based on customer feedback, or, like Skype’s Bilefield “to become a verb,” it’s paramount that everybody involved agrees on these goals.
De Mol told us that with unanimous strategic alignment, even differences in type of passion can be overcome, and even be a strength, as complimentary passions leading to the same goal can strengthen each other.
Van Nispen also stressed that it might be wise to agree on what happens if those goals are not met — even before hiring a new leader. Doing that makes it clear for everyone what the steps are before having to go through the whole process again.

"Forget the remote vs in-office debate, we need a personalized approach",Ben Marks and Leanna Lee,2022/06/22,"
Work-life balance or integration? Remote, hybrid, or return to office? In the past few years, tech companies have tried to redefine the best approach to work. But as groundbreaking as some of these new ideas are, many still miss the point: there’s no one-size-fits-all solution in a post-COVID working world.
Work-life debaters generally fall into two main camps: the separators (or balancers) and the integrators. Separators tend to want strong boundaries between work and life, like keeping set hours and “clocking” out of the office at the end of the workday. Integrators, on the other hand, go for a more blended approach and may compromise by taking work calls during family time or bringing their kids to the office. Crucially, both of these perspectives have been largely based on in-office work.
Then came 2020, when millions had to work from home. Suddenly, employees found themselves juggling work and family life in the same spaces, often homeschooling kids and taking Zoom calls from their kitchen tables. Full-time workers began reporting longer workdays and increased stress and burnout, leading many to wonder if remote work would mean the end of work-life balance as we know it.
And in some ways, it has.
Individualization, the next post-pandemic work challenge 
At a recent roundtable hosted by #WorkAnywhere, WeWork, Zoom, and Remote met with European Parliament and Commission members to discuss the future of work-life balance.
Remote quoted Ivanti’s 2022 Everywhere Workplace report, which states that 71% of workers would prefer to work from anywhere, anytime, while 43% had seen better work-life balance due to remote work.
WeWork shared the importance of combining face-to-face interaction with hybrid solutions. According to their recent survey with Economic Impact, 75% of workers desire flexibility to work between home, an office, and a ‘third space’. Zoom added that flexibility in the workplace leads to widespread cost savings, better mental health, and reduced dependence on large urban centers.
The consensus: companies need a range of flexible work-life management solutions that support individual needs and work styles.
Two people, two approaches to work
There’s no better way to illustrate the importance of individual approaches to work than by looking at our own careers. On the surface, we are two campaigners in the future of work space with similar interests and goals.
But dig a bit deeper and you can see how different our approaches have been.
Separating work and life
Ben was a success-crazed overachiever who adjusted to a healthier way of living and launched the #WorkAnywhere campaign.
Ben: By 24, I’d already sold a company, and was Head of Innovation for one of the world’s biggest media brands. I had everything I ever wanted, except that my anxiety disorder was escalating, and I even developed scary physical symptoms like extreme fatigue, headaches, and nausea. Since doctors had no clue what was going on, I turned to CBT, a therapy which is based on the concept that one’s thoughts, feelings, physical sensations, and actions are interconnected. My therapist helped me to identify my work addiction — and the chronic stress this caused — as the root of the problem.
To stay “sober”, Ben’s taken a more rigid approach to separating his work and personal life by setting strict boundaries for himself, like no work in the evenings or on weekends, and no phone before 7am.
Here’s what Ben’s average workday looks like:

Before 9am: Exercise, meditation/therapy techniques, and reading (no breakfast due to intermittent fasting)
9am-1pm: Work until midday, hour break for lunch (“deep work” in the morning and meetings in the afternoon)
1-6pm: Work again for a few hours, long walk, wrap up work

While his schedule can vary, Ben’s main goal is to avoid falling into the workaholic’s trap of “making up” the extra time he spends on his personal life. Rather than shooting for perfection, he aims for 70% productivity each day. The temptation to slip back into the old ways is always there. But hopefully Ben has learnt his lesson.
A more flexible, integrated schedule
Future of work and wellbeing writer and digital nomad Leanna has been self-employed her whole professional life, choosing to create her own work structure for mental health reasons.
Leanna: I’ve lived with PTSD, anxiety, and depression for over 15 years and learned early on that the traditional workplace wouldn’t be a great fit. After a variety of freelance gigs and part-time work after university, I started my own freelance business in 2016 (also finally got myself into therapy). In the past 6 years, I’ve set plenty of healthy boundaries for myself, but since my mental health is a daily issue for me, complete separation is not an option. Flexibility is, quite literally, what keeps me alive.
Leanna’s energy levels and ability to function can change drastically day-to-day. So while she has an ideal schedule in mind, heightened anxiety and depressive episodes dictate when, how, and how long she can work.
On a good mental health day, her workday looks something like this:

Before 7:30am: Tea, reading and start work
7:30-10/10:30am: Work and take calls for at least two hours
10:00/10:30-4pm: Breakfast, time with husband, lunch and chores, sometimes with short bursts of work in between
4-8pm: Errands, long walk and back to work for a few hours, depending on the day

On bad days when she still has to be productive, Leanna works 7 days a week (instead of her regular 5-6) for a couple of hours a day, combining short bursts of work with long breaks. Instead of a set schedule, her boundaries revolve more around the types of projects and clients she takes on, her workload, deadlines, and managing her energy day-to-day.
No more separation vs integration
Together, our personal choices have helped shape two different, yet healthy approaches to work. Now, you could argue that Ben prefers work-life balance, while Leanna is more of an integrator, but the reality is not that simple.
The danger of taking sides in the work-life separation or integration debate is that most people don’t fit comfortably into one box or another. In fact, a 2016 study shows that there is a wide spectrum within work-life separation and integration and the majority of people fall into four different work boundary style groups, not just two.
If one side were to “win” the debate today, we would both lose out. Because ultimately, having the freedom and flexibility to create our own schedules is equally important to both of us: it allows us to work and live well.
Shaping the new world of work
The world of work has come a long way since 2020, but we’ve got a ways to go. Hybrid and remote work, though both great concepts, are still more work-life management battlegrounds than actual solutions. We need to think further forward, giving employees the power to decide when, where and how they work.
So, where should tech companies begin? How about turning the concept of work-life balance on its head:
“We’ve been saying ‘work-life balance’, but life comes first, then work,” says Remote’s VP of Special Operations, Filipa Matos. “…this is something we’ve been advocating at Remote: work is a part of life, not the other way around.”
Here are a few ways businesses can support personalized life-work management:

Create a range of flexible work policies that address main areas of friction for workers like work scheduling, work locations, and paid leave.
Build a work culture that supports employee ownership.
Advocate for government policies that build on individual rights in and outside of the workplace.

Remote is a great example of a company thinking forward about work-life management. Their list of employee benefits includes company self-care days, home office and coworking allowances, and generous leave offerings as well as flexible scheduling. More importantly, though, they’ve created a work culture that encourages employees to shape their workdays.
Remote’s company values state, “We trust you to do what is in the best interest of the company… It’s up to you to decide how you do your job at Remote.” Their public handbook also helps managers and workers alike navigate a more flexible working life, breaking down each benefit in-depth with examples and communication guidance.
Every company has a take on what work should look like. But by refocusing employee benefits and work culture to center around individual needs, we can not only encourage workers to live healthier lives, but empower them to do so.
After all, there is no one “right” way to work, but many.

"Avoid these common startup funding mistakes, say 3 founders-turned-investors",Cate Lawrence,2022/06/20,"
There are plenty of VCs keen to impart their knowledge on how to get funded, but what if you could gain insights from investors who have first-hand knowledge of seeing investment? 
At this year’s TNW Conference, three VC partners who’d previously made the jump from successful founder to investor presented a panel on the crucial efforts they learned along the way. 
The panelists were:

Bryony Cooper, Managing Partner, Arkley Brinc VC: The company encompasses and hardware VC Fund and an acceleration program with the goal of investment.
Johan van Mil, Co-founder and Managing Partner, PEAK. The company invests in a broad range of marketplace, platform, and SaaS companies across a range of verticals. 
Jan Miczaika, Partner, HV Capital: HV’s funds invest early with initial tickets between € 500k and € 5m. The company focuses on transportation, logistics, supply chain, and storage. 

During the session, the panelists not only provided an insight into their journey from founder to investor, but offered great insider perspectives, with a whole lot of tangible takeaways for startups looking to get their company funded. 
What are the biggest differences between the experience of a founder and an investor?
The roles of founder and investor are vastly different. Miczaika described an investor’s experience as being “one step removed.” The position requires you to have a broad market view, and there’s plenty of time spent talking to interesting people, but you “don’t really do anything anymore.” 
Van Mil described the experience of a founder and investor as having fundamentally different energy and work prioritization. Startups have sprinting marathons, while “as an investor, it’s more like a marathon where you also have to sprint.” 
Here’s what startup founders get wrong in seeking funding from VCs:
The panelists have collectively connected with hundreds, if not thousands, of startups seeking funding. They shared some of the most common things that startups get wrong: 
 1. Not doing homework 
Your pitch deck is a vital tool for promoting your startup and the investment opportunity. Miczaika gets at least four-pitch decks daily by email. So you need to compete for his attention. 
Details matter, according to Van Mil and Cooper. Investors are busy people, and much like when you complete a job application, you need to provide all the necessary information in a compelling way. 
Van Mil asserted that using MailChimp to send investors the same mass email is bad, especially when you get their name wrong. 
Cooper advises companies seeking funding to be well-prepared with up to date documentation. Your financials and desired milestones should be documented and organized. “Otherwise, as you grow, things get really messy really fast.” 
In most VC companies, different team members focus on specific verticals. So, reaching out to the investor whose interests represent your company is important. Otherwise, as van Mil notes, “it’s a wasted step in the journey that could have been faster.”
2. Selling your idea but not your company to VCs
Van Mil shared that you should not just seeking funding but collaboration with the VC fund most suited to your business and industry. Think about where the VC stands in your timeline: “Ask them what their successes are. For example, is their focus early-stage or more established companies?”

3. Not understanding your market or product community
Part of doing your homework is understanding what you are trying to achieve and where it sits compared to existing and up-and-coming tech. Miczaika asserted, “We want to invest in groundbreaking ideas. Is there traction? Is there someone willing to pay?” 
Building community is also vital. For example, in the case of software, getting developers already using your software and providing feedback. The more evidence you have that there is a market for your product, the better. 
4. Lacking people skills 
VC invest in people, not just products
One of the most important attributes a founder can have is people skills. 
Funders are investing in people, not just an idea, and in many sectors, investors may introduce you to your very first clients, especially in the B2B space. 
Cooper stressed the importance of emotional intelligence over IQ, discussing the need for good communication skills to convince customers and partners to come on board. A strong sense of entitlement or ego won’t endear you to anyone. As she shared: 
“If you can’t convince me in fine minutes that you are likable, you won’t convince people to buy your product.”
What about the impact economic downturn on investing? 
After a bull market, it’s a difficult time for many startups. The pandemic, invasion of Ukraine, increases in energy prices, and supply chain woes have left some sectors in a downtime. 
However, Cooper stressed: “The downturn is not in all sectors. There’s never the right time to make any life-changing decisions, whether having a baby or starting a new business. What are the needs of my company in this market?” She notes that venture investment is not the only option, with companies at different stages having success with crowd and angel investing. 
Seeking investment means going all in
Sourcing money is time-consuming, and challenging. It can be a tricky balance between being charismatic and being your authentic self. Everyone you meet might be a potential investor or in a position to provide you with a warm introduction to one. 
But it’s also an opportunity to get feedback on your business idea, connect with people in your industry, and potentially gain board members and advisors. 
Many industries are in a state of flux right now or even downsizing. Therefore, building relationships with people investing or focused on your industry, especially with people with first-hand experience weathering capable situations, is more valuable than ever. It should be a top priority in taking your company to the next step.

We’re in the age of hybrid working: How to make it work for your team,The Conversation,2022/05/17,"
After more than two years of disruptions, lockdowns and uncertainty, employers are facing a new reckoning in 2022: getting staff back into the office.
Dubbed by some the “great hybrid return to work”, employers across a range of industries are being forced to consider what the work environment will look like for staff.
In an environment where labor is tight, just how much can businesses prod employees to come back into the office? And how can bosses design a solution to meet the needs of the collective after more than two years of work-from-home flexing where individual choice has reigned supreme?
This reckoning isn’t isolated to New Zealand, with stories from the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia painting a picture of a world that has fundamentally shifted, and the dawn of what may well become the work-from-home decade.
Granted, not all employees can work from home. Some never have, as they’ve continued to show up on the front line in hospitals, grocery stores and emergency response call outs. But research suggests those who got a taste of working from home are hungry for more.
Placing emphasis on coordination
A 2022 report from Stanford University heralds the benefits of a hybrid approach to work, acknowledging that most – but not all – staff benefit from a bit of time at home and a bit of time in the office.
The Stanford recommendation is to coordinate the return to the office with agreed days (for example, Tuesday through Thursday in office, Monday and Friday at home) and reassess at the end of the year to create a long-term plan.
This copy and paste plan certainly won’t work for all workplaces but it suggests there is some merit to a coordinated approach.
During the global pandemic, working from home became a necessity. Many workers now prefer the work-from-home option, with businesses unsure how to get them back to the office. Image: charlesdeluvio / Unsplash
Fairness as key
Social connection isn’t the only reason some researchers are advocating for a hybrid working model where teams come in on the same agreed-upon days.
This approach can maximize fairness and equity, thereby boosting diversity and inclusion. Having teams in one place at the same time ensures equitable information transfer and opportunities for development and promotion.
This could be especially pertinent for working parents, who may already face difficulty or discrimination from working flexibly or taking parental leave, and for minority groups that have traditionally been pipped at the post for promotions or mentoring opportunities.
Fairness, one of the key protective factors against burnout at work, helps to offset feelings of cynicism, anger or indignation.
Decisions about returning to the office should be transparent and clearly communicated. And while individual approaches may be necessary, plans for work should equally advantage all groups – senior leaders and entry-level graduates alike.
Ask, don’t assume
What works for some won’t work for all, so employers should talk to their employees. This simple advice applies as much to the general well-being of employees as it does to the structure of the work week.
By engaging in genuine conversations with staff and including them in the decision making process, leaders can build and maintain a level of trust that is essential to a strong culture of well-being in the workplace and can ensure the diverse needs of employees are met.
While everyone is neck deep in the process of discovering a new normal, employers should take the opportunity to really tap into the specific wants and needs of their employees by implementing a consultation process.
This may mean providing various options for people to give input, such as informal check-ins (face-to-face, text or otherwise) or more formal meetings and forums; this formal and informal communication can be complemented by anonymous employee surveys to capture opinions that some people may find hard to give in person.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to launch a new way of working that meets the needs of employees and allows them to participate in the process of strengthening support and well-being in the workplace.
While cubicles have long been the norm in modern offices, research shows the format can have a negative impact on collaborative work. Image: Thought Catalog / Unsplash
Build back better
While many leaders may bemoan the reluctance of their employees to return to the office, citing a reduction in collaboration and information sharing in the work-from-home setup, it’s worth asking whether pre-COVID office spaces really that much better.
Open plan offices, the norm for many modern workplaces, can actually increase stress responses in the body and, paradoxically, reduce collaboration, well-being and engagement.
How do businesses strike a balance between opportunities for collaboration and information sharing, while protecting an employee’s individual well-being?
With the aim to build back better, employers need to consider adapting office space in a way that is fit for connection as well as focus, with multiple breakout spots, intentional collaboration opportunities and quiet working zones.
Businesses should harness the power of hybrid working too – perhaps utilizing work-from-home days for deep work, with a “no meetings” rule and reserved in-person office days for collaborative working and catch-ups.
The next six months will undoubtedly be a period of trial and error for many businesses as they look to encourage workers back to the office. Following the simple rules – “ask, don’t assume” and “keep it fair” – may go a long way to ensuring the return to the office is helpful for employees and organizations alike.

The future of marketing is hyper-personalization,Callum Booth,2022/05/17,"
While marketing’s purpose has remained (relatively) static since its inception, the way this is achieved is in a constant state of flux.
Fundamentally, marketers want to convince their target audience that their product or service is worthy of their attention. The way professionals go about it has changed dramatically over the years.
30 years ago, you may have reached consumers through local papers and physical mail. Now? You may be looking at TikTok and Spotify.
To try and get a handle on what the current trends in the marketing business are — and what skills professionals need to cultivate — I spoke with Oscar Höglund, CEO and co-founder of Epidemic Sound, a music tech company that provides royalty-free soundtracks.
First off, Höglund told me that personalization, particularly that with “the use of visuals and music,” will become even more important in the coming years.
“Historically, marketers have tried to appeal to the masses,” Höglund said, but this is set to shift.
To illustrate this, he told me a story about the Super Bowl. Previously, the strategy for such an event would be to create a single advert — one designed to reach millions of people — and hope it lands well.
Personalization will change this. With the right technology and approach, Höglund said, you can create “hyper relevant content that attracts different target groups.”
A Super Bowl advert could become 40 different pieces of content, the soundtrack replaced by many songs in different genres that appeal to a range of target groups.
“Although the product and the core message will remain the same,” Höglund told me, “companies will need to make more personalized content in order to appeal to customers.”
If the marketing industry is going to evolve to be more personalization-centric, it makes sense that professionals in the space will also need to change. I put this to Höglund, asking what skills people in the sector will need in a decade.
“In the future, marketers [will] need to constantly analyze their customer needs,” he told me. “They need to map out and appeal to the different parts of people’s identity.”
Expanding on this, Höglund believes that the combination of analyzing data and learning about each individual’s preferences can help marketers give people perfect suggestions, recommending them things they’d never previously considered. To put it another way, to almost know them better than they know themselves.
Ultimately though, Höglund thinks the future of marketing “really boils down to understanding humans.” Computers will improve and take on the brunt of analysis, meaning marketers will have to get closer to people.
As Höglund put it: “In the future, marketers will move from being mathematicians to becoming anthropologists.”

Here’s what your avatar’s first day of work will be like,The Conversation,2022/05/12,"
In the context of work, the digital divide has become less about access to devices and connectivity and more about skills and mindset. Many experienced professionals have never learned more than the rudimentary basics of email, web search and Microsoft Office. Instead, they lean hard on nearby colleagues or the IT helpdesk when things go wrong.
By contrast, young people have already demonstrated a competitive edge in the virtual workplace. They come equipped with a more intuitive grasp of digital technology and the initiative to troubleshoot problems via YouTube tutorials, social media, and subreddits.
As a generation, they’re also bigger gamers. As more and more work takes place in virtual reality (VR) – and one does not have to share the somewhat eccentric vision of the metaverse Mark Zuckerberg articulated at the 2021 Connect Conference to believe that it will – being familiar with massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) like Fortnite and Roblox, not to mention the ability to manage multiple digital identities, is set to make that edge keener still.
Much of the metaverse is still to be built. VR, of course, has long been used in training for certain physical jobs, from astronauts and pilots to law enforcement, surgery, and manufacturing. When it comes to specialist machinery or complex locations, the relative safety and cost advantages of training virtually are obvious. But it is in knowledge work – from software engineering to law to design – where the changes will be most profound.
How virtual workplaces can improve communication
For most people, remote working during the pandemic has been characterized by alt-tabbing between communications apps and videoconferencing platforms such as Slack, Teams, and Miro. And there is certainly a lot of room for improvement there.
Academic studies have found that collaborative work between colleagues suffers when they work remotely. Exchanges over email or Slack increasingly replace real-time in-person conversations, hampering communication.
Google itself has claimed that informal chats at coffee machines and lunch tables on its campus were responsible for innovations such as Street View and Gmail. But, with remote working, this kind of serendipitous encounter all but disappears.
And of course, there are costs to remote working, in terms of individual wellbeing too. Stanford researchers have found that so-called “Zoom fatigue” is driven by a combination of intense eye contact, lack of mobility, self-consciousness about one’s own video feed, and the cognitive demands of needing to give exaggerated feedback to signal understanding, agreement, or concern.
Technological advances mean solutions to these problems related to remote working are becoming possible. Collaboration software such as Meta’s Horizon Workrooms and Microsoft Mesh, which allow colleagues to meet as avatars in VR or take part in a real-world meeting as a photo-realistic hologram, are already available.
The metaverse 1.0 will no doubt see organizations creating persistent VR workplace environments, in which employees can interact in real time as embodied avatars. VR versions of office spaces can be designed to encourage chance encounters and corridor chats.
Imagine, for example, if going from one remote meeting to another involved leaving the conference room and crossing a bustling virtual atrium. That might sound far-fetched but bear in mind that Korean PropTech company Zigbang has already opened a 30-floor VR office called Metapolis. Employees choose an avatar and navigate to their desks via elevators and corridors. When they meet a colleague’s avatar, their webcam and mic are activated so they’re able to have a conversation. The webcam and mic then turn off automatically as their avatar walks away.

Employees in the Korean VR workplace, Metapolis, can do large presentations, give speeches and work in small groups.
Meanwhile, the ability to use and read body language and actively participate in group discussions by scribbling post-it notes or drawing on a virtual whiteboard should make remote meetings in VR more engaging and less sedentary. They require much more active use of the neck, shoulders, arms and hands than a typical hour on Zoom.
How to work as an avatar
It seems likely that a new set of workplace norms will emerge as the metaverse develops. Team games, including virtual bowling nights and virtual ping-pong tournaments, might supplant Zoom drinks as the default remote working social event.
When it comes to hiring, meanwhile, VR could bring distinct benefits. “Blind” auditions have been shown to significantly increase the representation of female musicians in symphony orchestras. It follows that interviewing as an avatar might diminish the effect of bias –- unconscious or otherwise –- against people on the basis of their gender, age, or appearance.
Just as custom “skins” (outfits) are a feature of many MMOs, in the virtual world of work, there may well be demand for creativity in virtual fashion and accessories too, as people seek to express their personal brand within the constraints of professional dress codes for avatars. Gucci has already sold virtual hats, handbags, and sunglasses on the MMO platform Roblox.

Gucci is one of the first fashion brands to sell accessories for avatars.
Young people have been the worst affected by the disruption COVID has caused to the job market. While some struggled with working productively from a shared house or their parents’ homes, others were scammed into joining companies that did not even exist.
Nonetheless, the pandemic has also brought exciting glimpses of how remote working might evolve. Due to public health concerns and climate pressure, the latter is here to stay. As it develops into the metaverse, it will continue to bring capabilities that are concentrated among younger people to the fore.

How to grow your D2C business — 4 tips from a successful founder,Trinny Woodall,2022/05/11,"
Did you know Trinny Woodall is speaking at TNW Conference this summer? Check out the full list of speakers here.
There’s no doubt that the pandemic encouraged consumers to rethink their shopping habits, with over half now preferring to buy from brands directly. In fact, market growth of D2C in the US is expected to reach just under $175 million by 2023.
As the market continues to grow and become increasingly competitive, a strong D2C growth strategy has never been more important for a brand to stand out.
At Trinny London, we’ve worked hard to ensure we’re much more than just a makeup brand. We have a community of customers who share our values of authenticity and inclusivity, and our multi-pronged D2C strategy has paid off. Since founding the company in 2017, our revenue soared to £55 million by the end of 2021.
Here are my top four tips for building a successful D2C strategy:
1. Trust your gut – it’s your most valuable advisor.
When raising capital for Trinny London, I initially faced skepticism from male investors who believed a digital-first beauty brand wouldn’t work for our initial target market: women over the age of 35. Traditionally this audience preferred testing products at a beauty counter before purchasing.
Instead of being knocked back by their doubts, I stuck to my guns. I’d been in this position once before, when I launched my first business at the height of the .com bubble in 1999.
This time around, I knew the best person to rely on was myself. I was confident that there was a strong demand for the inclusive and personalized D2C brand I was creating, having spent over 20 years of my career speaking to thousands of women.
Remember: when you’re in front of investors, it’s likely they’ll be bringing their previous experience into your meeting. But what worked for their last investment might not work for you — you need to stand your ground. And for me, trusting my gut paid off; in 2017 we raised £2.4m and used the capital to…
2. Invest in tech.
If you want to join the world’s biggest D2C brands, you have to be able to offer customers a seamless and personalized digital shopping experience.
We worked with data scientists to create an industry-leading personalization service, Match2Me. The service enables customers to purchase makeup that suits their unique combination of skin, hair, and eyes. Now 75% of customers are using Match2Me when purchasing.
Not only is Match2Me hugely valuable for the customer experience, it’s also an incredibly useful tool from a business growth standpoint. Instead of guessing at the counter, these customers now have the confidence to shop online, and this confidence is integral to building consumer trust which we know is the key to success — 61% of UK customers are willing to pay more to purchase from a trusted brand.
What’s more, the customer data we retrieve from both Match2Me and instore from pop-up store experiences allows us to follow the journey of each customer from the very start.
We’ve now extended the capabilities of our Match2Me to include skincare, which will give us far more in-depth knowledge of our customer. For example, if we’re able to see how many of our customers have oily skin, we can ask ourselves if we’re doing enough to support this group of people and give them the products they really want and need.
The key is to collect data in a way that it can be analyzed with ease. We took time to build a data team so when we launch something new, the data points we need are embedded in the build. A strong data team is non-negotiable for an effective D2C strategy.
3. Strength is the ability to adapt.
The world of business is full of risk and instability — with globalization, new technologies, and extraordinary events like the Covid-19 pandemic on the minds of CEOs, being nimble has never been more important.
In order to adapt, it’s essential that your D2C strategy includes the monitoring of changes in the industry and wider world. If detected, act quickly by assessing your business model and current resources, and identify ways in which you can reshape them to fit the new demand.
Trinny London was quick to adapt when the world began locking down in March 2020. It was one of the first beauty brands to offer virtual appointments to customers (in fact, on the launch day 3,000 appointments were booked).
We now have a 24-hour booking schedule with professional makeup artists able to provide customers with a personal service from the comfort of their own homes — no matter what time zone they’re in.
As a result of our adaptability, Trinny London grew by 330% in 2020, with the number of new customers more than doubling from 95,000 in 2019 to 260,000 in 2020.
4. Don’t underestimate the power of community.
Without a doubt, the most valuable asset for a D2C brand is community. But don’t be fooled, a true ‘super’ community is more than just your social media following or customer base — it’s a group that provides genuine connections and enables a brand to make informed decisions that really move the needle on everything from product development to marketing spend.
Trinny London’s community, the Trinny Tribe, now has over 100,000 members in over 30 countries worldwide, and acts as a place for customers to not only discuss upcoming product launches and beauty tips, but also to make lifelong friendships.
And an online community can be powerful in more ways than one — recent research from HBR reveals that, amongst other benefits, resolving questions within a community is 72% cheaper than support channels.
Trinny London’s Facebook groups have had a massive positive impact on both the growth of the business and our product development strategy. In 2019, we made it our mission to take our Australian market revenue to 12% (which at the time was at about 6%). Thanks to a particularly inspiring tribe in Sydney, whose word-of-mouth was incredibly strong, we exceeded targets hitting 16%.
We hear our Tribe members loud and clear, and recently launched our 2-in-1 Lash2Brow as a direct result of Facebook comments requesting a Trinny London mascara. The product has been one of our most successful launches to date, highlighting the value of nurturing brand communities.
I believe Trinny London’s success is down to the strong relationship each customer is able to form directly with the brand. As a founder, take time to think about how the community becomes your customer and build a meaningful and lasting relationship with your brand, beyond the product or service you’re offering. That’s when you’ll see real success in D2C.

Video calls make us less creative — but that’s no reason for your boss to force you back to the office,Natasha Nel,2022/05/3,"
Video conferencing is making us dumber and less creative — and that’s according to science.
A laboratory study by Columbia Business School’s Melanie S. Brucks and Stanford’s Jonathan Levav found that “video conferencing inhibits the production of creative ideas.”
How’s that for a great excuse to keep your video turned off on your next Zoom call?
The study found that “video conferencing hampers idea generation because it focuses communicators on a screen, which prompts a narrower cognitive focus.”
To put that another way, the results suggest that the cognitive load used in virtual interactions hamper the amount of bandwidth we have for creativity.
Apparently, when you look at a screen, the narrowing of your vision “constrains the associative process underlying idea generation,” in which your mind branches and pulls on disparate information, forming new ideas in the process.
The study, conducted across five countries, explains: “as virtual communicators narrow their visual scope to the shared environment of a screen, their cognitive focus narrows in turn.”
But don’t sweat just yet — this doesn’t mean we should all head back to the office five days a week.
Telling Mike to unmute himself is here to stay, “but there’s a tension”
These findings back up the concerns laid out by Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky when he announced its new hybrid WFH policy last week.
Credit: Airbnb co-founder Brian Chesky on Twitter
His solution? Quarterly in-person meetings.
Chesky isn’t the only founder making a post-pandemic move to a hybrid WFH policy.
A survey conducted by Harvard Business Review in August 2021 said 75% of US employees reported “a personal preference for working remotely at least one day per week.” A research paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research — entitled Why Working from Home Will Stick — affirms HBR’s predictions, with an estimate that “20% of US work days will take place at home, after the pandemic ends.”
Nobody is saying you have to go back to the office
Video conferencing may make creativity more challenging, but, on the other hand, it appears to make prioritization and project management easier.
As the science says: “when it comes to selecting which idea to pursue, we find no evidence that video conferencing groups are less effective (and preliminary evidence that they may be more effective) than in-person groups.”
Unfortunately though, this isn’t universally agreed upon.
Another study conducted by Carnegie Mellon University’s Maria Tomprou et al. in March of 2021, however, suggested that videoconferencing not only hampers creativity, but “reduces collective intelligence”. Yikes.
Turning off our cameras may make us smarter and more creative in meetings
The Carnegie study suggests that the central blocker to collective intelligence and productivity in virtual communication is video access.
Their reasoning? “Teams without visual cues are more successful in synchronizing their vocal cues and speaking turns, and when they do so, they have higher CI.”
CI, or, collective intelligence, is defined here as the ability of a group of humans to work together to solve problems.
Contrary to popular opinion on the value of video in enhancing remote relationships and collaboration, Carnegie Mellon’s researchers propose that limiting time spent with your video turned on may lead to more equal and collaborative communication — as well as improved problem solving capabilities — likely because without video, there are fewer visual stimuli and less distractions.

"Airbnb joins Twitter, Reddit, Dropbox; finally admits remote work wins",Natasha Nel,2022/04/29,"
Airbnb CEO and co-founder Brian Chesky on Thursday announced the company’s 5-point plan to enable employees to live and work anywhere, all the time.
Ostensibly because “The world has become more flexible”, and “We also had the most productive two-year period in our company’s history — all while working remotely” (presumably, also: massive decrease in operating costs; consequent increase in profit margins).
More highlights from Chesky’s thread include the ability to move anywhere in the US without any change in compensation; in-person team gatherings facilitated quarterly; and the implementation of a multi-year roadmap with two product releases per year, to “keep us working in a highly coordinated way”.

This remote-led policy will impact the lives of Airbnb’s 15,000-ish employees — around 6,000 of whom are US-based — and comes more than two years following the initial wave of pandemic-induced remote work policies being implemented by many other tech multinationals, including Reddit, Twitter, and Dropbox.
What sets Airbnb’s announcement apart somewhat is its decision to standardize pay regardless of location. As noted by Mitchell Clark for The Verge, “employees at Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft will have to take a pay cut if they want to move to an area with a lower cost of living, according to reports like this one by the BBC.”
Some online forums predict a mass exodus of employees from more expensive cities to Nashville, for example — where Airbnb’s San Francisco-level salaries would be “game changing” [sic] — signaling, once again, this now mighty scaleup’s sustained influence over global housing and migration trends.
If there are any lessons in this story for startups, it’s probably in how much positive press you can generate when you give laptop-bound adults the freedom to choose where they want to live and work. Plus, with more countries catching on to the idea of “Digital Nomad” visas, it’s easier and more cost-effective than ever before to build your dream team, entirely remotely.

"Hiring friends and family might be good for business, research suggests",The Conversation,2022/04/29,"
Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta/Facebook, recently remarked in a podcast interview that when it came to hiring new staff, his preference was people whose “values aligned in the things that you care about”. This, he said, was akin to “choosing a friend or a life partner”. He went on to state that many young people were too “objective-focused” and “not focused enough on connections and … people”.
This speaks to one of the eternal questions for managers in deciding who to hire: do you choose the candidate who has objectively higher ability or the one whose values are more in common with your own?
While some would unambiguously select the higher ability candidate, others like Zuckerberg might weigh differences in candidates’ abilities against the extent to which they share the values of the employer. Some would go further and hire family or friends.
Many firms actually promote this with employee-referral incentive schemes that encourage hiring individuals of similar characteristics – or at the very least those who move in the same networks. The stated purpose of such schemes is to reduce the costs of hiring, increase employee retention rates and improve employee engagement. There are even guides dedicated to helping managers who hire their friends.
On the other hand, such a buddying approach to recruitment seems to contradict anti-discrimination laws. These have been enacted around the world to ensure that certain groups of individuals are not treated more poorly than others. For example the UK’s Equality Act 2010 makes it unlawful to discriminate on the basis of age, gender, religion, race or sexual orientation (among others). The US equivalent, the Equal Employment Opportunities laws, similarly aims to reduce workplace discrimination.
The problem with hiring your friends
Broadly speaking, anti-discrimination laws promote diversity, while prioritising hiring friends, family or those with shared values seems to do the opposite. The American psychologist Gordon Allport, in his 1954 work The Nature of Prejudice, noted a distinction between hiring based on negative prejudices (discrimination), and hiring based on positive prejudices (factors other than ability). He claimed that while hiring based on negative prejudices created social problems, hiring based on positive prejudices did not.
Gary Becker, the American economist, made a similar distinction in his 1957 book The Economics of Discrimination but reached a different conclusion. He termed hiring based on negative prejudice as discrimination, and hiring based on positive prejudice as nepotism, and he argued that both led to economic inefficiencies. This was because both involved hiring workers for reasons other than ability, which he reasoned was the greatest predictor of output.
The role of human behaviour
But why would many companies explicitly focus on recruiting friends and family if it were really bad for business? Could it be that hiring decisions that don’t prioritise a candidate’s abilities might lead to lower output, but having employees with shared values is still better for an organisation overall?
In a recent paper myself and two research colleagues, Catherine Eckel and Rick K. Wilson, sought to find out. We conducted a controlled laboratory experiment with a sample of university students with strong social ties at Rice University, Texas. Upon admission, students at Rice are sorted into “residential colleges”, which are essentially housing where they typically stay throughout their studies. Students of the same college live together, eat together and compete against other colleges in a variety of activities, inculcating a strong college-based identity and shared values.
In our experiment, we got the students to play a famous two-player game that economists use to measure trust. This simulates a manager-employee relationship by first giving an individual in the role of a manager a small sum of money – usually US$10 (£7.66).
They are then asked how much they would like to transfer to an individual in the role of an employee. Whatever they transfer is then multiplied, usually by three, and given to the employee. The employee must decide how much to give back to the manager. Both are trying to end up with as much money as possible. Hence the manager is investing in the employee and trusting them to return some of the investment. The employee chooses how much to send back to the employer, which is a measure of reciprocity/effort.
In our version, managers had to choose between investing in an employee from the same residential college (meaning they had shared values), and one that was not. They were also made aware that different employees had different “abilities”, in the sense that the multiplier that determined how much money they received from the investment would be smaller – for example, 2.5 instead of three.
In some cases, the employee with the shared values was “lower ability”. This meant that the manager would need to trust them to give back a higher proportion of their money than the alternative choice would give back.
When faced with employees of equal ability, 80% of managers chose the one from their college. Even when their fellow college member was “lower ability”, 40% of managers still chose them. In other words, while at least some managers were choosing partners based on ability, a significant proportion incorporated college membership into their decision.
Employees from the same college exerted more effort for their managers (meaning they returned a larger share of the money) when they were “lower ability” than the other candidate. This suggested that “lower ability” group members compensated for their handicap by increasing their effort. On average, when managers with a choice of candidates of “equal ability” went with their college mate, they made 10% more money. And among those offered a “lower ability” college mate and a superior outsider, they made 7% more by going with the college mate.
These results imply that focusing on ability alone ignores the contribution to output of behavioural factors such as engagement, trust, motivation and effort. As long as differences in ability are not too large, hiring from within employee networks would appear to be a profitable strategy. Becker had it wrong, in other words.
So while it was previously thought that hiring based on network or familial ties was mainly altruistic, our research suggests otherwise. It may still bring up managerial challenges, such as having to tell these employees what to do, or calling them out when they don’t meet expectations. But employers trust employees more when they share their values, and the employees may compensate for their lower ability by working harder, benefiting the organisation as a result.

Founders! Europe’s SpaceTech scene is hitting lightspeed — and here’s the inside scoop,Andrea Hak,2022/04/28,"
Are you a would-be founder looking for the right industry to build, grow, and scale? Are you an engineer looking for a new challenge? Do the words ‘earth observation’ and ‘geospatial data’ get you going? Then SpaceTech might be the next frontier for you.
In the past, space was dominated by missions run by big space players, the US, Russia, and China. But the EU has set its sights to the skies, announcing a 20% increase in the European Space Agency’s budget at the end of 2021 — the largest the agency has seen in 25 years. Meanwhile, its upcoming ExoMars and JUICE missions are set to explore the mysteries of the red planet, Jupiter and three of its icy moons.
It’s an exciting time for the European Space Agency, but it’s an even more exciting time for the bloc’s burgeoning SpaceTech ecosystem.
TNW spoke with five up and coming SpaceTech startup founders who recently took part in the European Commission backed X-Europe accelerator program.
Here are some of the hottest and fastest-growing areas within the EU’s SpaceTech industry at the moment:
Building space technology infrastructure
“Space technology will be the basis of an unprecedented transformation of humankind that we will witness this century — namely, humans settling on other worlds for the first time in history. Europe must be at the forefront of these efforts, and this can only be achieved with a vibrant, powerful space tech ecosystem,” said Zdravko Dimitrov, CEO of Sfera Technologies.
However, much like the transition to EVs, we won’t be able to access the full benefits of space technology without building up the necessary infrastructure. As Dimitrov explained:
Space infrastructure makes it possible for a much broader user base to tap into the benefits of space — from data to hardware or services — thus making the space industry much easier to integrate with the rest of the global economy.
Sfera Technologies’ first product, HomePort, is a ground segment infrastructure for earth observation data. In other words, with an increasing influx of earth observation data, HomePort’s ground station network is set up to receive and process this data in a fast, secure, and efficient manner.
Accessibility, but also sustainability
Earth observation data promises to provide a new economic boom in terms of business creation, revenue, and job growth. According to a recent survey, in 2020 the EU’s Earth Observation industry experienced a 24% growth in the number of companies, a 24% increase in revenue, and a 17% rise in employees, compared to 2019.
But many businesses still lack the skills and resources to take advantage of this growing opportunity.
“Earth observation missions are key to fighting climate change, improving crops, wildfire monitoring, and other major challenges. But to build and put satellites in optimal operational orbits is complex. ESFERATROS is offering in orbit delivery services to empower companies to access optimal operational orbits faster, safer, and at a competitive cost,” said CEO Leopoldo Martinez.
However, he offered one important caveat. While the push to make earth observation data more widely available will stimulate business growth and address the impact of climate change here on Earth, we cannot ignore the buildup of pollution in space.
Space debris is putting current missions and human lives at risk in low earth orbits, and if nothing concrete is done, we can reach a point of no return, limiting access to space for current and new players in the industry. Even though the problem is well known, many players in the industry still think space is too big and are not willing to take concrete actions toward space pollution.
Luckily, as Martinez explained, the EU and ESA are committing more resources to tackle the problem. ESFERATROS in particular is working on non-invasive solutions to mitigate space debris.
A long term vision for the future
“Personally, as a co-founder of a European space startup, I can see that the European space sector has stepped up its game on the global space map. The new iteration of the EU Space Programme of €14.8 billion strives to strengthen European strategic autonomy, security, and its role in the space sector. With the introduction of the GOVSATCOM initiative and the Space Situational Awareness program, there is a huge potential for the development of the new upstream and downstream markets, and an increased European presence in the space sector,” said Artem Axelrod, COO at Mission Space.
However, he admitted that as a co-founder of a startup that represents the newly established SSA program, specifically space weather monitoring and prediction, he faced a lot of challenges securing funding.
Mission Space set up a satellite-based space weather intelligence system. Its solution can detect, predict, and gain advanced warning of solar storms and space radiation risks. Solar storms have the potential to short the circuitry on satellites and disrupt telecommunications infrastructure and power grids. For any government or business sending equipment or missions into space, this could cost major sums in damaged equipment, not to mention the danger astronauts could face. According to Axelrod:
Since the space weather market is still emerging, and we are one of the first ones to operate in that market, corporate investors do not see an immediate return, and, rather than focusing on the bigger picture and long term investment to boost the development of the EU’s newly established SSA program, they prefer to pass and look for companies that operate in a more understandable market segment for them.
Nevertheless, Axelrod shared that there is huge support from various state-based and corporate-based accelerators and programs, such as:

X-Europe: a European space tech accelerator aimed to facilitate the shared development of the European deeptech startup ecosystem
Fit 4 Start: an accelerator program initiated by the Luxembourg Ministry of Economy and managed by Luxinnovation
Space Founders: European Space tech accelerator program that is jointly initiated and run by CNES, the National Centre for Space Studies, and the Entrepreneurship and Intrapreneurship Program at the University of the Bundeswehr Munich
Seraphim Space Camp: UK accelerator program by Seraphim Space Capital

“With their help, we at Mission Space were able to close our pre-seed round of €250,000, book our first flight for January 2023, close contracts worth €1.5 million, and become eligible to apply for the €150,000 non-equity grant from the Luxembourg Ministry of Economy,” Axelrod said.
Innovation in materials
One thing that will be essential to driving down costs for SpaceTechs will be innovation in material design and components. Indeed, components are one of the biggest costs a SpaceTech startup might encounter. That’s where innovation is continuously needed to build materials that are cheaper, more efficient, and scalable for a growing market.
“Some of the hottest topics in EU SpaceTech are related to sustainable propulsion systems from new kinds of chemical propulsion systems to a wide array of innovative electric propulsion products,” says Elias Bögel, Project Engineer at Neutronstar Systems.
Neutronstar Systems has developed a first-of-its-kind electric propulsion thruster aimed at pushing human-space activities further, faster. Their SUPerconductor based Readiness Enhanced Magnetoplasmadynamic Electric Propulsion thruster (or simply, ‘Supreme Thruster’) is built using alternative materials (such as Argon and Ammonia) that make it more efficient, cost-effective, and scalable.
For Bögel, one of the biggest advantages of being a SpaceTech firm is the funding programs being sponsored by the bloc, and the collaboration opportunities with businesses and universities.
We are extremely excited that the EU is now providing more and more funding for ambitious space projects, especially for startups. For example, through the Horizon 2020 program or external projects. A prime example of this is the MEESST project, a collaborative research project made up of startups/SMEs and academia, all funded under Horizon 2020.
SpaceTech startups are also helping to create safer materials. Engineering service provider ADOTT solutions specializes in designing products that can be used in explosive atmospheres. In particular, the use of electric batteries and x-ray shielding has a higher risk of causing fires or explosions in space. As Endre Surinya, Head of R&D explained:
There is a boom in the number of satellites around the Earth, and these satellites use batteries as an energy source. However, the safety of lithium batteries is below expectations, and the more batteries there are, the greater the risk of issues, as well as the amount of space debris. ADOTT Solutions’ BLueDoTT battery is delivering an alternative solution that is ultra-safe, having already been tested in the oil and gas industry.
What excites Surinya most about the space industry at the moment is that plucky startups are leading the charge in innovation:
New technologies allow for new practices that could potentially enhance the quality of human life on Earth. These technologies are now coming more and more from startups, rather than from governmental organizations as was the case before.

Startups are leading the way in agtech and food innovation,Cate Lawrence,2022/04/27,"
Right now, agtech and new food startups are hot in terms of funding, technical innovation, product development, and ROI. Today Startup Genome, in partnership with the Global Entrepreneurship Network launched 
the Global startup ecosystem report (GSER):Agtech and new food edition. And it’s definitely worth a deep dive.
Looking for the latest trends or need to know information for your own startup or even your next investment? The GSER provides comprehensive, data-driven research on startups, with 280+ entrepreneurial innovation ecosystems and 3 million startups. 
Let’s look at some of its findings and profile some cool startups in the agtech and new food space. 
COVID 19 as a catalyst for change
The report shares that the COVID-19 pandemic, spiraling fertilizer costs, supply chain disruption, climate change awareness, and recent geopolitical events have brought new urgency and mainstream attention to the issue of food security.
Whether through editing crop genes, rethinking logistics, or producing plant-based foods, startups are drivers of real change in the sector. And I am all for it.
What are the key areas in agtech and new food? 
The depth and breadth of the space is abundant. Agricultural technology captures the use of technology in agriculture, horticulture, and aquaculture to improve yield, efficiency, and profitability through information monitoring and analysis of weather, pests, soil, and air temperature. 
There’s a strong focus on improving agricultural efficiency and sustainability, including field sensors, drones, farm-management software, robotics, vertical farming, and more. 
“New food” employs innovation to optimize food design, creation, diversity, distribution, and utilization. This includes apps and services that provide access to food, including direct-to-consumer food delivery platforms, meal kit and grocery delivery services, and products and services that innovate food processing and ingredients.
New food also refers to next-generation food and drinks, including cultivated meat, plant-based meat and milk, insect-based products, and fermented foods. Also part of the equation is waste management and food packaging. 
What are some of today’s biggest trends and investments? 
Plants not meat
The GSER report finds that fake meat is hot hot hot, so say goodbye to your chicken nuggets. (Not convinced? Check out Thomas’ review of plant-based filet mignon)

Specifically, investments in alternative proteins grew to a record-breaking $5 billion, up 60% from the prior year.
Grocery deliveries

Due to shifts in consumer behavior (largely thanks to COVID-19) and rapid innovation, food and grocery delivery deals have climbed steadily in recent years. 
In 2021, food delivery accounted for 11% of the $1.6 billion invested in agtech and new food, up from just 2% of the total dollar amount invested in the sub-sector in 2017 and 6% in 2020.
North America and Asia dominate 
The most successful agtech and new food startups and funding are in North America and Asia. If you are a startup in the space, you need to read this report. 
Any savvy startup should comb this report with a fine-tooth comb, then work your networks for warm introductions.
In particular, the report provides a deep dive analysis into the most funded sectors and the best places to position a startup.I won’t replicate all the data here, but the top five Agtech & New Food ecosystems are Silicon Valley, New York City, London, TelAviv-Jerusalem, and Denver-Boulder. 
Not convinced that agtech and new food are the innovators of the future? 
Reading through the report inspired me to make a little listicle of some of my favorite agtech and new food startups. Some are in the report, some are companies I’ve previously interviewed, or have been following for a while: 
Centaur Analytics (US/Greece)
Even when stored in silos, crops can be at risk of spoilage and insect infestation. Centaur Analytics has developed proprietary wireless sensors designed to “sniff” crop storage conditions inside shipping containers, grain bins, and storage bunkers. The sensors enable crop monitoring in various scenarios, including ship carriers and transportation, which may take weeks or months. 
Behind the scenes, entomological models are applied to the data stream. Predictive analysis helps farmers with proactive measures like fumigation and pest control.
Farmobile (US) 
Credit: Farm Mobile
Today farms are a hotbed of data analytics that enables farmers to gain critical insights to assist with precision agriculture, including planning, water, fertilizing, and yield optimization.
Farmobile has created the world’s first online marketplace for agricultural data for farmers to sell their data to seed suppliers, farm machinery manufacturers, researchers, and others, as well as fairly compensate farmers for their digital assets. 
Infarm (Germany)
Credit: Infarm
Traditional indoor farming usually involves large outer city warehouses of plants where plants are grown, then picked and transported to shops and restaurants. Infarm has developed a unique indoor vertical farming solution. 
The modular farms stack to fit any given space, from supermarket aisles and restaurant kitchens, to distribution warehouses. Crops are ready to be picked and sold without the need for excess transport miles or a delay between picking and distribution.
Tortuga (US)

Employee shortages hit farms and agricultural businesses hard. Tortuga builds robots to perform farm services, including picking and packaging.
By automating mundane, difficult tasks, workers on the farm can dedicate themselves to higher-value work. The robotics also capture never-before-possible plant-level data that turns into valuable information for growers. 
Live Green Food Group (Chile)
Credit: Live Green Food Group
Ever bought vegan food only to find that the ingredients aren’t all that healthy, or come from some far-flung destination?
Live Green Food Group is building a proprietary AI platform, called Charaka. It discovers plant-only ingredients that replace all animal ingredients as well as the synthetic and ultra-processed additives in food products. It also considers local availability and sustainability parameters like zero waste, and land, water, and energy consumption.

Lego’s digital transformation targets your inner child,Natasha Nel,2022/04/22,"
“Becoming a digital consumer goods company is our ambition,” says Atul Bhardwaj, Chief Digital and Technology Officer of The Lego Group, in a not entirely predictable statement statement — coming from the world’s most valuable manufacturer of physical toys.
“We’ll always be anchored in the physical — just to be clear — but digital needs to come in and augment that physical build process,” Bhardwaj clarifies. “Our business has scaled a lot in the last two years; we need to make sure that our platforms and our systems also scale.”
The Lego Group’s earnings for 2021 saw revenue grow 27% year-on-year (to $8 billion), while consumer sales grew 22%. CEO Niels B. Christiansen said in September that Lego’s strong financial performance would allow the company to accelerate investments in digitalisation.
“The Lego Group is making a significant strategic investment in digital transformation; it’s a multi-billion DKK (Danish krone) investment,” confirms Bhardwaj. “We’re trebling the size of our digital teams and accelerating our presence and our capabilities here [in Copenhagen], but it’s all part of a much broader digital agenda.”
Having led digital transformation for MediaMarkt and Tesco before being hired by the Lego Group 18 months ago, Atul Bhardwaj knows a thing or two about turning what he calls turning a “traditional IT team” into a “digital technology team”.
When asked whether he thinks the pandemic was the real driver of Lego’s growth over the past couple of years, he’s adamant its success is driven by great narratives created around great products.
“There’s a lot of excitement around our build experiences,” Bhardwaj insists, which begs the question: how is the magic of Lego’s IRL user experience being effectively augmented by digital products, largely built for adults?






Lego’s video gamified take on the Star Wars franchise.
“When you build digital products, you think first about who you’re building these products for,” says Bhardwaj, “We’re asking ourselves: ‘What are the digital needs of each of our key user groups?’ We want to be product-led, engineering-led, and architecture-led in everything we do; so, we’re introducing the concept of digital products to the Lego ecosystem.
“And we’re doing this for all of our user groups,” explains Bhardwaj, going on to outline the four key user segments his digital transformation efforts are focused on: “consumers, shoppers, partners, and colleagues”.
Because Lego’s consumer group comprises both kids and adults, they’re building separate “engagement platforms” for each audience. One of the objectives of these platforms is to gamify and support “co-building” between family and friends. Naturally, these new formats present various challenges Lego’s digital teams are tasked with solving: “How do we make sure kids can engage with us digitally, in a safe way? And how do we build great communities for adults – some of whom are very experienced, and some of whom are new to building?”
When asked for a couple examples of digital transformation projects being prioritized at Lego’s new “digital hub” in Copenhagen, Bhardwaj says, “The difficult thing is for me to pick just one or two.”
Credit: kottke.orgWith its building instructions app nearing 10 million downloads, DX at Lego is now focused on automating supply chains, unifying their on- and offline shopping experiences, and building gamified “engagement platforms” for both children and adults.
With the consumer-centered mobile app that took Legos building manuals online already on 9.7 million downloads, Bhardwaj is now focused on creating a “seamless” online-offline experience for shoppers: “How do we bring together the experience you have on lego.com with the experience you have in our stores? What does that look like?”
From a partner perspective, Bhardwaj is tasked with digitizing and automating Lego’s B2B interactions at scale, which means significantly upgrading the experience for resellers by revamping orders and tracking via “Partner Portal” webshops.
Likewise, for the colleagues user segment (referring to the people working in Lego’s offices and factories around the world), Bhardwaj says the focus is on automating “as much as possible”.
“We’re moving to the cloud. We’re building modern APIs so that our systems can talk to each other in a more modern way; and we’re also replacing all of our networking in all of our sites across the world – quite literally laying out new cables to renew all of our infrastructure,” Bhardwaj says. “A lot of interesting problems to solve. It’s a challenging and exciting time to kick-off a career in digital transformation at Lego.”

CTOs share how to move from a dev role to the C-suite,.cult,2022/03/20,"
This article was originally published on .cult by Mikaella C. .cult is a Berlin-based community platform for developers. We write about all things career-related, make original documentaries and share heaps of other untold developer stories from around the world.
Have you ever wanted more control over the direction of your company? When is it time to rethink your role?
One study from Honeypot found that many developers become less satisfied with their working environment and company culture as they age, describing an increased risk of ageism from 29 onwards. As we grow more accustomed to working life and professional responsibilities, it’s common to become frustrated with elements that might feel outside your control as a single developer.
Some issues might be set by management or a C-level team, which you have little say in. And while there are all kinds of ways to negotiate for and manage a better working life, some developers choose to change up their own role dramatically — perhaps even by building their own company.
The path from developer to CTO isn’t straightforward, but it is well-paved. And there are all kinds of reasons to pursue it, and different ways to get into the role. Maybe you were the first developer on the ground at a company; maybe a friend approached you with a big deal. Or you might be actively searching for that big C-level role.
Whether you’re dreaming about the future or ready to start pursuing that role right now, there are strategies you can use to build yourself into the best (and most hirable!) CTO you can be. Take a page from other developers who have done the same thing.
1. Move beyond your standard toolkit
The best developer in the world isn’t going to make a good CTO if that’s all she can do. As Reiner Kraft, CTO of Yunar explains, there are three main fields when it comes to a CTO’s responsibilities:
Business (crunching the numbers and income), product (what we want to deliver) and technology (how are we going to make the product we want to deliver). Eventually, you’ll need to focus on orchestrating these three together. Become both the visionary who sees the big picture and the catalyst who makes things happen.
These three fields cross over so many different spheres of work and responsibilities that, to a certain extent, the exact nature of a CTO’s role is decided by the CTO (and the company they work for) themselves. Greg Brockman, former CTO of Stripe and now the co-founder and CTO at OpenAI, writes that while every CTO he spoke to, “viewed themselves as the facilitators of the technology organization,” the way this actually functioned differed:
Sometimes this was about connecting senior engineers. Sometimes it was mentoring. One thought-provoking case for me was a CTO who was effectively head of product.
This flexibility and breadth of responsibility means that you need to broaden your toolkit to look beyond software and programming. As a CTO, you’ll be responsible for huge swathes of a company’s work, from culture to recruitment to business and more. You’ll want to get involved in some of these areas as soon as you can. There’s lots of small but valuable ways to take on more responsibility at your current company:

Help plan a company party
Sit on the hiring committee for the next engineer to join your team
Help out a designer ordering new team t-shirts

Don’t be afraid to ask if you can shadow someone in a role or team that might not have a lot to do with your day-to-day workload. Put your hand up to work on projects closely linked to business development and administration, where you can learn by osmosis as you go.
Most companies are excited to see an employee interested in their own professional development and this extra activity might even come in handy around promotion time, but it’s also part of the territory of being a CTO, so it’s important to see everything as a long-term effort. Assess your own capacity, find your areas of deficiency and make slow and steady efforts to build out your skillset.
You might also decide to pursue a Master’s degree at some point, which will give you a thorough and verifiable claim to expertise. One of our surveys found that over two-thirds of Berlin’s CTOs have a Master’s in a variety of fields including Computer Science, Business Admin, Physics, and even Art! But the most common Master’s was in IT which includes IT Management, Business Information Systems, Business IT and, in Germany, Wirtschaftsinformatik ​(Business Informatics), all of which offer a useful link between technical and business knowledge.
But that still leaves a third of CTOs who don’t have a Master’s degree, meaning that if you build your skillset through practical and professional experience, you may not need further education to reach that role.
2. Find a community
‘Try to network’ can be vague and intimidating advice. It might conjure memories of awkward conversations or forced friendliness. At the same time, it’s important as a wannabe CTO to keep an eye out for opportunities, like-minded people and exciting ideas, because as a CTO or co-founder you’ll want to get in on the ground floor.
Rather than thinking of it as networking, try to expand your opportunities to encounter any of the above in situations that you find genuinely interesting and are comfortable with. In most major cities there are plenty of meet-ups and tech conferences where you might be able to socialize with other people interested in the same industries and companies you are. Or try going to a hackathon, where a fun project for a day might just turn into a company.
If you’re not much for events, extend your energy online. LinkedIn is an obvious avenue for professional engagement. Make your page an active one that people will recognize. Here’s a few ideas to get you started:

Write short blogs (Is there a fun problem at work you solved? Did you just go through a hiring process and have thoughts on how it could be improved? Have you got a new favorite hack you want to share with others?).
Share articles you found interesting.
Make memes related to your field (remember to keep it professional!).
Liking and commenting on other people’s posts can also go a long way towards improving your presence on LinkedIn, making you a digital face that others might remember.

It’s also okay if LinkedIn isn’t the place for you: there are still other options. Investigate Reddit, Twitter and even Discord, where there are also fun and engaging communities. The important thing is to put yourself out there, engage with the world and make it easy for anyone who has that burgeoning idea for an amazing company to find you, their next CTO.
3. Get ready to lead
In the end, any great C-Level position is about one thing above all else: people. Greg Brockman, co-founder and CTO at OpenAI shared:
I had a very strong vision of the environment I wanted to be a part of, and I was willing to go out of my way to make it exist. I was faced with a choice: the technical route or the people route. I’ve never found anything I loved more than writing code, but at the same time I knew we had a responsibility as an organization to support the amazing people we’d hired.
Brockman’s responsibility to support his employees came from the position of CTO at Stripe, but you don’t have to wait until you’re a CTO to start working to improve and understand the lives of your colleagues. You could start simply by talking to your colleagues and asking if they need help. By engaging with work beyond your own, not only will you become a friend to your colleagues, you’ll get a clearer picture of the problems your company is addressing.
You could also start thinking and reading like a C-level professional well before you reach that stage, giving yourself a leg-up amongst the competition as well as a taste of what’s to come in the real life of a CTO. Books can also impart useful leadership strategies and communicative techniques which will make you a better CTO when the time comes.
Joel Beasley, who began writing code at the age of 13 and sold his first tech at 18, became a CTO who works with startups and billion dollar enterprises alike. He highlights the importance of communication:
You’ve got to be able to communicate in life, it’s enormously important. Schools, to some extent, under emphasise that. If you can’t communicate and talk to other people and get across your ideas, you’re giving up your potential.
Along with Beasley’s book, you could try leading tech and entrepreneurial authors including Ben Horowitz, Rorie Devine, Mark McCormack, and more. And if you struggle finding the time to read, consider an app like Blinkist, which digests non-fiction into easily accessible bite-sized ideas.
If it feels like this work is leading you away from your first love — coding — that’s something to keep an eye on. But Reiner Kraft warns that this might be part of the job:
The one who conducts the orchestra doesn’t play the instrument. Similarly, being a CTO is really about helping others to grow.
4. Learn to let go
A lot of CTOs say that, for better or worse, their role involves stepping back from their first love — developing.
Sometimes becoming CTO might mean that, from day one, you’re no longer coding. Other times it happens slowly, over time. When describing his own journey, Airbnb’s co-founder and former CTO Nathan Blecharczyk said:
In [my] first one-and-a-half years I did write every single line of code myself. In the next three years, it was all about hiring a team: I spent most of my time screening candidates and trying to convince the outstanding ones that it’s worth joining Airbnb on this journey. As CTO, I did not only run engineering, but also data science, the data-driven aspects of online marketing, as well as our payments team.
Many CTOs make an effort to keep coding as part of their life. “I still code and program daily because it is important to make sure these skills are relevant and up to date in order to work with my team of developers and lead them appropriately,” Chalmers Brown, CTO of Due, says. “Plus, I enjoy doing this aspect of work.”
Others find new ways to stay close to code; when Arash Ferdowsi was still CTO at Dropbox, he was famous as a “chief debugger”, where Forbes reported on, “his propensity to file bug reports at all hours —3 a.m. missives [were] not uncommon. While he no longer codes, he [was] still the one making sure the company’s growing family of products remains unified and retains a simplicity of design and ease of use.”
And even when you’re still working close to code, you might have to move away from the kind of complicated, rewarding work that makes up part of a developer’s day-to-day life. An important part of being a CTO, says HeidiPay CTO Alistair Stead, is being:
… the person who sees a wider picture and thinks one or two steps ahead. Early in my career, I realised that technology exists only to serve business needs. Developers live to solve complex problems, yet finding the simplest solution to a business need (so the business can move forward) should be the imperative.
Whether you work to keep coding part of your working life or not, it’s certainly true that CTOs have such a wide scope of responsibilities that you’ll be doing a lot less coding than a developer would. As a developer seeking to move into a C-level position, this is worth reflecting on. Would you be truly happy taking on a role that is more about leadership, business strategy and company culture than coding? Would you be ready to spend more time in meetings than at your computer? More time imagining than building? It’s fine if the answer is “yes, definitely!”; it’s also okay to say “yikes, no thanks!”
Higher doesn’t always have to mean better. But if you do decide the CTO path is the one for you, it’s a fascinating and exhilarating experience with a lot to learn along the way. Try to enjoy the journey as much as you do the outcome.

The next big cybersecurity threat is connected SaaS platforms,Built In,2022/03/18,"
This article was originally published on Built In by Aner Gelman.
Text notifications about new messages on Slack. Linking Trello boards to Microsoft Teams. Using Boomerang to control a busy inbox. These apps and platforms — and their connections with each other — are all part of daily life in many companies today. They not only help make remote and hybrid work possible, but are key to building and scaling companies and products.
But the communications between thousands of SaaS platforms are also an emerging threat to corporate cybersecurity. Most existing cybersecurity solutions still do not offer adequate protection or a convenient way to monitor the communications between these apps and platforms, leaving companies vulnerable to cyberattacks and unable to effectively know or control which parties have access to sensitive corporate or personal data.
A handful of high-profile attacks — including a data breach at cybersecurity provider Imperva Security, in which attackers stole an API key that allowed the software to work on Amazon’s cloud, which ultimately permitted the attackers to gain access to sensitive customer data — have resulted from taking advantage of how SaaS platforms communicate with each other. In order to effectively protect themselves, companies need to understand how SaaS platforms are becoming increasingly vulnerable, what’s at stake, and what steps to take.
Current Cloud Security Options Don’t Protect SaaS-to-SaaS Communications
Cloud-based SaaS platforms have been growing rapidly for two decades, as they provide a convenient and affordable way to get tech services for both work and personal use. By now, most modern consumers are familiar with popular platforms, many of which can be customized, like Gmail and Salesforce.
Because SaaS is cloud-based, traditional cybersecurity measures, like firewalls that protected on-premise networks, data, and software, are no longer effective. So the market soon developed CASBs, or cloud-access security brokers, which are intermediaries between cloud-based services and their users or on-premise services. These can be software or hardware-based. But ultimately, they only protect connections between SaaS products and their users. This was fine — until more SaaS products started communicating with each other, doing things like sending a Slack message when a customer opens a support ticket.
More recently, SSPMs, or SaaS Security Posture Management solutions emerged. These have become popular, with research and consulting company Gartner naming them as a top tool in the future of cloud and SaaS security. While these do monitor more aspects than CASBs, they are only available for certain services, and even though they take a cloud-first approach, they are missing additional features, like overseeing the ubiquitous SaaS-to-SaaS communications.
Interconnected Apps Mean More Opportunities for Hackers
Slack popularized the notion of connecting different platforms to work together, and now most SaaS apps are communicating with each other. Each action a user takes, whether it’s sending a message or updating a calendar, may result in several other automatic actions and notifications in connected platforms, and other add-ons and apps for SaaS platforms require access to even more data on the platforms.
This means that if a hacker gains access to one platform, they potentially have access to all of that users’ different SaaS platforms and connected applications. In an age of increased cyberattacks, like recent supply chain attacks that often target organizations in order to gain access to more numerous or valuable targets — like what happened with the well-known SolarWinds attack — this leaves a lot of information extremely vulnerable.
What Can Companies Do to Protect Their Information?

Invest in SaaS security tools
Inventory apps currently in use by employees
Don’t neglect service accounts
Revoke all access from former employees’ linked accounts
Consider establishing an SaaS Operations department
Establish clear policies regarding use of third-party SaaS platforms

Companies need to invest more not just in SaaS security tools, but also in figuring out how many apps their employees are using, and what is being shared on them so that their cybersecurity departments have an accurate and comprehensive understanding of the potential threat landscape.
Organizations are becoming more aware of this, with 55 percent of information security professionals saying the top SaaS security challenge is a lack of visibility into SaaS usage and data. Once gained, they should use this intelligence to write clear policies regarding the use of third-party SaaS apps and platforms that takes into account their employees’ workflows.
Companies should be careful about things like service accounts being neglected, resulting in vulnerabilities like non-used API tokens that can be stolen and used to access privileged information. In addition to the threat of cyberattacks, the web of SaaS products also potentially leaves companies vulnerable to non-authorized users, or former employees, who may, through continuing email or message notifications and add-ons to platforms, have access to sensitive information.
While some automated solutions are emerging to address management of SaaS platforms, one immediate step companies can take is to dedicate a department to SaaS Operations, which oversees the purchase, security, and management of SaaS products a company uses. A recent survey found that 40 percent of IT professionals now see SaaS Operations as a critical new role.

High fashion to high tech: What startups can learn from industry icon François Kress,Alejandro Tauber,2022/03/17,"
Did you know François Kress is speaking at TNW Conference this summer? Check out the full list of speakers here.
Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Bulgari, Prada, Carolina Herrera, Miu Miu. This might sound like a bar from a standard rap song, but it’s actually a list of companies where François Kress has held leadership positions in his long career in the luxury industry. Then, an unexpected but welcome opportunity presented itself.
“I was really suffering from luxury fashion fatigue, and decided to move on and start this project,” he tells TNW over Zoom.
At the invitation of a friendly venture capitalist, Kress joined Feelmore labs as co-founder and  CEO, to develop a unique, category-defining type of wearable: Cove. It’s a wearable device that relies on the science of neurostimulation, sending specific vibrations to specific sensors behind your ears to “help you feel calm and emotionally balanced,” according to the website.
Curious about his switch from high fashion (“There was a time I had two secretaries and obviously a driver and everything”) to high tech (“Now I have to change the toilet paper at the office myself”), and what experience he took along with him, we spoke to Kress from his apartment in New York about the lessons tech can learn from the most luxurious of luxury brands on the planet.
Dressed in a casual navy blue long-sleeve with perfectly coiffed silver-gray hair and thick-rimmed glasses, it’s easier to see Kress managing Fendi than a high-tech wearable company. But looks, in this case, are deceiving.
Kress’ background, before being recruited by Bernard Arnault of LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy), was in theoretical physics, with a special interest in topology — hardcore math describing complex dynamic geometric problems.
“For me, it was like going back, because after high school I studied intense theoretical stuff for 8 years.”
Move slow, do things well
During his career in luxury, Kress was sucked into tech when he was offered a board position at a biopharmaceutical company, and was surprised by the fast pace of tech companies.
“Coming from big luxury groups, which have hundreds of years of history and where everything is very slow and very careful, to this fast-paced biotech world and startups and VC money was a shock.”
After meeting some VCs through his board position, he agreed to co-found Feelmore Labs, where he could finally bring together his experience in rigorous science from his science degrees, and dedication to craftsmanship from his career in luxury. This also allowed him to bypass some long-held beliefs about the pace of business that many founders face
“Just put an MVP on the market. Even if it’s crappy, you know, you will learn as you iterate,” he says was something he’d hear often. “But I was very determined not to get rushed, or half-bake the technology for the sake of this kind of iterative process.”
Listen to your customers less
The iterative process couldn’t be more removed from the process in high-end fashion and luxury, Kress tells us.
“It’s the opposite of what you hear in luxury and fashion, at least at the top end of those products. There, it’s ‘don’t listen to your customers, they don’t know what they want.’ If you ask customers what they want to see on the runway, you will always see the same black dress coming out of every workshop. So for me, that was a complete shift.”
Haute couture by fashion designer Iris van Herpen
Kress says he’s trying to find a middle ground between not listening to customers at all, and letting customers determine the whole product. “I think like everything in life, there is a middle point, right? We could bring a little more finesse into tech. Apple is a good example of a brand which had very strong aesthetic content and a strong vision, which was not purely based on practical aspects.”
Not everything needs to be practical
A total focus on practicality can be a flaw, he thinks. “It sometimes makes me sick when all I hear is like, ‘Oh, what is the problem, what is the solution.’ That’s cool, and you can make nice little projects that way. But you’re never going to build greatness out of solving practical problems.”
Kress believes firmly that for building a new category of wearable, one that actively affects your mood, versus one that just registers your vital signs, you need to do more than just focus on the functionality. To do this, you need to look at the whole picture, and build the brand holistically from the get-go.

“If you look at the functionality of fashion, like a bag is to carry your stuff from point A to point B, then there is no reason to spend thousands of dollars on that, because you could do it with a plastic bag, right?”
The attractiveness of a product goes way beyond the functionality of the product, he tells us. Although he’s the first to admit that Cove is still far from being acknowledged as an item with more intangible value. “We are too young, the category is still too young,” he says.
Perfection, perfection, perfection
Another lesson Kress brought along from luxury brands is the obsession with quality and perfection. In the case of Cove, Kress says they spent way more time and money on first proving the science of the device, and then perfecting the device itself than strictly necessary.
Cove headset by Feelmore Labs
“We added little hinges in the design to accommodate potentially wider heads, we added a heart rate sensor, a motion sensor, which an MVP probably could have lived without. All these things made the whole design and mechanical engineering much more complex, but they add a marginal impact, which people may not even see. There are a lot of subconscious signs that you send in luxury that overall build the dream.”
Their goal for Kress was to build something users forget they’re wearing, and that has perfected “even things you don’t see, because I think in luxury the value is in execution. Everything in luxury is overdone, look at the stores, they are just perfect. So we spent time perfecting the device.”
Don’t price yourself too cheaply
While Cove is not a luxury device per se, it did not come cheap. The launching price was 490 dollars, in a market where most wearables set you back around 300.
“We were widely criticized for that, to be honest. As an unknown entity, it’s hard to start at that price. But we decided to do it anyway,” he says. Obviously, there was a reasoning behind the price point.
“There is a psychological barrier to price in general that you can never go up in price, right? If you start low just for the sake of moving merchandise, you will stay there,” he says. 
But there’s more to it than just keeping margins up. “First of all, for a neuro-product, which relies certainly on the placebo effect, I believe that the price matters. It’s like when you go to the shrink, we all know that paying is part of the therapy. I think the price is part of the reflection of the seriousness of the product — within limits, obviously.”
Service is everything
Kress did mention that Cove would soon be offered as a monthly subscription service soon, partly to reduce the sticker shock of the high price. But it’s also to reflect that the company offers exceptional service — which is another lesson he brought along from luxury. 
“Since we are in the mental wellness field, service is difficult sometimes. People who call us don’t only talk about the functionality, you get people who want to talk about their problems. And no, we don’t offer therapy, but we hire people who are subtle enough to address all that. We have been praised a lot for that, that’s super important.”
The company also prides itself on being lenient on return and replacement policies, which come at a cost, but “that’s the least we can do for people who have the courage to try a new technology and take a leap of faith to try something unknown.”

Will the metaverse replace offices? Not by a longshot,Samantha Johnson,2022/03/14,"
Covid-19 has opened the world’s eyes to the benefits of remote and flexible work, and many aren’t looking back — according to a survey by workplace platform Envoy, 71% of employees would choose a hybrid work model, only 12% want to work remotely every day, and just 16% want to work full-time in the office.
Until now, technology hasn’t quite been able to keep up with this change of attitude — we can agree that video conferencing software sucks and a Zoom call doesn’t really cut it as an office party replacement. But conversations around the promises of the metaverse and web3 have businesses and employees excited about the possibilities.
The metaverse promises to solve hybrid workplace obstacles — but is it really the silver bullet solution?
So why are companies so excited about the metaverse?
Working in the metaverse  would allow workers to be 100% remote, while still allowing for social interaction. For employers, this means a limitless talent pool, as workers from Michigan to Mozambique can interact together in a virtual, hyper realistic world. And for employees, this means they would get the freedom and flexibility of working from anywhere they want.
A metaverse workplace could also make for a more equitable workplace helping to level the playing field between the employees managers see every day and those who have to or want to be remote, for example if they’re a single parent, disabled, or just can’t afford to live near the office.
Health and safety also come into play. A recent survey also found 43% of office workers, either hybrid or full-time, are more worried about exposure to and transmission of Covid than remote workers. For employees of color, 21% lose sleep over it compared to just 11% of their white coworkers.
A metaverse office means anyone can come in, whether they’re vaccinated, unvaccinated, immunocompromised, positive or negative.
And then we get to the actual offices themselves. Think of a metaverse office where real estate is cheaper, and you can design it at the top of a skyscraper or inside the belly of a whale — without the hefty price tag (or whale guts).
Desk space in the metaverse is infinitely scalable. Size up or down based on your needs. It’s the ultimate customizable space. Virtual meeting rooms or communal lounge areas will be configured for the type of work people are doing — heads down work or creative team brainstorming.
Metaverse real estate companies like The Sandbox are already cropping up to stake their claim in this new frontier, and businesses like UK media company VCCP and Mediahub have already set up their metaverse offices.
Ultimately, employees want flexibility, freedom and the ability to socialize and easily collaborate — and the metaverse could conceivably offer it all.
The metaverse won’t replace the physical office any time soon
Of course, this is all theoretical at this point. Until we actually have long-term business use cases, we won’t be able to measure the opportunities or understand the potential downsides. Some questions we’ll need to consider for example are: How long can people really wear a headset for? Are there detrimental impacts on physical and/or mental health to spending your 9/5 in ‘The Matrix’?
What’s more, we’ve seen some interesting innovation in metaverse gaming, but adoption is still low and whether this could translate to the world of work is still unproven.
So the question is, when will we get a chance to have a chat around the virtual water cooler?
While the Big Five are already planting their flag in the metaverse, and new startups are cropping up to push the metaverse further, not everyone is convinced we’re as close to a true “meta” metaverse as we think. According to Envoy’s CEO and founder, Larry Gadea:
Yes, anything’s possible so it could eventually replace reality. Now, is this happening anytime soon? No. Is this going to happen all at once? Absolutely not. For the metaverse — it has to be believable, or it won’t work. In-person interactions are so fundamental to who we are. It’ll take generations for us, along with the metaverse, to develop and evolve. And right now the technology just isn’t there yet.
Gadea founded Envoy to make workplaces work better for employers and employees alike. As the world plunged into lockdown amidst Covid-19, it became more urgent than ever to create workplace products that would help bring people back to the office safely.
During the pandemic the company launched Envoy Protect and Envoy Desks, apps that gives employees an overview of who is working in the office and when so they can sync work schedules and optimize time in the office, reserve work desks and, most importantly, certify their health status — users can upload proof of vaccination, a weekly negative Covid test, or fill out a daily health check.
In January, Envoy raised $111m in a Series C funding round, which Gadea says will be put towards building out its product offering further to help make hybrid workplaces even more flexible, thoughtful, and a better experience for employees. And while the metaverse isn’t a major focus for Envoy yet, they’re keeping a close eye on it.
Bringing people together IRL
Even when we have the technology for a truly realized metaverse, Gadea says, offices will still play a crucial role.
The world never does everything at once and it’s not going to, no matter what the benefits are. So there will always need to be a bridge between that world and the physical world.
Socializing, for example, will always be a key reason why the metaverse won’t replace an IRL office anytime soon — or even at all. Gadea added: “It’s very hard to have memorable moments that you’re going to be like, oh, yeah, I remember that. That person spilled a drink on this other person… That’s how you remember moments in life. The challenge is figuring out how to recreate human interactions in a virtual environment. Spontaneous conversations in a virtual hallway. Mimicking a real-life meeting where people can have multiple conversations going with folks.”
Besides the obvious mental health benefits, having candid moments with colleagues IRL is proven to increase creativity, productivity and problem-solving. And when it comes to the metaverse, you can’t really have a “water cooler moment” if you can’t actually drink the water.
So what does the future office look like? “I think we’ll get some cool new technologies. We’ll have video conferencing that’s even better. We’ll have meeting rooms that are much more inclusive of remote people than they are today,” Gadea says.
But at the end of the day, people being together is one of the most important things that can happen. And that’s one of the biggest things that was taken away from us with COVID.

"Zoom etiquette: Yes, it’s OK to mute your face",Zapier,2022/03/12,"
We’re now years into this great experiment in remote work. It started off as a Zoom, but now it feels more like a plod. Our work lives are lived on camera all day, every day—and it’s time to let people take a break.
Face-muting is ok
Communicating remotely isn’t new. For ages, we corresponded by mail. Then we added telegraphs, which increased the speed of communication. Then came telephones, which allowed us to communicate beyond cables. Fax, email, instant message—the communication options continued to grow.
We didn’t see each other’s faces, yet business still thrived.
Video calls are great for a lot of things, like screen sharing and picking up on non-verbal cues. But it doesn’t mean we always have to stare each other in the face. Because, let’s be honest, it’s exhausting.

We all know it’s ok to mute. But I want to make it clear that it’s just as ok to face-mute—to turn your camera off—especially in certain situations.

When eating. On days when I’m slammed with back-to-back meetings, I often eat during calls. To avoid turning the meeting into a mukbang session, I turn off audio and video.
When multitasking. Not all parts of all meetings I’m at are relevant to me. If folks are talking about something that doesn’t pertain to me, I use that time for busywork, like checking Slack. I don’t face-mute to hide my multitasking—it’s a good use of time—but if I had my video on, it’d be noticeable and distracting to others to see me doing something else.
In large group meetings. If no one’s going to see you anyway, feel free to give yourself a break, so you don’t have to worry if people noticed the weird way you itched your ear.

When you don’t have your game face on. We’re not camera-ready 100% of the time. While time-shifting to accommodate time zones, I’ve popped into 5 a.m. meetings. I’m not getting up at 4:45 a.m. to get my game face on, and believe me, you don’t want to see my face at that hour.
And there’s one more big one: face-mute whenever you feel like it.
How to encourage people not to face-mute
Yes, it’s ok—and sometimes important—to keep your camera off during a video call. But it’s also nice to see people’s faces sometimes, and the visual aspect of synchronous communication has obvious benefits.
Instead of issuing a hard edict, you can encourage attendees to show their faces by implementing a few strategies.

Have an agenda and share it ahead of time. It lets those who are multitasking know when something will be relevant to them. Instead of defaulting to camera-off the whole time, they can turn their camera on when it’s a pertinent agenda item.
Keep things concise. It’s easier to put your game face on if it’s a shorter meeting, and people might be more open to camera-on for 15 minutes than 45. Don’t schedule a one-hour meeting just because it’s the calendar default.
Ask engaging questions or use breakout rooms for small group discussions. People are more likely to show their faces if they’re actually participating.
Don’t record the meeting unless it’s really necessary. Being on camera all day is tiring enough. Knowing that it’s going to be recorded and live forever in the bowels of Skynet—uh, the internet—adds another layer of pressure. If a recording is necessary, add timestamps so people can easily skip to relevant sections, and enable closed captions and/or transcripts so people can get the context without staring at everyone’s recorded faces. As an added bonus, it’ll make your meetings more accessible.

I concede that meetings are sometimes (I repeat—sometimes!) necessary, but you can decrease the burden of being camera-on all the time. It may not be a full zoom anymore, but see if you can at least turn that plod into an amble.

This righteous bot trolls hypocritical brands posting about International Women’s Day,Cate Lawrence,2022/03/8,"
It’s that time of year again: inspiration porn is everywhere, image libraries are seeing huge downloads of diverse females in suits, and women are organizing their own celebrations without pay.
Yes, it’s International Women’s Day.
But what happens when we look behind the sickly efforts of corporations? The back-patting social media posts? The tokenization?
Well, you’ll find a fucking huge gender pay gap.
Introducing… the Gender Pay Gap Bot
The Gender Pay Gap Bot
Today some anonymous activists launched a campaign on Twitter to raise awareness about the gender pay gap. It explains:
Employers, if you tweet about International Women’s Day, I’ll retweet your gender pay gap.
That’s right: it uses a bot to name and shame. Excellent. 
It’s a mighty, powerful fuck you to corporations and their carefully curated social media posts, and I like it. Some choice examples: 

In this organisation, women’s median hourly pay is 68.6% lower than men’s. https://t.co/Vk45EVqON4

In this organisation, women’s median hourly pay is 37% lower than men’s. https://t.co/ZbCVRKW5Dx
— Gender Pay Gap Bot (@PayGapApp) March 8, 2022

The bot is using data sourced from a UK government database.  This is great, especially when you consider the state of women in the UK government.
The UK is governed by a conservative government, where women make up just 33% (225) of the elected representatives in the House of Commons, and only six ministers in the current Cabinet (27%) are women. 
On top of that, only 28% (229) of members of the House of Lords are women. And no, I don’t understand how the House of Lords can exist in 2022 either. 
One thing’s for certain though: that’s a lot of men making decisions on behalf of women. 
Fortunately, the campaign also highlights some companies that are doing things right:

In this organisation, men’s and women’s median hourly pay is equal. https://t.co/cdUZTXY2kl

In this organisation, women’s median hourly pay is 16.5% higher than men’s. https://t.co/iG1tVB07es

Great to see!
A day doesn’t make up for a year of gender discrimination 
However, the reality is that equality and inclusion go far beyond an event or campaign. I haven’t been at TNW for long, but I’m pleased to work for a company where pay rates are the same regardless of gender. 
This is achieved by having a salary house assign a wage level (or two) to a role based on experience and qualifications, meaning each person gets paid the same amount for that role. 
The company hasn’t always been blameless when it comes to speaker representation or remuneration. However, TNW is currently working to ensure that half of our conference speakers are female or gender diverse. 
I’ve written about the lack of gender diversity at tech conferences before. Many of us are familiar with attending events where we feel unwelcome, such as through the use of marketing gimmicks like “booth babes.”
Yes, this is still a thing, even in Berlin, a city where International Women’s Day is a public holiday.
So please take a closer look at all the companies blasting out about their great female employees today. 
Ask yourself, how many women are in management? How many are board members? Do they foster an inclusive workplace culture? What practices do they have to deal with workplace sexual harassment, bullying, and discrimination? Do they provide maternity and paternity leave? 
We’re privileged to work in tech, the wealthiest industry of all, but there’s still a lot of work to do. Fixing the gender gap takes more than a day each year.

Stop obsessing over Elizabeth Holmes’ voice — it’s sexist,The Conversation,2022/03/4,"
There is a scene in Hulu’s new series, “The Dropout,” where Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, wearing a white blouse, stands in front of a mirror and practices saying, “This is an inspiring step forward.” With each iteration, her voice deepens.
As the world has learned about Theranos’ web of deception – whether through John Carreyrou’s bestselling book, “Bad Blood,” Apple’s podcast series “The Dropout” or Hulu’s streaming series of the same name – Holmes’ supposed attempt to alter her voice is a detail that captivates audiences. The behavior might strike some people as bizarre, even sociopathic.
But because of my training in vocology, the study of vocalization, and my interest in speech biases, I’m intrigued by why Holmes may have felt compelled to change her voice in the first place. I see the story of her voice as part of a broader cultural fixation on the way women speak and sound.
Reactions to Holmes’ voice
Whenever Holmes is in the news, some questions always come up:
What’s with that distinctively low voice? Is she faking it?
I have not been able to find definitive proof, in the form of video or audio recordings, to show that Holmes’ voice is noticeably different in its current form than at some previous time.
One video claims to capture Holmes shifting between two very different voice modes. During this interview with Elizabeth Holmes, commenters highlight a vocal switch between the 1:28 and 2:08 marks.

However, it could have been easily edited. And dramatic, sustained pitch changes in speech can be associated with heightened emotional states without indicating a put-on voice. At the same time, people who know Holmes have claimed that she changed her voice in order to cultivate a persona as a Silicon Valley wunderkind.
Only a clinician like a laryngologist can make a voice-related medical diagnosis. But since I can’t definitively answer if Holmes’ voice changed intentionally, it is worth considering what natural or medical processes could cause a similar effect. Hormones directly impact the voice, including pitch and the perception of roughness or hoarseness. Women’s voices tend to decrease in pitch range during menopause.
Holmes’ young age at the time she became known for her voice may rule out an age-related hormonal voice change, but a similar effect could be found with certain hormone therapy. There are also several voice disorders that impact pitch range.
If she did it … how?
There are all sorts of reasons people seek voice therapy or coaching to address vocal insecurities. Whether they’re concerned about their voice range or simply seeking skills to become better communicators, the voice is resilient and can be developed with training. There are also wonderful resources available for gender-affirming voice support for transgender people.
So what is the physiological process at play when someone intentionally lowers their voice.
Engaging a tiny laryngeal muscle called the thyroarytenoid causes the vocal folds, which are housed inside the larynx (or “voice box”), to relax and become shorter and thicker. Imagine decreasing tension on a rubber band. These shorter, thicker folds vibrate at a lower frequency, resulting in a lower-pitched voice, just as a thicker or more lax guitar string has a lower pitch.
It is likely the singular nature of Holmes’ voice is related not only to its low pitch, but also its resonance, the unique tonal quality, and placement of the voice. Holmes might adjust her resonance by consciously lowering the larynx. Doing so creates a longer space above the larynx, which boosts the deeper, darker tones in the voice.
Women’s voices subject to scrutiny
In my role as a theatrical voice coach, I’m sometimes asked to help women actors lower their voices. I’ve encountered directors and producers with a significant distaste for higher-pitched women’s voices, especially when this pitch range is combined with nasal resonance.
In movies and on TV, characters with high-pitched voices are often portrayed as comical, dim-witted, and generally undesirable. Think of Lina Lamont, the character from “Singin’ in the Rain” memorably played by Jean Hagen. Her high, piercing voice became a source of consistent laughs.
Might sexist attitudes about women’s voices cause women in leadership roles to feel pressured to adjust their pitch range down?
Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, nicknamed the “Iron Lady,” famously down-shifted her voice to burnish her stature. Research on perceptions of pitch in women’s voices shows higher ones are associated with physical attractiveness, while lower voices are associated with dominance.
Meanwhile, many women radio and podcast hosts are barraged with negative listener feedback about “vocal fry,” the creaky mode of speaking made famous by Kim Kardashian.
Yet physiologically, to create this sound, the vocal folds must vibrate at a low frequency, associated with low pitch. This much-maligned vocal feature is at one end of the pitch spectrum. But there’s another equally hated speech feature that is achieved at the other end: the high-rising terminal intonation pattern, or “uptalk.” This feature is noted for the dramatic upward pitch at the end of each thought, which can make statements sound like questions.
The insistence that women in media change the pitch of their voices often comes with little concern for the anatomical and physiological factors that will limit how much pitch change is ultimately possible. My current research is investigating perceptions of women’s speaking voices in the performing arts and considering whether it’s time to part ways with some old aesthetic preferences.
Either way, the delicate dance of trying to strike a happy medium – the Goldilocks voice profile, where one can be taken seriously as a leader without being perceived as inauthentic, grating or patronizing – seems to be elusive. Women’s voices are the subject of endless scrutiny at both ends of the range – it seems they just can’t win.
If everything about this story were the same except the gender of Theranos’ CEO, I wonder whether his voice would even be remarked upon. If it were, might the same vocal qualities be perceived as positive traits befitting a capable, serious-minded leader?
Elizabeth Holmes undoubtedly lacks the practical skills and moral compass to be a great leader. But all the noise about her voice, and the potential that she changed it to get ahead, just may reveal a sexist double standard that women seemingly can’t escape.

"Tech loves to talk ‘diversity,’ but some firms are actually moving backwards",The Conversation,2022/03/3,"
The U.S.tech sector is growing 10 times faster and has wages twice as high as the rest of the economy. This industry also wins the race for high profits and stock returns.
At the same time, the tech sector’s professional, managerial and executive labor forces are overwhelmingly white and male.
It is not surprising, then, that the field is under a great deal of pressure to diversify its labor force.
As researchers who study inequality, we examined the data to go beyond the picture of diversity in the tech sector as a whole. In our most recent research, we looked at which types of tech firms increased their workforce diversity, by how much, and for which groups of people. What we found surprised us.
Our research used machine learning techniques and firm-level data on employment diversity for 6,163 tech firms employing 2,582,342 workers. We used a clustering algorithm to identify groups of firms with similar changes in diversity between 2008 and 2016.
We focused in particular on professional jobs – the programmers, engineers, and designers who are the core source of innovation in the sector. We also looked at the managers and executives responsible for human resource practices. We don’t identify specific firms because this data was originally collected by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and our ability to analyze it requires strict confidentiality.
Diversity trajectories
We found that 80% of firms displayed a pattern of very minimal increases in diversity in their professional labor force, primarily driven by small increases in the employment of Asian men and Asian women, with declines among non-Asian women and no change among other minority men. We also found that this widespread pattern reflects much slower movement toward employment diversity in this sector than in the rest of the U.S. labor force.
Our findings for the remaining 20% of firms surprised us. We found some firms with rapid increases in diversity among professional jobs, and others where diversity declined substantially. In about 10% of firms, we found rapid increases in the proportion of white male professionals, in most the percentage of women fell, but in some, mainly Asian men were displaced. This latter small group of firms also saw growth in all other groups, even Asian women. This pattern permitted white male dominance at the expense of Asian men while making room for all other groups.
More hopefully, we observed a rapid growth in diversity of the technical labor force in two types of firms. In both, the percentage of white men declined by about a quarter. In the larger of these two groups, about 7% of tech sector firms, white male professionals were primarily replaced with white and Asian women, although Hispanic and Black men and women saw gains as well. The second group of firms was smaller, representing only 2% of tech firms. In these, white men were replaced by Asian men and Asian women, while all other groups declined as well.
We found similar patterns at the managerial and executive levels. Most firms showed little change, but there were small groups with rapid increases in diversity, and others with rapid decreases.
White male executives declined across the sector by 5.9%, and we discovered significant increases in the representation of all other groups, even Hispanic women, in the top jobs. It appears that the most common tech response to the pressure to increase diversity was to move more women and minorities into executive positions. This pattern has been described in previous research as being primarily a defensive response to diversity demands rather than a commitment to promoting employment diversity.
When do firms become more inclusive?
We also wanted to figure out which types of firms showed a pattern of rapidly increased diversity. Here we have two more hopeful findings.
Firms where professional diversity was growing rapidly also tended to be among those with rapid overall employment growth. Diversity looks to be good for business – or perhaps innovative, well-run businesses are better at hiring more diverse labor forces.
We wondered whether increased diversity among managers who do the hiring and executives who set the tone was associated with having a rapidly diversifying professional labor force. Here we found that those firms with strong increases in managerial diversity also tended to embrace strong increases in professional diversity. In contrast, strong increases in executive diversity did not reliably raise the chances that a firm would have strong diversity growth among its core professional labor force.
Window dressing or diversity now?
It looks to us as though the recipe for increasing diversity in the tech sector is at least in part to increase diversity at the managerial level. It also looks like increased diversity is good for business, although it is also possible that well-run firms hire more diverse labor forces. Unfortunately, this combination is not widespread. Dramatic improvements in employment diversity are confined to only 10% of firms.
We believe that most of the technology industry is stuck in a low-inclusion rut, and a disturbing set of firms are moving backward. However, a handful of firms demonstrate that diversity is possible now.

How to build high-tech tools for low-tech industries,Blanka Szamos,2022/03/3,"
The past two years have provided some extreme dynamics for technology and innovation. Business and industries were shaken up and some were forced to adapt to digitization faster than planned.
2021 was the year to refine goals and adapt to a new reality. However, 2022 has the potential to become a year of even bigger changes.
When experts discuss fast-growing trends in technology, eCommerce is one of the leading examples. No surprise there, we’re talking about an industry with a tremendous growth history. Not to mention its ability to adapt to challenges (and world-wide pandemics) is faster than the wind.
But, instead of rushing to adapt to new technology, some industries are considered late adopters — or so called “laggards” in the technology adoption cycle. These are industries with long histories and a workforce which is often less tech savvy than in emerging industries. While many had been able to resist digital transformation in an ever evolving digital world, the pandemic made it necessary to kick tech adoption into high gear.
There’s now high demand for user-friendly tools that can help less tech savvy users adopt change quickly. But how do you go about designing tech tools for these industries? Can we use the same processes?
We interviewed two entrepreneurs from the latest batch of Techleap.nl’s Rise Program, FeedbackFruits and RoomRaccoon, who are set to shake up the (slightly more traditional and less tech savvy) education and hotel industries with innovative ideas and approaches.
From helping teachers design digital learning experiences to giving small-scale hoteliers a tech boost, here are five things you should know about designing tech tools for late stage adopters.
Speak their language
Education and students were hit hard through the different COVID-19 waves and variants, leading to a rapid and often not fully prepared switch to online education. A McKinsey report expanded on the effect that “unfinished learning” can have on students. It also notes how technology could provide the boost the education system needs to bridge the gap.
FeedbackFruits is on a mission to transform the education system through EdTech. Founder and CEO, Ewoud de Kok, designed tools that are easy to use, and understandable for both teachers and students. For him, having an open mindset to EdTech and new methods, can move the adoption cycle faster.
But how can you help your users develop an open mindset to new tech?
First, as Ewoud explained, you need to make it as close to the user’s current reality as possible.
During FeedbackFruits’ 1.0 version of the product, pedagogy and online education still had a long way to go in technological adoption. Ewoud and his team spent a lot of time and energy to properly understand their users and make adjustments to create a more seamless solution.
An insider-tip he shared was to focus on terminology.
You should invest time into explaining your product using their vocabulary. When it comes to educational institutions, we learned it was best to use terms like “learning objective,” “activity,” or “method,” which are commonly used by educators.
When you design a tool for late stage adopters, simply taking the time to learn how to speak your users’ “language” will make user education and adoption much easier and faster.
What if you’re already on your 2.0 version? Well, take that extra mile to get even closer to your users and design an even better 3.0 version. Optimization is an always-on approach.
Have an outstanding customer service experience
This is strongly connected to the previous point. It seems simple, yet it has a domino effect.
When you keep polishing and tweaking your product, users will have different interaction points with it. Some can adapt to it fast, some can get confused. And when confusion and frustration sets in, this is often the point when less tech savvy users will give up and go back to the old way of doing things.
Remember that your overall user experience is connected to how your users receive help when they feel stuck or have an issue with the experience. Hiring a team of patient, easy to understand customer support professionals (who, again, know how to speak your users’ language) will give late adopters a stronger sense of security when diving into the world of tech. Ewoud explained:
Our support team saved us several times! When you guide your user properly and help with their problems, you create a supporter and a follower.
Motivate the hell out of your users
The hotel industry’s adoption of technology has certainly quickened during the COVID-19 pandemic. This means several businesses had to improve their approach, and rethink their strategy to get the most out of their internal systems, while keeping their guests happy. The demand for new technology in the industry is exceptional. In the past two years, RoomRaccoon grew its team by 210%.
There are so many tech tools being created everyday, but the trick to getting users to choose yours over others is to, not just solve your users problems, but to go beyond by showing them new opportunities and possibilities they may not have thought of before.
Co-founder Tymen van Dyl explained that hoteliers in general are not the most tech-savvy people, and they’re aware of it. Thus, one of the key factors for designing your tool is user experience and motivation.
RoomRaccoon is a platform that helps hotels automatically optimize their rates according to room-sell-probability in real-time. Beyond this, it also offers a solution to automatically upsell room upgrades and extras to guests.
Van Dyl’s team provided an incredible amount of content to help educate users about their tool and new traveltech trends. Their aim is to activate their users, while keeping human interaction alive.
Hoteliers don’t click around that often, so we are putting extra energy into explaining and motivating them to try out new things on our interface. We provide a lot of extra customer and user communication by providing additional content, webinars, and live training.
Localization plays a huge role in this. When you’re active in multiple markets, providing localized content and interface help for your users around the world speeds up the process of trust-building and adaptation.
Be agile and flexible
Always be looking for new opportunities to develop your product and be ready to adapt to new customer pain points.
During the pandemic, the hotel industry faced major changes in dynamics. With travel agencies like Booking.com giving bookers preference when making cancellations, many hoteliers realized just how dependent they were on such agencies.
Challenges like this can be seen as opportunities to re-prioritize. When direct booking became more popular, and the dependency on travel agencies changed, RoomRaccoon’s team introduced Google Hotels integrations, which boomed during the pandemic.
Additionally, gamification became a new trend in customer experience and employee engagement. On the hotel-side, customer support started using gamification to keep employees engaged and motivated by helping them “level up” and gather points for rewards based on their achievements. Meanwhile, gamification provided new ways to engage customers via loyalty programs and reward-systems, giving fast moving brands a competitive edge.
As Van Dyl explained:
You can’t look too much ahead into the future, so be agile and flexible enough based on the market. Keep on communicating with your teams, set your priorities and respond to new events in the industry.
Tech adoption is about enrichment, not replacement
Finally, it’s important to address one of the biggest fears that often hinders tech adoption: the fear of being replaced. During the pandemic, social distancing protocols forced many industries to replace human contact with technology. In the hospitality industry, this meant contactless check-ins.
But, as van Dyl explained, once restrictions were lifted, many hoteliers found that travelers actually wanted to be welcomed by someone at reception — even if they were still using a contactless check-in system. There will always be a need for human interaction. First and foremost, as van Dyl explained, technology should be considered as “enrichment, instead of replacement.”
There you have it, with these five insider tips it’s time to go forth and build your products. All you have to do is listen to the voice of your users, provide outstanding customer experience, motivate like you are reaching for the stars, and be flexible. Keep an eye on what’s happening in the industry and transform it into an opportunity. Finally, don’t forget the human factor. It’s important to stress to your customers, especially late adopters, that technology won’t replace people, it should only enhance your offering.

Why people are leaving your company and how to get them to stay,Ebony-Storm Halladay,2022/02/28,"
When you first heard about The Great Resignation, what did you picture?
Was it an army of white-collar workers hurling their monitors out the window, tearing up contracts and trashing their swivel chairs?
Because the reality is a little less cinematic. People are burned out, miserable, and racking up more hours than ever before. For many, resigning was their last resort.
The Great Resignation concept gets some things right, and many things wrong. Workers are quitting in high numbers, but they’re not all leaving their jobs for the same reason.
Healthcare workers are burned out; exhausted by long hours and limited resources amid the ongoing pandemic. Knowledge workers are sick of spying bosses and shitty progression paths — they’re looking for better opportunities elsewhere.
Both situations suck, but they’re hardly comparable. Is a nurse experiencing the same Great Resignation as a marketing exec at a startup?
Over the course of the pandemic, many of us have restructured our lives, taking advantage of remote working to spend more time with our families, or on our side hustles.
White-collar workers got a taste of what it’s like to be a remote worker. And businesses discovered that work could continue outside the office, something the digital nomads have known for years.
With the perks, came the pitfalls. The toxicity that silently pervaded the office resurfaced remotely. Bosses installed mouse trackers while they lamented the old days of presenteeism. Trust between employers and employees reached an all time low.
So, with worker protections eroded, trust decimated, stagnating wages, and the fear of catching covid ever-present in the workplace, is it really that surprising that people left their jobs?
If The Great Resignation highlighted one thing, it’s this: there’s an overwhelming gap between what employers provide, and what individuals need from work. And bosses need to rethink not just their hiring practices, but their entire company culture to accommodate the transition.
We spoke with two recent cohorts of Techleap’s Rise Programme for fast-growing scaleups to find out more. As experts in the HRTech-recruitment space, they’ve seen the pitfalls and best practices when it comes to recruiting and retaining talent during these uncertain times.
Respect the shift
There are certain benefits workers will want to hold onto post-covid, like flexible hours and remote working. Other parts, like cramming a monitor into their box-sized home office and working 25% longer each week, need to stop.
To close The Great Resignation gap, employers have to respect how work has transformed in the eyes of their teams.
Niels Arntz, cofounder of gig platform Temper, which connects independent workers to shifts in their area, has seen firsthand how both colleagues at HQ and platform users are engaging with the new world of work.
“The years dominated by the pandemic have stimulated awareness,” Niels told me. “People are realizing it’s actually quite nice to have freedom and flexibility during the work week. People had the chance to explore meaningful questions too, like: Is my work important? Does my manager trust me?”
According to a report by McKinsey, 52% of workers want flexible working options post-pandemic. Before the pandemic, only 30% of workers did.
If you want to attract and retain people, you can’t throw down an Uno reverse card and demand that people work the way that they did before. There’s no going back, baby.
Talk to your staff about the parts of pandemic working that work, and the stuff they don’t like so much. Then build your policies and benefits package based on their ideas.
What’s more, you might not even need to hire anyone at all. There are plenty of experienced freelancers (or FreeFlexers, as the Temper team calls them) out there to help you plug the gaps in your team. A roster of reliable independent workers might even be preferential — you won’t need to add anyone to payroll, just pull in a contractor when you need an extra pair of hands.
Capitalize on ‘raw’ talent
Do you really need a world-leading software designer, or is that your ego speaking? Companies struggling to hire would do well to capitalize on raw talent. Instead of pitching for the people everyone else fights for, seek out skilled recruits from parallel industries.
Otto Verhage is chief of operations at TestGorilla, a pre-employment testing platform that champions candidate experience. He sees first-hand how employers unintentionally create obstacles for great candidates.
“Businesses tend to hire purely based on experience. Employers should look to identify talent where others don’t. They’ll have a better chance of finding someone because there’s less competition.”
The strategy is tried and tested (pun intended) at TestGorilla. Otto mentions that employees don’t need industry experience to secure a role at the company.
“We let everyone apply to our jobs, irrespective of their background. Our skill assessments identify promising candidates that we may not consider if we just use CVs. They open our eyes to diverse candidates.”
Niels also emphasises the benefits of a skills-oriented approach. “When I picture the future of work, I imagine a labor market that’s accessible to everyone. Covid has shown us the importance of flexibility. Let’s embrace it, and empower more people with opportunities.”
In which case, maybe it’s time to stop requesting 10 years of experience for a junior developer role. Be real, pal.
Make every day a learning day
In the UK, 43% of adults jumped on the lockdown learning bandwagon. People are continually seeking out opportunities to test their squiggly little skull organ. Employers that are proactive will get one step ahead of the game and start providing these options themselves.
And when businesses deliver on L&D, they can hire less experienced folks and make them brilliant. People are clearly willing to learn. You just need to give them the opportunity.
According to Otto, “when employers seek candidates outside of their usual scope, they have a better chance of hiring someone. But if you want to turn a maths teacher into a data scientist, there’s quite a lot you’ll need to teach them.”
Businesses that make learning and development an integral part of their offering can also boost retention. According to Gallup’s American Upskilling study, 61% of US workers consider upskilling opportunities as an important reason to stay at their job.
If you’re using a platform like Temper to find experienced independent workers, make sure you’re also including them into the learning opportunities you provide for full-timers.
Although they’re growing in number, freelance and flex workers often get forgotten when it comes to company perks, so it makes a huge difference when employers are willing to provide that for them. But keeping these workers engaged and taking the time to train them in how your business operates can ensure you have a skilled pool of temporary workers to call on when needed.
According to Otto, “The speed of technological development and labor market shifts mean people have to learn all the time. The pandemic created the urgency to keep learning to stay relevant.”
Take it back to basic (needs)
In a sea of employee stocks, stationary stipends, and flexible Fridays, basic employee needs get lost.
Sometimes you just want to hear “great presentation!” or “well done for figuring out how to remove the potato filter!” A little bit of praise goes a long way.
Otto identified this with one of TestGorilla’s pre-employment tools. The platform provides candidates and businesses with a motivation test that assesses if the job matches what the candidate is looking for. They also have a separate test to assess culture add which measures value alignment.
“We know for a fact there’s a list of about 10 job characteristics that are incredibly important to candidates. Things like: Do I have enough autonomy in my job? Do I get enough recognition? Can I work on something end to end? Those things are super important.”
Until employers can meet those basic human needs, they probably shouldn’t aim for the bells and whistles anyway. It’s time to get real about what you want and need from candidates.
While you’re at it, don’t fish from the same talent pool as everyone else. Don’t write off raw talent if they have transferable skills. And for crying out loud — do not list Zoom socials as a perk of the job.

"People no longer accept shitty jobs, and it’s fuelling the Great Resignation",The Conversation,2022/01/20,"
“Do what you love,” is no longer just advice.
High school students learn early on that their future careers should be passion-driven. Self-help books counsel job searchers to start with reflection on what they love. And Hollywood films teach people, in romantic fashion, to aspire to work that is intrinsically satisfying and expresses our authentic selves.
Researchers call this way of thinking about work the passion paradigm, and studies show it has become pervasive in modern societies.
The passion paradigm emerged in the 1960s. During this time, there was widespread questioning of social and cultural norms — especially among youth — which helped develop a new way of thinking about the role of work in human life.
This trend was spearheaded by the scholarship of humanistic psychologist Abraham Maslow, who applied his theory of the “hierarchy of needs” to the modern workplace. In Eupsychian Management, Maslow argues that work should be thought of as a key source of personal growth and self-actualization.
Maslow envisioned a world where individuals derive deep satisfaction from their working lives, and who treat their work as a sacred activity.
Since early 2021, I have conducted interviews with over 90 professionals and managers in Toronto, to learn how they think about work. Although there are exceptions, what the data shows, in general, is that Maslow’s theory has increasingly become common.
The downsides of the passion paradigm
Because the rising popularity of the passion paradigm has coincided with both increasing economic inequality and a steep decline in the power of unions, it has attracted a host of criticism.
Sociologist Lindsay DePalma contends that the passion paradigm encourages workers to romanticize their work while blinding them to the unequal distributions of power that characterize their working lives.
In her book Work Won’t Love You Back, journalist Sarah Jaffe argues that loving your job is a bad idea because it is a recipe for (self)exploitation.
Derek Thompson, a staff writer at The Atlantic, maintains that the passion paradigm has fuelled a new religion — “workism” — which is responsible for causing burnout and depression even among high-wage earners.

It’s not just managers who take part in the Great Resignation.

These commentators rightly fear that the passion paradigm can (and does) lead workers to accept harmful working conditions, poor treatment from their employers, and unrealistic expectations from themselves — basically to put up with what they shouldn’t.
When people aspire to love their work, they may prioritize work at the expense of other important aspects of life — family, friends, and hobbies. An overvaluation of work can lead people to see those who cannot work as lazy, stupid, or undeserving of concern.
And yet, despite these evident pitfalls, the passion paradigm can also have the opposite effects. In fact, I would argue that it is one cause of what has been dubbed the “Great Resignation.”
The Great Resignation
In August 2021, 4.3 million American workers quit their jobs, the highest ever recorded. And similar waves have hit the U.K.
In Canada, it’s not clear whether the Great Resignation is taking place with equal intensity, but some studies show that Canadian workers are increasingly considering leaving or switching jobs.
There are many factors causing the Great Resignation. Among the most notable are wage subsidies which have given workers more freedom to choose the kind of work they want to do, the added work stress caused by the pandemic, the need to stay home with young children, and the shift to remote work.
However, I think another reason has to do with the expectations workers have around work — expectations that derive from the passion paradigm.
The passion paradigm and the Great Resignation
By disrupting people’s routines, the pandemic has reawakened in many the deep-seated desire for a job they actually enjoy — a desire that has long been suppressed.
My interviews make it clear that many Canadian workers are looking at their jobs and asking themselves, “Is this really what I’m passionate about?” “Do I want to spend the majority of my waking hours doing this?” “Does my job bring me meaning?”
And this isn’t just managers. The highest number of resignations in Canada have taken place within the accommodation and foodservice industries. And as a recent article in The Atlantic put it, “this level of quitting is really an expression of optimism that says, ‘We can do better.’”
In a sense, the passion paradigm is paradoxically fuelling the demand for better, more satisfying, and more meaningful work. It is because workers expect more that they are no longer willing to put up with the status quo.
The passion paradigm requires a strong safety net
Of course, none of this could have happened without the government supports that reweighed the balance of power between workers and bosses.
Since the 1980s, workers have had less and less power to negotiate. So, while the passion paradigm may have grown in popularity, it grew in economic conditions that were largely determined by employers, not employees.
But in the wake of the pandemic, this has slowly begun to change. Faced with labor shortages, employers are forced to take workers seriously when it comes to demands around pay, flexibility, autonomy, and scheduling. They are receiving the message that “business as usual” is no longer acceptable — and, in some cases, they’re caving.
The crucial takeaway is that the passion paradigm can fuel demands for better, more meaningful work, but this is only possible when it’s accompanied by a strong social safety net.
Workers don’t need to stop loving their jobs. But they should ask whether their jobs are themselves loveable. And this is easier to do when you have real economic freedom.

Northern Europe’s founders lack ambition — here’s what we should do,Alejandro Tauber,2022/01/18,"
All in all, 2021 has been a great year for European unicorn creation with some media speaking of a ‘European unicorn boom’. To date, more than 70 European private companies have boasted a $1 billion plus valuation, bringing the total number of unicorns produced since 1990 to 296, slightly more than China.
But there’s still a long way to go. While Europe may be pulling ahead of China in terms of fresh unicorns, the US managed to mint 184 in the first eight months of 2021, with more on the way in the months after.
What’s one thing that could hold Europe back from competing in the unicorn market? A lack of ambition.
A recent report by Techleap.nl, a Dutch organization that strives to build a “thriving Dutch startup ecosystem,” and the University of Utrecht, found a startling paradox. Using data collected by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, they concluded that while the country has a high number of entrepreneurs, few have ambitions to grow their business on a larger scale.
The researchers behind the report posit:
Is the Dutch culture of ‘just act normal, that is crazy enough as it is’ limiting us? The Netherlands has become one of the best startup ecosystems in the world, but few startups transform into scaleups and unicorns.
“Ambition is something the country is going to have to attack if the goal is to grow more unicorns,” said Joe Wilson, a US native and CEO of Dutch company Risenu. He’s now one of Techleap.nl’s entrepreneurs in residence, providing mentoring for the organization’s Rise program cohorts.
Being from a country where ambitious (and at times cocky) founder personalities are the norm, Wilson provides a unique perspective on the very different Dutch ecosystem. He shares a story a Dutch scaleup founder shared with him that illustrates the problem with ambition in The Netherlands.
If you open one pizza shop, everybody in the room is excited. They’re like, ‘wow, that’s so great. Nice job.’ You open two pizza shops, and they’re like, ‘you’re doing so well. We’re so proud of you.’ You open three pizza shops, and they’re like, ‘why are you so fucking greedy?’
This isn’t a purely Dutch problem either. His Danish counterpart Nicolaj Christensen, Director of Digital Operations at Digital Hub Denmark, agrees, “that mindset shift is something that we’ve been struggling with.”
So how can we solve this success complex? The three gentlemen have some ideas.
Mentorship from previously successful startup founders
Maturity of the ecosystem is something all three national startup cheerleaders mention as part of the cause for the recent success of Europe. What this meant was unclear to me, until Christensen put it in very simple terms.
You had the first generation of founders who had to leave Denmark and go to the US to build their startup, companies like Unity and JustEat. They went abroad, made it big, and have these massive success stories. Then they came back home, reinvested their money but, more importantly, they also reinvested their knowledge. This helped reinvigorate the whole ecosystem.
Now we’re also seeing a second wave of founders doing the same thing. They’re CEOs who are still operational, still building, but they’re also taking the time out to go help the next generation of founders.
This reflects some pretty decent academic research, which concludes that knowledge imparted by investors, advisors, other entrepreneurs, and, in particular, corporate venture funds, are more important than the money they bring into the company due to the operational value they add. And the inspiration, of course.
Wilson sees this in the Dutch ecosystem as well:
I think the money is almost less important than these CEOs sharing their experience. Every time we have one of these guys talk at Techleap.nl, everybody’s eyes light up with the possibility that there isn’t a ceiling for success. Every time a great technical Dutch company breaks through, it’s a sign that it can be done.
He continues, “the key is that we recognize and shine the light on those people who are willing to take a chance, who are willing to show their ambition. We should celebrate ambition rather than criticizing it.”
Good education
This feeling can be even stronger when a founder’s personal proximity to a fellow founder who reached unicorn status is smaller – like if they went to the same university.
Both Wilson and Christensen share the view that a strong academic foundation breeds more innovative companies with huge potential.
“I think there’s a real specialty in the Netherlands around deeptech, like biotech. And your love of academia does create pockets of super cool developments. There’s plenty of cool shit being created in this country. I think the ideation to MVP is probably per capita one of the best in the world,” Wilson gushes, while also raising two big issues.
The first is that connecting the initial innovation to a successful business model doesn’t always happen as smoothly as it could. And second, there are just not enough students enrolling in areas with high unicorn-potential.
As Christensen puts it:
Talent, talent, talent, right? When we talk to the startups and scaleups and ask them what is really hindering their growth right now, it’s the lack of talent.
There’s no such thing as doing too much in this space, because the demand here is so big, and it’s only going to get bigger. It’s hindering companies’ growth today, will continue tomorrow, and become even bigger in the future. So we can never do ‘too much’ in terms of talent attraction and education.
Take a global perspective as soon as possible
Christensen thinks that part of the success of Denmark’s ecosystem is thanks to ambitious startups being forced to quickly take a more global outlook. “You need to go wherever it suits your business model,” he says. “That could be the Nordics, UK, or Germany, depending on your market. We could still be better at that. We can still go abroad much, much earlier.”
When it comes to The Netherlands, Wilson says, “I really believe that the Dutch have this great ability to start interesting things, but for some reason they don’t try to explode their business across the planet.”
Red tape might be one reason startups don’t more readily expand abroad. Multiple startup organizations mention that startups sometimes skip over expansion in Europe to move to the US, simply because complying with regulations in 27 different countries is way more of a hassle.
While this might sound like a nightmare, Wilson actually sees this as an opportunity.
“So I mentioned ChannelEngine, they wanted to run a European business first. There are different rules and languages in each country, and they just went out and mastered those. Then, when they wanted to expand to South America, the US, and Australia, they already had structures in place to learn and adapt to different cultures, regulations, and languages.”
But you don’t have to go so far away to make it big, he adds. “I do think there is a growing number of companies that believe you can make a unicorn in Europe, and you don’t have to go to the US. We’ve seen Polish companies who created a unicorn just in the domestic market.”
This is what I imagine the EU is aiming for with the newly announced Startup Nations Standard, a set of practices to create a “growth friendly environment,” which includes a bunch of things from this article as well. But also some points we have not touched on, like equity.
Stocks for everyone!
Both the German and Danish startup reps wouldn’t touch this policy detail on the record, but in most European countries it’s basically bad news to give your employees stock. Options or actual stock are treated as possessions by tax authorities, even though the valuation of the stock is completely virtual and the ‘possession’ is totally illiquid. Which in turn might limit the ambitions of both startup founders, and early employees who could be the driving force for more ambitious outlooks.
Wilson would go on the record saying that this awkward equity taxation, “reverts the compensation systems in the company to being about the salary as opposed to about the shared vision and contribution goal. So you don’t get to promote your belief system quite as strongly as when employees directly benefit from increased valuations.”
Although it does seem some countries, like The Netherlands, are taking a closer look at the current tax policy, it could still be a long time before European unicorns actually mint a bunch of new millionaires – who can then go on and invest their money and knowledge into new startups, creating a flywheel effect.
The Startup Nation Standard does seem like a well thought out document that addresses many of the issues reflected in this article, if adopted by enough European countries.
And maybe, considering Europe’s unicorn growth rate, we’re doing somewhat great already? Ugh, I’m so Dutch I can’t even say it without the question mark.

3 mindset shifts your bank needs for a successful digital transformation,Jamie Tolentino,2022/01/17,"
In a previous article, we discussed how a whopping 78% of enterprises fail on their digital transformation initiatives and that banks experience specific issues like legacy processes, tightly coupled technical systems, failure of innovation labs, lack of proper incentives for being risk-savvy, and underestimation of the scope of change.
There’s so much information out there about creating the right strategies and processes to tackle digital transformation, but what’s often overlooked is the mindset shift that needs to occur to actually make real change happen. The ‘why’ behind all the time, effort, and resources you’ll put towards this needs to be clear or, even the most comprehensive plan will fizzle out and die.
And it can’t just be the senior level, every change agent within your organization needs to understand why the changes you’re making are essential today and not ‘after’ or ‘tomorrow.’
Nick Van Weerdenburg, CEO of Rangle.io, says that, “Digital cannot be developed from the margins as adjacent to the core business. It must become the core business. We’ve seen this scenario play out dozens of times over the years”.
When organizations fail to see meaningful results from their digital investments, it’s often because of a reluctance to change what’s working now, and this usually includes their core business model.
A common but unsuccessful strategy involves implementing ad hoc digital initiatives and side projects that are intentionally kept at arms’ length from the core business. While initially appearing successful, these initiatives ultimately fail once the business attempts to integrate with the existing operating model.
Digital transformation cannot be solved by simply throwing more money or people at the problem. Copying what other businesses do is also prone to failure because your organization’s context is unique, even if it looks similar on the surface. Fundamentally, business leaders must be able to articulate why the business needs to change and what the future of the organization looks like, and this requires a major mindset shift.
Digital has radically changed the nature of the banking game, and there are three important themes to take into account.
Customer experience is significantly different in a digital world
With the emergence of neobanks and fintechs, consumers now know that financial services can exist as a purely digital service. As a result, people in all age groups prefer digital banking over in-person. Almost 80% want to manage some or all their finances digitally, and more than half use digital banking once a week or more. Furthermore, 32% of customers are more likely to change banks if they encounter technical issues when banking online.
This change in consumer expectations is likely brought on by increased digital usage since 73% of customers say that one extraordinary experience can raise their expectations of other companies. Regardless of the catalyst, 75% of consumers now expect companies to use new technologies to create better experiences.
But it’s not just competition from other banks that we need to be worried about. Previously, customers would compare the digital experience of one bank to another bank, but now they compare digital experiences across all industries, making the competition even more fierce.
Essentially, the customer experience is now defined by every experience in your customers’ ‘digital-everything’ ecosystem, rather than just rivals in your area or industry. This is important because 39% of dissatisfied users say that they can’t accomplish everything they intend to in digital channels, indicating that customer expectations regarding digital interactions and services have changed. This results in a lot of pressure for companies to continuously improve and modernize the entire customer experience from end-to-end, making it fast, personalized, and evolvable.
We need to embrace the notion that a world class digital customer experience is not just a nice to have, it’s essential for survival.
The fourth industrial revolution will significantly alter the world
In the past, industrial revolutions have significantly altered life as people knew it. The first used water and steam power to mechanize production, the second harnessed electric power for mass production and the third utilized electronics and information technology to automate production.
Klaus Schwab, author of The Fourth Industrial Revolution, claims that the current revolution we’re experiencing will fundamentally, “alter the way we live, work, and relate to one another. In its scale, scope, and complexity, the transformation will be unlike anything humankind has experienced before.”
The fourth revolution builds on the third digital revolution, this time characterized by a fusion of technologies which blur lines between physical, digital, and biological spheres. The Fourth is distinct from previous revolutions because it is evolving at an exponential (versus linear) pace and disrupting almost every industry, in every country. The Fourth’s breadth and depth has the capacity to transform entire systems of production, management, and governance.
Current innovations brought by the third digital revolution like processing power, storage capacity, and access to knowledge will reach almost unlimited levels, while new emergent technologies like artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, and quantum computing will experience breakthroughs in the Fourth.
For example, artificial intelligence is already pervasive in our daily lives in the form of self-driving cars, drones, virtual assistants, and translation software driven by an exponential increase in computing power and big data processing. Consequently, 62% of customers are open to the use of AI to improve experiences – up from 59% in 2018.
For businesses, this means that new technologies will create completely novel ways of serving existing needs and significantly disrupt existing industry value chains. Those that are slow to adopt this new technology will therefore fall behind fast, meanwhile early adopters could gain a competitive advantage.
Banks will also have to keep up with evolving consumer expectations as physical products and services can now be enhanced with digital capabilities.
Divided, hierarchical organizations aren’t fit for the digital age
The divided and hierarchical organizational structure is no longer fit for purpose when applied in unstable and uncertain contexts, like the digital world and the Fourth industrial revolution, where value is generated through an unpredictable innovation process.
Instead, an adaptive environment is needed where employees feel safe to ask questions, experiment, and apply divergent thinking in order to discover the right solutions for the challenge at hand.
The divided hierarchy, where work is divided and distributed into various zones performing highly specific and well-defined tasks worked well for stable environments like manufacturing, because the work is often routine, repetitive, and knowable. Dividing up the tasks created value because the process maximized efficiency and enabled scale. However, most of the work involved in digital transformation is neither routine, repetitive, or knowable so a different process is needed.
The new organizational structure needs to enable high-quality information flow, cross-functional collaboration, and daily learning. For example, measures can be taken to foster psychological safety, the ability to show and employ one’s self without fear of negative consequences of self-image, status, or career in the workplace. Leaders can frame work as a learning rather than an execution problem, acknowledge their own fallibility, and model curiosity by asking lots of questions.
Divergent thinking, the ability to generate new ideas, can also be practiced more effectively if separated and practiced in a different setting where convergent thinking, the process of thinking about what to do with those ideas, occurs.
Anne Manning states that divergent thinking is akin to reaching up while convergent thinking is akin to reaching down. If you try to do both at the same time, you will end up not doing either, so it’s best to do both actions in separate instances.
Start with why
There are a number of challenges financial institutions need to overcome to get on track with their digital transformation. But Bertrand Karerangabo, Chief Strategy Officer at Rangle.io believes that, “transformation is achievable — in every organization, and within every department and line of business.”
However, it will require, not just new policies, but a shift in mindset and culture. The first thing that needs to be clear for everyone, from the executive level to the newest hire, isn’t how this change will happen but why change is essential and what factors are driving it.

Entrepreneurs! Your social networks should be small and curated,The Conversation,2022/01/10,"
Bigger is always better. Many of us think this is true when it comes to building our online networks of social media friends, connections and followers. But new research suggests the opposite may be closer to the truth: curating small networks of trusted connections may be smarter in the long run. While this may seem counterintuitive, it also comes with a caveat.
We often feel compelled and are even encouraged by social media platforms, to grow our networks. Consider all the prompts about “someone else you might know” and “who to follow.” We all want the sociometrics (that number of friends or followers posted in the corner of your profile) to look good.
Offline and online social networks
Both offline and online, our social networks can function as either prisms or pipes.
As prisms, they broadcast to others our likes, dislikes, opinions, interests, activities, and more. They signal who we are, or want to be, to our network of social connections.
As pipes, they act as conduits through which help and resources can flow. Using our networks as pipes is an important part of how we build relationships. We give and receive advice, advocacy, endorsement, emotional support, and tangible things (like entrepreneurs do, for example).
Studies of face-to-face networks have generally shown that, whether we use our networks as prisms or pipes, bigger is better.
But what about online?
We flock to social media networks like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram because it’s easy to view, share and store our connections, allowing us to communicate with them whenever we want. That’s what makes connecting online and offline so different. We can’t search and find a comment we made six days ago to a friend over coffee. We can, however, find and reshare a conversation we had with our Facebook “friends” three years ago. It turns out that’s a really important distinction.
It’s when we use our online networks as pipes, not prisms, that small matters and seems to be valuable. In a recent study of Canadian entrepreneurs, our team of researchers uncovered this counterintuitive point and shed light on the reasons why.
We think it suggests some broader insights.
Using our online networks
For people to actually use their online networks as pipes for resources and support, three things need to come together. First, we need to believe we have the ability to ask for or give a resource or support (termed exchange). Second, we need to have a way to actually make the exchange happen. And finally, we need to want to conduct the exchange.
All those digital viewing, scanning, sharing, searching and storing capabilities of our social media networks make it really easy for us to believe we have the ability and arrangements to use our networks as pipes. I can quickly and easily ask my online network for something I need and get a quick response. But our research suggests that we don’t always have the willingness to ask.
Through interviews with entrepreneurs, we uncovered that the reason is likely that people are really worried about what others will think. This perceived social judgment risk can get in the way of entrepreneurs getting helpful resources from their online networks. We suspect it’s not just entrepreneurs who are worried about this. That’s because perceived social judgment risk is a product of audience collapse, which reduces our willingness to reach out online.
Audience collapse happens when we add people to our online networks from all aspects of our lives. These might be people we know well and people we barely know; personal connections, work acquaintances, volunteer connections, hometown connections and those with shared interests and hobbies.
By building these varied and oversized networks, and inviting so many different people to join, our willingness to ask for help goes down. With all that searching, viewing and sharing, who knows where our request might land?
Our research reveals that many of us likely perceive a lot of social judgment risk in asking for anything but information from our online networks. We are worried that others will judge our asks as weak, needy, unsure, confused, too personal or otherwise inappropriate, making us less willing to seek help. This dark side implication of bigger is better social media networking is rarely discussed.
If this resonates, what can you do?
To make our social media networks useful as pipes, we suggest creating trust networks. These are purpose-built to stay small — yes, small. Only add people who will support, not negatively judge, and help you  — these are the people you trust.
A trust network is likely to be very high in reciprocity, or the giving and getting of help, because all members feel it is a safe place to ask for and give help. It becomes a really useful pipe network where small, not big, is valuable.
So, if you want to use your online networks as a prism to signal things to the world — stay big. But if you want to give and get help, then create a purpose-built, small trust network on social media. We think you’ll be glad you did.

Your brand needs a Discord community — here’s how to build it,Zapier,2022/01/8,"
My main gig is writing marketing content, but I also wear lots of hats for an independent media criticism site called Unwinnable. I’ve been managing their social media, writing articles for them, and serving as an editor for five years now.
At Unwinnable, we use a classic-turned-modern publishing model. We have online articles, but our main operation is our magazine: a monthly PDF that you subscribe to like a print magazine. So we’re always looking for ways to make our subscribers’ experience better.
Earlier this year, we revamped our subscriber Discord server into a proper community, and I learned a lot working with the Unwinnable team to engage subscribers this way. I’d like to share what I learned—so here’s how you can create a Discord community for your brand.
Decide if Discord is right for your brand
Before you invest time and resources into a Discord community, make sure it’ll be a good fit for your brand. Here are some factors that affect how well Discord could work for your community versus a platform like Slack:
Your industry. Discord tends to suit B2C businesses better than B2B since it’s a casual platform originally meant for gamers.
Audience interests. Age and buyer behavior will affect your audience’s interest in using Discord. Younger, “geeky” audiences tend to use Discord more than older, less tech-familiar groups.
Funnel stage. Discord works well for customers near the bottom of the marketing funnel: people who already know your organization and product.
Message archiving. If you plan on including a knowledge base in your community, Discord lets you search all of your server’s previous messages regardless of how many you have. (Slack limits the number of previous messages that free users can see.)
Audio and video capabilities. Discord’s signature feature is its voice and video chatting, which could serve some communities better than others.
Threading capabilities. Discord has a thread feature, but those threads eventually archive themselves. You’ll need to use Slack for permanent threads.
NFT/crypto support. Discord recently considered adding NFT and cryptocurrency features, which could be positive or negative, depending on your stance.
At Unwinnable, we originally had a Slack community for subscribers, but we switched to Discord because it would more likely be in regular use for our audience, lots of whom are gamers.
Set goals
Before you build your community, give it goals that will guide your community design and moderation. Some popular goals for brand community Discords include:

Connecting your customers
Sharing brand updates
Humanizing your business through a community
Building customer loyalty
Sharing tutorials and offering support for your product
Creating an exclusive community for customers or supporters

Unwinnable uses Discord for the last goal: offering a community as a perk for people who subscribe to the magazine. It doubles as a selling point for potential subscribers and a reason for current subscribers to stick around.
You’ll notice that most of the reasons I listed here aren’t related to direct selling—they’re about building trust with customers.
Create your server and channels
With your goals in mind, you can now create your server and its channels.
To start a new Discord server, click the plus sign beneath your server icons on the left side of your screen.

From there, you can create a server from scratch or choose a template. The templates give you a list of channels to start with that you can edit however you like.

After you choose a template, Discord will ask if your server will be for a club or community or a private group. Discord isn’t very clear about how this question affects your server, so choose the community option or skip it.

Now, for the most important part: your server name and icon. Choose a name that includes your business name and an icon that matches your other brand assets, such as a logo.

Congrats! You have a Discord server. Time to add channels.
Think of your Discord server’s channels as different places to talk about specific topics. You’ll see them to the left of your server’s messages.

Text channels let you communicate with text and photos like other messaging apps. Voice channels allow the people who enter it to talk over voice and video.
Make sure your channels tie back to the goals you set for your community. For example, if you want to build a community for your customers, you could make channels based on everyday discussion topics like pets or TV. Or maybe you want to share brand updates—make sure to give them a dedicated channel.
Since Unwinnable is a pop culture criticism site, most of our Discord discussions happen in channels dedicated to mediums like TV and games. Think about the topics you want your community members to talk about, and make channels that match.
Depending on your objectives, you can make your server a Community server with added promotion features and analytics. If you want to keep your server small and exclusive like Unwinnable, though, you might be better off with a normal server. And you can always start as a normal server and switch to community features once you get the hang of Discord.
Set rules and roles
Community servers have built-in rules pages that members have to read and approve before posting. Your server’s rules should help you facilitate healthy discussions and create a safe space.
Here’s what the Unwinnable Discord community’s rules look like:
Credit: Melissa King / ZapierUnwinnable’s community rules (click for full-size image)
As you can see, they don’t have to be super long to do the job. Find more rule inspiration in Discord’s moderation guide and this quick guide on GitHub (shout out to Unwinnable’s editor-in-chief, David Shimomura, for writing these rules for me to post).
Once you’ve taken care of the rules, it’s time to create Discord roles for your community members. Roles determine a member’s admin permissions, accessible channels, name color, and appearance on your server’s Online list. This Discord support article explains how role hierarchies and permissions work in detail, and it’s worth checking out as you’re getting started.
If you have a normal Discord server, you can use an automation tool like Zapier to automatically assign a role that grants access to your channels after someone reacts to your rules. Zapier can also help you set roles based on members’ interactions with other platforms to give them access to channels relevant to their interests.
Promote your server
Now that your server is ready to go, it’s time to promote it in places where potential community members will see it. If you keep your community open to the public, use your invite link to its fullest potential. To find your Discord invite link, click the arrow next to your server name in the upper-right corner, and select Invite People.

From there, you can share it anywhere potential members will see, including social media, email newsletters, and your website. Anyone who clicks on your link will be prompted to join your Discord community.
Since the Unwinnable server is aimed at subscribers, we share a link to it in every issue release email and advertise it as a perk for subscribers on the site’s subscription page.

Don’t underestimate the power of consistent reminders. Recently, a newer member of the Unwinnable Discord community said they just remembered we had a server. I asked them what reminded them, and they told me the big red “Join us on Discord!” button in their issue release email did the trick.
Nurture your community
A Discord server is an ongoing investment. You’ll need to stay involved in your community to keep it growing.
Assign moderators or administrators to handle any issues in your community or help members with Discord features. When your community is small, you don’t have to hire a dedicated community manager, but as it grows, you might consider moderators.
And just like in real life, you can’t expect a conversation in Discord without contributing to it. Ask your team members to take part in community discussions. You don’t always have to have profound things to say. Just have fun, like I did sharing this tweet of the Boss Baby at the Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade:

Once you get a good base of people talking in your Discord community, try running events like giveaways, polls, or get-togethers. You can schedule an event in one of your text or voice channels by clicking the arrow next to your server name and choosing Create Event.
Zapier can also take some of the load off when you’re growing a Discord community. Try connecting it to your blog or shop to send a message automatically when you have a new blog post or product. You can also have Zapier automatically greet new community members when they join.
Revise as needed
After you set up your Discord community, don’t be afraid to make changes based on member activity and server analytics. If a channel isn’t getting much activity, consider deleting or changing it. Add or modify your server rules as needed to keep your community members happy and safe.
Just make sure to update everyone whenever you adjust something. Make an announcements channel at the top of your channel list, and tag everyone when you announce a change.

"In business and in life, experience isn’t everything",Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten,2022/01/6,"
Boris is the wise ol’ founder of TNW who writes a weekly column on everything about being an entrepreneur in tech — from managing stress to embracing awkwardness. You can get his musings straight to your inbox by signing up for his newsletter!
When I build a chair, I almost always make the same mistake. While I’m working on it, I tell myself: “This is just a trial run, and once I really understand the process, I’ll make another one, and it will be perfect.” But then I never build another one, and I’m stuck with the first version of my chair.
The first time you assemble an Ikea closet, it all fits snugly. But if a few years later, you need to disassemble and then re-assemble the closet, you’ll never get it back together as solidly as the first time.
Now imagine needing an operation, and the hospital gives you a choice between two surgeons. One is young, and the older is old. Which one do you pick? The older one might have more experience, but she also might be tired of her job and behind on newer techniques. On the other hand, the younger one might miss experience but looks at things with a fresh perspective and is still eager to learn and do a great job.
I can’t seem to figure this out. I like working with people with experience, but there’s a lot to be said for youthful exuberance. Some things get better when you do them a lot. And with other projects, you better give it your all the first time because there’s unlikely to be another.
So ideally, you find a surgeon who has the experience but still exhibits the excitement and energy of a young surgeon. And you never take apart that Ikea closet. And every time I’m building a chair, I should treat it as a one-off project from the start. 
But the cold, harsh reality is that you rarely get to pick your surgeon. And when you move to your new apartment, you probably just buy a whole new IKEA closet to save yourself the hassle.
When working with teams in companies, this is yet another argument for diversity. Find people from different backgrounds and skillsets so one person’s experience can be combined with another person’s exuberance.

Instagram carousels should be the center of your 2022 social media strategy,Elena Cucu,2022/01/5,"
Brands are investing a lot of time and money in promoting themselves online, and with this many resources put into it, you gotta make sure the results are paying off.
Now, among all the social platforms out there, there’s one that rules them all when it comes to engagement, and that’s the almighty Instagram.
And because of such a huge interest, the team from Socialinsider, together with Sked Social, conducted an Instagram engagement study, by analyzing 102 million posts, where they compared Instagram’s engagement in 2021 and its values in 2022.
By examining 2021’s trends for Instagram marketing, social media managers can predict what type of content will perform best in 2022 and adapt their strategies accordingly. We have to remember data never lies and it’s any digital marketer’s most important ally.
Apparently, these days Instagram’s engagement tendency is to decrease, for now having an average of 2.02%, going back to its values from 2019.
There were plenty of changes along the way, but with all these ups and downs, you gotta make sure your social media strategy is aligned with the trends to generate the effects you want.
So, here are five reasons to use carousels (and how) to maximize your social media efforts on Instagram, according to the study’s findings.
1. Carousels lead to a higher average engagement rate
When it comes to top-performing posts on Instagram, things aren’t as easy as they may seem, because actually, best practices will be considered depending on the account’s size.
To all Instagram marketers, this is something you should know:

Profiles under 5K have the potential of reaching an average engagement rate of 4.90% when choosing to post more carousels
In the case of medium-sized accounts (between 10K-100K followers) the best option for higher engagement rates is video, with values up to 2.90%
Large accounts (with more than 100K followers) will benefit more from using carousels


2. Using more carousels can help you increase your engagement per impression rate and make you gain more likes
The carousel post wins when it comes to engagement per impression across all profile sizes. This can actually reveal one of Instagram’s strategies, of pushing this type of content into the user’s feeds more.
With this in mind, think about prioritizing this type of content when choosing what to boost on Instagram.

Among the many benefits of choosing to place your bet on carousels is that this kind of post is the one that increases the median number of likes on Instagram.

3. Carousels lead to more comments on Instagram
Having an audience that presents interest in your topics, that’s open to communication and shows involvement is every brand’s dream and every social media manager’s objective.
But this ain’t an easy job, so, just in case you need a bit of help, check out these insights meant to give you a hand to improve your strategy:

For an account under 10K followers choose to post a carousel
In the case of medium-sized accounts (10K-50K), a mix between carousels and videos is the magic combo
When it comes to accounts between 50K-100K, it would be preferable to start pushing videos more
For large accounts (up to 50K followers), an approach of relying more on videos is what you should take into consideration


4. Carousels are more likely to be saved by Instagram users
Depending on your business objectives, there may be better to choose one type of post format to make your followers do what you want.
Let’s talk about generating more saves, for example. In order for you to get as close as possible to this objective, when creating your social media strategy you should consider using more carousels because this is what triggers people to press that save button most of the time.
But of course, there are some exceptions, large profiles (those with more than 100K followers) being the ones here. In this case, relying more on images would be a wiser choice.

5. Carousels increase the chances of a higher reach rate
Each type of post has its advantages and possible gains for your business, so what’s left to be done is to establish your goals and start working towards them, with the right tactics and actions.
Among the multiple benefits of integrating carousels more into your content calendar is that they also generate twice higher reach rates than videos, at least in the case of small profiles (under 5K).
The highest reach rates for carousels are 1.27% for small accounts, but also for middle-sized accounts (1.20%), those between 50K-100K followers.

TIP: Embrace captions with a maximum length of ten words for amplified results
When it comes to the optimal caption length of a post, there are a lot of good debates. But let’s not forget there’s strength in numbers, so data is the most trustworthy source.
What the analysis of 102 million posts showed is that captions of up to 10 words, combined with carousels are users’ favorite type of content to interact with. And that driving away from this formula proved to cause a decrease in engagement with about 0.70%.
Still, for those cases in which you consider a longer copy is needed, to properly deliver your message to your audience, you should take into consideration this formula: pair captions longer than 30 words with videos.

Conclusion
Now, with Instagram being the platform that has won people’s hearts, a closer analysis of what works and what it doesn’t is a gold mine.
Instagram’s engagement can go on mysterious roads, but the good thing is that data helps you be prepared and adapt to whatever may come.
Seeing how Instagram carousels become more and more important in Instagram marketing, and the many benefits they can bring to a brand’s social media presence, it becomes undeniably that in 2022, every business that hopes to be successful on Instagram should for sure become a heavy user of Instagram carousels.

Why banks’ digital transformation strategies fail — and what to do about it,Jamie Tolentino,2022/01/4,"
While digital transformation has been on the agenda for legacy institutions for over a decade, tech adoption has now become a do or die situation for traditional banks. The fintech revolution has brought about worthy adversaries in the form of neobanks and fintech apps that address the needs of a younger, digitally savvy generation. This coupled with the pandemic, which put the transition to digital banking services into warp-speed, has meant banks need to offer something new today or risk losing customers.
And it’s not for lack of trying. In 2018, banks globally invested $9.7 billion in digital transformation initiatives. Yet, today only 36% believe they’re at least halfway there. This isn’t entirely surprising as a whopping 78% of enterprises fail on their digital transformation initiatives.
So just what is still holding banks back?
We spoke with the team from Rangle.io, a tech company that helps banks up their game with mobile and web solutions, to find out what barriers banks are facing and how they can be overcome.
Legacy issues
Banks were late to the digital transformation party because most were concerned about the security issues that came with digitalization. This risk-averse attitude which earned banks a loyal consumer base 20-30 years ago, has carried on into the inherent culture of many banks today.
While the security risks that come with digitalization are real, the customer perspective has shifted since the pandemic. Before the pandemic, banking customers were more tolerant about banks being slow to adopt digital because they understood that the banks were not willing to compromise on security. However, with the pandemic bringing all services online, customers now expect a frictionless experience no matter where they are on the internet.
Suddenly, the challenges executives faced in the past are dramatically different to today’s landscape. However, current executives were still raised in that previous environment, where more conservative bets and a risk-averse approach were rewarded. At a strategic level, while it might seem prudent to steer a course towards that tried-and-true path, this bias in thinking can lead to stagnation in the bank’s value creation.
Nick Van Weerdenburg, CEO of Rangle.io, illustrates this with an analogy of cucumbers (agile leaders) getting pickled in brine (company culture). He says,
You can be the best lean or agile leader in the world, but if you join the most backward traditional hierarchical company, your intuition will slowly change as you pick up the culture. Eventually, the cucumber gets more pickled than the brine gets cucumbered.
Tightly coupled technical systems
Banks still run on antiquated technical backend systems which makes any technological innovation a challenge. Since these legacy systems are not designed for constant change, every change is complicated, has the potential to break other parts of the system and needs developer support to implement. In practice, this means that any change to a bank’s frontend experience takes a lot of time, people and effort, when it should really be as simple as updating your social media profile.
In a system where the frontend and backend systems are tightly coupled, the developers are in charge and create a bottleneck when multiple frontend systems need updating. One of the main reasons a bank can’t provide a frictionless experience for the customer is because the data clients need are housed in legacy platforms that are not designed to communicate with the new frontend systems. Any change to the website will also have to wait until the developers are free to implement the change.
To solve these issues, Rangle.io suggests decoupling the ability to change the frontend, e.g. website or app, from the antiquated backend system. This involves implementing a modern intermediary technical layer which houses data that can talk to both the front and backend system, speeding up data transmission between the two. The result is that simple changes to the frontend would not be subjected to limitations imposed by an antiquated backend system.
With a decoupled system, the bank’s marketing department can create pages on their website in a self-serve manner via a no-code or low code frontend system. Most of the time, the bank’s technological systems are not as optimized as the staff perceives them to be, so there will likely be room for improvement. Accenture claims that 87% of banking executives believe their bank must train their people to think like technologists, using and customizing technology solutions at the individual level, but without highly technical skills.
Failure of innovation labs
Innovation mandates within banks and other large financial institutions are usually siloed into one arm of the organization rather than being made a priority for the whole business to tackle. A lot of banks have started a ‘digital factory’ or ‘innovation lab’ or something similar five years ago, but the reality is that these expensive investments haven’t yielded results. According to a study by Capgemini, innovation labs have not increased revenue or improved the customer experience, resulting in an 80-90% failure rate.
This is because innovation units are usually treated as a separate entity with goals and objectives that don’t connect to the rest of the company. Furthermore, ideas generated from these units did not fundamentally change how the bank was delivering their services.
Rangle.io’s team believes that if you want to do digital transformation the right way, you need to make sure it’s a priority for the whole organization, and that the innovation lab has some connection to other aspects of the company, rather than being treated as a completely separate unit.
Lack of proper incentives for being risk-savvy
If employees in the bank are not incentivized by the leadership team, then nothing changes. Without the right environment where taking risks is rewarded, digital transformation is not going to happen. Therefore, companies must establish the proper means of measuring success in order to ensure their digital transformation is prioritized appropriately.
PWC found that more than four in five (83%) of risk-savvy executives report they are, “ahead or on track with their digital roadmaps,” versus 57% of their more nervous counterparts. In addition, 72% of the risk-savvy enterprises are also, “meeting or exceeding their expectations of improved customer experience,” versus only 45% of those less able to handle risks.
Bertrand Karerangabo, Chief Strategy Officer at Rangle.io claims that:
When enterprise objectives can be accomplished in the absence of a digital transformation, executives will be incentivized to carry on with business as usual. Therefore, measurable outcomes outside of profit are needed to ensure that digital transformation is a priority.
For example, when Nordstrom’s was stuck in their digital transformation journey, the executive team decided to integrate digital transformation goals into their bonus structures in 2016. To receive bonuses for that year, the IT and business leaders were tasked with creating a customer-facing improvement, and demonstrating potential for reducing lead time by 20%. This concrete, measurable goal is a digital transformation-centered goal which functions as an executive level incentive for taking risks.
Underestimating the scope of change needed
A lot of banks have invested in digital transformation initiatives while massively underestimating the scope. Usually, the investments are made in the silo of a department, innovation lab, digital factory, personnel hire, etc. A popular approach is hiring expensive superstar developers who then subsequently leave because of the reluctance to change bad processes and the underinvestment in technology.
This is reflective of banks implementing incremental change tactics when they need a disruptive change strategy. Apple started out as a disruptor when they first came out with the iPhone and the iPad. However, for the last decade they have only been making incremental changes, while other industry incumbents chip away at their market share
On the other hand, Nike heavily invested in digital transformation in 2017 which allowed the brand to overhaul their distribution strategy, resulting in a 33% lift in direct-to-consumer sales in two years. When the pandemic hit in 2020, their direct-to-consumer sales helped them thrive as a brand even when high street retail distribution channels were closed due to lockdown.
Banks need to understand what makes their brand salient with their audience and realize that digital transformation has become a must-have rather than a nice-to-have.
What can banks do to succeed in their digital transformation?
Since the market is too far ahead to put digital transformation off, or to put innovation in a silo like one of those innovation lab projects. It’s important for banks to take small but effective steps in starting their transformation now.
Usually, the scale and complexity often leads to far more questions like Where do we start? How much planning is appropriate? How will we allocate funds and resources? What are the key measures of success? While these are reasonable questions to ask, they are the wrong questions to begin with.
Instead, it’s better to first decide on the destination by defining a future state that is radically different from today. Rangle’s free ebook on transformation principles can be a good place to start.

5 designer’s shortcuts to help your new startup prioritize brand work,Jesse Pyy,2022/01/4,"
Early-stage founders often struggle with prioritizing and structuring their brand work – and admittedly, the feat can seem pretty overwhelming if you’re building your entire visual identity from scratch.
Color choices, fonts, and imagery can seem like petty details when you’re simultaneously building your product, fundraising, and headhunting for key roles, but overlooking your brand can be an expensive mistake for a startup with only one shot to woo a potential investor or customer.
At the same time, no matter what your investor, board member, or brand agency tells you, early-stage startups don’t need to have their ducks in a well-branded row as neatly as Coke or Apple.
Having worked with over 100 organizations on their brand, design, and visual identity, I’ve seen the sweat break on far too many founders’ foreheads as they try to prioritize their limited resources in a world of business cards, merchandise, and fancy brand videos they don’t yet need.
Here are five things every early-stage startup should do to make the most of their visual identity with limited resources:
1. Text logos are underrated (and all logos are overrated), so stop obsessing over them
Early-stage startups often give way too much weight to their logo and its inherent symbolism.
So, I’ll be frank: spending time perfecting your logo is a huge waste of time, creativity, and cash.
The world is so saturated with logos that it’s near impossible to create one that’s completely unique and identifies your startup from the moment it’s created. Much more important than trying to recreate the iconic McDonald’s or Nike symbols for your B2B startup is getting people to remember your name – and for that, simple text logos can bring some much-needed repetition.
If you don’t believe me when I say simple is beautiful, just look at companies like Burger King, Toyota, and Warner Bros who are jumping on the debranding bandwagon and simplifying their logos to their bare bones.
2. Don’t pay for staged photos that look like they’re stock
Meme accounts making fun of stock photos have made us all weary of image banks, but commissioning your own custom photo shoot isn’t always the best option.
Even real photos taken at your office using your own employees often end up looking fake – because let’s be real, no one sits five inches from their closest colleague pointing intently at the same screen.
Instead of paying for a custom photo shoot, there are great free image banks like Unsplash where you can get started, and cropping photos differently or adding colored layers can help customize them for your brand.
But a word of warning: don’t just go through the first five pages ranked by popularity, unless you’re going for the same look as your five closest competitors.
3. Only customize where it matters most
With limited resources for branding, you should focus your efforts on where your visuals can make the biggest impact.
For a SaaS company with a technical product, it’s imperative you have a high-quality image, animation, or video explanation of the real solution and how it works – not an oversimplified cartoon or artsy brand image – whereas a D2C brand will probably want to invest in packaging for the perfect unboxing experience.
And no matter what your brand agency tells you, unless you’re Coinbase or Spotify, you don’t need to pay thousands for a customizable icon bank or fonts (check out existing templates from Google, Streamline, or Fontawesome instead).
4. Buy templates instead of material production
Using an external partner to sharpen your visuals for key materials like pitch decks, your website or product packaging is often a good idea – because even if someone in your founding team speaks fluent Adobe, their limited time is likely better spent on other things.
However, when it comes to repetitive content like visuals for a social media post, paid campaign materials, or one-pagers, you can save a lot of resources and brief time by commissioning templates that someone on your team can reuse and freely modify.
Rule of thumb: if you need more than one version of something, a template is a must. If you need 20 versions of the same design, the first one might take you an hour to get right. The rest should be over in a couple of minutes, and if not, you’re doing it wrong.
5. Accept that your identity will expire in the first 2-3 years
Finally, companies are taught to fear brand renewals (“you shouldn’t change your colors now that customers are finally beginning to recognize you!”) but for startups, changing your visual identity in the first two to three years of your lifecycle often makes good business sense.
Startups tend to have limited resources to start building their brand, so it’s likely that you’ll want to amp up your brand once you have more learnings about your market-fit to do so.
More importantly, startups’ growth cycles are short, so it’s unlikely that the same visual identity will serve its purpose for over three years. As you enter new markets, broaden your focus from early adopters, or introduce new products or verticals, your brand will require a different approach.
Just think about Oura, whose entire vibe recently changed from performance-heavy biohacking to a more wholesome lifestyle approach, or Dropbox, who metamorphosed from a somewhat generic blue SaaS brand to a more consumer-centric and colorful brand.

Don’t let ‘shrinkflation’ affect your software development,Ross A. McIntyre,2022/01/3,"
You might not have noticed, but the products you’re buying at the grocery store are getting smaller. That’s right: They’re shrinking. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which sent raw materials prices soaring, many companies are trying to find ways to cut costs.
So if that box of Cookie Crisp (part of a balanced breakfast, they say) feels a little light, you’re not imagining things; General Mills has decreased its family size boxes from 19.3 ounces to 18.1 ounces.
Economist Pippa Malmgren coined the term “shrinkflation” to describe instances where companies reduce the size of products while retaining prices. However, prices aren’t staying the same. In May 2021, global food prices were the highest they’ve been since 2011.
While the Federal Reserve insists the current period of high inflation is temporary, the ripples are being felt throughout every sector of the economy, including software development.
If you think “shrinking” the amount of effort you put into projects is the best way to keep prices low, you’ll end up harming your company’s integrity and failing to meet client expectations. That’s not the right way to deal with inflation in the software development industry.
The state of professional services
For some C-suite decision-makers, there are few options but to increase the charge for professional services. Firms are grappling with pressure to decrease professional services costs, increased competition and commoditization, and the rising cost of talent. Some of these pressures have been mounting for years, while others directly result from the recent economic downturn.
Thankfully for those of us in the software development space, there were fewer obstacles during the pandemic due to the demand for digital innovation. The surge in remote work made software vital to businesses’ survival.
According to an IBM survey, the pandemic accelerated digital transformation at 59% of organizations. Additionally, the Worldwide Developer Population and Demographic Report indicates that the number of developers increased by 2.5% in 2020 (albeit slightly less than the projected growth of 4%).
The amount of money being poured into digital transformation could balloon to more than $2 trillion by 2022. According to Twilio, 79% of companies claim that COVID-19 increased their budget for the effort. Maybe this will make some of the laggards get off the proverbial pot.
Sidebar: The ridiculous thing about digital transformation hasn’t changed. It’s not a process with a defined end. Business owners will never wake up and discover that — poof! — their companies are transformed. It makes a lot more sense to view it as an ongoing process. (I’ll step down from my soapbox now.)
Organizations still have plenty of work to do, which bodes well for your business despite software industry competition. Your best-in-class digital services are the key to meeting executives’ digital innovation goals.
Cost, which has historically been the main factor impacting business decisions regarding technology investments, should theoretically become a smaller barrier.
However, something about this shift feels different. I’ve been in software development for 15 years. My advice? Make sure you can compete in the modern market.
How to best compete in this market
Researcher Aaron O’Neill estimates 2021’s global inflation rate to be 3.5%, which is significantly higher than 2016’s 2.7%. In the US, professional services experienced an average annual inflation rate of 4.86% between 1961 and 2021.
Considering other professional services are experiencing increased demand — CNBC reports that home renovations will cost more and take longer — it’s safe to assume the inflation rate will rise in the software development space as more businesses invest in digital innovation.
While shrinkflation might work in business-to-consumer industries like food and beverage, it’s not a tactic you should use to combat inflation.
Clients need software products that thoroughly address their pain points and improve existing workflows. If you’re producing something that’s ineffective, you’ll see fewer repeat customers and likely experience a decrease in revenue. No one wants that.
Assuming this pricing spike is inevitable, how should you decrease how much you charge for professional services moving forward? Here are my three tips:
1. Embrace new tech that will attract top talent
Top talent can be 400% more productive, according to a study in Personnel Psychology. And if your workers are more productive, you’ll see increased profits, according to Gallup.
But how do you attract high performers? By focusing on emerging technologies. These technologies can make existing processes more efficient, but they can also act as a draw for talent.
Software developers are looking for companies that are the “next big thing.” Artificial intelligence, blockchain, and more will inevitably shape the world in countless ways. Top talent wants to drive that change.
Increasing investment in and commitment to AI is now a necessity. What looks like magic to your competitors in five years is actually the result of today’s good planning. And AI is not a set of niche technologies — it is most effectively deployed horizontally across an organization.
According to Boston Consulting Group, digital laggards tend to view AI as a standalone solution, which limits its effectiveness in their organizations.
2. Invest in your current employees to keep them around
Workplace culture might be hard to define or quantify, but plenty of studies show that close-knit teams and inclusive office environments are associated with higher levels of employee engagement and productivity. And as I mentioned before, productivity improves profitability.
This isn’t to say you should underpay or overwork your employees. That mistake can result in poor performance and turnover, which is counterproductive to your goal.
Rather, you should make sure your firm values workers’ contributions, rewards them, and continually presents them with new opportunities for personal and professional growth. Nothing beats working for a company that genuinely supports its employees.
3. Put in the work upfront
According to George Cressman, president of World Class Pricing, “Delivering professional services requires great skill in diagnosing customer needs and understanding the relationship between very diverse components of a customer’s business. It requires skill in tailoring a solution to precisely meet a customer’s needs, and communicating that effectively.”
In short, your clients will be far more excited to work with you if you do as much of the discovery work for them as you can. The corresponding savings in software development costs can mitigate the impact of the current inflationary trend.
When you can hand your new partner well-defined personas, highly relevant user journeys, accurate requirements, and in-depth market research, everything moves faster. This upfront heavy lifting won’t eliminate the need to recalibrate once projects are underway, but it can reduce the number of steps from start to finish.
Even though it seems counterproductive, software development consulting rates can keep the overall cost of the project down. Moreover, with a detailed plan in hand before development begins, clients can be assured that you’re building the right thing the right way.
To be frank, software development is expensive. It was expensive two years ago, and it will be expensive two years from now.
Resisting the urge to raise your prices will help you stand out among your competitors. If your work is clever, comprehensive, and cost-effective, your business will reap the benefits of what could be a prohibitive trend for potential clients.

Founder to founder: A guide to scaling a startup,Christopher May,2021/12/13,"
When Henrik Gebbing and I founded Finoa in our shared apartment in Madrid back in 2018, little did we realize that within just three years we’d have team members across the globe with plans for exponential growth in the works.
Obviously, the way we ran things when it was just a handful of us would never suffice now. Scaling our business has meant overcoming some tough challenges in order to build a sustainable organization.
The biggest question I’ve heard from other founders is, “How do I know when my startup is ready to scale?” From my point of view, the answer is, “When you have found a winning business model.” This is a vital point here. You have to have a business model that works.
There’s no point in scaling if your minimum viable product is dysfunctional and you don’t have proof that you can monetize your product in one way or another. In other words, don’t scale if you don’t have customers who are willing to pay for your product.
Once you have a working business model in place and a group of paying customers, then you can think about broadening that client base. There are two ways that you can accomplish this.
One is by expanding into new countries or regions, the other is by expanding into new products. Each of these options will have some specific challenges, but here are my tips for how to prepare your company before scaling, so these challenges don’t derail your growth.
Expansions can fail without processes in place
Scaling a startup adds a lot of complexity — from straddling time zones to adding lots of new lines and boxes on an organizational chart. What happens to your operational processes as you add people in different regions, or at different management levels?
If you’re adding a new product, this adds levels of complexity to your supply chain situation, your billing department, and your development teams, just to name a few affected areas.
For example, if you try to scale a business with faulty project management and sales processes in place, you could end up with sales teams promising delivery of product updates that have not yet been finished and tested.
Management will end up spending too much time extinguishing organizational fires and not enough time making sure the core business itself is functioning properly — or on attracting new investors. This is an area where expansions can fail.
Where is your single source of truth?
The main challenge that scaling presents to internal communications is with the flow of information. When you have a team of five, it’s fairly easy to keep everyone informed about every little (and not so little) thing that’s going on.
With more people on board, it’s tough to ensure that relevant information is flowing to those who need it. Here, you may have to institute internal measures, including all-hands meetings, management meetings, communications tools like Slack, and even emails to everyone in the company when needed.
Remember, too, that internal communications need to be a two-way street: not just top-down, but also bottom-up. Having clear reporting processes in place will also help when you’re scaling into new countries or regions. Efforts in one location might be duplicated in another location, but may proceed in a very different direction.
As an example, if you have regional teams independently building product rollout roadmaps, you could end up with vastly different timelines that are in conflict with the launch plans underway by the marketing manager.
It’s vitally important to have a single source of truth in place, a central medium where all relevant and important info is gathered and shared, so that folks at each location know what the others are doing and who’s in charge.
Since many people are working from home and locations can be vague for some companies, this centralized structure should be set up by the headquarters and leadership so that there is a transparent flow of information within the company.
You can’t approach new markets with the same old messages
When you start to scale your company, you realize that it’s difficult to duplicate your image and brand onto a new product or to directly translate it into a new country. You see that a lot with car companies. They have different names for their vehicles, different ad campaigns.
The more your business grows internationally, the more important it is to align your branding and marketing to the target market, to accommodate for the preferences that customers in these countries might have.
If you’re headquartered in Germany, you would likely know what shows people tend to watch and when. But if you were to then expand into Spain, where you don’t know the market as well, you’d need to invest in support from local PR or marketing agencies who could help you localize your messages to be effective there.
The same applies to startups that scale by adding a new product. You might be selling comfort and usability for your first product, but perhaps the second product requires a completely different customer approach.
Scaling experience matters when it comes to hiring new managers
When you scale, you need to practically double or triple the team size, which will present problems to maintaining the company culture and DNA, especially if you are integrating diverse people across different time zones.
To minimize problems, you need to be sure to get people in management who have experience scaling. If you’re adding products, you need product managers who have experience working with that type of scale-up. They’ll best be able to handle any complications that arise as the new product is integrated into the company’s offerings.
If you’re opening an office in a new country, you need to hire a manager who knows the country, the market, and the local talent. Successful companies hire about 30% of their people from who they know and based on referrals. Therefore, it’s best to first look for a manager already working in your headquarters, who fits the company culture, and who has experience in or is from that country and knows the market.
Once you have a local manager in place, that person will be able to hire the right talent for that market. You can also work with international recruiting agencies that have supported scale-ups. They will have connections to talent and people in their markets.
For new teams in a different country or region than the headquarters, it will be important for leadership to spend some time with them on the ground in the beginning.
You have to really show your face so they know they are considered to be part of the whole company and not just external to it. There needs to be a strong connection here, and I highly recommend inviting these teams to the headquarters often and having in-person company-wide retreats where everybody can be together.
Get comfortable with ambiguity
As Finoa has grown, Henrik and I learned early on how quickly it can become too much for two founders to be responsible for everything. As a founder, you need to give away responsibility and become comfortable with ambiguity.
You are not going to know exactly what everyone is doing every minute of every day. It’s important to remember that you are still in charge of guiding the overall strategy and looking after the big picture, so you should not get bogged down in the nitty-gritty.
To do this, you need to increase the size of your management team and off-load operational responsibilities onto people you trust. Processes come into play here, too, since having these in place will enable you to collaborate with those people and maintain a surface-level knowledge of what is happening.
As I mentioned earlier, expansions can fail if the founders lose focus because they are drowning in work trying to do all the day-to-day stuff as the company grows.
You can’t prepare and scale at the same time
You want to make sure you are instituting systems and processes early on, as your company is starting to grow. Don’t wait until you have your minimum viable product and a customer base to start preparing to scale.
The longer you wait to get these processes in place, the harder it is to institute them with a larger team. By that point, everyone has already developed their own hodge-podge of ways to do things and it’s difficult to get them to completely switch to a new system.
Whether you are expanding into new regions or new product lines, having the above measures in place will help you successfully scale the operations of your startup, while maintaining your company DNA and keeping the big picture directly in your sights.

"Oi, marketers! Stay away from these 5 types of stock photos",Alina Valyaeva,2021/12/10,"
Stock photos don’t a great reputation. They’re cheesy and are easily recognizable, so a lot of marketers avoid using them. But I’d like to argue that stock photos aren’t the issue, it’s how you choose them.
Genuine top-quality stock photos expand your marketing opportunities. So let’s go through some common stock photo concepts that make your content look poor and then some good alternatives to consider.

1. Exaggerated facial expressions
Human emotions are an essential element of photos, which impacts the perception of the whole message you strive to deliver. Having a limited budget on hiring a professional model or finding persons to cover a topic related to them, photographers have flooded stock websites with images of people expressing fake joy or anger.

When picking a photo for your projects, keep track of people’s emotions and facial expressions. Make sure they appear natural, just like the photographer captured them in a real-life scene all of a sudden. This will make the content feel more genuine rather than cheap and staged.

2. Doppelgänger models
There are tons of stock photos out there of people wearing all-too-similar outfits, looking like weird doppelgängers.

Nowadays, more and more photographers aim for photo styling, color schemes, model authenticity, and diversity. When you look at their works, you can imagine what the characters are in front of you, what they like, and what they don’t. They have different stories and backgrounds, which make each photo real and vivid.
But if they’re all wearing the same-ish outfit, those stories will fall flat — so make sure to go for more interesting ones.

3. Ridiculous metaphors and allegories
Although stock photography intends to illustrate concepts and deliver a clear message covering various situations, some photographers generalize the topic and create plain visuals to express an idea.
Using all their imagination and photo editing skills, they tend to produce tons of content that, unfortunately, lacks originality.
Credit: Pixabay
Don’t get me wrong, I’m not suggesting leaving metaphors and conceptual photography exclusively to professional artists. Many stock photographers are good enough at illustrating creative concepts, but it’s on you to choose the right ones.

4. Over-editing
During the golden age of fashion magazines with flawless imagery, stock photography looked perfectly polished too. Today, things have changed, and photos that look natural have become the new black — which is why you should avoid over-edited gloss pics like the one below.
Credit: Pixabay, Pexels
By choosing real-looking photos with blemishes and imperfections, you have far better chances that your content will resonate with your target audience.

5. Cheesy clipart
You can’t have an article on stock photos without mentioning clipart.
Clipart portrays abstract concepts like ‘leadership’, ‘motivation’, ‘teamwork’ etc. As many stock websites are available for authors of any skill level, who are eager to sell their content, the number of cheesy clipart that portrays a concept in the most obvious way has grown exponentially.
They fail to grab attention and are hardly able to drive action.
Credit: Pixabay
Are there any alternatives? Sure.
Consider choosing more appealing and fresh imagery. For example, take 3D illustrations, which are still not outdated (the keyword is still!), or make a collage with several relevant photos.
But, please stay away from any images demonstrating abstract concepts literally!
Credit: Freepik
So the next time you’re choosing a stock photo for a project, keep these five examples in mind.
But also remember that the golden rule of stock photos is to always think of your target audience and don’t forget about the context. The image you’re going to choose should be a perfect match between your product and clients.
Remember that the right message delivered to the right audience at the right time is a key to a successful marketing campaign.

Building an iOS app? Avoid these critical App Store roadblocks,Chris Cardinal,2021/12/9,"
Apple’s App Store is a holy grail for businesses, offering access to an audience of about half a billion people per week, according to the technology giant. But that doesn’t mean landing an app in the digital marketplace is easy.
Apple has said it rejected almost 1 million new apps vying for inclusion in the App Store in 2020, along with nearly a million updates to existing apps. Building an app takes a big investment of time and money, so before you get the wheels turning for your big app idea, it’s worth remembering that Apple alone controls who gets to play in its sandbox.
Ambitious founders and entrepreneurs often hate being told no, but the simple truth is that Apple rules the App Store with an iron fist. Billion-dollar companies like Epic Games and Valve Software might view it as an unjust dictatorship and remove their popular products in protest, but the truth remains that you must play by the rules if you ever hope to get an app in front of Apple’s massive audience.
Unfortunately, even playing by the rules doesn’t always get you in. Indeed, most apps do get through, but there’s simply no way to guarantee acceptance. While Apple does publish a thorough set of guidelines, there are still internal rules they keep under wraps. If having to submit to an unpublished set of rules sounds infuriating, I can assure you it is.
Up against the App Store
My app software development company, Synapse Studios, recently worked with a large publicly traded company to create a fitness app as a benefit for members of certain insurance plans.
Part of the content was for plan members, and the rest was available publicly. Apple, however, insisted that we offer in-app purchases so the public could unlock the “exclusive content.” But that content was an insurance benefit, and our client never charges end users.
What’s more, Apple’s own App Store guidelines don’t even allow for insurance payments through in-app purchases.
We couldn’t win, and after the client spent hundreds of thousands developing the app and content, Apple simply said the business model was “incompatible with the Apple App Store.”
How to better your chances
No one wants to go through this kind of nightmare, and though you never know whether your app will be accepted, it pays big time to do your homework beforehand.
Learn as much as possible about the App Store’s published guidelines, and follow these three steps to give your app the best possible chance of making it to the virtual App Store shelves.
1. Quality assurance is key
Test, test, test. Bugs are one of the top reasons apps get rejected by Apple. App reviewers test your code to make sure the app is usable and secure from start to finish, checking to make sure it doesn’t crash, it’s not nefarious, it doesn’t have some kind of malware, and more.
It’s honestly a good thing that Apple rejects buggy products. What good is the App Store, anyway, if the apps available on it have serious security flaws, scam their users, or don’t function properly?
Still, ambitious leaders often operate under the “move fast and break things” mindset, aiming to get products out quickly and fix them later. But Apple doesn’t want broken things in the App Store.
Implement a thorough app QA testing strategy that includes a checklist of mission-critical items to test before and after deployment.
Many founders assume that developerswill do double-duty as testers, but a dedicated app QA testing team is a worthy investment to maximize the chance of your app getting accepted on the first try.
2. Build your business plan with Apple’s take in mind
The infamous “Apple tax” charges developers a certain percentage of the money that they collect from every transaction for a digital service in the App Store, such as in-app purchases.
It’s one of the reasons Epic Games brought Apple to trial in federal court. While a huge company like Epic might have the means to push back, however, smaller businesses won’t likely be so lucky.
The “good” news is that small businesses now pay 15% instead of the historical 30% fee. But once a company hits its first million in revenue, the 30% fee takes effect. It’s important to factor in just how significant 30% of your revenue will be to your ongoing operations and the prices you’ll have to set.
And trying to skirt the charge is one of the quickest ways to get rejected from the App Store. For now, the only thing you can do is incorporate this number into your cost and return estimates and move on if you can’t make it work.
3. Do something interesting
Apple can still reject you based on the value proposition of your app and not its technical merits. If the app doesn’t produce novel value, or if it’s too similar to an existing offering, expect to be turned away from the App Store. Some 150,000 submissions in 2020 suffered this fate because they failed to sufficiently differentiate themselves.
Apple is the judge, jury, and executioner in this arena, but a good guideline is: if your app could be considered a clone or near-copy of an existing app, don’t expect it to be accepted into the App Store.
One of the most difficult parts of starting a company is tapping into an audience, and the Apple App Store offers incredible access to potential customers in 175 countries around the world. It’s an exciting opportunity, but not one that should not be taken for granted.
Plenty of apps get rejected every day, which is why you should put in the work upfront and maximize your chances of acceptance.

Metrics can drive your growth — as long as you’re looking at the right ones,Shams Adly,2021/12/8,"
Working in a startup, regardless of your position, requires close attention to data — there’s just no way around it. So if I could give you just one piece of advice, it would be to learn how to effectively analyze these numbers and metrics.
I’ve been working at Orcas for the past four and a half years. Orcas is an Education Technology platform that gives tutors access to lesson plans and provides students with free assessments. Tutors can offer their 1-to-1 sessions and 1-to-many courses both online or in-person and Orcas provides them with discovery, booking, scheduling, in-app communication, and video-conferencing tools.
Every year, our CEO would gather the whole team and tell us about the target for the coming period, and for us, it almost always seemed impossible to reach. One of these meetings was even called “Mission Impossible.” As the Chief Growth Officer, I felt a lot of pressure and had so many thoughts running through my mind: “How will we reach our goals? What do we need to make this happen?”
However, I quickly realized that the only way we’d get there is by looking at the numbers closely, understanding where we are and which numbers to work on.
The real trick though is not looking at any number or all the numbers, it’s looking at the right data. The metric that will make the difference.
Last year, after one of those yearly growth meetings, we needed to achieve a 4x growth year over year in new customer sales; which at the time seemed very challenging.
But by using the correct data and a properly thought-out strategy, nothing is impossible. I was able to achieve the required growth by following the steps below:

Look at my funnel and understand our current performance
Look at my resources: the team and their strength, my marketing and experimentation budget, and the general conditions of the market — the seasonality of schools and exams has a big effect on our business.
Do a sensitivity test for the funnel numbers to see which numbers, if changed, will have the biggest impact on our sales.
After choosing the metrics we will focus on and our overarching strategy, came the tactics and experiments phase. What are we going to do to make these metrics move?

In our case, we decided to focus on the number of people who search daily on our app. We know that by increasing this number, the top of our funnel will increase and generate more users who place a request on a daily basis and therefore increase our sales — which is what we’re ultimately aiming for.
There was a catch, though: we had to do that while decreasing our Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), so we couldn’t throw money at the problem and spend more on ads to reach our goal.
We had to look at all the possible ways we can acquire new customers. One thing that we were confident in, was Facebook Ads. Unfortunately, we couldn’t only rely on ads because of our budget and how it could impact our CAC, so we had to find other ways.
Here’s what we’ve done:

Optimized the acquisition of new customers through Facebook ads — we worked on our targeting and our messaging (visuals and captions).
Activated old existing users: we defined new customers as customers who are paying for the first time. Luckily for us, we have thousands of customers who signed up and never paid before so we decided to hammer on this pool through push notifications, emails, and SMS — this worked really well! 25% of all new requests were placed by customers who had previously signed up but had never used Orcas before.
Activating new sign-ups: we made sure that every person who signed up received event-triggered emails and notifications to guide them and lead them to place a request. Our customer liquidity ratio doubled from 8% to 16%.

This growth wouldn’t have been possible if we didn’t choose the right metric to monitor closely and experiment often.
I’d look at the number of searchers on an hourly basis and set a weekly growth goal. We’d try different combinations of timings, channels, and messages to see what’s working and what makes users search. We were laser-focused on increasing that number that we even doubled the efforts on slow days.
Not everything we tried worked though… especially when it came to referrals.
As part of our plan to decrease our CAC, we wanted to capitalize on our already existing customers to become our brand ambassadors and get us more customers for a significantly lower cost (especially after conducting a survey with them and discovering that 60% of our customers are using the app because someone they trust told them about it).
We thought we hit the jackpot! We decided to incentivize our customers to recommend us more aggressively to their friends. They would then give their friends a code to use while booking their sessions to get a discount. Alongside that, they’d receive a monetary reward in return for each person who uses their code.
A win-win situation that would work wonders, or so we thought.
Unfortunately, things didn’t go as planned, our satisfied users didn’t want to use their code. They didn’t want to seem like they were recommending us to benefit from their friends, after all, we are a trust business.
Our users are not buying goods or taking one short ride, they’re looking for someone who will enter their home, sit with their children and teach them. They need to trust that person and the company that’s providing them with this service.
Understanding this was key to understanding why our happy customers didn’t want to use their referral codes. They don’t want to lose their credibility, they want to give advice to their friends and relatives without it looking like there is something in it for them.
This finding didn’t demotivate us, on the contrary, it gave us a better understanding of our customer behavior. An understanding that will help us do better in the next trial.
Experimentation is an ongoing process and in my opinion the only way we’ll learn and grow. At Orcas, we celebrate failed experiments because they represent newly learned lessons — and I think you should too.
"
Does having a European HQ still matter in a ‘remote’ world? Absolutely,Brennan O'Donnell,2021/12/7,"
Nearly every company has had to adjust to a distributed working model since the pandemic hit, with workers now dispersed to a wide range of locations and time zones.
One unexpected benefit of this massive paradigm shift is that startups today are better prepared than before to adapt to the demands of becoming a global organization, including those that I invest into as a General Partner at Frontline X, a growth-stage fund for US companies expanding to Europe.
But on the journey to building a global company, there are countless decisions, and a handful has an outsized impact on your growth trajectory. Selecting your European headquarters is one of these decisions, and it’s extremely painful to unwind if you get it wrong.
As a leader on Google’s initial landing team in Europe, I saw this play out first hand at our headquarters in Dublin as we scaled from a few dozen people to over 2,000.
However, many companies are now asking themselves: in our new world of remote working and distributed teams, is choosing a headquarters in Europe still relevant?
Short answer? Yes.
Let me show you why.
The path to go global runs through Europe
At $28.7 trillion, EMEA represents roughly 30% of the world’s GDP and is the largest addressable market outside of America. Europe itself is the world’s second-largest B2B software market, and for more than two decades has been the location of choice when US companies look beyond their own borders.
With the democratization of software distribution, it’s now common for companies to discover 10-12% of their business comes from Europe organically, and by IPO these same companies average 30% of their revenue from Europe. Simply put, the path for any business to grow into a global category leader runs through Europe.
However the region is far from homogeneous, and CEOs must think of it as a collection of many fragmented markets, each with its own unique dynamics.
There is generally a power law distribution to the size of these markets, with the two largest countries, the United Kingdom and Germany, commanding 40% of the addressable European market for most SaaS companies.
The largest cities dominate the economic activity, leading to a strong concentration of customers and talent in a few of these locations.
Even if you are currently working as a distributed team and have no plans to invest in a physical office right away, you still need to think about where your customers are, where the talent you need is concentrated, and where you can best access markets and opportunities for long term growth.
Therefore, selecting the right European headquarters is just as important as ever.
It’s essential to move quickly as well. The European startup ecosystem is flourishing, with nearly $60 billion in venture capital invested into Europe in the first half of 2021, up threefold from 2020, and local competitors being created daily, particularly across B2B SaaS.
Once your company has a repeatable sales process, is seeing European customer demand, and has the right leadership team in place, it’s time to invest in expansion.
A simple framework for choosing your HQ
It’s easy to fall into one of several different traps when selecting an HQ. Companies are often overwhelmed by the decision, overanalyzing all the factors and possibilities. It’s also common to over-index on cost or corporate structure considerations.
Others rush the decision, following a customer to a particular location, making piecemeal hires in Europe, or copying what another company they know has done.
To avoid these and other pitfalls, there’s a simple framework, based on four criteria — customers, talent, cost, and business environment, that CEOs can follow to inform their decision-making process.
Asking where your current and future customers are, what market segments you are targeting, whether your GTM motion is self-serve or sales-led, and what language or regulatory requirements does your product has, should come first.
For talent, CEOs must ask themselves what industry or role-specific talent do they require, at what level of seniority, with which language skills, and how do the employment laws and norms differ?
When evaluating cost, asking yourself questions about the ideal corporate and tax structure, what FDI investment incentives are available, what future real estate costs might be, and what is your talent budget is key.
Lastly, gauging the business environment should be based on how easy it is to do business across Europe from your location, how vital is synchronous working for your team, and knowing how and if geopolitical pieces like GDPR and Brexit matter to your business.
While all of these criteria are important, every business is different and my team’s recent report shows decisions around choosing the right location for you can be nuanced, and errors can be costly.
How these factors are weighted will differ for each company but focusing on customers and employees before costs is always our recommendation to build a successful and sustainable business.
I frequently tell CEOs who are evaluating locations for their HQ that having a low tax rate on a small revenue number does you no good. Costs remain a consideration of course, however that should not be the primary driver.
Where to land when you expand?
20 years ago cost was a primary driver of the decision process for selecting a European headquarters. The tech ecosystem and venture capital markets were far less mature, and very few software companies had reached the scale to move internationally.
As a result, the relevant talent pools were much more nascent and no one location carried much of an advantage over another.
Today, while cost is still important to decision-making, proximity to customers and talent have become the most important drivers for choosing an HQ location.
Proximity to your customer base is always an advantage, but it’s particularly critical for US companies selling into European markets, especially for B2B software companies targeting the mid-market and enterprise segments. This is why most tech companies have located near their customers and talent pools, creating a cycle that reinforces these geographies.
As software companies exploded and grew internationally, clear hubs started to emerge, particularly around Dublin, London and Amsterdam. There are extremely rich tech ecosystems in these three cities, each with strengths in certain areas.
Other cities such as Berlin and Paris also have strong emerging technology and startup ecosystems, however, the reinforcing dynamics that have concentrated customers and talent around the top three cities continue to make London, Dublin, and Amsterdam your most likely shortlist.
Conclusion
Although decision-making has become increasingly decentralized, selecting the right location for a European headquarters remains a critical step on the journey to becoming a global business.
Success is always predicated on being close to your customers, finding the best talent to compete, and scaling your operations in a cost-effective way.
London, Dublin, and Amsterdam each provide a strong foundation across these dimensions — which is why the majority of US companies end up in one of these three cities.
Above all else, spend the time to make a thoughtful decision. Do your research, properly evaluate your options and get advice from experienced leaders who have gone before.

Data centers could cause serious environmental damage — if we don’t regulate them now,Andrea Hak,2021/12/6,"
With the average adult spending 4.2 hours a day on smartphone apps in 2020, our reliance on technology has evolved even more than we might have thought possible. From ordering food to connecting with loved ones or binge-watching the latest series, our data consumption is an integral part of daily life.
As a result, businesses are also consuming more data than ever before, and this trend will only grow. But our tech-loving ways could cause lasting damage to the planet.
While the transition to the cloud has promised to solve many of our data overload problems, data centers are now producing the same amount of emissions as the global airline industry.
As COP26 comes to a close, one of the biggest challenges international leaders have failed to address is setting tighter and clearer regulations for the exponentially growing cloud industry.
The truth about ‘carbon neutrality’
Many tech companies have publicly claimed to be ‘carbon neutral’, but the truth isn’t as clean cut. A lot of them just purchase Renewable Energy Certificates or RECs to offset emissions on paper and don’t provide proper transparency in their emissions calculations. And that’s a big problem.
Without clear, transparent, and universal reporting standards, we can’t know what percentage of green energy is being used to power data centers and what percentage comes from purchasing REC offsets.
RECs are fine as a band aid to emissions, but it’s by no means a long-term solution.
We can’t repair the damage of the climate crisis after the fact, so it’s important that we instead focus on building data centers that are actually better for the environment.
Lack of reporting standards doesn’t just mean we miss out on recording greenhouse gas emissions, it also leads to the glossing over of other harmful factors.
According to the Uptime Institute’s 2021 Global Data Center Survey, while many report on power consumption, the electricity and water resources needed to keep data centers cool often aren’t being tracked or accounted for. Neither is the e-waste created by the need to continuously replace servers.

For example, in the Netherlands data centers use an average of 1 million cubic meters of water per year — the equivalent of 19,230 one-person households.
Earlier this year there were reports that residents of North Holland could experience water shortages due to data centers. While this claim was later disputed by the local government, it has raised concerns over the impact that increasing water consumption by growing data centers could have in an ever warming climate. Can sustainability and technology thrive together?
Our reliance on tech to power our businesses and daily lives proves that our data processing needs will only grow.
Although data consumption and sustainability might appear to be at competing ends of the spectrum, momentum is shifting towards the idea of greener, more sustainable forms of cloud computing. More and more consumers are demanding companies take a proactive role in reducing their emissions, putting the spotlight on big tech companies and cloud providers to address the issue.
While consumer awareness and activism are important to put pressure on companies, it’s governments that will need to set stricter emission reduction targets and transparent reporting standards.
The European Union has been a leader in this area with its ambitious Green Deal, which also includes a call for data centers to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030.
With more businesses looking for ways to lower their carbon footprint, this may pave the way for EU based data service providers to take the lead.
Across Europe, countries like Finland — that are heavily invested in renewable energy — are seen as examples of green tech innovators and serve as inspiration for those seeking greener energy consumption. In France, new legislation is putting pressure on cloud providers to decrease their energy consumption.
Some cloud providers are also going further to measure their impact. Cloud provider Scaleway is developing a Real Data Centre Efficiency measure to provide customers with an objective take on their environmental impact. By doing so, the tech firm gives consumers the transparency and information they need to make the best choice for themselves.
But, in order to hold global data centers accountable for progress on sustainability, there needs to be clear, comparable standards across the board, not just for power consumption and PUE, but also for other factors like water consumption and e-waste reduction.
While we have pressure from consumers and new legislation for data centers, there needs to be more pressure on companies to choose green cloud providers. At the moment, while companies are being pushed to lower their carbon footprint, they aren’t being held accountable for emissions generated by data stored on external cloud servers.
It’s important to note that, as of 2023, new legislation will oblige EU based companies with more than 250 employees to report on their environmental impact, just as they report their financial results.
While there are plenty of concerns world leaders need to consider when it comes to climate change, with ever increasing data consumption, taking action to push for greener cloud services isn’t one we can afford to overlook.
Here are a few ways they can do this:

Set clear, universal environmental reporting standards for data centers
Include water consumption, IT or data center carbon emissions, and e-waste in calculations
Provide incentives for data centers to invest in green tech adoption and research (particularly in new cooling techniques)
Make companies accountable for emissions tied to their external data and provide incentives to choose green data service options
Ban water towers in Europe

"
Want to improve your e-commerce metrics? Focus on your QA score,Nathan Resnick,2021/12/3,"
I think most of us are aware of the fact that customers are important. Throughout the shift from traditional commerce business to the current focus on e-commerce enterprises, concepts like “the customer experience” and “the customer journey,” continue to ring true. In fact, in many cases, they’re more important than ever.
That is to say, even in the online retail space, there’s no doubt that the customer remains a focal point in all things business. When customers are able to Google everything, customer experience can be a way to differentiate your business and stand out.
Businesses are continually morphing and evolving the various elements of how they operate. Things like managing remote workers, orchestrating complex e-commerce customer service, and scaling along with the steady increase in online shopping are rewriting what the customer experience is in the first place.
And yet, I still firmly believe that quality assurance remains one of the biggest factors impacting every startup‘s or company’s CX. In fact, with so much competition in the e-commerce space, the quality of the experience that you can offer to your clients is one of the biggest differentiating factors any organization can cultivate.
While the customer is key, though, catering to an e-commerce customer can be challenging. If you don’t have solid, customer-related metrics to guide you, creating a winning strategy can be impossible.
That’s where your QA score comes into play.
What is your QA score?
While quality assurance has always been a mainstay in business, tracking traditional QA in a spreadsheet-focused, 21st-century enterprise can be challenging.
The question is, how can you track, analyze, and improve your customer experience?
Traditionally, businesses gauge CX with things like customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores. The problem is, these can be skewed by external factors. They also tend to be simplistic, more often than not merely requesting a general opinion about a customer’s overall experience. This generates data that is non-specific and does not suggest specific areas of improvement…
Enter the QA score.
A quality assurance score is a metric that you can customize to the specific customer experience that your brand is attempting to offer. In addition to using basic CSAT information, a QA score can take into consideration critical elements like:

How your customer service rep is doing in their interactions with customers
If a rep is following your customer service protocols
If a rep is reflecting the tone, voice, and posture outlined in your brand guidelines
Any other company-specific standards or values worth tracking

These additional factors make a QA score much more effective at capturing detailed, relevant interaction data.
By tailoring your QA scorecard to your brand, you can judge the quality of your agent’s interactions with your customers. This can provide specific areas of improvement and growth rather than generic feedback that does little more than reflect initial customer emotions.
The measured difference between CSAT and QA scores
Traditional customer service surveys have been the go-to option for CSAT as they are used as a proxy for quality. However, I’ve found that they can be a bit misleading. In fact, at times, they can even contradict the more accurate data offered by a QA score.
Quality assurance software platform MaestroQA recently conducted an analysis of 265,000 customer support tickets. In the review, the company compared classic CSAT scores with more robust QA scores and discovered that even when only considering interactions with a 90% QA score or higher, nearly a third (31.8%) of the support tickets had negative CSAT scores.
In other words, even when customer service was stellar, more than three out of every 10 tickets looked like a failure from a CSAT perspective.
The critical nature of a QA score
Examples like the one I provided above help to highlight the weakness and overall shallow nature of a customer survey. On their own, these simplistic questionnaires tend to fall flat.
Rather than provide meaningful data, they cloud the problem with emotional responses. If a customer is upset after an interaction, it doesn’t matter how professional an agent was, or whether they followed their training and instructions from their team. The feedback will likely be negative. A case can be made for the opposite to be true, as well.
When you use a QA score, however, it can pinpoint precise areas of both strength and weakness. To reiterate, this is due to the fact that a QA scorecard can be:

Customized to gather specific data
Used to define detailed success and failure points
Used to read into feedback and data and then come up with meaningful changes

Compared to a CSAT score, a QA score provides a robust, well-rounded set of data for understanding whether or not agents are performing to set company standards. It can be tailored to meet each company’s needs, and can provide critical feedback.
Using your QA score to perfect your business
The e-commerce industry comes with many metrics — data in the CX area, in particular, can feel overwhelming at times. If you’re looking for a way to cut through the clutter and pinpoint where you really need to grow, look no further than your QA score.
From personalization to specificity, a QA score provides a quality metric that can redefine both your e-commerce data analytics and, by extension, your customer experience as a whole.
"
You’ve just been accepted into a startup accelerator — now what?,Andrea Hak,2021/11/29,"
Almost every startup has flirted with the idea of joining an accelerator program. When done right, they can be an invaluable opportunity to learn from experts, get feedback on your product, business, or strategy, and get access to lucrative funding opportunities. But just how beneficial are they?
The answer really depends on you.
Taking time out of your daily operations for three to even six months is a big deal in a startup’s hectic life cycle. There are so many founders who apply to accelerators thinking it’ll be a great opportunity and then, when the program actually starts, it gets pushed aside to tackle other concerns. You miss one workshop here, one mixer there, and the next thing you know it’s over.
In the past, we’ve written about what to consider before joining a startup accelerator, how to choose the right program, and how to actually get in. Now we want to focus on what you should be doing during and after the program ends to keep the momentum going — so let’s dig in!
Be THAT person at the front of the class

Luckily, we had access to a batch of cohorts fresh out of the DMS Accelerator for data-centric startups and SMEs in Europe. TNW reached out to some of the most engaged participants to find out how they got the most out of their experience and what they recommend to fellow founders.
Claire Linley, co-founder and CCO at retail technology innovator Delloop, began by sharing her simple strategy:
Participate, participate, participate! Get involved in every aspect of the program.
The biggest benefit of a good accelerator program is the mentoring opportunities. You’re opening your company up to be poked and prodded by experts and mentors who will scrutinize your business plan, question your product-market fit, and may even tell you to ditch your artsy logo.
Keep in mind that your startup isn’t a glass house. Some of the best known tech companies today went through pivots and rebranding to reach where they are now. Twitter was originally a podcasting platform, Airbnb was focused on finding beds for conference attendees, and Youtube started out as a video dating site.
For Manuel Pessanha, CEO of automated fleet and delivery scheduling solution, Synertics, one of the best pieces of advice for fellow founders is:
Be open and constructive to external opinions and ideas and engage with the incredible pool of mentors as much as possible.
This is your chance to see your business from different perspectives and ask as many questions as possible. So be that nerd at the front of the classroom.
Make some friends (or at least long term connections)

After the expert advice, the second biggest benefit of joining an accelerator is the potential connections you can make. Whether it’s with your mentors, fellow founders, guest speakers at workshops, or anyone else you meet along the way.
But it’s all too easy to let these connections fade after the accelerator ends. Faizan Patankar, CEO of industrial ops AI startup, Amygda said:
Build relationships with other founders, because in your journey who knows who might be able to help you with an introduction to a VC or a common connection to a new customer. Keep adding value to founders’ lives even after the accelerator. Just as you need help, the rest of the founder community needs it too!
In fact, Patankar suggests to think even wider than your own cohort:
Search through the existing and past companies in the accelerator. They could be a great source of new business sales or even partnerships.
Take a page from Leila Koenig, co-founder at Dashfactory (creator of the electric Dashbike) who told TNW she made it a habit to connect with every person she met on LinkedIn straight away.
Dashfactory took the best out of it. We really focused on connecting with the people in the program. We connected with everyone on LinkedIn and took part in every session.
Don’t just bring senior people

A lot of startups end up just sending founders or senior level people to accelerator workshops — but that’s a big mistake. Instead, you should think about them like free training sessions that your whole team can benefit from. Whether your marketing team wants to get some external advice on their new campaign or your sales team wants to learn about how they can build their pipeline, there are lots of opportunities for growth. Koenig put it succinctly:
Use those workshops to educate your team. Most startups have a lot of enthusiastic juniors. Take the right people with you to the workshops.
Similarly, Violetta Shishkina co-founder & CEO of blockchain-based CAD sharing solution, CADChain, actually found the DMS Accelerator to be a great opportunity for getting new hires up to speed.
Apart from the obvious benefits of participating in such a program, we were able to get the added benefit of connecting the onboarding process of new employees with their presence at the webinars.
As our startup was growing rapidly at the time, the participation of new employees in the accelerator allowed us to quickly and effectively immerse them into the startup life, providing them with crucial knowledge, great insights, and fresh experience.
Advertise, market, and share

Remember, being accepted into a well-known accelerator is great for your startup’s market cred. But don’t wait for VCs or potential partners to ask you which programs you’ve participated in — make sure everyone knows before they even think to ask.
That’s at least what Patankar believes:
You should share your journey through the accelerator on your website, blog updates, and social media. Build your social proof by being associated with trusted accelerators.
Echoing Patankar’s advice, Linley suggests:
Use all your social media channels to promote the accelerator, your participation, and to support your cohort peers.
Don’t forget to celebrate

Getting into a well-known accelerator is a milestone for your startup; it means the organizers see potential in your idea and your team. For all the ups and downs of startup life, it’s a great confirmation that you’re doing something right. So take the time to celebrate and get your team excited about what’s to come.
Billy Mello, CEO at LAIFE, an AI-based wellness and music company, said:
Being part of the DMS Accelerator was a highlight for our intense year at LAIFE.
Due to the highly skilled contacts, mentors, and training pieces, DMS delivers what it promises.
And the overall program encompasses everything a startup needs to get on track with the development, funding, client and investors relationships and much more.
We had the chance to meet brilliant mentors, committed investors, learned a lot through workshops and classes, but, above all, we felt that LAIFE now is part of a more prominent family, with lots of skilled peers.
There are over 7000 startup accelerator and incubator programs globally, so there’s bound to be a great one out there for your startup’s needs. If you’re a data-centric SME or startup based in Europe, check out DMS Accelerator. The program aims to help these companies overcome barriers in data skills, entrepreneurial opportunities, legal issues and standardization.

Engagement isn’t the future of software — so stop prioritizing it,Wade Foster,2021/11/29,"
When’s the last time you thought about your hammer? Probably the last time you used it.
Physical tools don’t ask for your time — they just do their job. Software, on the other hand, is also a tool, but lately, apps are demanding more and more of humans. Workplace software is just as addictive as consumer software, all in the name of “driving engagement.”
But who is this engagement really for? For most users, it only leads to irrelevant, or worse, distracting work. The constant red dot, the buzzing notification on your phone, and the chime of one more alert calls us to work that may or may not matter.
It’s overwhelming and pointless — so let’s stop doing it.
Don’t let software get in your users’ way
Imagine, if you will, a world in which hammers were optimized for engagement. They could maybe make a sound every day, just to remind you that you have a hammer.
They could have Wi-Fi, with push notifications, letting you know how many nails you drove in one year ago today. Maybe there’s the occasional note about new hammers you could purchase.
It’s a silly idea for a hammer. In a few years, people will also realize it was a silly idea for work software — so you better adapt.
People, and businesses especially, will increasingly look for software that’s less like a social network and more like a hammer. The future of software will be focused on enabling workers, not driving engagement. It’s about putting humans back in the driver’s seat.
People want software that allows them to have leverage over the work they do. To truly be able to do more things, with less. That means creating software people can use to do a job, then stop thinking about.
My co-founders and I founded Zapier on these principles — and I feel all software creators should do the same. We shouldn’t demand people’s time. Instead, we should give users the freedom and flexibility to do whatever they think is most important, while helping them automate the rest.
Let your apps work for you
The best employee is one you can trust to do their job without a lot of oversight. People who save you time, rather than take it up. Software should work the same way. People should be able to hire software to do a job, then trust it to get that job done without a lot of effort on their part.
Automation software is a great example of this. Creating automated workflows takes some time upfront, but after that, it works in the background. It saves users time every month, whether they log in to the website or not.
This is the future of software: apps doing more for us instead of demanding more from us. So if you want to succeed, apply this to the products you make, and help empower the next generation of creators.

From our worst month to our best: 4 lessons my startup learned the hard way,Sebastián Henao,2021/11/25,"
The pandemic was incredibly difficult for many startups, and mine was one of them. As restrictions started, our operations fell by a whopping 81%.
This might not be that surprising, seeing that we work in recruitment. But what might be a surprise is that we made it through this difficult patch and are growing again.
So let me share my learnings and how we got back onto the growth path with a new, faster, and more aggressive mindset.
Before we dive in, let me give you a bit of background. My startup Globalwork was founded in Colombia and operates across Latin America. Our purpose is to build trusting relationships between companies and their talent through background checks, information verification of their applicants, and home interviews.
When we started out in 2017 we worked with medium-sized companies, but over time we’ve begun partnering with large corporations in the region. We built a very solid information platform and a network of 200 professionals in psychology and social work throughout the region to conduct the best possible socioeconomic interviews.
Things were going great. The number of processes asked by our clients was growing 20% month by month… until the pandemic hit.
In Colombia, where we used to have our hand in 5000 hiring processes every quarter, the first months were wracked by uncertainty. Companies didn’t dare to hire new staff, many had to lay off a large part of their team (2.4 million job positions were lost and it’s estimated that Colombia went back 10 years in this regard) and clung to their jobs, so there was no turnover.
So in April 2020, our operations dropped by 81% — our absolute worst month. But only a year later, in March 2021, we had our best month ever, even compared with the b.c. (before covid) era!
I won’t claim that we have some magical solution or that all our decisions were right or fully informed. And I won’t deny the importance that the economic reactivation had on our indicators.
Instead, the truth is simply that we acquired experience during tough times, whose value we’re only now beginning to understand. But we’re using it to define good practices that are now part of who we are and I believe it can be useful for you as well.
1. If to ‘do or not to do’ is the dilemma, always do
The common opinion among our clients and colleagues, even our own opinion, was that the pandemic was going to last a couple of months. We could see how many companies were left to wait and barely reacted when weeks had passed.
We, on the other hand, spent the first weekend of lockdown in a hackathon, building the MVP of the product that I’ll tell you about later on.
A few weeks before, by chance, we had read this great article on the need to start playing offense. I found it to be incredibly important to jump-start our shift into a faster and more aggressive mindset.
2. Take the time to know your customers
As I said, we work in recruitment, which connects us directly with human resources. By calling our clients we discovered that many of them were carrying a heavy burden, as they had to fire people, channel the uncertainty and fear of employees, issue the disabilities of contagions, and even deal with the mourning of employees who lost loved ones.
The emotional burden and uncertainty were overwhelming the companies’ workforces. By putting ourselves in the shoes of our customers, we knew we had a huge possibility on our hands, not to sell more, but to connect at a human level with them.
This gave us incredible feedback on what people really needed and how we could fulfill those needs, but more on that a bit further down.
3. Be aware of your resources
My team has a network of 200 professionals in psychology and social work who conducted our home interviews. But when no one is hiring, and on top of that, if they aren’t even allowed to enter anyone’s home, what could we do with them?
Our decision was to assign psychologists and social workers to what they do best: listening and helping others.
Having previously identified the needs of the companies we worked with, we launched a completely free emotional wellness platform, in which 50 of our collaborators volunteered to participate.
The dynamic was simple: if anyone, whether they were employees of our clients or not, felt emotionally unwell, they could contact us through a landing page and schedule an appointment with one of our professionals.
With this campaign, we made a quick communication plan with our database and media and from one week to the next our website visits doubled, we were published in national media, and weekly we received around 100 requests for emotional accompaniment during three months.
As time went by, this platform became more sophisticated with people analytics, and we started to offer it to companies through a monthly fee so that they could open a space for empathic and professional listening to their teams and obtain valuable information about emotions in their organization.
4. Know the needs of the industries
You spend all day thinking how to make your product better. It is highly likely that you will end up believing that you are the best thing in the world and that the market needs you. Not even close.
While we were trying to sell a service that didn’t have a big demand because of the uncertainty in society, a client of ours, one of the most important companies in Colombia told us: “We are going to send 500 people to permanent remote work and we need a company that makes sure they have the optimal conditions for that. Would you be interested in checking this?”
So, again, we made specific changes in the technology we had already developed, and we assigned our entire logistics network of psychologists and social workers to this new service that implied minimal modifications to the process, but let us keep moving at first, and then, to building a profitable line of business.
These pivots that we had to make at full speed changed our own vision of Globalwork: they showed us that we are not only a background checks and information verification company, but mainly a logistics company that can support HR areas in a wide range of needs.
We now have two new lines of business, emotional wellbeing and verification of remote work conditions, which represent 7% and 6% of our current operation, respectively.
In addition, this dynamic of constant experimentation allowed us to go back to grow 20% every month and prepared us for the economic recovery, strengthening the relationship with our clients to a level we did not expect and teaching us to optimize our commercial processes, which reduced our sales cycles from 4-5 months to 2-3 months.
I don’t want to fall into the cliché of saying that change is the best thing in the world, because it isn’t.
It can be terrifying and super destructive. But it’s something you can’t control. Just remember the inertia law: objects tend to maintain their state, either at rest or in motion. If you are barely moving, any obstacle will stop you easily. If you are moving fast, of course you can be deviated and even derailed, but your inertia will keep you in motion.

How to successfully expand your brand into China,Ainar Abdrahmanov,2021/11/9,"
The Chinese market is one of the most appealing for brands looking to expand into new territories. And it’s clear why — the ecommerce market in China is $2.7 trillion, four times the size of the US ($843 billion), and is growing twice as fast. What’s even more exciting is that the share of ecommerce sales to total retail is expected to be at about 52.1% in 2021, growing from 44.8% just a year before.
While this is promising, I’ve found that there’s a widespread delusion among many executives that since there are 1.4 billion people in China, they’ll definitely be able to sell something due to the market’s sheer size.
But that’s not necessarily true, and we know many examples of a brand that failed to do so. Companies ranging from Tesco and Uber to eBay and Google have been on that path and had to exit or rebuild their strategy entirely.
So let’s dive into what’s the right way to approach the opportunities the Chinese market has to offer.
It’s all about ecommerce
Since ecommerce sales are about half of the total retail in China and even more than that in particular categories, I’d advise any brand interested in this market to focus on a digital-first strategy.
If a brand is used to offline distribution, its management and owners will repeat their usual strategy when entering China.
They think the following way: “Hell, we entered the USA, Brazil, and Japan. We know how distribution works, how advertising works, how to build relationships. We will enter major local retail chains just like we entered Walmart, Carrefour, and others. Each store will provide us with an expected monthly sales volume (100-200 kilograms or 200-500 packages on the shelf). That’s it”.
But if you want to export to China, the biggest mistake is repeating your strategy from other regions, even if it works outstandingly. In China, things are different.
Beware retail
In China, retail chains are overloaded with demand from all kinds of suppliers. You will have to pay for the shelf space, for a listing, promotion, and generally be offered pretty terrible terms. This means you will pay a lot, and you’ll get a wildly unpredictable result. Put simply, the market is saturated, and you’re new here.
Even if you’re large enough, you will be working through distributors with no control over your sales. And unless Chinese consumers already know about you, the retail chains have a minimal incentive to let your products on their shelves.
Ecommerce is different. Online marketplaces have infinite shelf space. Anyone with a bit of reason can put a product there. Compared to the time, effort, and cost of offline distribution, ecommerce is quick, effective, and scalable.
So the first question is to assess whether you’re ready to go online as your market entry strategy. If so, your team needs to understand how the ecommerce market works in China. Unlike ordinary retail, it’s pretty much unique regarding customer behaviors, habits, and the local ecosystem.
The local ecosystem helps you
In China, selling online is much more efficient because of the uniquely powerful marketplaces and supplier/vendor ecosystem. We do have bloggers and influencers in the US and Europe, but they’re more than just influencers in China. They are the media, and they control consumer trends.
We may have Instagram Live, but brands market their products through endless live streams performed by popular influencers, bringing their audiences to you. On platforms like Taobao or Douyin, they take the products they’re interested in and help you convert their audience into your customers. You instantly get connected to them, communicate with them, follow up, and market your products even further.
You might think that it’d be hard to top Amazon in terms of network power. But in fact, Amazon is just 5.8% of the US retail sales ($234 billion versus $4.04 trillion). And while it’s generally pretty good for consumers, suppliers have had significant and constant issues selling their products through Amazon, including some that have led to antitrust lawsuits. Unlike Amazon, Chinese ecommerce platforms help businesses grow.
Most importantly, platforms like Taobao and Alibaba provide us with data on sales for each product category and for each merchant — something you’d be surprised to see on Amazon. That allows anyone to adjust their product offering and adjust their listings for improved results.
The cost of customer acquisition through the Taobao live streaming or Douyin is much smaller than the investment required for offline retail. And most importantly, the ROI on the amount of money and efforts invested is significantly higher. Online sales are comparable in volume to offline in China, and for some products, even more significant.
Almost any brand, small or large, can start selling on Chinese online platforms, and for the following two to four years, you won’t even have to think about offline retail at all. And then, when the audience has already had a taste of your products — when you have proven there’s a demand for them — and have a few years of performance data, you could go to retail chains, show it to them, and get placements with more ease.
Essentially, you’ll de-risk your products for the Chinese brick and mortar retail outlets, and who’s not interested in profits with minimal risks?
Get local help
To market your products effectively, you will need to find a TP — a trading partner handling marketplace operations and managing live streaming platforms and blogger relations. Finding the right partner is a big part of your success. There are several agencies whose entire job is to help you find the right contractors. But you can’t just outsource these responsibilities straight away.
You need to have people explicitly focused on Chinese markets, talking to your trading partner, providing messaging points, basic marketing materials, and other details. Nobody knows your product better than you, and nobody will do that job for you.
A good trading partner always asks many questions and demands data to run successful campaigns, helping you flourish within the Chinese market.
Some of the companies that tried to enter China and failed believe there was something wrong with their brand. They pity themselves and explain to all others they just were too different and unique for this market, and there was nothing they could do about it.
The problem is not that your brand is unsuitable for selling in China or that you do not have enough money. The problem is neither in legal questions nor logistics. It’s about your competencies, experience, and psychology.
Success in China depends on whether you have people in your team who have experience working with the unique challenges of the region or at least are willing to learn and adapt because they understand it’s a different beast.
To successfully sell products in China, you need to look at companies that have operated there successfully for many years. Or, even better, at the ones that failed and rebuilt their operations. If Pizza Hut can make its product appealing to Chinese consumers, you can do that as well.

How to bootstrap and scale your SaaS startup the RIGHT way,Saravana Kumar,2021/11/1,"
As the founder of a bootstrapped startup, people often ask me how I decided on which funding route I’d take when there are so many options for founders to consider.
While I don’t have a short answer to this, there’s one thing I can say: your choice of funding needs to be based on the nature of your business and the product you are dealing with.
The exact type of your business can be determined in a number of ways, but I find ‘Red Ocean’ and ‘Blue Ocean’ can be quite helpful. Coined by acclaimed business theorists, W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne to classify all market strategies, Red Ocean refers to when there are a lot of competitors and you need a substantial amount of money to survive in it. Whereas Blue Ocean refers to a very niche market wherein you might see a lower growth rate but survive with considerably low investment.
While being helpful, there is of course no hard and fast rule to this theory — it’s often purely situational.
Our first product, BizTalk360 falls within Blue Ocean (no competitors, focused segment, and low customer acquisition cost) while our latest product, Document360, falls under the Red Ocean strategy.  With that product, we’re competing against companies like Zendesk, Freshdesk, Confluence, Notion, and so on, so we end up spending a lot on customer acquisitions for this product.
Now that I’ve given you a bit of the background on where I’m coming from, let’s dive into what made me ultimately decide on going the bootstrapping route.
The decision to bootstrap
The initial product idea for BizTalk360 was seeded at the Microsoft Global MVP Summit in Seattle in February 2010. The first version of the product was very well received by MVPs in 2011, which led to me to officially launch the startup the same year. Within a year, we onboarded 65 customers.
As we started to launch new products, we sort of banked on the success of our previous products and reinvested the revenues into the company to fund them. All our products have their own engineering, marketing, and sales teams working on improving the products and acquiring customers.
Today, our parent company kovai.co has 1500+ customers. We have not had to seek external funding since all our products are generating revenues.
Great products will sell
When we launched BizTalk360, we knew that we still had a long road ahead. Building the product was not much of a challenge since I have the required technical know-how. Selling the product was the tricky part as I didn’t have much experience doing that.
I started blogging very early in my career. My blog used to be very technical in nature as I specialized in a particular domain which is the BizTalk server and gradually I was able to build an audience of 15,000 followers.
When I developed BizTalk360, the blogs helped me get my first customer (a casino) all the way from Hong Kong, which was completely unknown to me until that point. While my blogging activities might’ve landed us the first customers, it was the value of the product itself that kept customers loyal.
So no matter how good your acquisition is, the retention will always come down to quality.
Scale at the right time
In my opinion, most startups fail due to premature scaling. That’s why knowing when to scale your startup is one of the most crucial decisions you’ll face as a founder.
Most entrepreneurs just assume that once their product has been successfully launched, it’s time to scale up. But that’s not how it works. The product has to be periodically monitored and improved to make sure that it is not being overtaken by competitors. Your product needs to scale up along with your business.
Since our flagship product, BizTalk360, is a niche segment, we were able to be the market leaders right from the beginning and still continue to do so. The product matured completely in about fives years and the goal was all about maintaining the product, taking care of existing customers, and adding new ones. We then decided to diversify and move to new products, we simply replicated what had worked for us in similar situations.
Another thing you should do is structure your work model and business process. You should have systems in place to effectively monitor the stakeholders and processes in the organization.
But once you actually pinpoint problems through that monitoring, you need to react to them the right way. Many startup founders think that just hiring a person can magically solve all their problems, but let me be clear: it doesn’t work.
For example, hiring a Sales Manager when your product isn’t working properly is a rookie mistake. You need to be extremely patient and persistent in the process. Ensure that your product is a market-fit product before you consider scaling your startup.
Scaling your startup might seem tempting sometimes, but nothing is better than the slow, steady, and organic growth of your startup.
Check your finances — cash flow, sales, expense, and revenue — before deciding whether you want to scale up. It’s easy to overlook certain aspects when you are trying to manage multiple things at the same time. Even then, you should have an elaborate financial plan with forecasts for the future.
The bottom line is: take time to lay the groundwork before taking your startup to the next level.

Even your ‘good’ decisions might be bad — so learn to rectify them,Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten,2021/10/28,"

When you’re launching a new company, product, or service, there’s an incredible amount of little decisions to make.
Of course, you’d like every single decision to be the perfect one, but that never happens. Instead, most of your choices will be mediocre, with many bad ones and only a few good ones. At the end of the day, you just have to hope your mediocre and good decisions make up for your many bad decisions.
And, unfortunately, the same goes for ethical dilemmas. Although you’ll aspire to be a saint and always choose the righteous path, no doubt at some point, you’ll end up negotiating on your ethics.
The reason for that is that ethical dilemmas are rarely clear-cut. You’ll have to figure out the many variables and decide which choice is the ‘least bad.’ And before you know it, you’ll do something that’s not straight-up evil or unethical… but close enough to make you question the tally of your karma points.
I heard about one such example from a manager at a startup recently. He had hired a salesperson, who was performing very well. And I mean seriously well.
They continuously outperformed everyone else in the sales team and landed the most impressive clients. But… this particular person was highly aggressive, impolite, and often almost abusive to prospective clients and coworkers.
Whenever the manager would overhear one of those sales calls, he would cringe and feel uncomfortable with the whole thing — although the salesperson hadn’t crossed any clear boundaries. The numbers also seemed reasonable, so he didn’t interfere.
Over time though, it became too much, and the salesperson was let go at one point. Sure it was a bit of a setback in the short term losing a high-performing salesperson, but after a few months, the company started gaining momentum again. They even got coverage on their favorite tech review site, amazing!
The article was comprehensive and cheerful and everything you’d hope for in a review… but then came the comments.
The first and most visible comment was from a CEO of a respectable company who described how awful the reviewed company’s sales approach was. He went on to explain, in detail, the aggressive stubbornness of the salesperson who hunted him, and how for him it stood out as an example of how not to do sales. He then concluded that if this reflected the company’s culture, he would never want to do business with them.
This was an important moment in the manager’s career because he instantly knew he deserved the criticism.
He knew the risks of allowing the successful but questionable salesperson to continue working at the company — but he was blinded by the revenue it generated.
So was it unethical to keep the salesperson on? No, but it was close enough to make the manager consider his karma points, and by then it was too late, the damage was already done.

Relying on a single cloud provider is hella risky — here’s a smarter strategy,Saidat Giwa-Osagie,2021/10/28,"
On 4th October 2021, millions of unsuspecting online users were surprised when a sudden internet blackout shut Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and Whatsapp down. The six-hour outage left many people without access to these platforms, which have cemented their place as the everyday cornerstones of modern communication. 
The significant outage lost Facebook billions on the stock market and made businesses that run on their platforms vulnerable to losses. Facebook’s data center issue shook the world, and a smaller Instagram outage a few days later highlighted how vulnerable we are to any disruption in our connectivity. And this isn’t the first time. 
Who could forget Fastly’s outage earlier this year that affected sites including Reddit, eBay, and The New York Times? Similarly, AWS Frankfurt experienced a major outage that took servers down when employees could not resolve the issue due to environmental problems preventing access to the data center. 
With 96% of companies depending on the cloud, digital platforms going down is a real and present threat. As companies revisit their crisis plans to avoid similar calamities in the future, the question is: what does a smart cloud strategy look like for companies today?
While not too long ago, everyone was talking about moving to the cloud, now we’re waking up to the fact that simply putting our data out there isn’t enough. A well-developed cloud strategy could save your business aches, pains, and even potential shutdowns. 
Configuring a cloud strategy
The majority of businesses on the cloud are using public services provided by giants like AWS. The benefit here is that companies can easily store their data in warehouses without needing the large budget and staff that housing the data themselves would require. 
There can also be substantial discounts available to a company investing heavily with a single provider due to economies of scale. However, these discounts can often come with a vendor lock-in, making it contractually impossible or more expensive to switch or access other cloud providers. For example, some cloud providers offer startups free cloud credits at first, then lock them into paid plans later on.
And, as exemplified by the Fastly outage, depending on a sole external cloud provider can have disastrous consequences if an outage occurs. The same goes for data leaks and cybersecurity threats; storing all of your data in one place makes it more vulnerable to attacks. 
Vendor lock-in also limits the amount of data sovereignty your organization can maintain. For example, with many larger cloud services based in the US or Asia, only a small portion of European data is actually stored in the EU. This could above all mean that your data is vulnerable and potentially visible by non-European authorities, due to extraterritorial legislation like the US Cloud Act. With 36% of EU based companies now using cloud computing, this could become a bigger issue in the coming years.
Finally, it also means less flexibility to take advantage of alternative configurations and possibilities that could work better for other parts of your business. For example, your accounting team’s data needs may be very different from what you need to properly store your client data. 
Pros and cons of having one sole provider:

Easy to move to an existing service
Discounts may be available
Possible vendor lock-in 
Vulnerable to outages and security leaks
Less flexibility and data sovereignty

Configuring a multi-cloud strategy
Instead of relying on one provider, many are creating multi-cloud environments across multiple vendors. According to a study by Accenture, out of enterprises that have already moved to the cloud, 93% have adopted a multi-cloud strategy. 
Going multi-cloud also offers flexibility by enabling companies to optimize workloads according to different providers’ capacity, performance, location, environmental efficiency and costs. With other USPs provided by various vendors, companies have the luxury of selecting the best aspects of each provider. 
A multi-cloud strategy also enables companies to avoid lock-ins with a sole provider, giving them the ultimate choice and flexibility in their cloud infrastructure. For example, this means you can also choose between multiple payment models (hourly, monthly, yearly) and multiple resource types (virtual, baremetal, homegrown).
Of course, as with any plan, there are some drawbacks to consider. One is that you really need to do a lot of initial research to choose which cloud providers can offer what you need to build a cloud strategy that meets your company’s needs. 
Diversifying cloud platforms may also require internal staff to manage your cloud strategy, adding to operating costs. Providing the needed security measures for a multi-cloud setup is another vital requirement and adds a layer of complexity.
Pros and cons of building a multi-cloud strategy:

Less vulnerability to shutdowns and attacks
Less prone to geopolitical risks when the cloud mix is diverse/international
More flexibility and options in building your cloud strategy
Lower operational costs when adopting a pick and choose strategy
Higher contract and operational costs unless the architecture is multi-cloud by design 
Need to develop a strong security strategy

What to consider when pursuing a multi-cloud setup
Even with a reliable cloud provider at hand, one bad downtime situation is all it takes to ruin a priceless reputation. At the same time, working with multiple cloud platforms can also increase the complexity and workload associated with cloud configurations, so balancing the benefits with the drawbacks of multi-cloud environments is essential. With those factors in mind, there are several steps to consider when deciding on a multi-cloud strategy. 
Identify how and why a multi-cloud would benefit your organization. A clear understanding of its usefulness in your context will help to shape your strategy and deployment. Ask yourself the following questions:

Are you using a multi-cloud setup for dynamic provisioning in the event of an outage or heavy usage demands? 
Could this approach save or make more money? 
What operational steps are necessary to make multi-cloud viable in your organization? 

The answers to these questions will differ in each instance but are vital in illuminating the processes moving forward.
Steps to set-up a multi-cloud strategy 
Let’s say you’ve decided going multi-cloud is the right move for your organization. How can you get there?
1. Identify all the different cloud vendors and contracts tied to your company 
Firstly, getting the big picture of your various cloud configurations is essential because it will help you understand the state of your organization and define how you want cloud operations to evolve onwards.
2. Determine which services you would like to integrate or stop
Once you’ve got a picture of the state of the cloud in your company, the second step is to determine which services you’d like to integrate or stop altogether. Are there opportunities to combine different services that would optimize performance or lower operating costs? Approaching the situation with a strategic lens will tease out your roadmap.
Multi-cloud enabling products could help you make that move without damaging the integrity of your current setup. Products like multi-cloud load balancers can help manage online traffic with third-party integrations and guarantee more server availability in the case of debilitating cyberattacks. Mapping out your multi-cloud plans will help you figure out where these sorts of products fit into your organization.
3. Build and develop a team with multi-cloud management capabilities
Thirdly, building a team that can manage the multi-cloud configuration is essential. Using different cloud operators can increase the complexity of an organization’s cloud setup, so having a skilled and collaborative team to oversee the architecture and operation of the cloud setup is necessary to instate and evolve your multi-cloud mission.
4. Create cloud governance procedures in tandem with cloud management tools
Finally, cloud management is a defining aspect of the multi-cloud approach. Assessing how you’ll handle integrations and accessing a vendor‘s APIs across multiple providers without incompatibility issues should be explored ahead of long-term implementation. If you can figure out how your separate deployments will work in tandem, this will help make your multi-cloud setup less complicated. 
With such a variety of cloud vendors available today, a multi-cloud or hybrid approach is fast becoming one of the trusted cloud strategies. As more companies consider how to maintain a constant online presence, really taking the time to build out a clear cloud strategy can give companies and users peace of mind during an otherwise unpredictable situation.

The ultimate employee benefit you need to offer: Purpose,Bob Lord,2021/10/27,"
The world’s labor markets are currently bracing for a mass exodus of workers in what some experts are calling “the Great Resignation.” 
Recent surveys indicate more than a quarter of the global workforce, and perhaps as much as 40%, is considering quitting. Meanwhile, U.S. Labor Department data reveals Americans are already leaving their jobs at the highest rates in two decades.
Why? Because with crisis comes perspective.
As many around the world emerge from the most difficult year in their professional lives, a steady job with fair pay and decent benefits is no longer enough. 
Even work-from-home options aren’t enough, with data indicating many workers are itching to get back into the office: 63% of people with kids under 12 and 40% of childless workers are ready for the end of work-from-home, according to a recent Haven Life survey. 
If, as employers, you want to keep employees engaged and productive for the long term — which I think you definitely should — let me tell you, the game has changed. 
You must now meet a higher standard. You must imbue their jobs with meaning. You must offer work with purpose.  
Create meaningful opportunities for employees to become activist engineers
Of course, not all lines of work come with an inherent sense of purpose. This is why nearly two-thirds of employers now offer some sort of paid-time-off program to encourage volunteering. That’s commendable. 
But these programs leave it to employees to identify and engage with an overwhelming and often unfulfilling array of volunteer opportunities. As a result, only about a third of employees take advantage of these programs.
To truly inspire employees to make a difference, I implore you to create volunteer opportunities that allow employees to become activists, applying the same skills they use in their day jobs. 
One example that I know well is Call for Code, a program IBM launched in 2018 with David Clark Cause and The United Nations Human Rights Office, to provide resources, funding, and open source technology to empower developers to create tech for good. 
The response has been staggering, with over half a million developers across 180 countries to date having contributed solutions to address societal problems. For example, four developers from Taiwan, Brazil, Mongolia, and India built an app to bring the power of artificial intelligence and weather insights to help rural farmers struggling with the effects of climate change. 
In this way, I view the traction we’ve witnessed with Call for Code as evidence that developers truly crave outlets for activism and a deeper sense of purpose – while also further developing their skills and exercising critical problem-solving skills. 
Offer to fulfill “stretch” assignments
Traditional stretch assignments serve an important role by acknowledging the tedium inherent in some roles. But these extracurricular opportunities often wind up being little more than a repository for unwanted, non-critical work.
To foster a sense of purpose in these assignments, you need to — as a business leader — identify or co-create opportunities to give back to communities while honing existing skills. 
The health fitness company Equinox, for example, funds The Heroes Project, which provides personal and physical training to severely injured veterans. SMBP, the large recruiting company, donates resume services and career coaching for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
So look at where you can give back and use it to inspire your employees.
Build ecosystems of support
Solving difficult, societal problems requires a variety of expertise and perspectives. But I feel like organizations limit too often the scope of their outreach based on artificial barriers. 
When trying to change the world, collaboration with customers, business partners, and even competitors are both necessary and deeply rewarding. This is a wonderful opportunity for deep employee engagement beyond their typical role.
In California, for example, The San Francisco Chronicle heads the San Francisco Homeless Project, which brings together reporters from dozens of competing news organizations and outlets to report stories that shine a light on the city’s homeless population. 
In Nigeria, the consulting company Accenture created a new e-learning platform to reach students in Africa in innovative ways, part of the Junior Achievement Nigeria initiative, a collaboration between many of the world’s leading consultancies and banks. 
In both cases, competitive boundaries were crossed in the name of purpose, which is a lesson to us all. 
Two years ago, before the start of the pandemic, the CEOs of the largest companies in America, including former IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, redefined the “purpose of a corporation.” The statement they issued made manifest the corporate philosophies many companies already held. Namely, that the responsibilities of the modern corporation should extend far beyond shareholders to include customers, employees, suppliers, and communities.
They also understood that today’s workforce needs more than stock options and profit-sharing to stay motivated. They need a sense of purpose. A connection to something bigger. 
And to be honest, it shouldn’t take a global crisis to make us deliver meaningful opportunities to the workforce so they can apply their shared desire and aptitude for activism to drive social good. 
So as the job markets begin to thaw and competition for talent heats up, I believe companies of all shapes and sizes, in every part of the world, need to start investing in purpose the same way they invest in marketing or product development, for the good of their business, and the good of society.

Your startup isn’t ready for Europe’s privacy shake-up — but here’s how it can be,Peter Day,2021/10/26,"
For decades, people have proclaimed the now-common refrain that “privacy is dead.” I often think back to Scott McNealy, then CEO at Sun Microsystems, claiming in 1999 that “you have zero privacy anyway… get over it.”
I wouldn’t go as far as saying that leaders at startups hold such a strong disregard for privacy, but I do find many taking the stance that the world’s strictest data privacy laws don’t apply to them. If you fall into this category, you ought to know that privacy isn’t dead, and a new era of privacy is being quietly ushered in across Europe.
Earlier this year the European Commission (EC) issued its long-awaited update to ‘Standard Contractual Clauses’ (SCCs), which represents the most frequently used mechanism to transfer your customers’ personal data out of the EU, including to the US.
If you’re a business that operates in or with Europe, these new updates – and the constantly shifting privacy landscape more generally – matter. If followed incorrectly or not taken seriously at all, it can be extremely costly. 
So, let’s look at some of these new privacy updates in more detail and I’ll then share some lessons I learned while working on privacy issues at a startup that processes vast amounts of user data.
A new era of privacy, and the fine print you probably missed
The question of where your data exists and who has access to it is becoming one of the most complex and significant questions in startup land.
On the one hand, the booming SaaS startup ecosystem means that we are now more reliant than ever on the cloud, where servers often reside abroad. On the other, there are ever-changing regional data rights as different jurisdictions embrace data sovereignty and privacy rights for users.
This friction has now made its way to the courts, and just last year the EU issued a ruling (dubbed ‘Schrems II’) that invalidated the ‘Privacy Shield,’ or the mechanism that was being used to get data out of Europe and into American data centers for processing. Then came the update to the SSCs. 
The basic premise of this update was to bring in new SCCs to govern the transfer of personal data from the EU to third countries, designed to better protect Europeans from mass surveillance, specifically a concern with regard to the US.
If you’re operating in or doing business with European residents, international data flows are probably an essential part of your business in an increasingly digital global economy. You might not even be aware that your digital product relies on microservices from a partner that sees user data processed in a third country.
Let’s take for example our product at Mixpanel. We provide SaaS-based product analytics technology, which by its nature, tracks user behavior within apps so product experts can improve the user experience. 
If you use our product, until recently you’d have been sending data to us that was processed in the US, perhaps without fully realizing the implications. We’ve now got full EU data residency to overcome this issue, but we’re very much in the minority.
And this should be the number one issue concerning startups. Has our surface area for liability and risk just been hugely expanded? If I put this in simpler terms: you’re a fintech that has contracts with seven companies providing services via APIs. Those seven companies also contract with a further 10 companies each, which now means your risk surface has expanded from seven companies to 70.
So, what can busy startups do to reduce their risk and ensure they’re delivering on privacy obligations for the people that use their services? 
In my view, there are three golden rules that can help a startup navigate this complexity.

Locate user data in Europe whenever possible: Depending on your infrastructure and ability to invest, you’ll need to form a judgment as to whether you can ensure your user’s data is stored and processed exclusively in Europe.  
Always maintain a ‘data map’: It is vital to take an “audit” of the microservices and ancillary support services that underpin your main products. In doing so, you can better understand that data ecosystem and your risk surface across third-party suppliers.
Seek European legal entities as partners: It’s possible authorities in the US could access data that was in the Netherlands, but was operated by a US-based company. The contracting party matters, so it’s important to partner with legal entities across different regional operations based in the EU. 

There’s simply no avoiding this issue in the long term. People increasingly care about data privacy and with the changes to the SCCs the EU has further signaled the importance it attaches to data residency. With local regulators soon to release their guidance and interpretation within member states, now is the time to act. 
The movement for improved privacy isn’t dead, it’s just getting started.

"Hybrid work isn’t perfect, but SCIENCE can help us improve it",The Conversation,2021/10/25,"
COVID-19 has changed the way we work.
Even before the pandemic, the U.S. workforce increasingly relied on remote collaboration technologies like videoconferencing and Slack. The global crisis accelerated the adoption of these work tools and practices in an unprecedented way. By April 2020, about half of companies reported that more than 80% of their employees worked from home because of COVID-19.
That shift was made possible by decades of research into, and then development of, technologies that support remote work, but not everyone uses these technologies with the same ease. As early as 1987, groundbreaking research identified some of the challenges facing women working from home using technology. That included the difficulties of child care, work-home separation and employee growth opportunities.
Since that time, we have learned much more about virtual collaboration. As an associate professor of information systems, I’m interested in what we can expect as we eagerly anticipate a post-pandemic future. One thing stands out: Hybrid work arrangements – that is, employees who do some tasks in the office and others virtually – is clearly going to be a big part of the picture.
One survey from April 2021 shows 99% of human resources leaders expect employees to work in some kind of hybrid arrangement moving forward. Many have already begun. As just one example, Dropbox, the file hosting service, made a permanent shift during the pandemic, allowing employees to work from home and hold team meetings in the office.
The definition of “hybrid” varies in other organizations. Some workers might be in the office a couple days a week or every other day. Other businesses may require only occasional face-to-face time, perhaps meeting in a centralized location once each quarter.
Either way, research does show many companies fail in their implementation of a virtual workforce.
Remote work versus in the office
In-office work promotes structure and transparency, which may increase trust between management and workers. Developing an organizational culture happens naturally. Casual office conversations – a worker walking down the hall for a quick and unscheduled chat with a colleague, for instance – can lead to knowledge-sharing and collaborative problem-solving. That’s difficult to replicate in a virtual environment, which often relies on advance scheduling for online meetings – although that’s still feasible with enough planning and communication.
But if you look at different metrics, in-office work loses out to working from home. My recent research discovered remote workers report more productivity and enjoy working from home because of the flexibility, the ability to wear casual clothes, and the shortened or nonexistent commute time. Remote work also saves money. There is a significant cost savings for office space, one of the largest budget line items for organizations.
Hybrid arrangements attempt to combine the best of both worlds.
It’s not perfect
It’s true that hybrid work faces many of the same obstacles of face-to-face work. Poor planning and communication, ineffective or unnecessary meetings and confusion about task responsibilities happen remotely as well as in-person.
Perhaps the largest issue when working at home: technology and security concerns. Home networks, an easier target for cyberthreats, are typically more vulnerable than office networks. Remote workers are also more likely to share computers with someone else outside of their organization. Hybrid organizations must invest upfront to work through these complicated and often expensive issues.
With hybrid work, managers cannot see the work taking place. That means they must measure employee performance based on outcomes with clear performance metrics rather than the traditional focus on employee behavior.
Another potential pitfall: Fault lines can develop within hybrid teams – that is, misunderstandings or miscommunication between those in the office and those at home. These two groups may start to divide, potentially leading to tension and conflicts between them – an us-versus-them scenario.
Establishing a hybrid environment
Numerous recommendations exist on the best way to develop a hybrid model. Here are a few of the best ideas.
Meeting too often or with little purpose – that is, meeting for the sake of meeting – leads to fatigue and burnout. Not everyone needs to be at every meeting, yet finesse from management is required to make sure no one feels left out. And meeting-free days can help with productivity and allow employees a block of uninterrupted time to focus on complex projects.
Listening to employees is critical to making sure the hybrid environment is working. Continually seeking feedback, through one-on-one conversations, focus groups or human resources surveys, is important too. So is recognizing and rewarding employees with in-person or virtual kudos for their achievements. Performance incentives, such as financial rewards or tokens of appreciation including food delivery, help develop a supportive culture that increases employee commitment.
Finally: Both managers and employees must be transparent in their communication and understanding of hybrid plans. Policies must be in place to define what tasks happen in the office and remotely. Access to reliable communications is essential, particularly for remote work. All employees must receive the same information at the same time, and in a timely manner. After all, whether in the office or online, workers don’t want to feel they’re the last to know.

4 tips for startups in the booming plant-based dairy market,Carolina Lapa,2021/10/22,"
People care about climate change and animal welfare — so it’s no wonder the demand for plant-based products has exploded in the last couple of years. The alternative dairy market is expected to triple over the next decade, reaching a whopping $32 billion USD by 2031.
But what exactly is it that will determine success within this fast-growing industry? And what do startups need to know in order to attain partnerships with the corporates that can get their products on the map?
Well, in my experience, it all boils down to four key lessons — but let’s begin with outlining the research I’m basing this on before diving into each of them.
Getting to know the field
My team at TNW works with industry-leading companies and governments all over the globe looking to partner with or support small innovative businesses in expanding their reach. Two of our most interesting recent projects involved scouting plant-based dairy startups for industry leaders in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector.

My following insights derive mostly from working on this report, in which the TNW scouting and research team, along with nlmtd, mapped a couple of the most promising startup-corporate collaborations in the plant-based dairy space.
Of course, I recommend you check out the full report — it’s a thrilling read — but what we basically saw was that while the number of bets on plant-based startups has been growing, the bar remains pretty high for the adoption of these products on a large scale.
So, here are my four key insights for startups and scale-ups who want to attract the right partnerships to succeed in the alternative dairy market.
Tip #1: Nutrition is one, naturalness is two
What I heard a lot in my conversations with industry leaders was that nutrition and naturalness are often misunderstood by consumers and sometimes miscommunicated by startups. 
Claims that refer to the amount of a certain natural ingredient (for example, ‘this product is 35% almonds’) say very little about the level of naturalness of that food product. 
In fact, naturalness, as seen by FMCG leaders, has more to do with the content of artificial sweeteners or preservatives — as well as other elements.
A study conducted by Hero Group with the University of Murcia and ETH Zürich, published in 2017, provides a helpful three-part organization to define naturalness: 

If the origin of the food includes the use of organic raw material grown locally
If the production of the product is free from artificial ingredients, preservatives, additives, artificial colors and flavors, chemicals, hormones, pesticides, and GMOs
And finally, if the end product is healthy, eco-friendly, and fresh

Nutrition, on the other hand, is more straightforward. In dairy, it often relates to the protein content versus the levels of fat and sugar. While high protein amounts are highly desired, fat and sugar are unwished for. 
The balance between the three is really key if your aim is to impress nutrition experts in FMCG corporations. So if you want to woo partners, compensating the taste of your plant-based ingredient that is high in protein with loads of sugar might not be the best way forward.
Tip #2: Taste and texture as the gate-keepers of future demand
Another two criteria that FMCG corporations repeatedly brought up when discussing new plant-based dairy concepts were taste and texture. 
It didn’t matter whether we were talking about milk, yogurt, butter, cheese, or spreads — taste and texture cannot be left aside if the goal is to choose a product that consumers will change their diets for. 
While the untapped demand for plant-based products is big, the curiosity of consumers for product experimentation might not always be this high. 
Once a few players achieve in plant-based dairy what consumers are used to experiencing in traditional dairy products, the market will be theirs for the taking — or at least that is what industry leaders bet on.
Currently, the levels of taste and texture of plant-based dairy products vary a lot from product to product, and that is of course natural to the experimental and radically innovative period that the market is in. 
But when consumer preferences consolidate, a premium experience of taste and texture is going to make the difference between a successful and a forgotten plant-based dairy brand, especially when we talk about indulgent dairy products, such as flavored yogurts and cheese.
Tip #3: Cheese is the Holy Grail

Cheese alternatives are considered the next frontier in product development and plant-based innovation. 
The market of alternative milk and yogurt — either made from legumes, nuts, or grains; or developed in laboratories based on cells — is in a period of expansion and global adoption. The market for alternative cheese is growing alongside the new milk trend, but at the same time, it faces more scrutiny from traditional dairy and a level of skepticism from consumers.
For an ambitious startup, a challenge like that is just another word for a business opportunity. In fact, we can easily observe the huge appetite for entrepreneurship in the plant-based cheese category. 
The way things are set up now, to me it seems like startups in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia are working non-stop around the clock to find what is the best possible combination of ingredients and which process produces the tastiest plant-based cheese. So you better be quick if you want to beat them to it.

Tip #4: Online, transparent, and (better if) local
Sustainability, animal welfare, dietary requirements, healthy lifestyle. All of these are consumer trends that have been directly boosting the growth of the plant-based dairy industry. 
Complimentary to that, I also see trends of convenience, consumer ethics, and community-driven economics are expected to have a significant impact on the direction in which plant-based entrepreneurship moves.
Our scouting research and discussions with FMCG industry leaders indicate that the need for convenience and flexibility creates space for new product formats as well as business models. 
For example, consumers are already open to experimenting with subscription models, in which plant-based products such as oat and almond milk are delivered to their door at regular intervals of their choice. Another growing product offering is ready-to-go plant-based yogurts and milk bottles, a format already known by the traditional dairy industry.
But I also feel we can’t overlook the fact that consumers have a broader understanding of the impact their choices have on the prosperity of society, the environment, and the economy. 
Information and transparency are key for individuals to build trust in both new and traditional brands. This has led to a preference for plant-based products that openly share information about the sourcing of their ingredients, as well as production methods and impact across the value chain. 
Sure, established global brands may be far ahead when it comes to scale, expertise, and reach — but young companies can outshine them when it comes to connecting with consumers. 
So if your startup is aiming to make big waves in this space, I recommend you work with the local communities and wisely choose the source of your products. That way can stay ahead by being more in touch with what future generations really want.

How to say ‘no’ to your customers and still provide great service,Ana Gotter,2021/10/19,"
I’ve worked in customer-facing roles in the retail and hospitality industries, and now I’m a freelance writer. In all three roles, I quickly learned that there are plenty of times when the customer is most decidedly not always right.
But even when they’re dead wrong, what do you do?
As a service-based business owner, I pride myself on delivering exceptional customer service, and I’ve learned how to create a strong client experience while also standing my ground. Here are my tips for how to walk that fine line as a service provider.
1. Don’t fall for an ambush
In order to stand your ground, you need to be prepared. Being caught off guard is a one-way ticket to being taken advantage of.
Here’s an example. I had a contract to write some website copy. I followed all of the instructions (including vague and frankly strange ones like “write sexy like James Bond”). I got great feedback from the client, and the project was complete.
Then the client “wanted to talk.” They insisted on a phone call at a ridiculous hour and refused to talk by email. I woke up at 6 a.m. for the call, and they promptly informed me they’d been working with two copywriters at once — and they liked the other person’s copy more. Ok, no problem. Except they didn’t want to pay me what we’d agreed upon, even though I’d completed the work exactly as specified.
It was an ambush. I knew it then, but I was too flustered to do much about it. They demanded an answer right away, and because I was still building my client base, I wanted to be agreeable. I said yes, I would take a discounted rate, and walked away with only half of the amount I had rightfully earned.
It was a mistake: the correct and only answer was no — to the call initially and to the request of a discounted rate. We had a contract, I delivered, and I even got positive feedback. I hadn’t been participating in some competition; it was a job, and I did it.
Since then, I’ve had a few (now ex-) clients try to rattle me with last-minute calls or Zoom meetings to try to increase the scope of work without payment. I stick to email, and it prevents an ambush.
If you’re ever caught off guard, try saying something like: “Let me consider it, and I’ll get back to you through email later today.” Maybe you’ll decide they’re being reasonable — and that’s fine — but it puts you back in control of the decision.
2. Communicate standard policies upfront
If you communicate your policies right off the bat, you’ll have something really clear to point to when standing your ground, which makes it a lot less fuzzy.
For example, one of my standard policies is that my prices include one round of revisions that allows for up to 15% changes in the text. I made this policy because I had clients who would approve outlines and then ask for multiple rounds of edits that completely revamped the entire post — they didn’t know what they wanted, and even if they were well-intentioned, it ended up losing me money.
Sometimes clients still ask for multiple rounds of edits. But I stick to my policies and let them know we can either use the existing edit or I can charge more for additional revisions.
For your most important policies, I’d suggest reminding clients a couple of times: once when they first sign on and then again when you start your first “project” with them (for me, that’s when I submit my first draft).
3. Put everything in writing
I essentially run my entire business through email. There are a few reasons for that:

It’s convenient
It prevents those ambushes I mentioned earlier
Most significantly, it allows me to keep a record of all communications

There’s no confusion when I can literally point to what I or the client said in an email two months earlier. Even after client onboarding calls, I send a written summary of everything we discussed and ask the client to confirm that the details are correct.
Of course, if you’re in a situation where you need to show your clients that you’re right, do it delicately. Here’s my go-to response:
I completely understand where you’re coming from, but for reference, I’ve attached the original email where you approved having this blog post be 1,500 words. Please let me know if you have further questions.
No one can argue with that, so you’re able to protect yourself while ensuring the client that you’re not trying to pull the wool over their eyes.
4. Know your boundaries in advance
Boundaries are hard: in life, at an office job, and especially when you’re running a business. When I started my business, I had no boundaries. I felt like I couldn’t say no to anything — it cost me money and was terrible for my mental health.
When I realized what was happening, I realized I needed to officially set some boundaries. They didn’t have to be part of my standard client-facing policies, but I needed to write them down for myself and stick to them.
I started delineating what I would always say yes to (e.g., NDAs) and what I would always say no to (e.g., non-competes). This means:

I don’t get decision fatigue every time I’m faced with a client request that I’m not sure is fair — I just follow my own boundaries
I have a clear understanding for myself of what’s good for me and my business, and I don’t accidentally lose sight of that for edge cases

I had a client, for example, who emailed me because a post with my byline mentioned one of their competitors. That mention had been added by my editor — I had no idea what the client was even talking about.
They asked me to remove the mention. I said I couldn’t: my editor put it there, and I don’t own the content. They then asked me to sign a non-compete that would be “at our discretion at any point” for direct and indirect competitors. This was a client who hired me for 3% of my annual income, and they wanted almost full control over my client relationships.
I’d really liked working with this client, but I said no. It meant I lost the client. And it hit: it was right at the beginning of the pandemic. But I had a clear boundary I’d established for myself long ago — no non-competes — so I confidently knew that I was making the right choice.
It’s worth reviewing your boundaries (and your policies) every so often to be sure they’re still relevant and meaningful for the current stage of your business, but don’t do it so often that they’re no longer helping you stand your ground.
5. Remember that clients who walk aren’t a good fit
Not all clients will be a fit for your business — and if they aren’t, it will be almost impossible to deliver the experience they’re looking for.
If you have a potential client that’s trying to get you to do something that doesn’t align with your skills, your contract, your availability, or your agreed-upon deliverables after you’ve said no, walk away.
I had a client who requested more content than I had time for one month. I told them I could write two blog posts for them, but I wouldn’t be able to do the website copy they requested. They continued even after I’d said no, and even accused me of “letting greed block my blessings.” I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and explained how the site copy would take four times as long as the blog posts, but even then, they said I should cut my Christmas break short to make time.
That was the end of that client relationship — and that’s ok. Losing a client is never easy, but if it’s not a good fit, you’re better off for it.
More than 90% of all of the clients I’ve worked with as a freelance writer have been exceptional, and all of my long-retaining clients are a dream to work with. But there will always be clients with unreasonable expectations. Others will blatantly try to take advantage of you. And some will simply misremember or misunderstand something to the point where you risk a potential issue.
Knowing how to stand your ground — both proactively and after the fact — allows you to keep your business running smoothly while offering great customer service at the same time.

In defense of the sensible embargo: How tech startups can do PR right,Ayelet Noff,2021/10/18,"
There’s no denying it: the trusty embargo remains a positive and productive tool for professionals on both sides of the press-PR divide. If anything, embargoes have only become more important in recent years, and they’re certainly not going anywhere. 
Why? It’s simple. Virtually every industry that depends on new releases and new information to push its news cycle forward makes use of the embargo. This includes arts and entertainment, publishing, science and medicine, gaming, and, of course, tech.
Whether B2B or B2C, large corporation or startup, tech PR relies on embargos to manage constantly changing product release schedules and updates. This is an industry that likes to keep things under wraps — if not totally secret — until launch day, and that requires a dizzying amount of coordination, calendars, and planning to make happen. 
It also requires real relationships with journalists. It’s no secret that good ol’ fashioned human relationships are key to getting your story in front of the public — whether or not it’s embargoed. 
But simultaneously juggling multiple journalist relationships while preparing a big PR push comes with its own set of challenges. That’s where the embargo comes in.
Embargoes are valuable in part because they prevent inadvertent favoritism. Embargoes allow every journalist you pitch an opportunity to cover your news at the same time, meaning no publication feels like they’re starting in second place. 
Top-tier publications naturally want to publish first, but embargos make sure nothing is announced before it’s ready and that all journalists pitched have the same amount of time (and breathing room) to cover, no matter where they work.
Journalists will not only welcome your embargoed scoops, but cooperate with you if you treat them like actual people with specific beats and use only the embargos you absolutely need. When used correctly, embargos give the right journalists time to write the kind of coverage you want and do it well. 
Avoid opening a communication channel with a journalist you’ve never worked with before with an embargo. There’s no good way to soften the but-what-can-you-do-for-me implied in that kind of unsolicited introduction.
Learn to prioritize and personalize. In other words, know who you’re talking to. 

my favorite kind of PR emails are the ones telling me I’m under embargo for some information that I didn’t ask for and have no interest in knowing
— Dylan Hafer (@thedylanhafer) April 30, 2021

First things first: does the journalist you’re pitching accept embargos? If they do, they may want all the information up front, or they may prefer to get a quick primer before agreeing to anything. If you’re not sure, ask. Don’t guess.
No matter which publications you want to embargo, you should be mindful of the constraints of their editorial calendar. No dropping an embargo on a reporter two days before it lifts. Yours is never the only story a writer is working on, and 48 hours from embargoed press release to publication just isn’t going to cut it. 
It may also have the inadvertent effect of making you look both disorganized and inconsiderate of their time. Try two weeks instead.
Know when it’s news, know when it’s not
In my experience, startups sometimes struggle to distinguish between what is promotional and what is truly newsworthy. This is totally understandable, as it can be tricky to tell when new developments are happening quickly inside your business. 
It’s nonetheless a crucial distinction if you’re going to keep journalists on your side and not stuff their inboxes with unnecessary embargos.
Be considerate by being discerning and realistic. At its heart, the embargo is about keeping things quiet, so only embargo news items that are tied to a specific date and that journalists will need additional time to research and write. 
Nurturing your relationships with journalists means valuing their time and not treating every single item of your public-facing strategy as uniquely precious.
This means deciding what’s truly newsworthy rather than promotional, then only embargoing the most important newsworthy developments. This includes brand new models and launches, top-to-bottom software overhauls, and game-changing funding announcements with lots of zeros. 
High-profile partnerships that coincide with a previously unseen special edition version of your product? Sure. High-profile endorsements and big awards? Those are no doubt wonderful to have, but they land firmly in the promotional camp. 
Calling an embargo truce
It’s no accident that despite some determined detractors, the embargo has held on. Part of the reason for that is practical. Startups and tech businesses deal with time-sensitive information by nature, and an evolving effort to prevent leaks will always be part and parcel of this industry. 
The best communications people for tech startups and tech giants understand this, and public relations for any industry will always depend on relationships. 
That’s why a little courtesy works wonders when it comes to embargoes. Eager startups chomping at the bit can sometimes struggle to see the forest for the trees when trying to get the public excited about their story. Journalists, in turn, can (not unjustifiably) find startups’ public relations efforts a little too persistent or impersonal. 
Consider both sides of this coin when deciding what and who to embargo, and scrap the mass blast while you’re at it. It’s no PR industry secret that this strategy is the surefire way to get actual results, delivered when you want them, without making any enemies along the way.

When should you listen to investors? And when should you ignore them?,Már Másson Maack,2021/09/27,"
As a founder, you’re bombarded with tips and tricks on how to secure funding and woo potential investors… but what happens after that? What do you do with their advice? And what happens if you don’t agree with their suggestions?
That’s why I called up Heini Zachariassen, Vivino’s opinionated and vocal founder, who’s got tons of experience listening to — and not listening to — his investors to shed some light on this awkward little dilemma.
You’re the right person to lead the company
For Zachariassen, the most important thing to remember is that you landed a financial backer based on your vision and ideas: “Investors know that the best person to run a company is the founder. If they didn’t, they wouldn’t have invested in the first place.”
And it seems this philosophy has really paid off for Vivino. The platform, which emerged from Zachariassen’s simple frustration of not knowing which wine to buy, has now grown to a community of 50 million users. It’s also raised $221 million in funding and rolled out a global wine marketplace. 
You know your company best — that’s why Zachariassen believes you shouldn’t let investors get involved with details. 
“We have product and engineering teams that work all day and night on the product, so they are going to decide what that button is going to look like and what color it is. Not the investors. There’s a level of granularity here that’s important. Investors shouldn’t get operational because they’re simply not qualified to do so.
Heini Zachariassen, founder of Vivino and host of Raw Startup.
Be careful though, this doesn’t give you a blank cheque to do whatever you want and just ignore your investors. Sure, in the early stages of Vivino, Zachariassen and his co-founder Theis Søndergaard fought investors to postpone their demands for profitability in order to secure the market. But in later stages, he followed one of the most seismic suggestions from his investors: moving to Silicon Valley.
This was a big change that reached far beyond just the scope of the startup. It meant Zachariassen had to uproot his entire family and all the challenges that come with that (there’s actually a whole documentary on this journey on Amazon Prime Video). But this was a big-picture suggestion from investors that Zachariassen could get on board with, as the connection between being based there and winning the US market was clear.








So you should sometimes listen to investors… and sometimes not? That doesn’t sound particularly helpful. 
Don’t worry though, Zachariassen breaks down his approach to listening to investor feedback. The first point is to be aware of is at what stage the investor joined. The second, investors will eventually ‘pull rank’ — but when they do, confirm that’s really what they’re doing and then deal with it accordingly.

Angels aren’t divine
“Getting angel investors can be a bit of a minefield. It’s the point where you have the biggest risk of getting someone on board that’s… really shit. The further you go up the chain, usually the better investors you get. That’s at least my experience,” says Zachariassen.
Of course, Zachariassen isn’t denying how important angel investors are to founders — he’s even made a whole video about how to attract them on his YouTube channel, Raw Startup. 








Instead, he wants to point out the simple fact that at this stage in your startup’s journey, you’re unlikely to attract specialized investors. And because these angels aren’t professional investors, they might be more prone to pushing for making returns quickly — rather than focusing on long-term growth and pay-off. 
“The solution is just making sure you get new investors in that are more ambitious all the time. Then you can keep postponing major shifts until you get people on board who are aligned with you,” Zachariassen recommends. 
The best situation would be to get the perfect investors on board early… but you usually don’t have the luxury to decide that kind of stuff. So be open to angel investors’ input, but try to kick the can down the road until you’ve got experts on board. 
But should you then do everything bigger investors say?
The great thing about bigger venture funds is they think, uhm, bigger. Zachariassen really enjoys working with VCs like Balderton as they’ve seen multiple companies they’ve invested in become unicorns.
“They know if we do this right and keep going, this could also become a unicorn,” says Zachariassen. “But that doesn’t mean they say you should do a particular thing. A good investor doesn’t do that.”
Zachariassen actually just finished a script for his next YouTube video which goes into the six signs of bad investors, and getting too operational is definitely one of the cardinal sins. 
“Good investors will nudge and say things like ‘have you thought about this?’ And provide examples from other portfolio companies. They should never tell you what to do, but they should definitely influence your direction.”
Sounds good enough, but what happens when an investor you’ve already committed to working with puts their foot down? 
“When it comes to the later stages — or actually as early as A and B rounds — the truth is that most of these people are really fucking good,” Zachariassen emphasizes. “They’ll rarely say to you ‘I’ve seen this 100 times, you’re doing it wrong,’ but they will use that card at some point. And when they do, they’re usually right.”
But there’s an important caveat here: you shouldn’t fold as soon as you hear a partner or a fund say that. Zachariassen says you should always push back if that’s your conviction, to make it absolutely clear that the investor is indeed pulling rank. Because once you do, you know it’s serious enough to listen to.
“Founders always say the same thing, ‘yeah you’re right, but we’re different.’ You always think you’re so fucking special, but maybe you’re not. Certain things are just the same no matter what.”
So be careful of letting angel investors dictate your strategy, especially when they’re not thinking big enough. Then find smart, experienced investors to nudge you in the right direction and when they play the ‘I know better than you card’ — confirm that they are, then fucking listen.

"Dear Venture Capitalists, you can help save the world — by investing in carbon neutral startups",Cate Lawrence,2021/09/24,"
Did you know SHIFT is taking the stage on Sept 30 and Oct 1? Together with an amazing line-up of experts, we will explore the future of mobility during TNW Conference 2021. Secure your ticket now!
Technology is evolving faster than ever before. It creates the opportunity for new products, business models, and bringing products more quickly to market. But what does it mean for industries such as mobility and energy? I spoke to Girish Nadkarni, the CEO of TotalEnergies Ventures, to find out.
TotalEnergies  Ventures focuses on finding, funding, and fostering high-potential startups that will create a low carbon future. This encompasses areas such as renewables, distributed energy, new mobility, energy access, energy storage, bio-plastics and recycling, AI, and IoT.
The challenges for B2B startups in the Venture Capital space
According to Nadkarni, success in the B2B space is markedly different from B2C.
In the B2B industrial space, it’s not just that technology takes time to develop. It’s a sector characterized by long development and sales cycles. In the B2C world, within nine to 18 you know whether or not you will be successful.
Industrial B2B startups disrupt large established companies, and traditional industries like utilities and manufacturing. They often focus on internal transformation or introducing new products to mission-critical functions and tasks. Therefore, startups need experience in the industries they aim to disrupt and support from a solid network to open doors. 
TotalEnergies Ventures focuses on later-stage investments. Nadkarni explains:
There are three risks that startups face: technology, market, and financing. So we say, ‘Okay, show us that you have customers willing to pay.’ We have a business development team, which works with our portfolio companies, and we address the barriers to success, make sure they talk to the right people.
Over the last couple of years, TotalEnergies Ventures have negotiated 25 different pilot projects and agreements and has another 55 under negotiation. According to Nadkarni:
We are making sure that we are not just a passive investor but a value-added partner.
Venture investment in companies like ChargeTrip unlocks the potential of electric mobility.
Failure and barriers to innovation
Nadkarni sees failure as part of progress for startups as it provides a learning opportunity. He notes that:
Sometimes you thought the project through only at a very superficial level, so the crucial success factors are not in place yet. Maybe the infrastructure is not there yet. Or sometimes, you’re applying an old mindset to new technology.
His favorite example is when desktop computers first came to people’s homes:
“People said, ‘Oh, now I can store my recipes conveniently.’ Well, yes, you can, but that’s not leveraging the power of the computer.”
In technology, being too early is sometimes the same thing as being wrong. Nadkarni explains:
A company called General Magic actually designed the functional equivalent of an iPad. The only problem was, they were five years too early. The processors didn’t go that fast. Touchscreen technology was not that good. The cables and the cellular connections weren’t great. So now they had everything that was sufficient, but not everything that was necessary.”
The future of venture capital is green energy 
Venture capital support accelerates carbon dioxide recycling efforts by B2B startups like Deep Branch.
Total Energies is a founding member of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, a CEO-led initiative that aims to accelerate the industry response to climate change. Nadkarni has a significant interest in hydrogen infrastructure and is leading an initiative with Air Liquide to raise a 1.5 BEUR clean hydrogen infrastructure fund. He notes:
The point of the fund is to kick start the hydrogen ecosystem and not just let’s find the best investments. We realize that there are many players just waiting in the wings for somebody to start the race. So what we want to address is the major sectors such as mobility and generation of green hydrogen. Regarding mobility, it’s about avoiding the chicken and egg problem by picking a territory at a time, and then funding the acquisition of the truck fleets and setting up all the hydrogen refueling stations at the same time.
Nadkarni assets that large companies are recognizing the need to get lower their carbon emissions:
There is pressure from regulators and reporting requirements. There’s pressure from investors. Incentives increase through governments offering subsidies. Additionally, younger consumers are becoming more aware. Even if it’s more expensive, companies like Tesco and Stella McCartney will pay more for bio-plastics. All the stakeholders are putting pressure. So there is no place to escape.

I don’t do meetings on Fridays — here’s why you shouldn’t either,Denya Beaudry,2021/09/17,"
Sometimes the smallest change can make a big difference for your mental health. For me, it’s keeping Friday completely clear of meetings.
I’m a manager at Zapier. I work on the success team, which means I need to have time to take care of my customers and my direct reports, all while getting through all the other work I need to do.
It’s… a lot.
And I’m not alone. I’ve talked with other managers here, and they feel the same way. It’s easy for scheduled meetings and calls to multiply until they take up every moment, and at that point, necessary work is going to fall through the cracks.
There are many solutions for this, but what’s working for me right now is to block out one day of the week on my calendar to be fully free of meetings. That day is Friday — here’s why, and how it’s working out for me.
Why Friday?
My work tends to build up and snowball throughout the week. You know how it is: you plan on working on something, then something else comes up. That happens to me several times a week, meaning there are all kinds of things on my to-do list I never quite get to.
That’s why meeting-free Friday is so great. First of all: I look forward to this day all week. It’s like a reward for getting through all of my calls.
But meeting-free Friday also gives me a chance to catch up on everything I dropped throughout the week. I’ve been trying this for a while, and I have to tell you: I’m much more productive on Fridays now. I consistently clear my to-do list.
That, in turn, makes my weekends better. I got everything done, so there’s no list in my head of things I’ll need to do Monday morning. This is a big part of the mental health benefit — my downtime is more relaxing now.
Like I said: it’s a small thing, but the benefits are huge.
How to set up your own meeting-free day
If you want to try something similar, don’t overthink it. Block out one day a week during which you won’t have any meetings, then stick to it. Let your coworkers know you’re doing everything possible to avoid meetings on that day.
If you work at a company that uses shared calendars, mark yourself busy on your meeting-free day. Here’s how that looks on my calendar:
Credit: ZapierYou could even use Google Calendar’s out-of-office feature to automatically reject meeting requests on that day, but that’s an extreme measure.
I fully endorse having a meeting-free day on your calendars — it’s a 10/10 strategy. I don’t know if I can ever go back.

The problem with looking happy at work,Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten,2021/09/16,"
Boris is the wise ol’ founder of TNW who writes a weekly column on everything about being an entrepreneur in tech — from managing stress to embracing awkwardness. You can get his musings straight to your inbox by signing up for his newsletter!
There’s a Seinfeld episode where George explains how he ‘works’ without actually doing anything. When Elaine and Jerry ask him how he gets away with doing nothing, he shares his simple trick: look serious and annoyed, and people will assume you’re busy.
We then see a few scenes of George looking angry, shaking his head, and mumbling as he paces around the office, while his coworkers treat his dedication with great reverence.
Not a bad tactic, George, although I completely disagree with it.

I recently met up with a friend over drinks and vented about a stressful project I was dealing with. I was slightly more open about my feelings than usual and at one point he remarked: “Wow, you always look and act so happy that I never realized you would feel stressed too.”
I was surprised for a moment and also oddly proud that I could hide my feelings well, but also aware of the cons of this tendency. There have been moments in the past where I’ve literally had to tell people, “don’t mistake my kindness for weakness.”
I’m a friendly fellow, which sometimes gives people the false impression that it means I’m also gullible or easy to take advantage of. So I guess it’s time I’ll have to add another warning to my collection, “just because I’m smiling doesn’t mean I’m not serious.”
I wish I wouldn’t have to do that, but it seems George was right about how people perceive ‘doing business.’
For me though, I’ve always believed in doing it with a smile, in being optimistic, and in acting friendly. The upsides of that are probably obvious, but the downsides are that we do think people have to look annoyed or brooding to be serious and think deeply about important things… while people who smile a lot must be a bit dumb.
I think that’s why it can seem attractive to some people to act more concerned or say they’re stressed about certain projects as it’s the only way we know how to interpret importance. And it’s understandable, as you’re not really allowed to deviate from that path.
If someone asks you how you’re doing and you say ‘great!’ with a smile, they might think you’re crazy. Haven’t you read the news? The world is going to shit! So why aren’t we all depressed?
Maybe that’s a fair question. In the face of doom, in the middle of a crisis, and with an uncertain future, it would be easy to lose your faith and stay optimistic. But there are people, more than you think, who are naturally optimistic and perk up when a challenge is presented.
They’ll smile comfortingly when you cry. They puff their chests up and laugh in the face of evil. They might go down in flames along with everyone else, but they’ll do it proudly and optimistically — and I feel that’s completely fine.
You shouldn’t need to act like George Costanza to be taken seriously at your job. You can be serious and dedicated while smiling and be quick to laugh. You don’t need to fake unhappiness to show you care about important issues — you should just be yourself.

What Spotify’s mess (and its clean up) can teach startups about long-term brand thinking,Claire Huxley,2021/09/14,"
Did you know Growth Quarters is taking the stage this fall? Together with an amazing line-up of experts, we will share key insights into entrepreneurship during TNW Conference 2021. Secure your ticket now!
Former Spotify boss Jim Andersen caused a stir earlier this year when comments surfaced that reignited the debate about the streaming platform’s motivations.
In his words: “Spotify was created to solve a problem. The problem was to overcome piracy and get artists’ music out there. The problem was not to pay people money.”
Unsurprisingly, this wasn’t well-received. The feedback was swift and sharp, with commentators across the board slamming Spotify’s attitude as harmful to artists and the music industry at large.
And yet, was this backlash fully deserved? A glance at Spotify’s website suggests that its current leadership are singing a very different tune to their former colleague. 
The company’s mission in 2021 is “to unlock the potential of human creativity.” This is accompanied by a list of commitments that Spotify is making, such as equipping artists with the data and training to maximize their streams and earnings on Spotify. In other words, to get artists’ music out there, and to pay them money.
So what’s at play here? Is Andersen a cynic, or is Spotify trying to tape over reality? I’d argue the answer lies somewhere in between. Let’s take a look how Spotify’s ‘mess’ and its solution serves as a useful blueprint for any startup on the road to scaling into a long-term, much-loved brand.
Laying a roadmap
From easily ordering take-out to seamlessly splitting bills, many of the apps we use every day were created with a singular “solve” in mind. And often, this singular fixation is a core factor in success. 
But, as any seasoned founder knows, for every problem solved, another 99 can pop up in its place. And without a clear overarching vision for how to respond, growth can quickly be derailed.
Take Uber. For years its team was driven by a singular cause: build an app that makes hailing cabs easier. What they didn’t anticipate, was that realizing this goal would trigger up a new series of challenges. 
Regulatory restrictions, passenger safety, drivers’ rights, disenchanted employees; suddenly, a simple “solve” didn’t seem so simple. And without a clearly defined brand strategy to help focus and communicate their efforts, Uber found itself at risk of grinding to a halt.
Uber’s challenges represent those faced by many startups when they pursue product development without engaging in long-term brand thinking. Defining a brand is about much more than choosing a logo; it’s about establishing clear and coherent principles that direct everything a business does, today and tomorrow.
Shift perceptions
What Spotify has done right is adapt its approach — moving beyond the simplistic technological approach so awkwardly put by its former chief.
 When Spotify speaks about “unlocking the potential of human creativity,” they aren’t trying to distract people from the streaming solution they once were. Rather, they’re setting their sights on everything they want to be tomorrow.
By broadening its focus to creativity and putting an emotional need at the heart of its mission, Spotify has a more widely applicable and emotionally appealing organizing principle than a pure technical solve. The brand can position itself as engaging with users and artists in a way that a functional piracy-fighting platform would struggle to do. 
Engagements like the Year Unwrapped round up – in which Spotify puts users at the heart of their own story by celebrating their listening habits – and the Loud And Clear resource for artists are an example of putting this emotional promise into action. 
Not only do initiatives like this help win brand loyalty by humanizing Spotify beyond a functional faceless tech platform, they also differentiate the brand from other competitors: anyone can create a new streaming platform, few can replicate strong brand love.  
Spark innovation
By defining their brand in terms of unlocking creativity, Spotify gives themselves a license to play far beyond the confines of a specific product, platform – or even industry. To quote CEO Daniel Ek’s response when he was asked about the competitors that concern him: 
I am looking at Fortnite, or Minecraft, or Roblox. All forms of media and entertainment is minutes that could have been spent listening to audio instead.
The inference is clear: to Spotify, “creativity” doesn’t stop at streaming songs – it encompasses all forms of self-expression. And viewed through this lens, the businesses’ potential for innovation is enormous. Whether by offering artist-controlled tiers of access, experimenting with forms of visual media, or even dipping a toe into NFTs, the opportunities go far beyond music.
Spotify’s past might have been to solve a single issue, but thanks to a bit of long-term brand thinking, its future is multi-faceted.

Forget ‘networking’ — just connect with people you find interesting,Justin Pot,2021/09/13,"
Did you know Growth Quarters is taking the stage this fall? Together with an amazing line-up of experts, we will share key insights into entrepreneurship during TNW Conference 2021. Secure your ticket now!
The idea of networking makes me cringe. Here’s the thing, though: I actually love connecting with people, and that enthusiasm works out for me professionally. I was referred to my job at Zapier because of a friend I made on Twitter, and the job before this was the same way. That’s networking.
Now, I didn’t reach out because I wanted a job. I reached out because I thought the people in question were interesting and doing admirable work. I wanted to talk with them…so I did. Connecting with people on those terms doesn’t feel cringey to me because it isn’t. It’s human.
People are more important than your career, but that doesn’t mean your career doesn’t matter. So if you struggle with networking, don’t make connections — make friends. Actual, human friends.
How to connect with people online without being a creep
I’m a writer. My background is in technology journalism, mostly on the service journalism side, and Twitter is the main place I connect with other writers. I follow writers I admire, occasionally respond to their messages, and become close with them over time. We help each other find work. If someone’s in town, we’ll hang out. It’s nice.
Connecting with people improves your life, but it’s hard, especially online. If you don’t know how to start, you might think that you’re being a huge creep. You’re not. I’ve written about how to small talk while working remotely, and the general principles are the same on just about any social network. Here are a few tips:

Compliment people’s work. Very few people take the time to reach out when they like one of my articles, and the people who do make my day. I bet it’s the same in most industries. If you admire what someone does, tell them. It’s not weird — it’s the best. Just don’t be transactional about it.
Don’t compliment people’s appearance. In the immortal words of the best account on Twitter: THIS ? IS ? NOT ? A ? DATING ? SITE ?. Seriously, though — compliment people on the things they do and create, not their physical attributes. The first thing is kind; the second is bordering on illegal. This is not particularly complicated.
Respond to questions. People post questions on social networks because they want to start a conversation. Take that opening, say something insightful, and follow up if the conversation starts flowing.
Don’t insert yourself into conversations. Sometimes a stranger will follow me on Twitter and immediately join a conversation between me and one of my friends (who they also don’t know). This is uncomfortable — don’t do it. Get to know one person, or ideally both people, before inserting yourself into conversations.
Be funny. Humor is the single greatest tool for connecting with others. If you spot an opportunity to be funny and think the person would enjoy it based on what you’ve learned about them, go for it.
But don’t force humor. If you don’t know someone’s vibe, you don’t know what they find funny. Lurk for a while, then respond when you have a feel for their sense of humor.
Bring up interesting information. Knowledge is cool, links to read are great, and sharing it makes the internet a better place. If someone shares something interesting, share something similar you think they’ll like. That way there’s more interesting stuff, which is great.
Don’t argue with people you barely know. Rule: if you have the urge to begin a message with “Well, actually,” consider instead throwing your phone into a volcano. You might love arguing…that’s great. Not everyone does, and the internet is exhausting enough. Don’t try to connect with someone by telling them they’re wrong — it doesn’t work.

In summary: try to be a good hang.
If you add to the conversation, and make using the internet better, people will like having you around online. If you make life worse, they won’t. Over time, you’ll find yourself in online friendships, which are actually just friendships.
Connect with people, then connect them to each other
I’m an immigrant — at least, I’m an immigrant if you consider Canadians who move to the United States immigrants. At one point, a fellow immigrant — this one from Russia — asked me how one goes about getting jobs in America. Specifically, jobs in tech.
I had no idea how to answer that question. First of all, while I work in tech, I hardly took a traditional path. I went from journalism to IT to tutorial writing to somehow writing about my feelings and calling it content marketing. I couldn’t help anyone recreate my career trajectory if I wanted to.
So I said what I’d say to anyone: connect with people. Go to meetups. Hang out with people online. Don’t do this with the expectation of getting a job; do this because talking to people is great, and talking to people interested in the same things as you is even better.
Then, when you need help, ask. I sincerely enjoy connecting friends who are looking for jobs with friends who are trying to hire. I promise your friends will feel the same way. This isn’t why you should connect with people — that’s a terrible way to live. But your career, and everything else about your life, will be better if you connect with people, online or off.

Play to your strengths and DON’T forget them,Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten,2021/09/9,"
Boris is the wise ol’ founder of TNW who writes a weekly column on everything about being an entrepreneur in tech — from managing stress to embracing awkwardness. You can get his musings straight to your inbox by signing up for his newsletter!
Wow, this has been an exciting week! On Monday, I announced I would transition into a new role at TNW and introduced our new CEO. You can read all about it in the official announcement here.
Of course, I didn’t come to this decision overnight. I’ve been TNW’s CEO for 15 years and thought about this meticulously before acting on it. Big decisions mean spending ‘big’ time pondering them.
But what I didn’t expect was how much time I’d need to just decide how to break the news.
Myrthe (TNW’s amazing new CEO and former COO) and I had so many discussions on if, how, and when would be a perfect moment to make this announcement.
In the end, we got to a decent draft announcing the change… but it stayed a draft for quite a while.
There were just so many things we had to organize in terms of workflow, internal organization, et cetera, et cetera, that the announcement kept getting deprioritized. I mean, surely a simple announcement can’t be that important?
Then, last week, it was finally time. Everything was in place and now we only had to push out the announcement post. But as I read it, something didn’t feel right.

Then it dawned on me. I’d been trying so hard to write a ‘standard press release’ and doing things like you’re ‘supposed to do’ that I’d failed to use TNW’s greatest strength.
For the last 15 years, one of the things we’ve always tried to do is NOT using the standard format for anything.
When we first started organizing events, we didn’t look at other events. We just organized a conference that we thought was interesting, and we ignored all the rules and what was generally accepted common practice. And I, who’s been CEO that whole time, forgot!
So when I realized this, I stopped laboring over a ‘press release’ and switched to writing a story — just as if it was this newsletter. That resulted in the fun little article you can now read on TNW.
Before we published it though, we also realized we didn’t have a good photo of me and Myrthe together.
So we checked our calendars to find a moment to get a photographer in for an official portrait and… starting to sound a bit like how things are ‘meant to be done,’ right?
Luckily, it didn’t work out. So we had to improvise.
I suggested taking a photo that looked like it was made in a photo booth at the train station. The advantage, I thought, would be that the images wouldn’t have to be high quality in themselves and could even be slightly blurry and black and white.
And since those photos always come in fours, we wouldn’t have to worry about finding the ‘perfect’ shot — we’d just combine four funny photos into one.
I found a room with a curtain, and then we asked the first person who walked by to take photos on my iPhone. All-in-all, the photoshoot took about 15 minutes, and we had a lot of fun thinking of different combinations; and had a nice symbolic last photo with Myrthe pushing me out of the picture.
I guess this announcement was one of the final ‘important things’ I did as a CEO, and it felt terrific to do it the TNW way. It also shows that you can achieve a lot with some creativity, defiance of the rules, and enthusiasm. And that you need to keep reminding yourself of it.
That’s certainly how I look back on the past 15 years as CEO of TNW.

P.S. Don’t worry about the title change, I’ll still write my newsletter! So until next week!

"No, I don’t want to grow my business",Evelyn Johnson,2021/09/9,"
Did you know Growth Quarters is taking the stage this fall? Together with an amazing line-up of experts, we will share key insights into entrepreneurship during TNW Conference 2021. Secure your ticket now!
Whenever I discuss my startup with someone, I get asked how I am going to “scale” my business. My usual response is that I am happy with its current size and don’t plan on expanding. The looks I get after this exchange make it seem like I’ve either badmouthed a universally loved celebrity or confessed to a horrible crime. 
Let me give you some background; I run an affiliate marketing business with my husband. We have four employees. We promote online coupons of different e-commerce sites on search engines and receive a commission every time a customer redeems it. 
It’s a small gig. It’s relatively simple. And it’s been this way for nearly five years now. Perhaps it’s the last bit that annoys a lot of my peers the most. 
Five years is a long time for a startup. I should be looking to expand, go public like some of my competitors, or even more ambitiously — eyeing the cover of the Forbes magazine. 
But I want none of these things and I will tell you why.
I like my tiny company
Business owners are obsessed with growth. But not a gradual growth that companies usually experience. They want to SCALE FAST. This sentiment has given birth to an army of influencers with each one promising to have a secret scaling formula through their clickbait articles. 
But is it necessary to relentlessly pursue growth? I would argue otherwise. Now, I will not go all philosophical or give you a lecture on minimalism. Instead, I will make a simple argument:
Organizations become much more complex as they scale. Ultimately, you would have to hire more employees, work with freelancers, and partner with other businesses. Some of this would require you to give up personal control. 
As someone who has worked in major corporations and dealt with ridiculously complex hierarchies, I would never want my company to transform into something similar. More importantly, I don’t want a “Chief Identity Consultant” walking around my office without knowing what their job is and why I hired this person in the first place. 
The little workforce I have performs exceptionally well. I know what each employee brings to the table. This isn’t remotely possible with a big workforce. 
I get to help out other businesses
Most entrepreneurs want to be a force for good. We hope to bring about a positive change through our ventures even though the scale of this change might be different. 
Admittedly, I am not one of those geniuses that are revolutionizing medicine or creating sustainable energy solutions. But my business model allows me to do something for the community.
As I explained before, I do work in the e-commerce space but don’t sell anything of my own. Instead, my website promotes coupons and promo codes of different online stores. It’s a form of affiliate marketing that has gained significant traction in recent years. 
With the current status of my business, I can promote small businesses, particularly those run by women and minorities. We can prioritize these companies and even be lax when it comes to commissions.
Scaling would require us to put money at the forefront and work with industry leaders. In other words, it would suck the soul out of my business. 
I get to better rather than bigger
Whenever I explain my nefarious plan of not scaling, one question is constantly thrown my way; “How do you stay motivated?” The answer is simple; I am striving to make my company better and not bigger. There is a difference between the two. 
Bigger businesses don’t necessarily provide the best of services. They’re just able to reach more people and able to serve a larger clientele. 
What I hope to create is a business that is efficient, innovative, and above all, able to manufacture impactful solutions. These solutions might not reach everyone but that’s beside the point. Getting this right will reflect well on the bottom line as it has for me in the last five years. 
If my business grows as a by-product of this then I wouldn’t go out of my way to stop that. However, growth is and will never be the ultimate objective for me.
I make enough money
I know what you’d be thinking; “enough money? ENOUGH MONEY?”THERE’S NO SUCH THING. You’re either in it to kick Jeff Bezos off the top or you can pack your stuff and go home.”
Once again, I would like to provide a different perspective. Money is a great thing. It’s the primary reason we do this business. It pays the bill and lets us buy cereals for our kids. 
However, there’s a point at which money becomes an obsession. You start valuing your work through a number and not before long, it’s all about increasing this number at the cost of your health and personal well-being. 
My husband and I have a specific income target for each month. Other than the office rent, employee salaries, and our personal expenses, the amount needs to be enough for us to save for the future and take a nice trip to Tahiti every once in a while. There’s no point in working our backsides off for more. 
But hey, that’s just my opinion
I will leave this little disclaimer at the end; this is just my opinion. Different entrepreneurs have different motivations. If you’re someone that’s looking to scale then that’s completely fine. I don’t look down on you and wish you nothing but the best. 
What I wish to explain is that business owners who choose to stay small are neither lazy nor uninspired. They are simply motivated by things other than growth. 
Businesses CAN choose to stay small and there’s nothing wrong with that. So if you’re happy running a small gig; find comfort in knowing that there’s more of us out there.

Your startup must begin climate action TODAY — here’s how,Már Másson Maack,2021/09/7,"
We all know mitigating the climate crisis is important… but it’s still weirdly easy to push any action to ‘tomorrow’ — especially if you’re a founder stuck in the daily chores of keeping a startup running. 
But you and I both know you need the push to act today. Not only to save the planet (this big round thing we live on), but also to make sure your business will survive.
That’s why I spoke to Tom Raftery, SAP’s Global Vice President and its Futurist & Innovation Evangelist, who’s made it his mission to inspire organizations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions before it’s too late. 
Raftery has suggestions for what you can do right this second, next few weeks, and before the end of this year. But first, let’s get into why exactly you’ve got to get started on your startup’s climate action — even if you’re fully digital. 
Bunch of laws are coming, stay ahead of them
Raftery, who’s speaking at the upcoming TNW Conference 2021, is well aware of the financial pressures startups and bigger organizations face when it comes to decision-making. But if you apply logical thinking, you’ll see the cost of emissions is way higher than the money you may save in the short term.
First up, legal troubles. Raftery says a whole host of climate legislation is coming worldwide and points specifically to the EU’s goal to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030. 
“I know 2030 sounds like a long way away, but it’s only about eight years. It’s as far away as 2013 is now,” Raftery warns and predicts the actual pressure will be felt much sooner.

“We’re going to get to 2025 when politicians around the EU will realize ‘uh oh, we’ve only got four or five years left and we’re nowhere near where we need to be.’ So there’s going to be a scramble.”
Bigger companies will have to start officially reporting on their sustainability in 2024, but Raftery believes it’s good for startups to begin preparing. Of course, the carbon footprint of individual startups is minuscule compared to larger corporations, but collectively startups make up almost 80% of the economy, making them a prime target for government climate policies.
So sooner or later, every single business will have to have rigorous reporting on its carbon footprint — no matter the field they’re in.
Oh, and it’ll also help with recruiting
“Startups don’t only need to act because there’s more of them, they also need to take action for recruitment and retention of employees,” says Raftery. 
As any good (and maybe even bad?) business leader knows, it costs a lot to find, hire, and train a new employee. So if they leave within a year, you’re looking at a lot of sunk cost. But what exactly does this have to do with climate action?
“Having a good climate and sustainability story to tell makes people proud to work for you. And therefore, that helps with your recruitment and retention. It also helps attract customers,” says Raftery.
And by “having a story,” Raftery doesn’t mean you can just have your marketing department churn out some greenwashing phrases. No, a climate story is about being able to point out the specific actions you take and how it relates to your company’s mission.
So let’s get into what exactly you can do to create your authentic climate story.

Right this second: Contact your energy provider
“Switch to an energy provider that gives you 100% renewable energy,” says Raftery. “Changing your electricity to clean energy gets rid of a huge amount of emissions instantaneously. It really is the low-hanging fruit of climate action.”
It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes to find the most climate-friendly energy provider, but it’ll pay off for years to come as it’ll make the rest of your journey that much easier. 
How? Well, once you’ve made your utilities are powered by clean energy, you should work towards electrifying all your energy consumption — whether it’s removing the gas stove in the office kitchen or updating your car fleet with EVs. This will make all future climate reporting easier as you’ll have a single central point of measurement.
Next few weeks: Change who’s responsible for your climate action
Raftery says reporting will only become more rigorous from now on, so it’ll affect companies’ bottom line even more. “This is why it needs to fall under the CFO’s organization.” 
A company’s climate action will soon be reported the same way as financials are — through yearly or even quarterly ESG reports — so it’s only logical to make it the responsibility of your CFO. 
The sooner you make the mental shift internally that climate action and sustainability do belong with the CFO, the better your chances become to grow. 
“The investment community will be monitoring this,” explains Raftery. “People whose ESG reporting is deemed to be good will have easier and cheaper access to capital. Poor ESG reporting will be seen as a more risky investment proposition. So the cost of capital for them will be significantly higher — if they can get it at all — and that will also obviously impact their share price.”
Before the end of this year: Start reporting diligently 
Once you’ve made it clear that climate action and sustainability reporting are the responsibilities of your CFO, it’s time to start producing actual ESG reports… or at least lay the groundwork if your team is small.
“For example, for any RFPs [request for propals] going out, mention that you want the emissions associated with those products and services included in the response. That will start putting people on notice,” says Raftery, who encourages businesses to work with their suppliers to make this shift.
He also adds that if you’re a startup servicing bigger corporations, you’ll have to be especially quick to adjust. It doesn’t matter if your startup isn’t big enough to fall under the EU’s reporting mandate, as your clients will ask for detailed emission reporting for their own ESG reports.
Use your agility to save the planet and flourish
The most immediate pressure for climate action and reporting will be on bigger corporations, but it never hurts to be prepared. It can take a couple of years for cumbersome corporates to redefine their processes and priorities, but you can avoid all that hassle by setting a climate-friendly agenda from day one. 
The next time you think “I’d love to work on my startup’s climate action, I just don’t have the time,” remind yourself that the hammer of the law is coming down just a couple of years from now and your clients and employees care about the planet. So you might want to make it your priority.

Get a bigger exit: Build your executive team’s personal brand,Randy Baker,2021/08/30,"
Did you know Growth Quarters is taking the stage this fall? Together with an amazing line-up of experts, we will share key insights into entrepreneurship during TNW Conference 2021. Secure your ticket now!
It’s pretty likely you’re able to pull up an anecdote about the life of a top entrepreneur without much effort. From Bill Gates’ divorce proceedings to Elon Musk’s opinion on crypto and Richard Branson’s love for kitesurfing, there’s no doubt that high-level executives are now expected to be public figures.
More than ever, it’s people – not companies – moving the world of business forward. 
There is a reason why a February 2021 Harris Poll indicates that 85% of Americans believe that CEO reputation significantly impacts the perception and valuation of a company. Teams aren’t merely the people behind the face of the product anymore; they become the faces themselves.
We all like to be liked; it makes us feel good… but apart from that, it’s extremely good for business. In fact, VCs deem the founding management team to be even more important than a startup’s business model, according to HBR. 
The average value of an exit is $242.9 million.
Let me show you how to utilize executive branding to achieve this and possibly much more.
Mine reputational capital
Working with founders every day, it still dumbfounds me that leveraging the reputational capital of the executive team remains a highly underutilized technique for a better exit. 
Whether you like it or not, there’s immense value in letting customers, investors, stakeholders, and even current and future employees peek behind the curtain and learn about the personalities representing the company.
After all, following the year of uncertainty that fully tested leadership, people have become far more sensitive to what company executives stand for. 
Remember when a decade ago, the ultimate flex was having your brand name printed on a t-shirt? Today, that’s nowhere near as important as actually having that t-shirt made from sustainable materials. 
In our interconnected society, everyone can form an opinion of what the world should look like and what the role of their companies is in that process. Branded products are great to boost team spirit, but won’t get you very far in terms of your sales goals. 
Consumers are highly aware of the power of their dollar and won’t think twice about opting for a competitor with ethics or values that better connect with theirs.
Half of investors already use digital platforms to learn what CEOs are saying. But it’s not enough to stop there. If your team has a CFO, COO, and CMO, they should all invest in building up their personal authority platforms. 
A team that not only works but also lives your mission and vision lifts the visibility of your company and makes you more attractive to potential investors. 
Only you know how to be you
Here, let me borrow the words of Tom Peters, a prominent business management author: 
To be in business today, our most important job is to be head marketers for the brand called You.
So, remember that your personal reputation is equally as important as your products.
Startups are hectic, yes. You are probably too busy trying to hit that next milestone – before you run out of cash – to dedicate the slightest bit of energy to what the “world” out there thinks of you. But trust me on this — if there’s anything you shouldn’t outsource, it’s your personal brand.
There is no such thing as business-to-business. Have you ever seen a “business” buy anything? No, it’s always person-to-person. There is someone that makes the decision to sell and someone that makes the decision to buy. 
Executive branding is all about creating motivational levers that drive people towards becoming a customer, and it’s something that needs to come from you.
There are a few simple strategies that won’t have you work your fingers to the bone. Podcasts, for example, are extremely powerful. 
In just an hour, you can create a bank of valuable content that can then be spread across multiple channels and is directed towards a specific outcome or behavior you want your listeners to take.
If your team makes an effort to represent itself consistently, it’s best equipped to build long-term trust in its abilities and decisions.
Avoid avoiding yourself
In executive branding, there’s only one rule: be yourself. 
You can’t show up in your crisp suit anymore, so don’t waste time on the polish. Statistically, CEOs who display authentic qualities are outranking those who do not.
When crafting your narrative, avoid the temptation to share professional updates only. Showing off by only recognizing your successes will not score you many points – it’s the matrix of your actions, values, skills, experience, all sprinkled with personality, that works best. 
Whether it’s jokes or puppy videos, there’s a space for everything. People want to know what you did on the weekend, how you feel about the latest Reddit chain, and what your struggles are.
Also, realize that your executive story didn’t begin when you started the company – it was long before that. 
What strange things happened to you? Did you spend a summer juggling your way through Europe? Have you had a near-death experience? What was weird about your great-grandparents? Never avoid your back story – embrace it and own it.
The likes of Richard Branson and James Altucher do this incredibly well, but for inspiration, don’t shy away from exploring platforms like TikTok (yes, seriously). 
The young and rising influencers of today are building their followings through two-sided community engagement. Bold, edgy, and fun bits connect them with micro-communities, one after another. Not that you should become an influencer – just think of Elon Musk’s doge memes.

You might ask if there are any limits to being yourself. My simple response is that there aren’t — though brace yourself for backlash. 
Still, it’s always a push-and-pull situation. Not everybody is going to like you, so push away those that won’t and bring closer those that want to hear what you have to say. 
Gary Vaynerchuk is the perfect example: he built up his audience through brutally honest advice and occasional swear words – and his fans love him for that.
Find your process
Speaking of Gary, he is huge on his personal brand: 
Your reputation online, and in the new business world is pretty much the game, so you’ve got to be a good person. You can’t hide anything, and more importantly, you’ve got to be out there at some level.
And where else to cultivate that brand than on socials? Today, 82% of consumers are more likely to trust a company whose CEO and leadership team engages on social media, so that’s another big reason to put yourself out there.
 Yet, these platforms are full of rabbit holes that can lead nowhere. One of the easiest ways to get started is to make informed comments on interesting or trending posts.
When posting, get out of the fog and tell the real story. Apart from overly promotional contributions, forget about low-quality, spammy content. 
An emoji-vote LinkedIn poll about a preferred work modality was cool at the beginning of the pandemic, but everyone’s fed up with it now. Instead, find a steady pace that allows you to share content of value.
You don’t need to be a wordsmith, but writing articles or even a short book can bring you a lot of traction. A process that only takes a couple of weeks can give you enough information for months in terms of content bits. 
Promoting the cover page as you work through the piece is a great way to get the conversation going. Then, especially if printed, books build authority and trust like no other medium – and they don’t need to end up in Harvard Law School library.
The beauty of personal branding is that there’s no one recipe to get it right. If you aren’t exactly one to start a new Reels trend, it’s fine. Just find your process and keep it up.

"State of the internet July ’21: Audiences swell, but advertisers are anxious",Simon Kemp,2021/07/21,"
Despite the rapid increases in digital adoption and use that we’ve seen since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic more than a year ago, the latest update in the Global Digital Reports series reveals that digital growth rates remain elevated as we move into the second half of 2021.
DataReportal‘s Digital 2021 July Global Statshot Report – published in partnership with Hootsuite and We Are Social – shows that social media continues to drive connected activity around the world, with global social media user numbers fast approaching another impressive milestone.
This quarter’s data reveals some potential challenges ahead for marketers though, with the impact of changes in Apple’s privacy policies and the rollout of the EU’s ePrivacy Directive starting to appear in some of our numbers.
You’ll find a handy summary of this quarter’s top stories in the video embed below (you can also click here), but read on below for the full report, and for my in-depth analysis of the latest essential trends.

Just before we dive into the data, I’d like to say a big thank you to the partners who make our Global Digital Reports possible: GWI, Statista, Semrush, Skai (formerly Kenshoo), SimilarWeb, Locowise, and App Annie.
Full report
You’ll find the complete Digital 2021 July Global Statshot Report report in the SlideShare embed below (you can also click here), but read on past that to understand what all these numbers might mean for you.
﻿﻿﻿
Essential headlines
Let’s start with the key figures for digital adoption around the world in July 2021:

Global mobile users have reached 5.27 billion, equating to just under 67% of the world’s total population.
The number of mobile users has grown by 2.3% over the past year, increasing by 117 million in 12 months – that’s almost 10 million new users per month.
Internet users have increased by more than a quarter of a billion since this time last year, registering year-on-year growth of close to 6%.
There are 4.80 billion internet users around the world today, equating to almost 61% of the world’s total population.
Social media user numbers have jumped by more than 13% since this time last year, with the latest data showing an increase of more than half a billion users in just 12 months.
There are now 4.48 billion social media users around the world, which is equal to almost 57% of the world’s total population.


Social media growth continues
Despite COVID-19 restrictions easing in some parts of the world over recent months, the pace of growth in social media users shows few signs of slowing.
The global unique user total grew by 520 million over the past year, representing annual growth of more than 13%.

For context, that means that more than 1 in 9 of today’s social media users started using social platforms for the first time within the past 12 months.
Furthermore, today’s user total is 147 million higher than it was just 3 months ago, equating to quarter-on-quarter growth of nearly 3.5%.
This is one of the fastest quarterly growth rates that we’ve reported in the Global Digital Reports series, but it’s important to stress that the latest figures have benefited from a meaningful upward correction in Facebook’s ‘family active people’ numbers.
As the company noted in its 2021 Q1 earnings announcement, 
“In the first quarter of 2021, we updated our metrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately 70 million [users] to our reported worldwide [total].”
However, while this correction may have inflated the latest quarterly growth rates, Facebook appears to update its models and metrics on a regular basis, so the 13% annual growth rate that we’re reporting this quarter should still be representative of actual year-on-year trends.

At an individual platform level, Facebook is pushing ever closer to the 3 billion monthly active user milestone, with current trends suggesting that it may reach this level by early next year.
However, the company’s investor reports indicate that roughly 3.5 billion people already use at least one of Facebook’s ‘family’ of platforms – Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger.
There were no updates to user numbers from YouTube, WhatsApp, or Messenger this quarter, but the latest data from Instagram suggests the platform has enjoyed significant growth over recent months – a story that we’ll explore in more detail below.
TikTok is still keeping its latest user numbers close to its chest too, so we’re unable to report any ‘official’ updates to its monthly active user figure this quarter.
However, data from Sensor Tower indicates that the TikTok mobile app was downloaded roughly 57 million times in June 2021 alone, so there’s a good chance that the platform’s active user base continues to grow (note that we’ve removed figures for China from Sensor Tower’s total, because we treat Douyin as a separate app).

Reporting of internet user growth continues to lag
Despite the latest data showing that internet user numbers have increased by more than a quarter of a billion over the past year, it’s clear that internet user data continues to be impacted by research limitations caused by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
In particular, many countries in the developing world haven’t published updates to internet user numbers since the outbreak of COVID-19 more than a year ago, and these are the countries where we’d expect to see the most significant increases.
As a result, we continue to anticipate a meaningful upward correction in internet user numbers once research and reporting can return to normal.

Internet time decreases
The average amount of time that people spend using the internet each day dipped slightly in the past 3 months, compared with the values we reported in our Digital 2021 April Global Statshot Report.
Data from GWI shows that average daily internet use dropped by almost a minute per day, with people spending roughly 30 seconds less online on computers, and 30 seconds less online on mobile devices.
People are still spending close to 7 hours per day using the internet though – more than twice the amount of time that they spend watching television.
However, it’s worth noting that people have been spending more time watching television in recent months.
The ‘typical’ internet user around the world says that they watched an average of 3 additional minutes of TV per day compared to the previous quarter, which equates to more than 5 additional hours of television content over the past three months.

Meanwhile, despite the drop in overall internet time, people say that they’ve been spending more time using social media.
GWI’s most recent survey found that people spent roughly 2 minutes longer on social platforms each day over the past 3 months, compared to values for the previous quarter.
Interestingly, GWI also found that people have been spending more time with ‘conventional’ media in recent months. 
Survey respondents’ self-reported values for time spent reading physical newspapers and magazines increased by 8.5% over the past three months, equating to an additional 4 minutes per day – faster than the increase we’ve seen for online press consumption.
Similarly, the amount of time that people say they spend listening to broadcast radio has increased by 3.5% over the past 90 days, equating to an increase of 2 minutes per day.
An increase of just a few minutes per day might not sound like a lot, but added up, these increases mean that the typical global internet user spent an additional 6 hours consuming print media over the past quarter, and an extra 3 hours listening to broadcast radio.
Social media dominates the world’s online activities
New data from GWI reveals that more than 95% of the world’s working-age internet users now use social networks and messaging services each month.
Interestingly, this data suggests that the use of social networking platforms like Facebook outranks the use of messaging services like WhatsApp, albeit only by a tiny margin.

More than 5 in 6 internet users between the ages of 16 and 64 also visit search engines and web portals each month, but this figure is more than 10 percentage points lower than the figure for social networks.
Meanwhile, roughly 6 in 10 internet users say they’ve visited some kind of online shopping platform in the past month, and more than 50% of internet users say that they shop or browse for products online every week.
Instagram reach soars, but points to potential trouble ahead
Recent months have seen some interesting changes in the numbers that Facebook’s tools report for Instagram’s advertising reach.
Overall, these tools show that Instagram’s advertising reach has jumped by 100 million users over the past 90 days, representing quarter-on-quarter growth of more than 7.5%.

However, this growth rate is all the more impressive when we look at changes in reach figures for countries in the European Union.
For context, changes in EU legislation – including the roll-out of the ePrivacy Directive – are already starting to impact companies’ ability to target and track audiences across the EU and the UK.
As a support article in Facebook’s Business Help Centre states,
“[We]… anticipate an impact on campaigns active in the European Region. Businesses that advertise to people in the European Region might experience decreased performance… We expect that the impact will unfold gradually, over the course of several months, as additional product updates are released.”
It’s worth noting that these changes will affect all advertising platforms that are active in the EU – not just those owned by Facebook.
But despite Facebook’s expectation that the impact of these changes will “unfold gradually”, it seems they may have already started to affect Instagram’s advertising reach numbers.
Compared to the figures that the company’s self-service tools reported just 3 months ago, Instagram’s advertising reach has dropped by a whopping 5 million users (14.7%) in the United Kingdom, and by 3 million users in Italy, Germany, and Spain.

Overall, Facebook’s data suggest that advertisers can now target 25 million fewer users across Europe than they could as recently as April of this year.
However, these drops only seem to have affected countries in the EU and the UK.
It’s also critical to stress that these figures likely only affect the degree to which advertisers can target ads to users in Europe, and they most likely do not represent a drop in actual users. 
Indeed, given the rapid growth in Instagram’s reach across all other markets over the past three months, there’s every chance that Instagram has grown its active user base in Europe since April.
Moreover, the company’s latest numbers show no evidence of a drop in Facebook’s advertising reach across the region, which may provide some level of reassurance for investors.

But it’s not just marketers in Europe who face mounting challenges.
In a separate advisory within Facebook’s advertising tools, the company warns that potential reach figures all over the world “may vary significantly as people opt out of tracking on iOS 14.5, or use other data controls.”
The tone of these messages suggests that Facebook expects Apple’s recent iOS changes to have a meaningful impact on the performance of its advertising products over the coming months.
These changes will affect many other platforms too – not just Facebook.
Despite these challenges though, it’s worth reiterating the point that I made at the start of this section: overall, Instagram’s advertising reach has increased by more than 100 million over the past 3 months – despite that big drop in EU reach.
So, the takeaway here is that changes to privacy policies, cookie support, and online tracking regulations may have a significant impact on marketers’ ability to target ads over the coming months – at least until publishers and platforms find ways to adapt.
However, those changes don’t diminish the broader opportunities available to marketers within digital and social media platforms.
Recent data from eMarketer shows that digital channels now account for nearly 6 in every 10 ad dollars spent around the world, and we don’t anticipate that the challenges outlined above will make a significant dent in that share.

Marketers will need to change how they use digital and social media platforms over the next few months though, to ensure that their activities are as efficient and as effective as possible.
For example, you may want to experiment with contextual targeting opportunities, instead of relying solely on audience demographics – at least until you’re better able to identify how new policies and laws will affect your advertising strategy.
Mobile connection speeds accelerate
The latest data from Ookla shows that the average mobile connection speed around the world has increased by 60% over the past 12 months.
The typical mobile user now enjoys data download speeds in excess of 55 Mbps, compared to the 35 Mbps that the company reported this time last year.

Based on Netflix’s guidance, these figures indicate that the typical mobile user can now simultaneously stream two 4K movies via a single mobile connection.
According to Ookla’s latest findings, only two countries in the world now suffer from average mobile connection speeds below 10 Mbps: Afghanistan and Venezuela.
At the other end of the spectrum, 13 countries now enjoy average mobile connection speeds in excess of 100 Mbps, with average speeds in the United Arab Emirates already close to 200 Mbps.

To put that figure in perspective, the typical mobile user in the UAE can now download internet content 3,450 times faster than they would have been able to by using a 56K modem just 20 years ago.
The latency of mobile internet connections continues to improve too, with Ookla’s latest data showing that the ‘lag’ between a device sending a data request and it starting to receive the requested data has fallen by 7.5% over the past 12 months.
The latency of the average mobile connection continues to be almost double that of the average fixed connection though, so there’s some way to go before mobile gamers can enjoy the same speed advantages as their peers who use a fixed connection.

When it comes to fixed internet connections, a total of 10 countries now enjoy average download speeds of more than 200 Mbps, with Monaco and Singapore enjoying average speeds in excess of 250 Mbps.
However, 7 countries continue to suffer from average fixed connection speeds below 10 Mbps, and Ookla’s data reveals that mobile connections now outpace fixed connections in more than 40 countries.

Chinese websites move up the rankings
The latest data from Alexa (the analytics firm, not the voice assistant) suggests that the share of global internet traffic attributable to Chinese websites continues to grow.
The company’s latest rankings show that websites managed by companies based in China now account for 7 of the 10 most-visited sites in the world, and half of the global top 20.
Chinese ecommerce platforms are particularly popular, with three of the country’s online merchants – Tmall, Taobao, and JD – all ranking above Amazon’s ‘.com’ store at a worldwide level (note that Alexa treats each top-level domain separately, so traffic to Amazon’s local country stores are not included in the values for its .com store).

However, almost all of the traffic to Chinese websites appears to come from within China itself.
Alexa’s data shows that more than 95% of Tmall’s traffic comes from its home market, while that figure is 94% for Taobao, and 95% for JD.
Across each of these three sites, visitors from the United States and Japan account for roughly 3.5% of total traffic, meaning that the rest of the world accounts for barely 1.5% of each site’s worldwide total.
This data clearly demonstrates just how quickly China’s connected population is growing, but it also illustrates just how different China’s internet behaviors are to those of the rest of the world.
People increasingly rely on internet translation tools
The latest data suggests that online translation tools are becoming increasingly popular with internet users around the world.
Google Trends data shows that 3 of the worldwide top 20 Google search queries between April and June 2021 related to converting content between languages, with “translate”, “traductor”, and “Google Translate” all now top queries at a global level.
 

GWI data reinforces this finding, with the company’s latest survey revealing that roughly 1 in 3 internet users between the ages of 16 and 64 use online translation tools every week.
However, GWI’s data reveals some fascinating differences between countries and cultures.
Internet users in Latin America are the most likely to make use of online translation tools, with more than half of internet users in Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina saying they use these tools on a weekly basis.
However, internet users in countries where English is the dominant language appear to be far less likely to want to translate content from (or into) other languages. 
For example, fewer than 1 in 5 internet users in the United Kingdom and the USA say that they’ve used an online translation tool in the past week.

Even more tellingly, searches for ‘traductor’ rank relatively highly amongst Google queries in the United States, suggesting that many of those who do use online translation tools in the US are not native English speakers.
Around the world, younger people are also more likely to want to translate content than their parents’ generation.
GWI’s data shows that Gen Z internet users are almost twice as likely to have used an online translation tool in the past week than Baby Boomers are, with nearly 4 in 10 female internet users aged between 16 and 24 translating content online in the past 7 days.

Overall, these findings indicate that people are increasingly consuming content in languages other than their own native tongue, which represents some interesting new opportunities – and challenges – for marketers.
For example, as we reported this time last year, we’re seeing increased prevalence of cross-border online shopping, especially outside of North America.
However, as international content becomes ever more accessible, and as more people visit online merchants outside of their home country, brands may find it increasingly difficult to justify different prices – and even different product ranges – across different countries.
It’s also worth noting that Amazon appears to have increased the visibility of reviews from shoppers in other countries – some of which may be in different languages – which adds a whole new dimension to the factors that marketers need to consider when it comes to online shopping.
Digging deeper into video game behaviors
We’ve teamed up with GWI to bring you some detailed insights into gaming activities this quarter, taken from the company’s new Gaming dataset.
85% of the world’s internet users say that they play video games, so gaming environments represent a huge opportunity for marketers.
Moreover, 1 in 3 gamers around the world say that they play video games on a daily basis, with that figure rising to more than 40% in the USA, Japan, and the Philippines.
Meanwhile, more than 5 in every 6 gamers (84%) around the world say that they play video games at least once per week, with that figure rising to 87% in Mexico and India.

As you might expect, younger people are more likely to play video games, but GWI reports that more than 2 in 3 internet users aged 55 to 64 also identify as gamers.
Men are also slightly more likely to play video games than women, but amongst older age groups, women are just as likely to be gamers as men are.
The gaming ‘gender gap’ is also much smaller than many marketers might think, and when it comes to certain ‘casual’ game genres – particularly those on mobile devices – female players often outnumber their male peers.

The data also shows that people play a wide variety of different kinds of video games.
Action adventures like Assassin’s Creed and shooter formats like Call of Duty top the global rankings, with more than half of all gamers saying that they’ve played at least one title in these genres over the past year.
However, 10 distinct gaming genres have attracted more than a quarter of the worldwide gaming audience during the past 12 months, including puzzle formats like Limbo, simulation games like The Sims, and role-playing games like Mass Effect.
This highlights the fact that gaming opportunities cover a wide variety of contexts, making video games an even more compelling opportunity for marketers.

Opportunities aren’t limited to in-game activities either; gaming livestreams and related social media conversations are often just as compelling as the games themselves.
YouTube attracts the largest share of social media activities related to gaming, but – perhaps surprisingly – Facebook ranks ahead of Twitch and Discord, despite those platforms’ strong association with gaming communities.

Gaming environments are quite different from other kinds of media though, so it’s important for marketers to invest time in understanding which kinds of gaming genre and marketing activity will be most relevant to their specific audiences, as well as to their brand.
Online news behaviors
To round out this quarter’s analysis, let’s take a look at some key headlines from the 2021 edition of the Digital News Report, published by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.
This annual study provides a wealth of insights into how the world consumes news, which has particular importance when we consider GWI’s finding that “keeping up to date with news and events” is one of the top 3 motivations driving global internet use.

This year’s Digital News data shows that 82% of adults aged 18 and above now consume news online – significantly more than the 64% who say they watch news content on television.
Moreover, people are now more than twice as likely to get their news from social media as they are to look for it in newspapers and magazines.

Overall, 56% of respondents in the Digital News survey say that they use social media to access news content, but that figure rises to more than three-quarters of all adults aged 18 and above in Thailand, Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa.

Younger people are particularly likely to turn to social media for news, with two-thirds of respondents aged 18 to 24 saying that they use social platforms to access news content.
However, roughly half of all adults aged 55 and above say that they use social media for news too, so this behavior is by no means limited to Gen Z audiences.

Once again, these findings reinforce the data in GWI’s survey, which shows that news content is a strong draw for social media use.
Indeed, GWI’s latest data reveals that news content is a primary reason why more than 1 in 3 internet users aged 16 to 64 visit social platforms.

The Reuters Institute’s new report shows that Facebook continues to be the top social destination for news, with 44% of worldwide respondents saying that they use the platform to discover and consume news content.
YouTube ranks second at 29%, while WhatsApp is now the third most important social channel for news, with almost a quarter of survey respondents citing the platform as a regular feature in their news repertoire.
This year’s data also highlights Twitter’s outsized role when it comes to news content.
Despite claiming three times fewer monthly active users, Twitter is almost as popular as Instagram when it comes to news content.

However, people have significantly lower levels of trust in the news content that they find via social channels, compared to news in other kinds of media.
Overall, 44% of survey respondents say that they feel they can “trust most news content most of the time”, but positive sentiment falls to roughly half that figure (24%) when it comes to news content in social media.
So, while social media continues to play an important role in people’s news habits, it’s critical to remember that social media environments may have a negative impact on news credibility.
As a result, marketers and publishers may want to think carefully about how they use social channels to promote and distribute news content, especially if that content relates to potentially sensitive or contentious topics.

Perhaps ironically though, despite the relatively low levels of overall trust in news, people are still reluctant to pay for digital news content.
Fewer than 1 in 5 adults aged 18 and above around the world say that they currently pay for digital news, with that figure falling to less than 10% in Germany, the UK, and Croatia.

Outlook for the second half of 2021
Once again, the data in this quarter’s report demonstrates elevated growth in digital use and adoption around the world, creating a variety of opportunities for marketers everywhere.
However, I confess I’m surprised by these sustained high levels of growth, especially when it comes to social media user numbers.
The initial spikes in user growth that we saw at the start of the coronavirus pandemic were perhaps to be expected, but I’m unsure as to why those growth rates haven’t already returned to the levels we saw prior to the outbreak.
So, while my expectation is that we’ll start to see quarter-on-quarter growth rates fall from their recent highs later this year, I wouldn’t be surprised if that deceleration is still a few months away.
Furthermore, with ongoing delays in reporting updates to internet user numbers, we may see a significant jump in those metrics as new data starts to become available.
But what does this mean for marketers?
Here are my top tips for the second half of 2021:

Focus on macro trends: it’s easy to get distracted by short-term changes in the numbers, especially when fluctuations make for great headlines. However, the underlying story seems clear: our audiences have significantly increased their use of connected devices and services over recent months, and it’s unlikely that they’ll completely return to their pre-COVID habits. As a result, growth trends in digital activity don’t face the same risk of a downward ‘correction’ that we might expect to see in areas such as stock market prices.
Prepare for change: new privacy policies, the demise of third-party cookies, and changes to online legislation are combining to create ideal conditions for advertising’s ‘perfect storm’. Of course, this may all turn out to be another Millennium Bug, but with evidence of change already visible in some of this quarter’s numbers, I’d recommend opting for safe instead of sorry. If you haven’t already done so, now is the time to review which of your marketing activities depend on data and targeting practices that may be affected by these changes, and to develop contingency plans that will ensure your marketing efforts can continue.
Embrace digital utility: many of today’s most successful digital companies focus on two key industries – communication and entertainment. However, the next wave of digital innovation will likely focus on everyday utility, with the rapid digitization of education, banking, and healthcare leading the way. These industries offer fewer advertising opportunities than a new form of entertainment might do, but the changes they’ll bring to people’s everyday activities will likely have a knock-on effect on people’s digital expectations. As a result, I’d recommend exploring how you might use digital channels to create new kinds of value for your audiences, rather than using them solely to promote existing products and services. Entertainment will always be a compelling option, but with a bit of careful thinking, inspirational content and how-to videos can be just as engaging as the latest dance craze on TikTok. 

That’s all for this quarter, but we’ll be back with another Statshot report in October.

‘I don’t know’ is the best phrase for your career,Justin Pot,2021/07/20,"
I used to do sales, and I found three words very helpful: “I don’t know.”
The internet is full of articles for salespeople offering alternatives to saying those three words, all with elaborate ways to avoid admitting ignorance. And I get it: telling someone you don’t know something is hard, especially when you’re trying to convince that person to give you money.
But that’s why saying “I don’t know” is so powerful. In a world full of BS, the best way to stand out is to resemble an actual human being. Admitting you don’t know something is the most human thing you can do.
You don’t know everything — which makes sense
I used to build WordPress websites for local businesses in Boulder, Colorado, and I never impressed potential clients more than the times I admitted I didn’t know the answer to a question. It caught people off guard, in the best way, because they were so used to people pretending or weaseling their way out of corners.
“I don’t know,” I’d tell people. “Let’s see if we can figure it out together.”
And then we would. If I wasn’t sure what a setting did, I’d experiment as the customer watched. If it was something that would require more research, I’d commit to figuring it out. But first, and always, I’d admit that I didn’t know.
I built multiple relationships using the words “I don’t know” because people knew I wasn’t trying to hide anything. There’s trust in that. And you know what? The clients this impressed were by far the best people to work with. They were, on the whole, more curious, kind, and generally just the sort of people you want to work with on a project.
Our culture values confidence — it should value competence
I should clarify: I’m not saying you should be proud of your ignorance. Far from it. I’m saying that, when you don’t know something, you should admit it. You can’t learn something if you think you already know it.
This is a hard thing to realize. If recent history has taught me anything, it’s that American culture values confidence more than competence. Being loudly incorrect gets you on TV more often than being quietly curious, and it sadly seems like a quick path to success in business. There’s every incentive to pretend you know everything, and doing so can easily become reflexive.
Unfortunately, respecting the “I don’t know” isn’t universal. I asked my Zapier coworkers, and many of them told me that, in previous roles, they’d been punished professionally for admitting they didn’t know something. That’s a shame. Those companies missed out on the best possible version of my coworkers — the version that admits they don’t know something and tries to learn.
Just admit you don’t know
None of this is to say that admitting you don’t know something is easy. It isn’t. My Zapier colleague Breetel Graves recently wrote a Friday update on our internal blog that I can’t stop thinking about. She outlined her internal monologue in the lead-up to asking a question:
Breetel: I’m so dumb, I can’t ask this question. I can’t reveal how dumb I am!
Other Breetel: Ok, let’s say you are that dumb. What will happen if you reveal how dumb you are?
Breetel: I’ll get fired.
Other Breetel: You probably won’t be fired immediately. It’ll take a bit. You’ll probably have some warning.
Breetel: But then I’ll get fired.
Other Breetel: Yeah, but you’d probably get another job. The local cheese shop is hiring. You love cheese.
And then I asked the question.
This is so human it hurts. I do the same thing: I wonder if admitting I don’t know something will result in some sort of catastrophe.
But you know what? It hasn’t, at least for me — and it shouldn’t for anyone.

There’s a story about one of the chief innovators at Nokia, who receives a call while walking at the beach. After a few minutes, the person calling him asks about the noise in the background, prompting the Nokia chief to explain where he is. The caller then says, “Oh, I thought you were working,” to which the innovator replies, “I AM WORKING. I’M THINKING!”
It’s a funny story that’s always stuck with me. At a lot of companies, there’s an obsession with productivity that seems to overlook human nature… or even actual results.
Basically, if you look serious and your hands are moving, you must be working hard. But if you’re staring at the ceiling with a smile on your face, well, that obviously means you’re slacking.

I feel like this outlook is based on the archaic master/servant relationship which defined work-life at the beginning of the previous century: the boss tells the manager what to do, who then makes the employee do it.
And although I’m not a fan of design by decision, or even democracy as a management form, I do think that empowering your people and allowing them to do their best work is a more enduring and scalable strategy than treating them as soldiers in your imaginary army.
Every now and again, you hear a story about a company that blocks social media or specific websites to save their staff from ‘distraction.’ The theory being that people should work at work, and only engage in distractions during their off-hours — such as social media or calling your significant other about whether there’s enough toilet paper at home.

But this doesn’t describe the reality of employees’ lives. It isn’t binary with work and private life neatly compartmentalized.
You worry about a client while you’re preparing dinner. You think about a proposal you’re writing while the kids swim, and you might reply to a few emails or write a memo in bed when you’re finally relaxed enough to get your thoughts straight.
Sure, some people clock out at 5 pm and stop thinking about everything. But I’m guessing those people probably spend less time on personal stuff at the office. In the end, life is chaotic and fluid, and we should allow people to feel human at work.
If that means taking a call from a friend, then so be it.

Turning my startup’s office into an art gallery was a weirdly good business move,Daria Leshchenko,2021/07/9,"
I came into the office completely drained after a difficult meeting. But when I looked up I stopped awestruck: someone had hung a painting on the wall. Suddenly the boring hallway had been turned into a room with personality and mood. 
My business partner had decided to hang up an abstract painting by modern Ukrainian artist Anton Popernyak he owned. The painting undeniably brightened up the space, but its real value was the course it put us on — turning our office into an art gallery.

Putting on an art exhibition in your office might sound like an indulgent thing to do for a startup, but we discovered that it actually led to a lower turnover rate and increased offer acceptance among candidates we interviewed. 
So here’s how we came up with this idea and what results we got from it. Hopefully, it inspires you to do the same!

Why we did it
My business partner is an experienced patron of the greatly underappreciated Ukrainian art scene. He’s always been keen on bringing art closer to people and wanted to help introduce the team to their local culture. I wasn’t as involved in art as he was, but I’ve always cared about making our workplace an inspiring creative space where people would want to come back, not be obliged to come in. 
So when we saw our business would be expanding, we decided to combine our interests when designing a new office. 
Credit: SupportYourApp
We invited ten muralists, graphic designers, and calligraphists and gave them carte blanche — a censorship-free opportunity to use our office walls as a canvas. Five months later, our 350-person office space had turned into a modern art gallery. 
Now what did our team think? They loved it.
Of course, we had hoped for the project to be a morale boost for the team and maybe increase people’s interest in their local art scene. But in the end, what we got was so much more.

Decreased turnover rate
We work in the customer support industry which has one of the highest employee turnover rates of any field. While the average rate for companies in general is 15 percent, for customer service centers it can reach 30-45 percent. 
This is a big problem for businesses as the cost to replace a person varies between $10,000 to $15,000 and can add up to a lot of money for big call centers. 
But since we gave our office an art makeover, our turnover rate dropped by 16 percent. All of a sudden our fun art initiative had a real measurable impact on our bottom line. 
Increased number of job applications
Credit: SupportYourAppAs a customer support company, our recruiting process is continuous and requires a huge pool of specialists who speak foreign languages. Just last year, during the challenging 2020, we hired 658 people. 
Most of our candidates come from job searching sites or are referred by current team members. But after we introduced art to the office, the word got out and the number of organic job applications increased 1.5 times. 
When asked, people said that they’ve seen the photos of our office on the job sites, on their friends’ social media, or in the press, and it made them want to apply. To them, our company seemed interesting and innovative and stood out among other offers. 
Judging by the incredibly positive results we’ve gotten, I believe that our investment into the space paid off with increased interest among potential candidates. 
Increased offer acceptance rate
We have three-stages job interviews and in the case of a local hire, the last stage is an in-person conversation in the office. We noticed that an average acceptance rate is 50 percent higher among the candidates interviewed in our new ‘art office’ in comparison to the old one. 
And it’s clear why from the feedback we’ve gotten from newcomers:  “The minute I saw this, I knew I wanted to work here.”

Credit: SupportYourAppTo give you a bit of perspective on why this has been so successful, I think it’s good to note that 42 percent of our applicants are millennials. 
Since 78 percent of them consider the quality of the workspace important when choosing an employer, it’s not surprising that a creative workplace attracts candidates’ attention. 
However, they are not the only ones who care about it: 81 percent of all applicants would reject a job offer if they didn’t like the workplace. That’s why I consider resources put in the office a long-term investment into our recruiting efforts. 
Increased brand awareness
Introducing an art project like this also drew the attention of local media and put us on a map of global office spaces. It helped us reach a new audience outside our traditional channels and cement a reputation as a responsible employer. 
A lot of factors contributed to getting us there. Team members shared photos of the office on social media and brought their relatives to our corporate Family Days. I also found employees were also more willing to promote the company among their friends. 
And because of all this interest, we introduced tours of the office for the public so more people could come to see the murals. All of this combined increased interest among potential candidates and, subsequently, clients.
Credit: SupportYourApp
Clients’ recognition
Since we’re in a competitive sector of the B2B industry, relationships and reputation are crucial for us. 
Before signing a contract, clients sometimes go on a tour checking out different service providers. Before COVID-19, we hosted on average four client visits per month. Having a unique office makes a memorable impression and lets us stand out among the competitors. 
The contact center industry is stereotypically perceived as a toxic work environment with gray open-space and no air conditioning. We bust that myth and make our clients see how their money is spent: on happy representatives which means happy customers. 
Clients, who value commitment to the team’s wellness, appreciate our efforts and tend to choose us as a partner. 
Credit: SupportYourApp
Of course, we can’t credit all the above-mentioned achievements solely to art in the office. You can’t just hang a painting on the wall and expect the turnover rate to go down — that’s not how it works. It has to be a part of and supported by other strategic efforts to improve the overall employee experience. 
However, the massive introduction of art into our space definitely played a key role in how our team perceives its workplace and the company. Still, one of the less visible yet priceless benefits I love the most is when I overhear two people chatting in the kitchen… about which mural they liked more — the one by Manzhos or by Kondakov.

3 semi-useful tips on office ‘conversation pieces’,Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten,2021/07/8,"
Boris is the wise ol’ CEO of TNW who writes a weekly column on everything about being an entrepreneur in tech — from managing stress to embracing awkwardness. You can get his musings straight to your inbox by signing up for his newsletter!
I recently learned a technique for enabling connections and conversations during dinner, and it’s called… the conversation piece. 
Apparently, in previous centuries, it was common practice for the wealthier families of Amsterdam (where I live) to place an object in the middle of the table, so your guests could discuss it. A literal conversation piece.
They’d host prestigious dinner parties where the pieces were crafted by commissioned artists. Some were abstract, some more classical and poetic, and some were downright pornographic. So conversations never stalled, the more audacious and controversial the piece was, the more there was to talk about — especially once the alcohol started flowing.
[Read: The ‘five whys’ will make returning to the office less awful]
I greatly enjoy hosting dinner parties as they revolve around good conversations and exchanging ideas, so I was really inspired. But I was also inspired because I could see how the benefits can reach far beyond dinner parties.
I want to have great discussions in my management team, good exchange of ideas with other teams, and engaging one-on-one conversations with my employees.
So here are my three tips to improve your communication, based on the age-old conversation piece.
Tip 1: Choose your piece
Let me be clear: don’t bring an erotic centerpiece to your next team meeting. But what you can do is think about the general concept of having a conversation piece to enable great conversations.
I love the story of the founder of Palm when the company was first starting out. He chose what sparked conversations by actually fashioning a Palmpilot prototype out of wood, drawing a screen and buttons on it with a pencil — and then he carried it around the office and pretended it worked.
He’d come into meetings, place a block of wood on the table, and act as if it was a fully functioning machine. Now that’s a conversation starter.
But a conversation piece doesn’t have to be a physical object or a thing. At our conferences — next one in 84 days, see you there in person? — I like to use our speakers as the conversation pieces.
No matter who you run into or what field they’re in, it’s so easy to encourage a discussion with a simple “have you seen this speaker?” And the beautiful thing is, it doesn’t even really matter whether the answer is yes or no because you now have something to kickstart the conversation.
Tip 2: Shut up
As great as it is to come prepared for conversations, there’s one undeniable fact we have to acknowledge: you talk too much.
If you want to have a good conversation, learn to shut the fuck up. Or as more eloquent people would say: you’ll never learn from just hearing yourself speak.
I know you agree with me when I say the best conversations are when you’re genuinely interested and ask lots of questions. It’s amazing when you have chats like these with friends and family, but they’re even more precious in company meetings.
That’s why I find the most powerful thing you can do in a meeting is to start by saying, “I’m here to listen.” Then hold your tongue and absorb what others have to say — you’ll learn a ton.
So not only can a ‘conversation piece’ be abstract rather than physical, the intentional absence of one can start a deeper discussion.
Tip 3: Walkie-talkie 
The physical conversation pieces of old also remind me of a conversation technique I picked up a while back. When you want to discuss complex topics, go for a walk together.
Why? Because it works so much better than a rigid chat sitting across from each other.
When you’re walking, you can stare into the distance and speak your mind more freely. When you’re sat opposite each other, you won’t be able to avoid eye contact, and that can make it harder to think out loud as you feel more scrutinized or worried about how the other person will react to a half-formed thought.
This is just one reason video chats can be so annoying: the constant and unavoidable eye contact.
A walk can therefore make sure the wrong thing doesn’t dictate which direction the conversation goes — for example, perceived judgment by the person sitting across from you.
So to sum up… 
Want to ask someone a tricky question or discuss a complex topic? Don’t schedule lunch but go for a walk, or meet in a museum, or find a sunset or fireplace to stare into. And then shut up and listen.
Don’t try to impress others with your stories or insights, but dive deep into their background and reasoning. And lastly, define your conversation piece — whether it’s physical, abstract, or non-existent — then let the conversation develop on its own from there.

Open-plan offices make you stressed and moody: We’ve got the data to prove it,The Conversation,2021/07/7,"
If you’ve ever felt your noisy open-plan office makes you cranky and sends your heart racing, our new research shows you aren’t imagining it.
Prior to the pandemic 70% of office-based employees worked in open-plan offices. Employee complaints about this design are rife.
Yet there is little experimental research investigating the effects of office noise on things like cognitive performance, physiological stress , and mood.
The results of our study, in experimentally controlled conditions using heart rate, skin conductivity, and AI facial emotion recognition, shows the effects of that noise are very real.
We’ve found a significant causal relationship between open-plan office noise and physiological stress.
Our results show such noise heightens negative mood by 25% — and these results come from testing participants in a simulated open-plan office for just eight minutes at a time. In a real office, where workers are exposed to noise continuously during the day, we would expect the effects on stress and mood to be even greater.
How we simulated open-plan office noise
We used a simulated office setting with volunteers to compare the effects of typical open-plan office noise to a quieter private office on a range of objective and subjective measures of well-being and performance. Our carefully manipulated soundscapes included people speaking, walking, printing papers, ringing telephones, and keyboard typing noises.
Our study involved observing the same individuals “working” — participants were asked to complete a proof-reading task — under the two noise conditions. We varied the order of the sound tests to avoid bias due to fatigue and training effects.
This “repeated measures experimental design” allowed us to make causal conclusions about the effects of the noise on well-being indicators.
We used sensors to track changes in heart rate and sweat response — both reliable indicators of physiological stress. We used facial emotion recognition software to assess emotional responses. We also had participants self-report their own feeling using a mood scale.
Even after a short exposure, we found a causal relationship between open-plan office noise and both stress and negative mood. Negative mood increased by 25% and sweat response by 34%.
While there was no immediate effect on reduced work performance, it is reasonable to assume such hidden stress over the longer term is detrimental to well-being and productivity.
Credit: The ConversationNegative effects of open offices

Precise causal relationships
Our study addresses a gap in the literature by using a simulated office environment with objectively manipulated noise levels and a wide range of objective and subjective dependent variables.
Reviews in research in this field show past studies have tended to only use self-reported measures. They have not used controlled experimental conditions, nor tested sound parameters.
Comparing multiple output measures has allowed us to investigate cause-effect relationships. Much research on open-plan offices has not established direct causal connections, which is necessary to understand precise relationships, and thus the how to most effectively and efficiently reduce these stressors.
Although open-plan offices rarely present an immediate physical danger in terms of sound levels, unrelenting exposure all day intensifies their effects.
Chronically elevated levels of physiological stress are known to be detrimental to mental and physical health.
Frequently being in a negative mood is also likely to harm job satisfaction and commitment. It potentially increases the likelihood of employees leaving.
What to do about it
The pandemic has changed our tolerance for office work. Surveys show up to 70% of employees will seek new jobs if their employer does not offer flexibility to work from home some of the time. So creating a healthy work environment is more important than ever.
As organizations seek to adapt to COVID-19, many are reconsidering how they set up and use the office. Though open-plan offices are unlikely to go away any time soon, our study highlights the importance of understanding employee needs in designing work spaces.
One advantage of more employees working from home at least some of the time is a less crowded office, reducing both visual and auditory distractions.
But there are other things that can be done. Acoustic treatments and sound-masking technologies — ambient sounds designed to make other people talking less intrusive — can help. Good old-fashioned walls or partitions may also assist.
Such interventions can be costly, but so is the impact of poor office environmental quality on productivity.
And we might all feel happier about going back to the office.

The process of building great tech teams is broken — here’s how we fix it,Sachin Gupta,2021/07/6,"
Today’s world of software development is different from the proprietary software of years past. Open source enables speed, agility, and flexibility. APIs connect disparate processes into ecosystems of solutions that easily plug into each other and speak a shared language.
While software development itself is now extremely collaborative, I’d say the process of hiring and upskilling talent in this world is just the opposite. 
It’s fragmented with siloed teams and technologies that don’t work together. Individual recruiters, hiring managers, HR teams, and strategic leaders work independently like the legacy software that the developers they’re hiring, in many cases, are replacing.
Misaligned expectations between recruiters and hiring managers is a common pain point, but the problems with building great tech teams go much further up the organizational pyramid than you might expect.
For example, Chief Learning Officers rarely consult with hiring managers when they develop L&D initiatives. At first glance, that might make sense… but not when you really think about it. 
If you want to start prioritizing certain skills at your organization and develop entire courses to promote those skills, wouldn’t you want to understand the skills that are being prioritized when hiring prospective employees from day one?
This is why I believe we need strategic communication between teams so that everyone is aligned on who to hire, why, and how to upskill them into the most complete talent that fits the technology trends and business needs of the present, AND the future. 
Here are some ways we can get there:
1. Build a skill-based organizational culture
Some cultures are fun. Some are rigid. The joke in the VC world here in Silicon Valley is that the culture of Venture Capital firms can be summed up in one item of clothing: Patagonia vests.
But culture of course far exceeds clothing — and it starts in the hiring process.
As I’ve argued in the past, the idea of hiring for culture fit is changing. Organizations used to hire archetypes that looked and felt the same, risking inclusivity in the process. Today, culture fit is more about aligning values at every stage of the interview process. 
These values must be inclusive at their heart, but once you know that a candidate has a similar world view, a hunger for excellence, and customer-centricity, for example, then you simply must prioritize skills.
What my team and I do is put skills at the heart of our organizational culture. We hire for skills, agnostic of gender or racial background. In fact, we mask personally identifiable information like name and gender during screening and even, sometimes, during interviews so that unconscious bias won’t impact a hiring decision. 
I think everyone can recognize that interviews are often a source of subjectivity where it’s easy for someone’s decision to be based on personal preferences over actual skill. 
We ensure that objectivity is at the heart of coding interviews by designing a way to accurately measure skills, even during a face-to-face interview so that there is absolutely no room for subjectivity or bias in the process.
But we go further than just hiring. We design our learning and development programs around strategically prioritized skills. That way, we know we have a pipeline of developer talent that will meet our needs, but we can also tailor L&D programs to further strengthen their skills and make them future-ready.
With our skill-based organizational culture in place, it was easy to get stakeholders to collaborate to define skill-based objectives and work towards helping new and old developers alike grow in a strategic manner.
This is also something that we’ve put into our solutions for companies worldwide. We not only help you hire based solely on skill, and nothing else, we also enable you to identify skill gaps within your current organization so that hiring and even L&D programs can be aligned seamlessly.
2. Continuous assessment to ensure continuous learning
People who develop products often follow this procedure: design, test, iterate. 
I’ve found that many learning and development programs don’t emphasize the last two steps. Companies design these great programs, but it’s hard for them to understand and quantify success.
In fact, Deloitte’s 2021 Human Capital Trends Report highlights that reskilling and upskilling programs must “gather and act on workforce data that provides a real-time view of workers’ skills across the entire talent ecosystem.”
Part of this will, of course, be gathering employee feedback on individual programs, but you also have to test their skills in quantifiable ways. Can you build an assessment that gauges their ability to code in Go, a highly sought-after programming language, for instance? 
Their assessment data then needs to be tracked against performance data. Are they succeeding in their role in the way their assessments might predict? Why or why not? How can the L&D program be tweaked to impact real-world applications of skills?
If you aren’t assessing the skills that you’re prioritizing, you’re building skill infrastructure blind.
3. Apply D&I insights to your upskilling programs
Though the corporate world doesn’t necessarily have a strong track record of supporting diversity and inclusion, something did seem to change in the aftermath of last year’s BLM protests. Many organizations have prioritized D&I hiring initiatives, but where their efforts fall short is in upskilling and promoting diverse talent from within.
For instance, women are more likely to take a career break than their male peers, and D&I upskilling programs can be effective ways to help them quickly reacclimate to a different work environment that places emphasis on different skills.
With the skill gap very much heightening competition for tech talent, your HR department can add a lot of value by simply working with your hiring managers to highlight these upskilling programs as an attractive draw to your organization. 
On the flip side, the hiring managers themselves can really help inform elements of these programs by communicating areas of growth needed from their candidates.
This collaboration allows you to not only hire diverse talent, but also tailor programs to their needs to put diverse talent in positions of leadership.
The connective tissue to build great tech teams
It’s funny how sometimes we fail to learn lessons from the things we study day after day. We focus on the minutiae of execution rather than seeing strategic changes as they happen. 
When it comes to tech, we’ve embraced the collaboration of APIs, but we haven’t sourced, screened, interviewed, and upskilled our tech talent nearly as comprehensively.

The ‘five whys’ will make returning to the office less awful,Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten,2021/07/1,"
Boris is the wise ol’ CEO of TNW who writes a weekly column on everything about being an entrepreneur in tech — from managing stress to embracing awkwardness. You can get his musings straight to your inbox by signing up for his newsletter!
I was talking to a woman the other day about how much she liked the company she worked for. It’s fun and modern in most ways, but there was one big catch — the management team is still stuck in the past when it comes to this year’s biggest challenge for employees and companies… returning to the office.
Their CEO had recently announced that they expect employees to work from the office again five days a week as soon as things return to normal.
She was dismayed and annoyed and told me most employees don’t want to return to the office five days a week. Some are fine with three days. Others would prefer two days, and a few are happy with just one day a week at the office.
[Read: The secret to personal growth? Be scared and show up]
Now faced with a forced five-day week back at the office, the employee told me she and her coworkers are ready to revolt. They thought about going to the office and spending less time working and more time drinking coffee and chatting. Performance would drop, and management would be forced to allow work from home again.
The response? Management took the position of look, you’re being paid to work from the office, so if you don’t like that, you can quit and find a different company to work at.
Both responses are incredibly human and understandable knee-jerk reactions — but they won’t lead to a solution. And I truly believe that in the end, both employees and the company will be worse off.
So how do you solve it…?
I don’t have the perfect solution to this problem (I never do), but I think it’s important to realize that frustrations with decisions like these are usually just the tip of the iceberg, while there’s so much more going on below the surface.
In this situation, I think it would’ve made more sense for the management to ask themselves, “Why exactly do we want people to work from the office? Why really?” And the answer can’t be “just because.”
To me, the answer would most likely be “because I want people to perform” and the logical follow-up would be “and I can’t ever be sure if they work from home because I can’t check up on them as easily.”
Now that’s a trust issue — and it’s an indictment on management and its approach. But trust is also something you need to earn, so both management and employees need to think hard about how to build that trust.
The logical next step is to look at performance. If you’re an employee and can show you’re more efficient and reach your goals faster while working at home, then surely that should be a persuasive reason to allow you to work from home.
But I can also see the manager’s point of view who wants to inspire people by having them in the same space because group spirit can be incredibly energizing. A good office creates a lot of space for serendipitous encounters and it can be the glue that holds a company together — which is extremely difficult to replicate online.
So despite the fact we’ve all seen that we can work and be productive from home, I think we should never underestimate the magic that can happen when you get people together in the same place.
That’s why if you’re an employee, you need to be honest when asking yourself this question: “Does working from home really make me more efficient, or is it just slightly more comfortable?”
Now, these questions won’t resolve the issue on their own, but they’re a good start of getting into the habit of asking yourself the ‘five whys.’
Try solving issues with the ‘five whys’ technique
In my mind, if you want to solve a problem, you’re going to have to stop looking at it superficially and look for its root cause. Just thinking about it a minute longer might help, but I’m quite fond of the ‘five whys’ technique.
How does it work? You just need to ask ‘why?’ five times.
If we apply it to both the employee and management in the problem above, we get something like this:
Why do you want to work from home?

1st why — because I like it
2nd why — because I can focus better
3rd why — because there are fewer distractions
4th why — because the office is too loud and I’m pulled into too many meetings
5th why — I need silence and no interruptions to do my work more efficiently

All of these reasons are completely understandable, but using the five whys forces you to see that working remotely might not be the only solution.
These issues could, for example, be addressed with a quieter office space and a rule that limits the number of meetings throughout the day. So you staying at home or coming into the office might not be the root cause, but rather the company’s culture.
But let’s see how it works for management:
Why do you want your employees to come to the office?

1st why — because I don’t think they work as hard from home
2nd why — because I believe they will be too distracted at home
3rd why — because their cat demands attention, the dishwasher needs to be emptied, and their kids are running around
4th why — because that means they won’t spend all their time on their work
5th why — and that means I’m paying 100% and only getting 50% work back

‘Butts in seats’ isn’t a solution to not having control over productivity. Instead, just focus more on output rather than hours or being physically present.
Implement a clear KPI and OKR system and make sure you’re happy with those goals, and then when employees meet those goals… who the hell cares about hours worked?
And if you’re worried about morale being low due to lack of face-to-face interactions — or see more confrontations and criticism happening — then organize more events at the office or create other reasons to entice people to get together and interact more with each other.
If we break it all down, I think the primary reason people want to work from home is comfort. And the reason managers want their employees close to them is control. But both comfort and control can be achieved by other means if we’re all able and willing to look at the root cause of our desires.

How to organize your horribly chaotic Slack sidebar,Justin Pot,2021/07/1,"
Do you ever wonder why your coworker’s Slack sidebar looks so much better than yours? It’s probably because they organized it. You can tweak all sorts of settings in Slack, from how the sidebar behaves to how it looks.
Let’s outline these tweaks one at a time.
Only see unread channels in the Slack sidebar
By default, Slack shows every channel you join and the person you DM in the sidebar, which means it can get cluttered quickly. That’s why you should customize your Slack sidebar to only show what matters.
I recommend that you first set the Channels section to only show unread channels. Hover over Channels, click the three dots to the right, then click Unread channels only.
You will now only see channels in the sidebar if there’s something unread. You can repeat this process for direct messages, if you like, and things will look really clean really quickly.
Create personalized sections in the Slack sidebar
Of course, there probably are some channels you want to keep track of, so I recommend that you create sections for them. Click the three dots next to Channels again, then click Create new section.
You can now create a section for your sidebar, complete with an (optional) emoji.
You can add as many sections as you like, then drag DMs and channels to the relevant sections. I opted for the clean look, free of emojis, that allows me to see different things in the sidebar depending on which team I’m working with right now.
My coworkers have customized this in all sorts of creative ways.
Tweak this until it looks just right for your usage.
Change the order that channels are listed in
You can also tweak what order your Slack channels show up in. Click the name of your organization, at top-left, then click Preferences.
Now head to the Sidebar section.
The default option, alphabetically, is probably best for most people. If you’re feeling brave, though, Slack can sort things “By priority,” which means the channels you use most often end up on top. You can also decide here whether private and shared channels show up in their own lists.
Once you’ve grouped your channels into sections, you can also drag and drop each channel into a new order, or even a new section.
Change the Slack sidebar color scheme
Now that you’ve organized your sidebar, it’s time to get to the fun stuff: customizing how Slack’s sidebar looks. Go to Preferences > Themes, scroll down, and you’ll see a few default themes to choose from:
These are fine, but I’m sure you were hoping for more options. Good news! You can design literally whatever theme you want using the Custom Theme option.
This is, of course, way too much work, which is why I’m thrilled to share even better news: you can quickly grab themes from SlackThemes.net. There’s a bunch of good ones here.
Just find a theme you like, copy the values, then paste them in back in Slack. You’ll have a great-looking Slack in no time.

How a 1930s Soviet miner helped create today’s toxic work culture,The Conversation,2021/06/30,"
One summer night in August, 1935, a young Soviet miner named Alexei Stakhanov managed to extract 102 tonnes of coal in a single shift. This was nothing short of extraordinary (according to Soviet planning, the official average for a single shift was seven tonnes).
Stakhanov shattered this norm by a staggering 1,400%. But the sheer quantity involved was not the whole story. It was Stakhanov’s achievement as an individual that became the most meaningful aspect of this episode. And the work ethic he embodied then – which spread all over the USSR – has been invoked by managers in the west ever since.
Stakhanov’s personal striving, commitment, potential and passion led to the emergence of a new ideal figure in the imagination of Stalin’s Communist Party. He even made the cover of Time magazine in 1935 as the figurehead of a new workers movement dedicated to increasing production. Stakhanov became the embodiment of a new human type and the beginning of a new social and political trend known as “Stakhanovism”.
Credit: SOVFOTO/TimeUSAAlexei Stakhanov on the cover of Time in 1935.
That trend still holds sway in the workplaces of today – what are human resources, after all? Management language is replete with the same rhetoric used in the 1930s by the Communist Party. It could even be argued that the atmosphere of Stakhanovite enthusiasm is even more intense today than it was in Soviet Russia. It thrives in the jargon of Human Resource Management (HRM), as its constant calls to express our passion, individual creativity, innovation, and talents echo down through management structures.
But all this “positive” talk comes at a price. For over two decades, our research has charted the evolution of managerialism, HRM, employability, and performance management systems, all the way through to the cultures they create. We have shown how it leaves employees with a permanent sense of never feeling good enough and the nagging worry that someone else (probably right next to us) is always performing so much better.
From the mid-1990s, we charted the rise of a new language for managing people – one that constantly urges us to see work as a place where we should discover “who we truly are” and express that “unique” personal “potential” which could make us endlessly “resourceful”.
The speed with which this language grew and spread was remarkable. But even more remarkable are the ways in which it is now spoken seamlessly in all spheres of popular culture. This is no less than the very language of the modern sense of self. And so it cannot fail to be effective. Focusing on the “self” gives management unprecedented cultural power. It intensifies work in ways which are nearly impossible to resist. Who would be able to refuse the invitation to express themselves and their presumed potential or talents? Stakhanov was a kind of early poster boy for refrains like: “potential”, “talent”, “creativity”, “innovation”, “passion and commitment”, “continuous learning”, and “personal growth”. They have all become the attributes management systems now hail as the qualities of ideal “human resources”. These ideas have become so entrenched in the collective psyche that many people believe they are qualities they expect of themselves, at work, and at home.
The superhero worker
So, why does the specter of this long-forgotten miner still haunt our imaginations? In the 1930s, miners lay on their sides and used picks to work the coal, which was then loaded onto carts and pulled out of the shaft by pit ponies. Stakhanov came up with some innovations, but it was his adoption of the mining drill over the pick which helped drive his productivity. The mining drill was still a novelty and required specialist training in the 1930s because it was extremely heavy (more than 15kgs).
Once the Communist Party realized the potential of Stakhanov’s achievement, Stakhanovism took off rapidly. By the autumn of 1935, equivalents of Stakhanov emerged in every sector of industrial production. From machine-building and steelworks, to textile factories and milk production, record-breaking individuals were rising to the elite status of “Stakhanovite”. They were stimulated by the Communist Party’s ready adoption of Stakhanov as a leading symbol for a new economic plan. The party wanted to create an increasingly formalized elite representing the human qualities of a superhero worker.
Such workers began to receive special privileges (from high wages to new housing, as well as educational opportunities for themselves and their children). And so the Stakhanovites became central characters in Soviet Communist propaganda. They were showing the world what the USSR could achieve when technology was mastered by a new kind of worker who was committed, passionate, talented, and creative. This new worker was promising to be the force that would propel Soviet Russia ahead of its western capitalist rivals.
Soviet propaganda seized the moment. A whole narrative emerged showing how the future of work and productivity in the USSR should unfold over the coming decades. Stakhanov ceased to be a person and became the human form of a system of ideas and values, outlining a new mode of thinking and feeling about work.
It turns out that such a story was sorely needed. The Soviet economy was not performing well. Despite gigantic investments in technological industrialization during the so-called “First Five-Year Plan” (1928-1932), productivity was far from satisfactory. Soviet Russia had not overcome its own technological and economic backwardness, let alone leap over capitalist America and Europe.
‘Personnel decides everything’
The five-year plans were systematic programs of resource allocation, production quotas, and work rates for all sectors of the economy. The first aimed to inject the latest technology in key areas, especially industrial machine building. Its official Communist Party slogan was “Technology Decides Everything”. But this technological push failed to raise production; the standard of living and real wages ended up lower in 1932 than in 1928.
The “Second Five-Year Plan” (1933-1937) was going to have a new focus: “Personnel Decides Everything”. But not just any personnel. This was how Stakhanov stopped being a person and became an ideal type, a necessary ingredient in the recipe for this new plan.
On May 4, 1935, Stalin had already delivered an address entitled “Cadres [Personnel] Decide Everything”. So the new plan needed figures like Stakhanov. Once he showed that it could be done, in a matter of weeks, thousands of “record-breakers” were allowed to try their hand in every sector of production. This happened despite reservations from managers and engineers who knew that machines, tools, and people cannot withstand such pressures for any length of time.
Regardless, the party propaganda needed to let a new kind of working-class elite grow as if it was spontaneous – simple workers, coming from nowhere, driven by their refusal to admit quotas dictated by the limits of machines and engineers. Indeed, they were going to show the world that it was the very denial of such limitations that constituted the essence of personal involvement in work: break all records, accept no limits, show how every person and every machine is always capable of “more”.

On November 17, 1935, Stalin provided a definitive explanation of Stakhanovism. Closing the First Conference of Stakhanovites of Industry and Transport of the Soviet Union, he defined the essence of Stakhanovism as a leap in “consciousness” – not just a simple technical or institutional matter. Quite the contrary, the movement demanded a new kind of worker, with a new kind of soul and will, driven by the principle of unlimited progress. Stalin said:
These are new people, people of a special type … the Stakhanov movement is a movement of working men and women which sets itself the aim of surpassing the present technical standards, surpassing the existing designed capacities, surpassing the existing production plans and estimates. Surpassing them – because these standards have already become antiquated for our day, for our new people.
In the ensuing propaganda, Stakhanov became a symbol burdened with meanings. Ancestral hero, powerful, raw, and unstoppable. But also one with a modern, rational, and progressive mind which could liberate the hidden, untapped powers of technology and take command of its limitless possibilities. He was cast as a Promethean figure, leading an elite of workers whose nerves and muscles, minds, and souls, were utterly attuned to the technological production systems themselves. Stakhanovism was the vision of a new humanity.
‘The possibilities are endless’
The Stakhanovites’ celebrity status offered enormous ideological opportunities. It allowed the rise of production quotas. Yet this rise had to remain moderate, otherwise Stakhanovites could not be maintained as an elite. And, as an elite, Stakhanovites themselves had to be subjected to a limitation: how many top performers could really be accommodated before the very idea collapsed into normality? So quotas were engineered in a way which we might recognize today: by the forced distribution or “stack ranking” of all employees according to their performance.
After all, how many high-performers can there be at any one time? The former CEO of General Electric, Jack Welch, suggested 20% (no more, no less) every year. Indeed, the Civil Service in the UK operated on this principle until 2019 but used a 25% top performer quota. In 2013, Welch claimed this system was “nuanced and humane”, that it was all “about building great teams and great companies through consistency, transparency and candor” as opposed to “corporate plots, secrecy or purges”. Welch’s argument was, however, always flawed. Any forced distribution system inextricably leads to exclusion and marginalization of those who fall in the lower categories. Far from humane, these systems are always, inherently, threatening and ruthless.
And so Stakhanovism is still flowing through modern management systems and cultures, with their focus on employee performance and constant preoccupation with “high performing” individuals.
Something that often gets forgotten is that Stalinism itself was centered on an ideal of the individual soul and will: what is there that “I” am not able to do? Stakhanov fitted perfectly this ideal. Western culture has been telling itself the same ever since – “the possibilities are endless”.
This was the logic of the Stakhanovite Movement in the 1930s. But it is also the logic of contemporary popular and corporate cultures, whose messages are now everywhere. Promises that “possibilities are endless”, that potential is “limitless”, or that you can craft any future you want, can now be found in “inspirational” posts on social media, in management consultancy speil, and in just about every graduate job advertisement. One management consultancy firm even calls itself Infinite Possibilities.
Indeed, these very sentences made it onto a seemingly minor coffee coaster used by Deloitte in the early 2000s for their graduate management scheme. On one side it said: “The possibilities are endless.” While on the other side, it challenged the reader to take control of destiny itself: “It’s your future. How far will you take it?”

Insignificant though these objects may appear, a discerning future archaeologist would know that they carry a most fateful kind of thinking, driving employees now as much as it drove Stakhanovites.
But are these serious propositions, or just ironic tropes? Since the 1980s, management vocabularies have grown almost incessantly in this respect. The rapid proliferation of fashionable management trends follows the increased preoccupation with the pursuit of “endless possibilities”, of new and unlimited horizons of self-expression and self-actualization.
It is in this light that we have to show ourselves as worthy members of corporate cultures. Pursuing endless possibilities becomes central to our everyday working lives. The human type created by that Soviet ideology so many decades ago, now seems to gaze at us from mission statements, values, and commitments in meeting rooms, headquarters, and cafeterias – but also through every website and every public expression of corporate identity.
Stakhanovism’s essence was a new form of individuality, of self-involvement in work. And it is this form that now finds its home as much in offices, executive suites, corporate campuses, as in schools and universities. Stakhanovism has become a movement of the individual soul. But what does an office worker actually produce and what do Stakhanovites look like today?
Today’s corporate Stakhanovites
In 2020, the drama series, Industry, created by two people with direct experience of corporate workplaces, gave us a glimpse into modern Stakhanovism. It is a sensitive and detailed examination of the destinies of five graduates joining a fictional, but utterly recognizable, financial institution. The show’s characters become almost instantly ruthless neo-Stakhanovites. They knew and understood that it was not what they could produce that mattered for their own success, but how they performed their successful and cool personas on the corporate stage. It was not what they did but how they appeared that mattered.



The dangers of failing to appear extraordinary, talented, or creative were significant. The series showed how working life descends into unending personal, private, and public struggles. In them, every character loses a sense of direction and personal integrity. Trust disappears and their very sense of self increasingly dissolves.
Normal days of work, normal shifts, no longer exist. Workers have to perform endlessly, gesturing so that they look committed, passionate, and creative. These things are compulsory if employees are to retain some legitimacy in the workplace. So working life carries the weight of potentially determining a person’s sense of worth in every glance exchanged and in every inflection of seemingly insignificant interactions – whether in a board room, over a sandwich, or a cup of coffee.
Friendships become impossible because human connection is no longer desirable since trusting others weakens anyone whose success is at stake. Nobody wants to fall out of the Stakhanovite society of hyper-performing top talents. Performance appraisals that may lead to dismissal are a scary prospect. And this is the case both in the series and in real life.
The last episode of Industry culminates in half the remaining graduates getting sacked following an operation called “Reduction In Force”. This is basically a drastic final performance appraisal where each employee is forced to make a public statement arguing why they should remain – much like on the reality TV series The Apprentice. In Industry, the characters’ statements are broadcast on screens throughout the building as they describe what would make them stand out from the crowd and why they are worthier than all others.
Reactions to Industry emerged very quickly and viewers were enthusiastic about the show’s realism and how it resonated with their own experiences. One YouTube channel host with extensive experience of the sector reacted to each episode in turn; the business press too reacted promptly, alongside other media. They converged in their conclusions: this is a serious corporate drama whose realism reveals much of the essence of work cultures today.
Industry is important because it touches directly on an experience so many have: the sense of a continuous competition of all against all. When we know that performance appraisals compare us all against each other, the consequences on mental health can be severe.



This idea is taken further in an episode of Black Mirror. Entitled “Nosedive“, the story depicts a world in which everything we think, feel and do becomes the object of everyone else’s rating. What if every mobile phone becomes the seat of a perpetual tribunal that decides our personal value – beyond any possibility of appeal? What if everyone around us becomes our judge? What does life feel like when all we have to measure ourselves by are other people’s instant ratings of us?
We asked these questions in detail in our research which charted the evolution of performance management systems and the cultures they create over two decades. We found that performance appraisals are becoming more public (just as in Industry), involving staff in 360-degree systems in which every individual is rated anonymously by colleagues, managers, and even clients on multiple dimensions of personal qualities.
Management systems focusing on individual personality are now combining with the latest technologies to become permanent. Ways of reporting continuously on every aspect of our personality at work are increasingly seen as central to mobilizing “creativity” and “innovation”.
And so it might be that the atmosphere of Stakhanovite competition today is more dangerous than in 1930s Soviet Russia. It is even more pernicious because it is now driven by a confrontation between people, a confrontation between the worth of “me” against the worth of “you” as human beings – not just between the worth of what “I am able to do” against what “you are able to do”. It is a matter of a direct encounter of personal characters and their own sense of worth that has become the medium of competitive, high-performance work cultures.
The Circle, by Dave Eggers, is perhaps the most nuanced exploration of the world of 21st-century Stakhanovism. Its characters, plot and context, its attention to detail, bring to light what it means to take up one’s personal destiny in the name of the imperative to hyper-perform and over-perform one’s self and everyone around us.
When the ultimate dream of becoming the central star of corporate culture comes true, a new Stakhanov is born. But who can maintain this kind of hyper-performative life? Is it even possible to be excellent, extraordinary, creative, and innovative all day long? How long can a shift of performative work be anyway? The answer turns out not to be fictional at all.
Stakhanovism’s limits
In the summer of 2013, an intern at a major city financial institution, Moritz Erhardt, was found dead one morning in the shower of his flat. It turns out that Erhardt really did try to put in a neo-Stakhanovite shift: three days and three nights of continuous work (known among London City workers and taxi drivers as a “magic roundabout”).

A year on from intern Moritz Erhardt’s death, has the banking industry changed its ways? http://t.co/SHEDDFOOfb pic.twitter.com/ZetsLV4Oga
— The Independent (@Independent) August 10, 2014

But his body could not take it. We examined this case in detail in our previous research as well as anticipating just such a tragic scenario a year before it happened. In 2010, we reviewed a decade of the Times 100 Graduate Employers and showed explicitly how such jobs can embody the spirit of neo-Stakhanovism.
Then in 2012, we published our review which signaled the dangers of the hyper-performative mold promoted in such publications. We argued that the graduate market is driven by an ideology of potentiality which is likely to overwhelm anyone who follows it too closely in the real world. A year later, this sense of danger became real in Erhardt’s case.
Stakhanov died after a stroke in Donbass, in eastern Ukraine, in 1977. A city in the region is named after him. The legacy of his achievement – or at least the propaganda that perpetuated it – lives on.
But the truth is that people do have limits. They do now, just as they did in the USSR in the 1930s. Possibilities are not infinite. Working towards goals of endless performance, growth and personal potential is simply not possible. Everything is finite.
Who we are and who we become when we work are actually fundamental and very concrete aspects of our everyday lives. Stakhanovite models of high-performance have become the register and rhythm of our working lives even though we no longer remember who Stakhanov was.
The danger is that we will not be able to sustain this rhythm. Just as the characters in Industry, Black Mirror, or The Circle, our working lives take destructive, toxic, and dark forms because we inevitably come up against the very real limits of our own purported potential, creativity, or talent.

Work and life should NOT be ‘balanced’,Justin Pot,2021/05/28,"
It’s hard to notice oddities in your culture — they just feel “normal.” But there’s nothing universal about what you consider common sense. It’s all shaped by the world you grew up in.
The book American Ways by Gary Althen taught me this clearly. The intended audience is non-Americans who need to interact with Americans, so the book is full of tidbits that make me feel like an alien specimen undergoing examination. Like this:
When they first encounter another person, Americans engage in a kind of conversation they call small talk. The most common topic of small talk is the weather. Another very common topic is what the speakers “do,” meaning, normally, what jobs they have.
The book goes on like this, for 300 pages, describing all kinds of behavior I consider normal in clinical terms. It’s mind-bending.
But pay attention to the second example of small talk: what you “do.” Think about that: one of our most common subjects of conversation is, more or less, “what labor do you engage in so that you can earn money?”
This is not universal. In some cultures, the answer to “what do you do?” is to talk about what you do for fun. But here, in North America, we talk about work. That means something, especially in our current “hustle culture” moment.
Which brings me to the idea of work-life balance, as understood by knowledge workers.
“Work-life balance” is kind of a messed up phrase
Picture, if you will, a scale.
Credit: Unsplash
No, not like that. Picture an old-timey balancing scale.
Credit: Unsplash
Yeah, like that. Imagine, if you will, putting your work on one side of that scale. Then imagine putting literally everything else about yourself — your friends, your hobbies, your family, your relationships, your beliefs, your favorite sports team, the movies you like, and so on — on the other side.
Do you think the scale should be tilted evenly?
Balance is a bias
The phrase “work-life balance” is, itself, an argument. Those words put the world into two categories — work and everything else — and imply that these two categories should be given more or less equal weight. And this, mind you, is the phrase used to suggest a healthier alternative to burnout.
I’m not saying we should all stop using the phrase “work-life balance.” Workplaces where employees put in grueling hours, to the point where it’s impossible to have a life outside of work, really are a problem, and all too often, workplace culture reinforces this. It’s easy for that to develop on a team if leadership isn’t intentional about it. I believe most managers and executives who use the term “work-life balance” are trying to make life better for their employees.
Having said that, I think our culture’s obsession with work is easy to ignore, and I think the phrase points to it.
Work and life aren’t opposites
Our culture glorifies work. Most of our TV dramas and sitcoms are set in workspaces. Social media feeds are full of hustlers working long hours in the workplace, then heading home to work on their side hustle. It’s easy to feel like work is the place where you should try to find meaning in life, and that you should constantly be trying to get to the next goal by working harder.
But you don’t have to. You can stay where you are, if your needs are being met. There’s no rule that says you have to advance, or that your business has to keep growing. You can get yourself to a reasonable place, and then stop. Turns out that’s perfectly legal.
That isn’t to say you can’t get satisfaction out of work. You can. I get a lot of joy out of writing and would probably spend a good chunk of every day doing it even if no one was paying me. Every so often, I write things I’m proud of. Sometimes strangers get in touch to tell me it meant a lot of them. It’s a great feeling, and I could imagine spending all of my time chasing it.
But there are other things worth chasing — sunsets, music, conversation, mountains, perfect pets, pizza, friends, laughter, and so much more.
This might seem obvious to you. I, personally, have had to learn this lesson over time, in part by having friends repeat it to me multiple times in situations where it should be obvious.
So I’m learning to put work in its place. I’m setting up guardrails so that I remember to stop working when it’s time. I try to automate busywork, then use the time I free up to do something else. And I try not to use working from home as an excuse to work more often. It’s not about balance — it’s about keeping things in perspective.
Work might be personally meaningful to you, or it might not be. But it’s not who you are, or even necessarily the most interesting thing about you. Work can just be a thing you sometimes do and occasionally bring up in conversation (when the weather isn’t interesting enough, anyway).

How to make it as a ‘non-specialist’ founder,Andrea Hak,2021/05/27,"
What do you need to start a successful business? Common sense would say business smarts and of course the know-how to succeed in your industry. But what if you only have the former?
The rise of serial entrepreneurship has brought about the era of the non-specialist entrepreneur. These entrepreneurs are generalists who specialize in starting, operating, and scaling businesses and not in the ins and outs of the industry they’re looking to disrupt. 
You’ll find them across all industries, with the most lucrative being those still on the cusp of their technological revolution. If your aim is to build and scale a successful business, why would you enter the overcrowded world of dating apps or food delivery? It’s the (let’s admit it) ‘less sexy’ industries like manufacturing, construction, and real estate where the real potential for disruption and success lies. 
Agritech in particular is a great example of an industry that was lagging behind in terms of tech adoption but is now experiencing a boom, with entrepreneurs applying new technologies to solve the biggest challenges facing farmers. 
But can non-specialists actually be successful in industries they don’t fully understand? And, perhaps key to this question, how do they actually gain trust from customers who are experts in their field?
We spoke with three Agritech entrepreneurs from X-Europe‘s Deeptech accelerator program about why they chose this field, how they broke into the industry, and what it took to develop and scale a successful business as a non-specialist. 
Could Agritech be a gold rush sector for serial entrepreneurs?
The global population is set to reach almost ten billion by 2050. In order to feed a population of this size, we’ll need to produce 60% more food. 
The problem is, farming is also one of the most taxing activities on the planet, taking up 70% of freshwater resources and 38% of the world’s land surface. The conundrum we find ourselves in is the need to increase food production at a rapid rate, while also decreasing our impact on the environment. 
Investors are already pumping money into this fast growing industry. In 2019, the global Agritech market was valued at $17,442.7 million and is projected to reach $41,172.5 million by 2027.
According to estimates by McKinsey&Company, with the rise of frontier connectivity technologies like LPWAN, 5G, and LEO satellites, roughly 80% of the world’s rural areas will be connected by 2030. This means greater access to data for the farming industry and a realm of new digital tools. The endless possibilities that increased connectivity could bring has the potential to add an extra $500 billion to global gross domestic product.
All of these factors make the industry ripe for disruption. But what if your only farming experience comes from playing hours of FarmVille?
Are tech expertise and entrepreneurial smarts enough to break into a completely foreign industry?
Alban Pobla, CEO of Dilepix, is the perfect example of an entrepreneur who doesn’t want to limit himself to one field. Instead, he’s used his expertise in robotics to explore new possibilities across industries.
As an entrepreneur, I’ve always been involved in projects working to solve the world’s major problems. Now, as an ‘agripreneur’ I try to make industrial agriculture (which will feed ten billion people in 2050) sustainable and lucrative with the use of technology and innovative business models. 
Agriculture is a great playground for those, like me, who love computer vision, edge computing, robotics, artificial intelligence, big data analysis and remains one of the last industries to have not yet made its digital transformation. This sector is full of opportunities for those who know how to seize them.
And that’s exactly what he did with Dilepix. The company’s software solution combines computer vision, deep learning, and robotics to help agricultural businesses solve a wide range of challenges including detecting crop diseases and weeds, fighting off pest invasions, monitoring livestock, making machinery more precise and autonomous, and more. 

For those who believe specialists are the only ones with the know-how to break into an industry, Pobla and his team are proving them wrong. As he explained, their experience and knowledge in the latest technology and how to apply it to different markets has actually really helped the team see problems from a different perspective.
Having experience in other industries keeps us from having blinders on. We’re ready to reconsider all the assumptions of the agricultural industry, because technological advances allow today (or will allow tomorrow) solutions that were once impossible and long ruled out, when they now have their place. 
Finally, there are always good practices which are universal and which we do not hesitate to apply at Dilepix, in particular, in terms of marketing, communications, customer relations, open innovation with large distributors, etc.
He shared that the key to closing the knowledge gap when breaking into a new industry is to get out there and start talking. 
Before and since the creation of Dilepix, we have carried out many interviews (over a hundred!) with all the players in the agricultural value chain to understand their needs. We go out into the fields and farms and compare our proposals with the daily reality of our customers. We started with the early adopters who were interested in technology and ready to follow us. Then we gradually moved up to those who have a functional interest in our solution. 
We always give ourselves time to discuss and exchange again and again with our prospects and our customers!
Winning over trust with the experts
Even with all the latest cutting edge technology in the world, as an outsider, it must be difficult to convince farmers who’ve been working in the industry their whole lives to try new ways of doing things. How do you win over their trust?
Tamás Bodnár, CEO of Agroninja knows this struggle well. 
It’s a challenge, even if you’re in this business for ten years, because you don’t have a farm. If you don’t have a farm and you’re not a farmer, and you are even further if you’re a tech guy from thousands of kilometers away.
His company’s first product, beefie, is a user-friendly application that solves what some might call a very large problem in the cattle industry. Like paying taxes, weighing cattle is one of those necessary evils that takes time and causes stress for both the animal and the worker tasked with leading and keeping a stubborn steer on a scale. 
With beefie, farmers can simply take a photo of the cattle in question with their phone, without having to disturb them from their grazing. Within 20 seconds they’ll have an accurate reading of the animal’s weight. 

I think the most effective way to gain trust is to be humble and ask good questions. Even if you don’t know everything about the industry, knowing the right questions to ask the experts (your customers) is the most important thing. 
We never want to tell them how to do their daily work, we just try to show them how our application could help complete a task (which is really a pain) in a way that’s faster, not stressful for the cattle or the individual, and much more cost effective.
When it comes to converting that trust into higher volumes, Bodnár admitted that, in the Agritech industry, it’s difficult to grow by word of mouth. He explained that, even if a farmer is happy with your product, they’re unlikely to spread the word to other farmers in the area as they’re usually not as extroverted as your typical influencer.
The Agroninja team also tried connecting with national bodies like agricultural chambers, breeding associations, and agricultural ministries, but this didn’t have as big an impact as expected. 
Instead, the company’s (quite unexpected) breakthrough came from a small article in a Dutch agricultural magazine. Somewhere along the way it was picked up by Brazilian farmers, translated into Portuguese, and as Bodnár described, Brazilians soon ‘stormed’ their website. Now a lot of their customers and newsletter subscribers are based in Brazil. The jump from their much smaller Hungarian customer base to Brazil opened up a huge market for growth. 
You may be surprised to find there are a plethora of trade magazines and media for the agricultural industry, even drilling down to niche topics like cattle herding or poultry. A placement in one of these publications could just give you the reach and credibility you need. 
Convincing customers to take the first bite
If you thought convincing farmers to adopt new technology was hard, imagine trying to convince the wider public to add a pinch of grasshoppers to their daily diet.
Hargol FoodTech grows grasshoppers for human consumption with their main focus being in two sectors: 

 The ‘New Meat’ market – improving meat products and plant based meat products with a boost of protein, health and environmental benefits, and added functionality including natural colors, flavors, and the enhanced ability to bind water and fat. 
 Fuel for fitness buffs –  their research shows grasshoppers are superior to whey protein and provide better amino acid distribution to athletes. 

As CEO Dror Tamir explained: 
Seven years ago I became aware of the global protein challenge and started looking for solutions. I remembered a story my grandparents told me as a young boy in Kibbutz Ma’anit. In the 1950’s Israel suffered from food insecurity and locust swarms (grasshoppers) flying in from Africa and destroying crops. While the Kibbutz members tried to save the crops and scare the grasshoppers away, they saw Yemenite Jews coming to the fields to collect and eat them. 
I learned that grasshoppers are food for many people around the globe. They’re actually nature’s most efficient protein source.
Even for a completely different and unconventional niche like grasshopper farming, Tamir shared that the same tried and tested business rules still apply.
Like in any other sales process you need to understand the needs and pain of your customer. We did a lot of research into the pains of the meat industry, the fitness industry, and the benefits grasshoppers can provide. 
The first thing we learned was that it’s important to keep the message focused and simple. Customers’ attention nowadays is very short. The second was to prioritize the benefits and focus on one or two that matter most. 
The education process is long for this kind of product, so third was full collaboration with media and opinion leaders on social media to achieve maximum and long term exposure.
For those thinking about starting a business as a non-specialist, whether in Agritech or any other field, Tamir left us with the following tips:

 Learn, learn, and learn. Never stop learning.
 Build a founding team with experts in the fields you lack knowledge in, especially the ones that matter the most for your new business.

Finally, the most important piece of advice all three entrepreneurs shared was to listen to your customers. They’re the real experts, and if you gain their trust by showing you really want to build a product that works for them, you’ll get the key insights you need to build a successful business.

I bootstrapped my company to a $500M+ valuation — here are my top 5 learnings,Ross Andrew Paquette,2021/05/25,"
I’m a big advocate of bootstrapping a startup’s growth rather than taking on VC funding. It’s an approach I took from day one with my company and it undoubtedly contributed to our success. 
I want other startup founders to know that it’s possible to build a wildly successful SaaS business without VC funding, angel investors, or taking on shoulder-crushing traditional debt.
Those who have bootstrapped a startup previously will more than likely relate to the lessons I’m going to touch on, which I hope will inspire and help those who are looking to start their first business.
We didn’t use any top-secret growth hacks or have game-changing connections in the early days of Maropost. We started at zero and grew our user base and MRR entirely bootstrapped throughout the years.
Whether you have struck out in pursuit of funding or simply don’t want to give up equality and face possible dilution down the line, I hope my lessons inspire you to consider bootstrapping and take the entrepreneurial leap.
1. Focus on building a brand from day one
The only way you will differentiate your company from the other options available is to have a strong brand, from the name of your company to its messaging. We put a lot of thought into branding from the beginning.
It’s much harder to backtrack and try to establish a brand down the line if you realize you swung and missed. A company may offer a quality product or service, but a generic non-brandable name will leave them sitting dead in the water.
There is an element of trust associated with a strong brand name. With a SaaS, the name is extremely important. A strong brand name is short and unique, while also having unlimited branding potential. I felt “Maropost” checked all of the boxes.
2. Get your MVP to market quickly for valuable feedback
Many founders want to wait until their product is deemed “perfect” in their eyes before launching. This is the worst mistake you can make — it’s never going to be perfect. Get your MVP (minimum viable product) live ASAP, and get it in as many hands as possible.
The early feedback and input you receive will allow you to make a much better product that the masses will love. If you keep waiting for perfection and delaying, you will never launch. This is also a great way to get a feel for overall interest and set realistic early revenue goals.
I’m a perfectionist just like every entrepreneur, but I learned first-hand the importance of getting your product into the hands of users quickly provides you with invaluable feedback. This ultimately helps you to build a much better product.
To this day we continue to listen to our users and take their feedback seriously when developing new features. Listen to your users — they are your most valuable asset.
3. Make profitability a focus and know your numbers
Being self-funded forces you to know your numbers. Each month’s budget is determined by what you made the month prior. I quickly learned the importance of knowing our numbers and I believe it makes you a much more disciplined founder when you are not spending someone else’s funds.
When you are bootstrapped you have to generate revenue to stay above water — there are no other options. It’s sink or swim, and that pressure will force you to make running a profitable company a priority.
I would highly suggest that you re-invest every possible dollar back into your business. When you start out you will be running as lean as possible — we were in the same boat. Once we became more profitable we kept the same bootstrap mentality, re-investing into the business.
The difference down the road is that you now have other options — you can put more money towards content marketing, paid advertising, etc. — to fuel your customer acquisition growth.
Even when the flood gates open and your profitability increases, continue to run a tight ship budget-wise and use your money intelligently. The more focused you are on profitability, the more cash you can deploy into growth initiatives. This is how we were able to scale to the point we are at now.
4. Hire the best talent slow and fire fast when necessary
Your business is only as good as its employees. They represent your brand and they are ultimately the reason your business experiences success and growth. I made it a point to always hire the best talent for every position, from entry-level to executive.
Take your time during the search process. With so much technology available to aid your search for the best candidates there is never a shortage of applicants. I made it a point to be highly diligent, continuing to barrow down the candidates until I found the best person for the role.
Not every hire will be your best, either, and that is to be expected. Sometimes it’s a bad judge of character or you may have been rushed due to fast growth and the immediate need to fill a position.
If you have a bad hire fire them as quickly as possible. I’ve learned that people typically don’t change — the sooner you remove a problematic employee the better. Trust me; the damage will be far more severe if you keep a cancerous employee around.
5. Automate everything you can
I love automation, and I have found that it can be one of the most crucial aspects when it comes to scaling and growth. There are services, SaaS tools, and apps that can help you automate so many different parts of your business and its operations.
From automated payment and billing notifications to onboarding and feature emails, we have streamlined as much as possible. This frees up your team to focus on the most important tasks. 
This doesn’t mean that you should rely entirely on automated workflows — some parts of your business still need that human touch to satisfy the needs and wants of your customers.
Finding the perfect balance between automation and human interaction will vary greatly from company to company. It’s important to find the balance that works best for your business.

Even ‘dream jobs’ have their flaws: Why honesty is the best recruiting tool,The Conversation,2021/05/20,"
What happens when you land your dream job but it turns out to be anything but?
Friends, career consultants, and the media inundate us with a constant barrage of advice telling us to follow our dreams, find our bliss or pursue our passions in our professional lives. Yet this kind of advice is not always easily followed.
Even when it’s heeded, the advice can come with downsides, especially when it turns out that those aforementioned passions involve jobs with routine, day-to-day tasks that people are less than passionate about. In short, work is often hard work.

We’re told to follow our passions in our careers. But what happens when the job you’ve clamored for is mired in drudgery?
People land jobs in data science and artificial intelligence, for example, expecting to create brilliant algorithms that will solve big problems. But they often end up performing menial data collection and cleaning tasks. The excitement of working for a startup loses its luster with difficult and boring work often outside an employee’s primary areas of interest.
And not everyone promoted to the lauded ranks of management is thrilled to be there performing management tasks, or even see the job as a step up.
 
People romanticize working in the media, fashion, film, fine and performing arts, and other cultural industries, but the work often ends up being more drudgery than glamour. Any job, especially an entry-level position, has elements of drudgery.
‘Glossy work’ is lackluster
This gap between expectations and the day-to-day reality of jobs is a phenomenon we’ve labeled as “glossy work” in a recently published study.
For the study, we interviewed magazine fact-checkers who worked for high-status organizations in a glamorous industry while performing menial tasks every day. They experienced a kind of dissonance between their work and its setting.
As one fact-checker described it:
“Because you’re affiliated with the magazine, people think you’re a strange type of royalty no matter how you’re affiliated.”
We examined how this phenomenon affects them.
For employees, the glossy work dissonance can spur attempts to change the actual job, frustration, and a quick exit from the position. Glossy work also creates a dilemma about how to present the work and themselves to the world. How do they balance their simultaneous needs for self-enhancement and to be fully understood and authentic?
Glossing over mundane work
We find they do so by differentiating their descriptions of their jobs across different audiences. When talking to complete outsiders — people at social gatherings, for example — they focus on the more glamorous aspects: working in journalism and for glossy magazines.
For the high-status writers they collaborate with, they focus on their own expertise and other status markers. And to insiders, they present a more complete view of their work.
Presenting themselves differently depending on who they’re talking to can mean that anyone who is not a true insider at the company ends up with a partial or biased view of the work. The full nature of the work is often glossed over, and that’s a problem for those considering taking one of these jobs.
When they only hear about the gloss, prospective employees end up with false expectations that tend to fuel the cycle of disappointment.

If you’re only hearing about the glossy elements of a potential job opportunity, you’ll end up feeling disappointed.
Potential employees can get around this by doing more careful research on the true nature of the jobs they’re considering taking. They should ask questions about the position’s day-to-day requirements and consult a range of people who currently have the job or who have previously held it.
What employers can do
“Glossy work” also comes at a cost to employers as they try to manage worker frustration and staff turnover. They can stop this vicious cycle by providing realistic job previews. This doesn’t mean they should only show the negative side of work, but they should provide an honest balance of the glamorous and less glamorous aspects of the job.
Employers may also want to consider alternative ways of assembling tasks so that the less pleasant tasks are spread across employees and jobs.

Allowing employees to help craft their job descriptions and create new opportunities can be helpful.
They may also want to be open to employee efforts to craft and tweak their jobs and create new opportunities within their organizations.
Ultimately, however, performing many mundane tasks remains a reality in all jobs despite the promise that AI will eliminate more and more rote chores.
What’s more, hiring managers should exercise caution when listing “passion” as a job requirement. In an analysis of more than 200 interviews for a project on startup hiring, passion was a frequent subject of discussion. Hiring managers looked for it. Potential employees wanted to live their passion.
Yet none of the hiring managers who were looking for passion in their prospective employees could describe how they would assess passion in candidates, or why it was important for the specific job being filled. The risk here is that they hire people who are passionate and then provide work that either doesn’t match or douses that passion, creating a problematic situation for both employee and employer.

My team had a ‘no meeting week’ to ease Zoom fatigue — here’s how it went,TJ Leonard,2021/05/14,"
After one year of working from home, I knew my team needed a change. 
Judging by conversations I had with colleagues, family, and friends, it was becoming very clear that the new-to-remote workforce was on the fast track to hitting a collective wall.
 Generally, we try to keep our ears close to the ground when it comes to listening to employee feedback at Storyblocks so we can spot any mounting issues and nip them in the bud quickly. In the early days of the pandemic, this meant figuring out creative ways to maintain our company culture while working remotely. 
So we went all-in and enrolled in virtual cooking classes, collaborated to crack the code in a virtual escape room, and gathered employees based on shared interests outside of work with interest-based clubs like podcasts and book clubs. 
We also launched some of our newest business resource groups (BRGs) in an effort to unite employees within our workplace based on shared characteristics or life experiences as our team continues to grow and evolve.
But while these initiatives helped foster an increased sense of connection and belonging among employees, they did not address the percolating problem that many companies are up against now – employee burnout.
Enter: No Meeting Week
After surveying Storyblocks employees and doing some digging to find the spark that lit the match of employee burnout, we found that Zoom fatigue was a recurring theme driving burnout. 
When we looked at how much time Storyblocks employees were spending in meetings across all of our departments, we found that it ranged from around 40 to upwards of 80% of their workday, with certain teams that meet as a core function of their productivity (i.e. product and marketing teams) over-indexing on time in meetings in comparison to time in “deep work” phases. And while this percentage of meetings may have been similar to pre-pandemic, there was one main difference – meetings were now on video.
Zoom fatigue has become a common culprit of employee burnout throughout the pandemic. According to the Zoom Exhaustion and Fatigue Scale, created by Jeremy Bailenson, founding director of Stanford University’s Virtual Human Interaction Lab, there are five different types of fatigue associated with video calls: 

general (overall tiredness)
social (wanting to be alone)
emotional (being overwhelmed and “used up”)
visual (symptoms of stress on one’s eyes)
and finally, motivational (lacking the drive to start new activities).

Additionally, video calls contribute to the “always on” mentality that has resulted from working from home during the pandemic, which has made it difficult for many people to discern where work ends and home life/personal time begins. 
When doing research on employee burnout, we quickly found that this problem was something many companies are also up against. For example, to persuade people to take time off, Google has started offering a bonus vacation day for those who book time off. PwC has also started offering their US-based employees $250 for every full week of vacation booked, up to $1,000 a year. 
But while these programs are substantial and tackle the problem of employees not taking their PTO, we wanted to make sure whatever initiatives we put into place hit at the real root of our employees’ burnout. 
That’s why we decided to initiate a ‘No Meeting Week’ to enable heads down, uninterrupted work time that would help our employees recharge and catch up on larger projects.
What we found
Following No Meeting Week, we conducted an internal survey to get a sense of whether or not the initiative was successful at easing employee burnout, and I’m happy to say the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. 
In fact, nearly three-quarters of employees who participated in the survey said they had more time for their personal life throughout the week and nearly 90% of employees said they were more productive compared to a normal week. 
They also said they appreciated the added flexibility of not being tied to a strict meeting schedule, and felt like everyone they spoke with were in a noticeably better mood throughout the week. 
Other positive outcomes included: added flexibility, more consistent sleep patterns, slack traffic decreased, and more time for reflection and ad-hoc discussions. 
Interestingly, while it technically was No Meeting Week, many employees found that they collaborated much more in an organic fashion than they normally do throughout the week, and ad-hoc meetings felt more purposeful and organic. 
Last, but definitely not least, our employees across the board reported having a more positive attitude toward the work they were doing. That’s a big win in my book.

Keeping up the momentum
In order to keep up the positive momentum from No Meeting Week, we will be testing out a summer break in July, where all employees will be taking the same week off. 
I’m hoping this will enable employees to really disconnect and focus on personal time by reducing back-and-forth emails throughout the week. 
Additionally, we have reinforced the idea that going “camera-on” for meetings is optional, and we’ve encouraged all employees to “audit” their meetings to ensure that they are productive and actionable for all attendees.
While we are all still new to remote work, the solutions we’re uncovering to combat the issues that come with it are building the framework for a more positive work culture than we’ve seen in years past. 
Over the past year, our experience learning how to tackle these new workplace challenges will be an important skill for us as we move toward ironing out what the best hybrid model will look like for current employees and future generations.

3 big mistakes I’ve made in my career as a software engineer,.cult,2021/05/13,"
This article was originally published by Emma Bostian on .cult by Honeypot, a Berlin-based community platform for developers. For the latest updates, follow .cult by Honeypot on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin, and YouTube.
I vividly remember my first week as a Software Engineer at IBM. I was bright-eyed out of college and slightly egotistical.
“I deserve this job,” I thought, “Web development is easy; I’ll get promoted in no time!”
And then I made my first huge mistake: I forgot to test my code before merging it to master.
In college, I took one entry-level web development course, where they taught you that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript exist and you should use Bootstrap and PHP. Testing was never discussed and as a result I was embarrassingly unaware that just because my pull request was approved didn’t mean I could merge without second glance.
I promptly received an angry phone call from a Scottish senior developer reprimanding me for my lack of oversight. I had broken everyone’s development environment. We quickly rolled back to the previous version while I scowled in my office.
I never forgot to test my code from that day forward.
We all make mistakes; it’s part of the learning process. But making mistakes doesn’t have to be a bad thing as long as you learn from them.
Here are three of the biggest mistakes I made during my career. I hope you can learn from them, as I have, and grow as a developer and as a person.
1. Not asking questions
As a new hire, and even more so as a woman in a team full of men, I was nervous about asking questions for fear of sounding stupid.
I was afraid to ask questions which would expose my programming ignorance, and this greatly impeded my growth as a developer.
Once I built a strong rapport with my team members, I began asking more questions. I learned how to strike the balance of researching the answer and not wasting time looking on my own. And once I got over my fear of asking questions I learned more quickly.
Every developer starts from zero, and while we all learn at different speeds, we all have to go through the same process.
It is vital to ask questions if you don’t understand.
When you ask questions in-context, both you and your colleagues waste less time. If your question can be easily solved by a quick Google search, first take the time to do some high-level research. This will save your colleague the frustration of answering a question you could have found the answer for on your own, and it will save you the embarrassment of being told so (this happened to me at IBM and I will never forget it).
2. Assuming everyone communicates the same way I do
At IBM I worked with international colleagues, and now living in Germany as an American I work on a team with six different nationalities. And it wasn’t until a year of living abroad that I realized every culture has a different idea of what “good communication” means.
I had numerous miscommunications with my German manager as we would both walk away from a meeting with different ideas of what the next step was, and this led to frustration and inadvertent turmoil within the team.
Then I stumbled upon the book The Culture Map by Erin Meyer in the Frankfurt Airport and it changed my outlook on life.
Different cultures have different communication processes; some are high-context communicators and read in-between the lines (like people from Germany) while other cultures are low-context communicators and require explicit and redundant communication (like people from the United States).
It’s no wonder I had massive communication problems with my team and my manager; we were communicating differently!
From that day forward I vowed to learn more about communication and building solid professional relationships, and it has greatly improved team rapport.
Multi-cultural teams need low-context processes. All communication should be explicit, spelling out exactly who is responsible for which task, and backed-up in writing which is then distributed to the team through Slack or email.
Learning some of the cultural differences between you and your coworkers, as it relates to giving constructive criticism, communicating, even scheduling meetings, will greatly enhance your interpersonal relationships and your team dynamic.
3. Taking constructive criticism personally
Constructive criticism is important to grow as a developer and also as a human, yet to this day I struggle with taking constructive criticism personally.
When someone gives me constructive criticism, my first instinct is to interpret this as a reflection of my personal identity; it feels as though they’re attacking who I am.
In reality my colleagues are helping me by identifying the areas for improvement, and this is truly a gift. It demonstrates that they see potential for me to be successful, and they’re helping me reach that milestone.
Create a safe space to receive and give constructive criticism. It’s best to set a meeting to discuss this topic, where both parties know exactly what to expect, and to do it in private.
And when someone gives you a piece of constructive criticism that you don’t believe is true, don’t immediately get defensive and shut down. Take some time to process what they’ve just suggested and truly see whether their feedback holds some truth.
These are only a handful of mistakes I have made during my career, and I hope you can learn from them. You’re not expected to be a perfect employee and teammate, but having the ability to understand your flaws and learn from your mistakes will improve your job performance and set you on the road to success.

My startup tripled in size in 2020: Here’s what I learned,Thierry Schellenbach,2021/05/12,"
Many founders openly talk about the challenges and triumphs that come with expanding product offerings and adding customers. But adding colleagues — especially in a remote environment — comes with its own set of growing pains and valuable lessons. 
I experienced that first-hand last year when my team tripled in size. It wasn’t easy, but I learned great lessons that made me a better entrepreneur. So let me share what I discovered while scaling our team at a rate that none of us had anticipated.
First up: Context
When my team closed our $15 million Series A funding round last August, I wouldn’t have guessed that just six months later we would follow up with our $38 million Series B round. 
However, as a provider of enterprise-grade cloud components that enables software teams to add in-app chat and activity feeds to their products, maybe it shouldn’t have come as a surprise. Our rapid growth came as chat emerged as the dominant medium for day-to-day communications in our new virtual reality. 
So to sum up our growth: in 2020, we saw a 517% increase in revenue from our chat API product, while more than doubling our user base to support more than a billion end users. 
Our team size tripled from 31 to 93 employees, and the headcount continues to increase almost daily. Today, we employ 116 people across our offices in Boulder, Colo., Amsterdam, and remotely worldwide. 
A lot of people and a lot of challenges, here’s what I learned from it.
Take one step back, two steps forward  
One of the most pressing issues we faced as a team while expanding was a customer onboarding bottleneck. We prioritize supporting our customers with quick response times and thorough solutions, and this became increasingly difficult to maintain while simultaneously ramping up hiring. 
As Stream’s customer base grew, I found it presented a catch-22: there was a need to focus energy on onboarding new customers and ensuring customer satisfaction, but we needed the personnel resources to do so. 
Then to keep up with customer demand, our new team members had to hit the ground sprinting. While that might be an easy default when things are hectic, it wasn’t setting employees up for success.
That’s why my team and I took a step back to assess our processes, and ultimately, we temporarily shifted our focus to ensure we were properly hiring and training new employees. Of course, doing so required resources from existing team members, and as a result, some core competencies and initiatives had to be paused. 
For many founders and leaders, this might feel like a hard pill to swallow during a high-growth period, but I think it can definitely be worth it. It’s a short-term decline in speed that will allow you to pick up ten-fold in the long run. 
Support existing employees  
As the team grows, existing employees will naturally develop in their roles. Particularly, employees who were previously one-person departments may start managing teams for the first time. 
This was especially true for us because we often intentionally hire people who might be one level below the title, and we encourage them to grow at Stream. Snowflake CEO Frank Slootman writes about this concept in his book Tape Sucks, if you want to dive deeper into it.
While there is ample value in this hiring approach, I soon realized I needed to make sure new managers had the proper resources and felt supported in their accelerated growth. 
Over time, I became better at coaching managers to clearly communicate goals and check in regularly with their direct reports. I think it’s also smart to look for the tools that can help you at this point. For me, Lattice was the right to help us streamline this process and create organized accountability. 
I also discovered that as a founder of an early-stage startup, you’re directly leading people who do the work and execute. As the team expands, that leadership role evolves and becomes more indirect. 
So in order for your startup to successfully scale, it’s imperative that you and early employees trust incoming leadership hires to run their respective departments. This process can be hard because founders especially are used to having a hand in everything, but it’s necessary to relinquish some control and let others make decisions.
Evolve the culture
Lastly, the culture will evolve whether you want it to or not, and it’s essential to take an active role in shaping it. 
In the early days of a startup with a small team, you naturally develop close relationships with your co-workers as you’re working long hours in close proximity. As that team doubles, triples, and even quadruples, the dynamic will inevitably shift. This is where it’s key to step in with intention. 
Initially, my co-founder Tommaso Barbugli and I leaned on HR for help, focusing on the obvious things like benefits, perks, and fun team-building events. However, as the dust settled, we realized we needed to think bigger in terms of the culture we wanted to cultivate. 
We agreed that it’s important to us to make Stream a place where people can learn the skills they might need to pursue their own projects or startups in the future, as I believe employees feel most content when they are progressing and acquiring new abilities. 
To accomplish this, we’re starting to develop open resources such as dedicated Slack channels for learning about startups and certain coding languages, weekly technical training opportunities for employees outside the engineering department, and more. 
The lesson here is that during this liminal (and hectic) period, there’s actually ample opportunity to thoughtfully mold your company culture. A happy, healthy team is the best investment you can make as a founder to sustain your business for the long term. 
Scale with intention
Ultimately, the resounding lesson in scaling our organization can be best summarized as pause, assess, and move forward with intention. 
I know it can be tempting to continue at full speed when the momentum of growth really sets in, but a purposeful slowdown to address necessary issues can go a long way in achieving organizational goals. 
Moving quickly is a non-negotiable in the startup world, but that doesn’t mean you can’t also move purposefully.

Here’s what Freakonomics gets wrong about advertising,Michael Cross,2021/05/11,"
Freakonomics recently applied their formula of Pop Economics to put a challenge to the efficacy of advertising: “Does Advertising Actually Work?” where the hosts lay out a compelling narrative to suggest that advertising may have little uplift… but it’s just not that simple.
“Guess what? Advertising doesn’t work!” makes a great narrative hook for a podcast, but it’s not helpful if what you’re trying to do is measure advertising effectiveness. 
My concern here is that a lot of decision-makers believe Freakonomics’ general premise that advertising is “guilty until proven innocent.” However, anecdotes aren’t a substitute for a rigorous measurement strategy bespoke to a brand’s characteristics and conditions. 
Instead of trying to find “smoking guns” that highlight the inadequacy of advertising, the more productive path for a CEO or CMO is to understand the inadequacy of measuring advertising correctly.
How do I know? Over the last 20 years, I’ve measured advertising for hundreds of brands and witnessed the refinement of measurement to a point where advertisers can reliably predict business outcomes. 
So let’s do a point-by-point walkthrough of how to think about advertising measurement in a more productive, less knee-jerk way:
Freakonomics conclusion #1 — Teasing out the causal part of TV uplifts is a near-impossible task
I went back to this company and I said, ‘I’m really sorry to say, but with the data you have, with nothing like a randomized experiment, it’s just possible that the return on investment could be anywhere from zero to infinity.’
Freakonomics presumes here that academic studies have failed a number of times to understand the causal impact of ads on sales because there was no randomized experiment to examine. 
While randomized experiments are preferable when conducting research, they aren’t always achievable, especially in the case of advertising where countless variables must be accounted for. 
Evaluation techniques, such as Market Mix Modelling (or MMM) can pull apart all sales drivers without the need for prior tests to be set up.
Freakonomics conclusion #2 — You can’t disentangle seasonality and media uplifts
 So, of course there was a correlation between the TV advertising and store sales. But it’s not necessarily or even primarily because of the ads. It’s because the company knows when the big selling days are, and they target the ads around it.
Brands will indeed — and quite rightly — advertise during seasonal peaks. The podcast puts forward an endogeneity problem: brands that advertise over seasonal peaks are getting advertising uplift confused with seasonality (seasonal demand spikes that would have happened anyway) and “it’s impossible to disentangle” the two.
 Approaching this problem the wrong way can cost brands a great deal in mis-allocated spending. Seasonality and media uplift can indeed be disentangled by analyzing a longer time series of data. 
For example, analyzing three years of data builds up as much real-world behavior as possible to inform the measurement model, giving you three chances of isolating seasonal effects (e.g., 3x Christmas, 3x Easter, etc). 
Also, advertising when customers organically look for your product doesn’t have to be a bad thing. For some brands, seasonal peaks are the highest-ROI opportunity for advertising, so it makes the most financial sense to advertise over the highest possible baseline of demand.
Freakonomics conclusion #3 — Using randomized experiments to measure advertising uplifts in its entirety
So, one of the challenges with measuring the effects of advertising is that firms aren’t out there assigning their advertising randomly across geographies and across time periods.
Freakonomics presents randomized experiments — or A/B testing — as the best method to measure media uplifts. 
While I think A/B testing is great — it is after all one of the most common means of measuring uplifts — it has its shortfalls. It can miss the mark on advertising uplift as it:

May only measure the initial sales lift and doesn’t measure the long tail effect or memorized effect of advertising; and
Can miss local nuances. For example, a geographically split experiment may miss: different responsiveness to price by geographic area (DMA, postal code, etc), climate factors, store closures, local marketing, etc.

Market Mix Modelling considers the initial sales lift of the advertising, as well as measuring the short to medium-term impacts, sometimes lasting up to three years. These kinds of longer-term branding impacts can add around 250% on the initial uplift.
Freakonomics conclusion #4 — TV ads are unprofitable
We find that almost all brands seem to be over-advertising, and that they are earning a negative R.O.I. from advertising in an average week. And if they were to instead decide not to advertise in a given week, they would earn higher profits.
It’s put forward that TV is unprofitable, and the uplifts are underwhelming. Now to break it down, I’d say there are two things going here: one is the uplift, and the second is the way ROI is measured. 
Firstly, the initial uplift suggested by Freakonomics of between 1% and 10% rings about true, but this is true of a consumer packaged goods (CPG) brand, which is the use case the paper is derived from. 
Media uplifts for CPG are notoriously small, not because the media impacts are nominal, but because CPG brands tend to spend 10x their total media budgets on trade promotions (temporary price reductions, multibuys, etc.) and this dwarfs media uplifts. Outside of CPG, you can expect to see media uplifts anywhere between 5% and 40% of sales. 
Secondly, the ROI calculation is a bit squiffy — they are calculating the marginal ROI rather than the absolute ROI. Freakonomics puts it thusly: 
The vast majority of brands over-invest in advertising and could increase profits by reducing their advertising spending
This is a very different point to whether the advertising is paying back or not. It is simply saying the ROI will increase if the budget is reduced. It is not an absolute ROI. 
Increases in spending will tend to lead to lower ROI/efficiency, but not the absolute profit uplift. In my experience, 8 times out of 10 clients can increase their spend on media and enjoy higher absolute profits.
Advertising doesn’t always work — the key is being able to tell when
While entertaining, sensational anecdotes from Freakonomics aren’t helpful for brands and decision-makers when it comes to understanding ad effectiveness. The key is to measure and find out what works specifically for your brand.
In your personal life, I hope I haven’t diminished your enjoyment of Freakonomics. In your professional life though, I hope this has been useful input for the next time you are drawn into an “advertising doesn’t work” debate.

Why companies must be critical of workplace surveillance practices,The Conversation,2021/05/10,"
With so many more people working from home during the pandemic, employers have stepped up the extent to which they are monitoring them online. Not so many years ago, employees were having to adjust to having their work emails monitored; but that seems almost quaint compared to the digital surveillance we are seeing today.
Employers can use specialist software to track workers’ keystrokes, mouse movements, and the websites they visit. They can take screenshots of employees to check whether they are at their screens and looking attentive, or even use webcam monitoring software that measures things like eye movements, facial expressions, and body language. All this can be checked against a worker’s output to draw conclusions about their productivity.
Besides specialist software, managers can view statistics from their corporate private network to see who logged in and for what duration, and again cross-reference this to workers’ productivity data. In some organizations, staff who do not open work applications early in the morning could potentially be viewed as late for work or not productive enough.
Home-working has also raised the prospect of more informal staff monitoring. For example, if a worker would normally log in to meetings by turning on their video, but one day they are in a car or a new location, the employer might think they are not committed or focused enough.
This all raises questions about how such surveillance is affecting people’s work practices, privacy, and general wellbeing. Given that home-working looks set to extend beyond lockdown for many people, this is clearly a moment for some serious reflection.
The productivity dimension
Managers justify this kind of surveillance by claiming that it is good for productivity. Some workers even seem to agree with this – provided the monitoring is done by a peer and not a manager.
Many have signed up to an online service called Focusmate, for example, which matches anonymous strangers on “work dates” where they briefly say what they will be doing during the appointment and then they can rate one another’s approach to work at the end. The service aims to make workers more productive and to feel less lonely at work.
That said, home-working during the first UK lockdown in spring 2020 did not have a major effect on productivity. Workplace surveillance may even have held it back, given that it appears to have increased at the same time. Certainly, there is evidence that such techniques can make people feel vulnerable, afraid, and less creative. It can also reduce their job satisfaction and lower their morale.
Also bear in mind that this surveillance is taking place in someone’s home, which may make them feel particularly vulnerable. Some people have struggled with their mental health while working at home, and many have had to fit in other responsibilities such as caring for children and home-schooling.
Next steps
In view of all this, companies need to adopt an “ethics of care” approach to their workers, meaning they make a commitment to take care of them. They need to investigate their surveillance practices and analyze how exactly line managers use them to check up on workers.
While carrying out such an investigation, companies should recognize that some employees might be finding workplace surveillance more difficult than others. This will depend on to what extent they think it invades their privacy, and how they weigh the risks and benefits of sharing their data.
This is likely to be affected by things like their cultural background, gender, and the context in question. Those already struggling with home-working, perhaps because they have to care for children at the same time, are particularly likely to feel that this surveillance is making their lives even harder. Workers can therefore try and evade surveillance techniques – for example, by keeping an automatic mouse-moving application open to make sure they appear online all the time.

Companies should be ensuring from these investigations that employees are aware of what data is collected about them and how it’s used. They should hold open discussions with workers and unions on how these monitoring practices affect workers, and allow workers to have their say without threatening disciplinary action. If workers feel that their employers care about them as individuals, they will hopefully feel empowered and trusting towards them, and less likely to find workarounds or to react negatively.
Equally, it is important for regulators like the UK Information Commissioner to reflect on how surveillance in the workplace is changing. The UK code in this area broadly requires that any monitoring be fair to workers and that any adverse impacts – for example, on workers’ privacy, damage to trust, or demeaning workers – be mitigated. The rules may now need to be updated to reflect some of the latest forms of surveillance, and there is a role for researchers in looking into this as well.
Researchers have tended to look at workplace surveillance from the perspective of productivity where workers are viewed as resources, but we need to start thinking in terms of data justice. This has been described as “fairness in the way people are made visible, represented and treated as a result of their production of digital data”.
In a world where computers and smartphones are all around us, we need to negotiate our private spaces and our control over the data we produce online. Just like this has implications in our private lives for our relationship with Facebook or Google, the increases in workplace surveillance make it just as important at work.

Beat imposter syndrome by developing ‘true confidence’ as a software engineer,Dale Markowitz,2021/05/7,"
Let me start this post off by saying that impostor syndrome has already been covered profusely and at length, and there’s probably nothing new I can add to the discussion, so let me stop here, thanks for reading, and sorry for wasting your time.

Ahem. While there’s already tons of advice for overcoming impostor syndrome, I find it usually falls into one of two buckets:

YOU! An impostor?! No way! Just stop thinking that!
Fake it ‘til you make it. If you just keep acting confident, one day you will be.

The first angle is clearly useless, and the second, I’d argue, is neither possible nor advisable.
Hot take: you cannot successfully fake being confident. Not to say it wouldn’t be useful if you could. Research shows that when it comes to appearing competent, confidence is as (or more) persuasive than actual competence in getting people to think you know what you’re doing. Overconfidence can get you far in life. But the same studies show that it’s not enough to merely fake being confident. You have to actually believe it–you have to be “honestly overconfident.” In a fantastic piece for The Atlantic, Katty Kay and Claire Shipman write of their interview with the confidence researcher Cameron Anderson:
True overconfidence is not mere bluster. Anderson thinks the reason extremely confident people don’t alienate others is that they aren’t faking it. They genuinely believe they are good, and that self-belief is what comes across. Fake confidence, he told us, just doesn’t work in the same way. […] Most people can spot fake confidence from a mile away.
“Most people can spot fake confidence from a mile away.” It’s a result that’s borne out in the lab, and one I’ve validated in my own life tons of times.
If you write software for a living, then you likely spend your days interacting with people who argue with such monomaniacal vigor about optimal keyboard shortcuts you’d think they were defending their PhD theses. On top of that, if you are a woman, you probably also spend lots of time convincing people you really do know how to code. Combine these two and the fact that programming is actually hard and it’s no wonder so many of us feel like impostors. I first learned the name for this feeling in 2013, when I was a sophomore college and got my hands on Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg’s new book, Lean In. Thanks to that book, I (and so many others) started asking myself, “Is the problem that I’m an impostor, or that I have impostor syndrome?”
It would be hard for me to name a single female software engineer who doesn’t wonder this on the regular (surely many men do, too–but I find it’s rarer). But this is where things get complicated, because when you know you may be suffering from impostor syndrome, you feel the need to counteract it. You come to the conclusion that the queasy feeling in your gut is wrong–that the insecure part of you is delusional–and that you should no longer let your gut instinct guide your actions. Instead, you enable manual override, behaving in the way you think a confident person would. You start conversations by listing your credentials; you find every opportunity to name drop your alma mater; you post your every accolade on social media. (I’m guilty of all of these things.) It feels like bragging, but it’s hard to tell, because isn’t that what somebody with impostor syndrome would think?
But my take is that this sort of self-promotion rings hollow. Meanwhile, in the midst of our credential-dropping, we often fail to show confidence in situations that actually do sway people’s views of us. For example, I have a tendency to give an opinion and immediately caveat it with, “but I have no idea what I’m talking about,” and, “but you should definitely Google that.” And this type of back-talk absolutely does make me appear less competent.
In other words, when we force ourselves to ignore the “delusion” that is impostor syndrome, we end up behaving in ways that don’t feel very human–and don’t come off as genuine to other humans. Meanwhile, we fail to address the root of the problem.
So what’s the solution? For me, the answer has been to focus on acquiring “true confidence”–the type that my brain and my gut both agree I should have. I’ve done this neither by repeating to myself the daily affirmation “You are great at Python developer,” nor by going back to school for my PhD. But here’s what’s worked for me.
Calibrate yourself
There’s a famous Bob Thaves quote that says, of the dancer Fred Astaire:
Sure he was great, but don’t forget that Ginger Rogers did everything he did, backwards, and in high heels.
It may well be true that no matter how qualified you are, if you don’t come in the right package–if you’re not tall or male or confident or charismatic–that you have to work twice as hard for people to realize it. If they ever realize it.
But most of us don’t go from having two left feet to being Ginger Rogers overnight. We start our careers knowing nothing, struggle through the early years as newbies, and eventually learn enough to call ourselves experts. Yet we rarely know at any moment where we fall on that spectrum (besides, expertise is relative, isn’t it?).
Which says to me that all of us must secretly be thinking: “Some people who think they’re impostors actually are! How can I be sure I’m not one of them?”
So my first piece of advice is to try, if you can, to answer this question in some sort of objective way: how competent am I compared to my peers? This isn’t the type of question that’ll make it into the pages of any wellness-minded self-help book, but for me it’s been incredibly helpful (and not because I’m some amazing 10x programmer).
The analytics-crazed field of software development has tools for doing just this. One engineering manager I knew kept a dashboard that analyzed the code commits of all his team members and computed their relative productivity (I’m sure glad he wasn’t my manager). I’m not suggesting you use this Orwellian gauge as a measure of your self-worth, but if you have at least some way of objectively measuring your standing, you can better identify whether your insecurity comes from imagined or real performance differences. And this, particularly in the world of tech, is important, because non-objective measures abound.
You don’t need a college degree in Computer Science to be a successful coder, but taking the traditional university route did give me one irreplaceable perspective: seeing first hand the differences in the way I think about myself, versus the way my classmates–who would eventually become my coworkers–thought and talked about themselves.
Switching into Computer Science as a sophomore, I was already “behind.” Lots of my classmates had been coding since they were in utero. The field is vast, and I had no idea what people were talking about most of the time: Arch Linux? Lambda functions? emacs? Neural networks? And it wasn’t just the lingo that intimidated me. It was also that my classmates had such strong opinions! Why was it so important that I give up my Macbook Pro for a computer with an operating system that couldn’t hibernate or play audio? Why did I have to write code in a text editor with no graphical user interface that was built in the 70s? I had no idea, but I was convinced it was what legit programmers did.
“The thing you don’t realize,” my friend Raymond, a precocious coder two years above me, said, “is that they spend all this time arguing about things they don’t know anything about.” It took me three years of CS education to realize that so many of my classmates were, indeed, casually spewing bullshit, and there really wasn’t any good reason to write code in emacs. (#vim4life)
It’s often easier to become close friends with the classmates you’re pulling the same punishing all-nighters with than it is with your co-workers. And because of that, I saw this pattern play out time and again: a friend speaks at length and with authority about quantum computing, but on further interrogation reveals their entire background knowledge boils down to four Tweets. Their standards for how much they had to know about a topic in order to argue about it were much lower than mine. Which gave me the impression that was a lot further “behind” than I actually was.
The plural of anecdote is not data, but the data do support this “confidence gap” across gender lines six ways to Sunday: in the lab, women thought their performance on tests were worse than men did, even when their scores were the same. In one study, women applied for promotions only when they thought they met 100 percent of job qualifications; men applied when they met just 60. This phenomenon is one of the most repeatable results in psychology.
I’ll always remember applying for internships junior year when my then-boyfriend came to me distraught that he’d been rejected for a role as an Android developer.
“But Frank*,” I said, “you don’t know anything about Android development.”
To which he replied:
“And without this job, how will I ever learn?”
I’ve seen another common variant when my female coworkers are asked if they can complete a task. In one meeting, a project manager asked (the only other) female engineer on our team if she could build out a feature.
“Maybe? I don’t know… I’ve never worked on anything like that. I’ll have to ask my manager about it.”
I’ve never in my life heard a male coworker say anything like that. It’s not that my male coworkers claimed they could do everything. It’s just that they usually placed the blame elsewhere–on complicated software or incompetent coworkers–rather than on themselves. But more often, they’d just say yes, assuming that whatever they didn’t know they’d be able to learn on the job.
Unfortunately, I can’t give you an exact formula for learning how you stack up, but I will say the most useful “calibration exercise” I’ve ever done was becoming an interviewer. In my first job at OkCupid, I routinely reviewed resumes from applicants who listed such achievements as “trained and deployed neural networks at scale” or “built a compiler from scratch” but that, when fingers hit keyboards, couldn’t write a for loop to save their lives.
In other words, if you let your opinions of others be swayed by those who can talk the talk, it’s easy to feel that you’re further behind than you really are. In this way, finding a more concrete measure–whether its lines of code committed, performance reviews, or a candid conversation with your manager–can be useful. Maybe no one measure is perfect, but together they can paint a clearer picture.
Of course, at the end of this calibration exercise, you may learn something that you don’t like. Maybe that means you do need to spend time garnering experience or studying hard to level up your skills. No shame there. It’s an actionable insight. And, if you discover that you really are bad at something, despite hard work, that’s okay, too. I’ve never been happy in a job I didn’t feel that I was good at. But I have stayed in those roles longer than I should have because I spent so much time thinking I just had impostor syndrome. The right move for me has always been to pivot to something that suits my strengths better. Or, of course, you could simply say fuck the competition–you like the job you do and that’s all that matters.
Talk the talk
It’s important to calibrate your abilities against your peers not just so you know how “good” you are, but also so that you understand how your peers (who are sometimes your competition) are representing themselves. No, you don’t want to lie on your resume and say you’re C# expert when all you’ve written is “Hello, world.” But at the same time, if everyone on the job market is listing themselves as experienced C# developers with only a year of experience, shouldn’t you be using that as the same bar for yourself? In fact, if you don’t do this–if you hold yourself to a higher bar–you might be inadvertently misleading folks into thinking you’re less competent than you really are, because you’re using a different scale.
Credit: Dale Markowitz
Overselling your abilities is unwise and feels “icky.” But when you really understand how people with your abilities represent themselves, you may find you speak with more confidence naturally, simply because you feel it’s honestly deserved.
And on the topic of talking the talk, here’s another tip: don’t unnecessarily undercut yourself. As stated, I would never advise someone to try to sound like they’re more knowledgeable than they are. But that doesn’t mean you should go out of your way to kill your credibility.
I’m guilty, often, of being so afraid of being “found out” that when I say something like,
“I have 8 years of experience with Python,”
I also tack on:
“But I don’t know anything about Flask or Django or how to author a pip package, and I don’t know the difference between Python 3 and Python 2, and I’ve never used the collections package, and sometimes when I laugh too hard, I pee myself a little bit.”
My fiancé once asked his dad for advice on asking out a girl who was “out of his league.” His father replied:
“Let her figure that out.”
For me and many of the women I’ve spoken to, we are so afraid of saying something that turns out to be wrong that we’re willing to massacre our credibility right up front to avoid that possibility. This is unnecessary. If you say something wrong, someone will look it up and correct you, or maybe they won’t. Big whoop. Just don’t try this on Twitter.
You’re smart even if you don’t know about Kubernetes
Maybe this is the most important tip of all.
For most of this post, I’ve suggested actions you can take to feel like less of an impostor – to change the way you think of yourself, and the way you present yourself to others. But of course, there’s a lot about the way people perceive you you simply cannot control, especially when bias is involved. As a woman in tech, I will always struggle to convince folks I’m competent, and their reactions will always make me feel less so. Plus, sexism aside, tech is filled with lots of jerks, and many more people who aren’t jerks, but that occasionally speak like them. I don’t know how to change that.
But I do think there’s value in recognizing when you’re talking to a jerk, so you don’t internalize this as a flaw in yourself. You cannot reasonably go up to Vint Cerf, the inverter of TCP/IP, and expect to have a debate about network protocols in which you don’t get totally schooled. But no matter how much or how little you know about a subject, you always deserve to be spoken to like a smart person. When I wonder if a coworker is talking down to me, I ask myself, “is this how that person would speak to me if I were Richard Feynman?” Because Richard Feynman doesn’t know about Kubernetes, but you’d never explain something to him like he were a hapless dummy.
Of course, when you identify you’re being talked down to, there’s not necessarily much you can do about it. But sometimes identifying the things you can’t change gives you more time to focus on the things you can.
But what do I know?
A very big thanks to Sara Robinson and Anu Srivastava, two of my wicked smart and thoughtful coworkers, for feedback on this post.

My treadmill desk makes me happier and more productive — here’s why,Stacie Taylor,2021/04/16,"
I love my home office chair — deeply. It feels like sitting in a hug.
Before 2020, I would only see it a few hours a day. The rest of the time, I’d work in co-working spaces and coffee shops, which I walk to. It kept me active.
The pandemic changed that — my chair became part of my body. I coded there, I had meetings there, I ate my meals there, I happy hour’d with friends there, and I watched Netflix there. I rocked my whiny kids there. I did everything in that chair, and my body started to feel it.
We all know that exercise plays an important role in our mental and physical well-being. As a car-less city-dweller, losing the ability to walk around and leave my tiny apartment when the world started to shut down weighed heavily on my mental and physical health. And, as a mom who now had more than one full-time job, I just didn’t have time to dedicate to exercise.
[Read: We spent a workday on a treadmill desk so you didn’t have to]
So I bought a treadmill for under my standing desk. I knew I needed something to get me moving, and I needed to be able to do it while momming, working, or hanging out with friends on Zoom. I needed to get my butt out of that comfy chair and get moving.
Look at my beauty!
It worked! I love this treadmill like one of my children, and I think you should buy one. Here’s why, and a few tips I have for setting up your own treadmill desk. Feel free to march in place while you read.
The benefits of a treadmill desk
So, why have a treadmill at my desk? I have a few reasons.

I can burn calories while I work. There aren’t enough hours in the day for me to work, parent, occasionally socialize, and work out. The treadmill desk lets me do two of those things at once, which makes me feel less guilty about all the Zoom happy hours.
I put less pressure on my back. Moving your legs can mean less pressure on your back than simply standing at your desk. Beware if you have existing joint pains, though — a yoga ball chair might be better in that case.
I feel better. You’ve heard it (and probably ignored it) so many times: exercise releases endorphins, which means you’ll feel happier. We all could use a boost these days, so don’t overlook the upside here.

There are more benefits, I’m sure, but wow do these ones stand out to me. It’s been life-changing.
When should you walk?
I don’t walk all day — I’m picky about it. Some tasks are better with walking, some aren’t. Here’s what works for me.

I walk during informational meetings. You know those meetings where you’re mostly listening, while occasionally sharing opinions? I walk during those ones, around 3.5 miles per hour.
I walk during simple tasks. Whether it’s planning my day or catching up on some reading, some tasks don’t require a lot of brainpower. That’s a perfect time to do some walking. I do around 2 miles per hour.
I walk during virtual dates with my friends. This sounds weird, but it’s wonderful — especially if your friends have treadmills too. Go whatever speed you want — it largely depends on if you’re drinking hot or cold beverages (I do not recommend sprinting with a latte).

This is going to vary for you, obviously, but the important thing is not to do it all day — you’ll get tired (and tired of it). I like to use it for less focus-necessary tasks: when it’s time to focus on coding for a while, I go back to my comfy chair. This might be different for you — maybe the treadmill will get you into focus mode, for example. You’ll have to define your own lines.
So gorgeous.
Tips for your new treadmill desk
When your treadmill arrives, and you start using it, there will be an adjustment period — there sure was for me. Here are some things I learned.

Warn your colleagues. You’re going to be walking during meetings, which will be jarring at first. Be ready to explain yourself (send them a link to this article, maybe?). Your coworkers might judge you a little, but that’s ok. They’re jealous and probably a little sad because, you know, lack of exercise.
Wear headphones. Your treadmill will be noisy. They just are. Make sure you’ve got good headphones, with noise-canceling, and that you wear them during the call. And mute yourself when you’re not talking.
Stay hydrated! Don’t overlook this one — drink water, constantly.
Mark your sweet spot. You’ll be pulling your treadmill out from under your desk quite often, and eventually you’ll figure out the exact place to put it. I recommend marking your floor with a little tape when you find that sweet spot. That way, you don’t have to constantly fuss with awkward or dizzying angles.
Take notes. Find your happy speeds and write them down, so you don’t have to experiment every time you start running.
Wear good shoes. I can’t overstate this: uncomfortable shoes are going to make this miserable. Wear something you’d wear for a long walk.
Get a portable treadmill. You need something that’s easy to tuck away when it’s time to sit again. You don’t want it to be a pain to roll out, or you’ll never use it. I slide mine under my desk. My partner tips his up on its side beside his desk. Find something that works for your setup.

Chaos isn’t always a bad thing,Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten,2021/04/15,"

When it was time to pick a school for my youngest daughter, we visited a few to see which one would be a good fit. The first one was the most prestigious, and it showed. They were well prepared, all the information was readily available, and nothing was left to chance.
The second school we visited was utter chaos. The teacher was late, she was sweating, and her face was red because she was dealing with some kind of issue with a bunch of kids in the other classroom. I can imagine a lot of people would lose their patience when being met with such ‘unprofessional’ behavior — but I loved it.
It wasn’t just the chaos I liked, it was what was causing it.
I could see that her first priority was the students’ wellbeing. Everything she did and said reflected that. She didn’t produce a perfect video or booklet, and her presentation wasn’t even that well-rehearsed. But it was clear she cared and she was ready to drop everything to help students. That’s why we chose that school for our daughter (but I’m also just a big sucker for chaos).
[Read: What separates a good manager from a bad one? Bullshitting]
Over the next few years, I saw school newsletters going out late and important events not always being announced on time. There were basically a lot of little things that didn’t really go as planned, but the kids loved it because the big picture was all about them.
The school also reflected our own household. I remember duct-taping my daughter’s coat closed (I’m not great at sewing) while she was already late for school. I remember stuffing leftover sushi in a bag because I had forgotten to buy fresh bread.
Basically, I remember not remembering a lot of things — but I know our kids grew up in a household filled with love and attention.
It wasn’t maybe the cleanest or the most organized household, but it was very compatible with a school that also had the wellbeing of their kids as their first priority.
I thought about that school and our experience with it when I read this popular quote attributed to Germans when they were at war with the US:
“The reason the American Army does so well in wartime, is that war is chaos, and the American Army practices it on a daily basis.”
It’s both an insult and a compliment, and the ambivalence of that makes it interesting. I also relate to it in a personal way, as I find chaos often comfortable because I’m a deeply chaotic person.
When a lot is happening around me and structure seems to be missing, I’m both inspired and energized. I love finding patterns in things, and I somehow become relaxed when others are stressing out.
I also think a chaotic situation can be fertile ground for new ideas. When you envision an inspiring environment, my guess is it will be a space with lots of stimulants. Music, images, tools, colors, and all that jazz. Not a clean sterile room with white walls and nothing to interact with.
But… that’s me. It is also important to remember that your friends, children, or employees might have the opposite experience and need order and quietness to perform well.
The goal is to not enforce the wrong structure on your team. Find out who thrives in chaos and who needs order to perform well within your organization.

4 questions you’ll need to answer to win VC funding,Malcolm Thorne,2021/04/15,"
For many people, selling a business for $50 million is a win. But for venture capitalists, it’s a poor outcome. VC success is defined as achieving top quartile return status among your peers. In other words, go big or go home. 
At the same time, barriers to building software are falling exponentially. Many startups are lost in a sea of commoditization, running on other people’s platforms, integrations, go-to-market channels, and data management technologies. Many don’t have a lot of differentiation because their business is a collection of a whole bunch of other people’s stuff.
How do you go big in a world where the barriers to innovation can be so low? How do you hit a home run when the “how will you win” of your startup isn’t yet worked out? 
As a startup founder, you need to understand how you’ll build a sustainable competitive advantage and that everything you do needs to support the creation of that strategy.  
That’s strategy — and that’s also how VCs think about strategy. Here are some of the questions venture capitalists will ask you when judging value creation and whether or not to invest. 
How is your software generating data that can build a wall around your business?
A proprietary data pool creates value. Your core software shouldn’t just be helping your customers achieve a goal — it should also be generating data. 
For example, Rentable (full disclosure: this is a portfolio company) is an apartment listing company that helps apartment companies market their inventory online and enables a digitized buying experience for their customers. 
In that process, Rentable is able to capture info on consumer demand and behavior, like when people buy, how they buy, at what prices, and success rates. 
That’s a lot of data coming out of the back of their core piece of software, and that’s valuable market-specific information that can build a wall around a business. 
Can you build a unique set of analytics or tie more generic analytics to a unique legacy problem?
In my experience, the most valuable analytics come from really understanding customers’ pain points and building analytics into a workflow that is part of the ordinary course of business. When you combine a set of analytics and with a legacy business problem, you have a new opportunity to build best-of-breed capabilities for that particular problem, and “go big” in the process. 
Consider, for example, an inventory manager who uses your analytics to do their job better. Having information on how many units are in a marketplace, what units sell for, and at what realized prices is useful analytics? 
But if you can automate the inventory manager’s daily workflow by providing, automated daily recommendations on what units to buy, sell and reprice and then provide automated functions that execute those recommendations. You now have an automated workflow powered by analytics.
Can you connect this to a unique piece of hardware, such as an IoT device?
Can you pair your software with a device to create something proprietary? Such a pairing takes you out of the world of commoditized software by adding a unique differentiator. 
Let’s say you have software that helps urban planners and real estate developers by providing demographic and population growth information on certain geographies. It’s slick and has analytics, but it’s not a solution. 
What if you add a computer vision system that monitors vehicle and pedestrian traffic, analyzes vehicle and consumer behavior, and combine that with the demographic information, all wrapped into an algorithm to predict best use cases for buildings and transport? Then you have a real differentiator. 
With the explosion of cheap IoT devices and pervasive connectivity, there is a whole host of hardware devices that could be a real source of differentiation for your startup.
Can you build a two-sided network?
Airbnb and DoorDash are classic examples of two-sided networks: startups that serve both consumers and businesses, and build such large networks that the network itself becomes a competitive barrier to entry. Such businesses are frequently winner-take-all markets, and are highly risky and expensive to create.  
Simultaneously convincing both consumers and businesses to participate can be difficult and very expensive, but the rewards can be very large. Given the valuations the public markets have attributed to both Airbnb and DoorDash, they have proven that the risk was worth it for their early investors. 
Unlike with hardware, not all businesses are suited to two-sided networks, and they can be very difficult to scale. If yours is, however, the risk may pay off not just in terms of hitting it big, but in creating a unicorn — which all VCs are looking for. 
There’s a reason that VCs are searching for “unicorns” and not just your basic “good business idea.” To gain the attention of investors, startups need to find the unique qualities that differentiate them from every other good idea. That focus, differentiation, and competitive advantage will attract capital and, ultimately, will enable your company to survive the competitive threats.

3 reasons why I won’t hire you to join my tech startup,Sachin Raoul,2021/04/14,"
1. You want to work in tech, but not at our company
At a startup, the first 20-30 employees are fundamental to the culture and success of the entire enterprise. A startup’s journey is saturated with challenges and difficulties and the thing that’s going to get us through it is purpose. 
If you don’t connect with our purpose, or you don’t feel it, that’s fine — but that probably means this isn’t the job for you. 
It’s easy to spot when this isn’t there, mainly because it’s so easy to spot when it is. Some people are just so excited to join they can’t put it into words. You’ll hear phrases like, “I can’t even describe how perfect this is for me.”
We hear a lot about product-market fit and increasingly about product-founder fit. But there’s also product-employee fit. Do you and your skills and interests make sense for this product? Will your approach and passions fit with the team ethos? 
This is usually why technically amazing candidates are passed over. In the long term, it’s in everyone’s interest. If it’s not a role where you’ll care about the product, then not getting the job means you can pursue opportunities you truly care about. 
2. You’re a brilliant jerk
There are some people out there who are just brilliant. Throughout the interview process, you see some soft-skill red flags, but you want to hire them anyway because you really need their skills right now and their CV is just so good. 
After all, I’m building a team of geniuses, right? Wrong. 
No matter how brilliant you are, if you’re not able to self-reflect and display empathy, it will create issues for the wider team. Every startup is a team, you cannot do things in isolation. 
When a person can’t work collaboratively, their impact on morale is significant. They are, to use Ben Horowitz’s phrase, a brilliant jerk. 
If you’re a CEO, don’t fall into this trap, it’s not worth it. And, if you’re job seeking, don’t forget the vital importance of being a team player. 
3. You’re the right person with the wrong skills
You might find a company that you love and connect with. The role feels like the right fit and you submit an application with excitement. And it’s genuinely fantastic to receive these applications; full of enthusiasm and passion. But that doesn’t mean we can offer you the job. 
A startup requires specific talents at different times. The evolution of the company happens so rapidly, that the team requirements are constantly shifting. Especially in the early days of the company (let’s say, the first 3-5 years) there’s little room for generalists. 
A startup needs experienced people because you’re probably going to be the only person in the team with that skillset, so there’s no one to learn from. 
If you’re a data scientist, you might be the data scientist. You can’t go to someone to ask tricky data questions and if you’re unsure about anything, it’s hard to troubleshoot. You could be setting up an entire function within the business, at lightning speed, with little margin for error. 
If you don’t have that very specific skill set that is needed at that moment, no matter how passionate you are, we can’t hire you. But, I’d encourage anyone who’s fallen in love with a company to get in touch with the founders and tell them that you love what they’re building. 
It might not lead to a yes right now, but when the job does come up, you’ll be front of mind.

"The biggest tech trends of 2021, according to 3 founders",Andrea Hak,2021/04/13,"
2020 was a year of rapid adaptation. Companies quickly, at times haphazardly, pivoted as fast as possible to new digital solutions that would keep supply chains functioning, employees and teams connected, and products accessible to customers.
In most cases, companies found that this quick switch accelerated their rate of new tech adoption and experimentation. Plans on the backburner to ‘eventually’ see how blockchain, IoT, or AI could be leveraged were suddenly added to the list of starters. 
2021 will be a year of refinement. Companies are now wiser about what works and what doesn’t, and will yet again be experimenting with how they can use newly adopted tech to refine processes and innovate in ways not thought of before. 
Techleap.nl’s Rise Program is focused on providing fast-growing Dutch scaleups with the tools they need to take on the global market. We spoke with three of their cohorts to find out what new trends they see on the horizon this year.
Using tech to enhance digital relationships with customers

Online supermarket app, Crisp, started out on a mission to bring fresh products directly from producers to their users’ doors. Not only would ingredients be fresh, their bet was that the convenience and time-saving benefits that online shopping could bring would attract families who wanted to spend less time at the supermarket and more time with their loved ones. 
Of course, when social distancing concerns became a major factor in consumer behaviors, Crisp was already ahead of the game. As CFO Michiel Roodenburg explained to TNW, 
One of the most important tech trends we’re experiencing is an increased level of personalization in B2C. By leveraging the power of large data sets, more online retailers are able to create individualized shopping experiences.
This enhanced capability has allowed them to not only make the shopping experience faster and more convenient; it’s also helped them go beyond simply meeting customer expectations.
“Using data in a smart manner allows us to combine convenience with inspiration,” Roodenburg said. “Users want to buy their usual products as quickly as possible and we can help them by suggesting these. In addition, we offer a layer of inspiration with an offering that is new but equally relevant.
“For example, in our recipe section, our offering is automatically adjusted to make it more relevant. We’ve seen that this also increases the average order value, positively impacting the logistical cost ratio, which is very important in the online food business.”
This has also helped them streamline different aspects of the customer experience. 
“Tech enables our service team to effectively communicate with consumers. For example, by automatically categorizing questions or suggesting useful answers that the employee uses to send a richer answer.”
For companies that want to experiment with new strategies this year, Roodenburg suggests:
Focus on creating customer value as opposed to lowering costs. Improving your value proposition is, in my opinion, often more important. But it only works if the customer is truly the middle point of the organization. Technology does not make the distance with customers bigger; quite the opposite: it can help you become more intimate with the customer.
Easing the transition to the new normal with AI

Just like our shopping habits have changed, so have our work habits. While the quick switch to remote working was a struggle for many in the beginning, with over a year of Zoom meetings under our belts, some have now gotten used to the comforts of a home office, skipping the morning commute, and having extra time to spend with families. 
The question is when the time does come for everyone to go back to the office, will we actually want to go back to the normal nine to five? 
As Judith Huisman, co-Founder of Meetingselect, said, “Nothing can ever completely replace face-to-face meetings,” especially when it comes to team building, brainstorming, or branding activities.
Companies will therefore need to find the balance between in-person and more flexible work options. But this can also bring new opportunities for those willing to adopt new tech.
Meetingselect is at the crossroad between businesses and the hospitality industry, making it easier for organizations and enterprises to provide external meeting spaces, group bookings, and workplace solutions to their employees while helping hotels and venues attract more customers to their meeting spaces.
As Huisman explained, this requires a more strategic use of meeting data and AI-powered automation. 
The meetings industry is a $450 billion industry, yet only 10% of those meetings are booked online. Even though we’re used to booking hotel rooms or car rentals in a few clicks, meeting bookings still haven’t been embraced by 90% of the market. 
A couple of years ago people said, ‘why should I book a meeting online?’ Now no one wants to call and send emails anymore, they just want to search online and book it. That’s why you want to have an automated booking solution backed by Artificial Intelligence. 
We now have large hotel chains that have signed on to our software solution to make that happen. We’ve also developed a booking engine so that small venues or boutique hotels don’t have to invest in the technology themselves.
Looking to the future, when we can begin traveling again for work, Meetingselect is now working on a new feature that will help companies calculate “The Best Place to Meet” in terms of Total Travel Time, Total Travel Cost, and CO2/carbon footprint reduction, and ease the process of flexible workspace and co-working space bookings. 
Digitizing workplace knowledge and learning

One of the biggest challenges manufacturers have faced over this past year has been the breakdown and fragmentation of communication lines. With warehouses and other facilities working at limited capacity due to social distancing measures, supervision and guidance for workers has been limited. As Willemijn Schneyder, CEO of SwipeGuide explained, this experience revealed a serious gap:
Covid-19 has forced companies to fundamentally rethink their approach to building knowledge capital. But as many experts have noticed, it’s also accelerating an inevitable digital transformation within the industry. 
Manufacturers still struggle to capture something we call silent knowledge: the dos and don’ts of the job that live in the heads of long-time expert employees that simply never get recorded. Think about any process at your own job that’s not written down anywhere, it’s simply ‘how it’s done.’
As these employees retire or switch jobs, best practices and crucial operational knowledge is lost forever. Given the scale and tight tolerances of global manufacturing, the resulting errors and lost time can be catastrophic. If you develop the tools to capture this knowledge at scale, suddenly you’re able to improve and distribute it throughout your supply chain.
Not only is this a communication issue, it’s a safety issue. With the technology manufacturers are working with constantly evolving, workers need to be kept up to date with new operational procedures, safety measures, and potential hazards. Ironically, the learning process used to teach workers how to operate high-tech machinery is still low tech, with PDF-based instructions being the norm. 
Much like a CMS, Swipeguide’s platform allows users to create, drag and drop, edit, publish, update, and share instructions with their workforce in real-time. This also allows companies to capture data on these instructions including usage, scoring, and feedback from workers. Best of all, it’s available on or offline and can be easily adjusted to different language and device preferences by users ⁠— meaning workers can easily access instructions wherever they are. 
Schneyder believes this transition to digital workplace learning is just the beginning.
The best manufacturers are solving this problem and also thinking past the pandemic. Yes, the current situation has accelerated the process. But they’re laying the groundwork for future success by investing in digital solutions that will enhance productivity at scale for years to come.
For example, we’re really excited to see the development of something called the Workforce Digital Twin. This is the collection of expert knowledge, captured via apps, that’s stored in the cloud to be distributed among frontline workers. It’s an ever-improving and ever-expanding repository of your best knowledge that’s insulated from turnover, and simple enough to be customized for any person working on the factory floor.
We think of this as a now, near, future process. It’s a matter of taking today’s operational knowledge to build tomorrow’s digital twin, in order to build resilience and efficiency for the future.
Ready to step up your game, but don’t know where to start?
As Schneyder told TNW, “We would tell any company to look at their product and ask themselves: ‘how does our solution help connect people to the resources they need and make them more effective in a world dominated by remote work and new technology?’
“Once you’ve answered this, you can begin to position your product within any digital transformation at scale. We believe that when you focus on empowering the human elements first, the sky’s the limit.”

Here’s why you should quit,Justin Pot,2021/04/9,"
Quitters never prosper. Never give up. If at first, you don’t succeed, try, try again.
There are so many sayings with the same basic message: quitting is bad. This idea is instilled in kids, internalized by adults, and generally just considered common sense.
It’s also often wrong.
I once had a job that, in retrospect, I should have quit earlier. I stuck around two years longer than made sense, all because I thought giving up would be a personal failure on my part. That was wrong. When I finally left, I was happier, more productive, and better off.
I quit, and then I prospered.
Why did I keep doing a job that wasn’t working for so long—even when I had other options? Because of the prevailing cultural norm that quitting is bad. I felt like walking away would be a failure on my part, so I put off doing it.
This idea — that quitting is bad — deserves to be questioned.
The sunk cost fallacy is real
Let’s lower the stakes a little. My Zapier coworker Katie recently told me that she used to force herself to finish books she hated. That’s relatable. If you spent money on a book, then spent a bunch of time reading it, it feels like you have to finish it. Wouldn’t that time and money be wasted otherwise?
It sounds logical, but it isn’t. It’s an example of the sunk cost fallacy, a cognitive bias that causes us to commit to continuing to do something we’ve already invested in.
It’s easy to think that, by not finishing a book you started, you’re somehow losing all the time you put into the book so far. That’s not true: your time is already gone, regardless of how you spend it going forward. Finishing the book won’t retroactively justify the bad time you’ve had reading it so far — it just means you’ll have more of a bad time.
Ask yourself: is reading more of a book that you hate the best thing you could be spending your time on going forward? Because that’s what you can control. You can’t change how you spent time in the past, but you can decide what you want to do going forward. You could spend time reading something you actually enjoy but only if you quit reading the thing you hate.
It’s also not true that the time you spent reading the book was wasted if you stop reading. You learned something about the kinds of books you don’t like, which is a good thing to know. You also tried something new, which is valuable in and of itself. And you now have the opportunity to write a scathing review on Goodreads or make jokes with your friends about the terrible book you never finished. These results apply regardless of whether you finish the book.
Quit. You’ll be better off.
It’s also true in business
All of this same logic applies to work, or running a company. It’s easy if you’ve put many hours into a project or career path, to think that you should continue working on that indefinitely — even if it’s not working out. After all, quitting means admitting that something isn’t working, and that’s a really hard line to cross.
The thinking here is exactly the same: if you stop now, all of the time you spent on the project or opportunity is wasted. It’s way too easy for this mentality to lead to spinning your wheels on something that’s not working.
Cortney, executive assistant here at Zapier, told me she had to do this before finding her current profession:
I thought because I got a degree in marketing, and because my first few jobs were in marketing, that I had to stick with it, even though it was making me really unhappy. I quit, and I am much better for it now! Very happy and my current role is much more aligned with my interests and skill set.
In some cases, you can salvage a project if you put more time into it — and some books have twist endings that retroactively justify how hard the beginning was to read. But not every time.
I’m not going to pretend I can tell you how to know which situation you’re in, but it’s important to consider the possibility that quitting is the best option.
Sometimes you have to move on — and learn from it
I already threw out a bunch of cliches, so here’s another one: “The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.” Einstein never said this, but someone did, at some point, and people attribute it to Einstein because they think it’s smart.
There’s no sense in continuing to do something that’s not working for you, and quitting is the easiest way to not continue. Another Zapier colleague Breetel put it well in a message she sent me:
To quit means you have to honor your instincts and the desire for something else, but it also demands that you take a leap of faith. It requires you to trust yourself and the world enough to believe you will be ok without whatever membership, credential, activity, situation, or person you are walking away from.
This isn’t just true when it comes to reading books or doing your job. It’s true in every aspect of your life. Sometimes you’re going to put work into something — a hobby, say, or even a relationship — only to realize it’s not working. Knowing when to walk away is an essential life skill.
This isn’t to say that everyone reading this should quit their jobs if they don’t like them — there are good reasons to keep doing something that’s not perfect, or even far from ideal. But it’s too easy to keep on doing things that aren’t working, and our culture’s emphasis on not giving up only plays into this.
Keep this in mind, and maybe be a little less afraid of quitting in the future.

Waymo’s 7 principles of outcome-centered design are what your product needs,Lauren Schwendimann,2021/04/8,"
While the notion of invisible or boring design isn’t new — after all Dieter Rams’ 10th principle is: good design is as little design as possible — designing for simplicity still seems to be difficult. As designers and creative people, it’s easy to get caught up in the magic of making and the minutia of details. 
Making something simple is hard, and it takes discipline. Our goal as designers is to inspire feelings of satisfaction or delight by meeting a need or solving a problem. It shouldn’t be about keeping people’s attention. Instead, success should look like reducing anxiety or giving people a way of doing things they didn’t know was possible. Or, allowing people to do something faster, to feel more carefree, or to be more independent. 
Giving people less work and worry, and more joy and convenience is what makes your product memorable. And, making a memorable experience is what feeds us as designers. As such, we need to view our role as one that enables people to achieve those outcomes of increased fulfillment and satisfaction. 
Here are seven principles I work by to ensure design feels simple and helps people meet their goals. 
1. Get familiar with your customer’s mindset and motivation
If we’re designing to enable an outcome — more joy and less worry — then we must have a deep and rich understanding of what is and isn’t working for people. The trick is that your customer won’t tell you, “x needs to be easier,” or “I wish there was a better way to y.” 
It’s critical to develop empathy for our customers, and to be familiar with their mindset and motivations. Let’s take transportation for example. 
Why do different people prefer to drive their own car for some errands, but use a ride-hailing service or public transit for others? What if they have a toddler, if it’s late at night, or if they need to make a few stops? Talking to a variety of people about these kinds of questions will put you in their shoes. People consider their goals and circumstances before they use a product, and we need to know what those are so that we know how to make something easy for them.
2. Create focus by clarifying your purpose
Inspired by a deep empathy for our customers, in the thick of product definition and feature roadmaps, we often plan for more features to address problems or indulge cool new ideas. How can we make something simple when there are so many problems to solve? You don’t need to solve every problem for everyone. 
Find an area where you can specialize and have a significant impact. The Pareto principle, or 80/20 rule, applies in design and it’s been a guide through some of the trickiest decisions I’ve encountered. Basically, 80% of the time your customers are only doing 20% of what you offer. 
That’s why you design for the 80% scenario, which is only a handful of use cases. Make those sing. Clear the path for near-zero friction. Get those right. 
Of course, you should always address the 20%, or edge cases, with best practices so that you keep your customers’ trust. But don’t let the low-likelihood ‘what-if?’ compromise your chance to offer the best possible experience most of the time. 
3. Reduce noise with system-based design
A strong system is the foundation for consistent, simple design. Consistency is a hallmark of good design because it reduces complexity and builds trust. A design system leverages repeatable and familiar patterns for your audience, which removes guesswork and lets your product’s purpose shine through. 
You don’t need to invent a new way of interacting to be innovative and memorable. Invest in defining clear guidelines, setting your guardrails, and sticking to them so that your customer feels confident and focuses more on their goals than trying to make sense of the unfamiliar. 
If you are creating a way of interacting that’s new (heck, we do that sometimes!), then the need for a system is even stronger so that your customer can gain confidence and learn each time they use your product. 
4. Clue in to your customer’s context
Even with clear priorities and a strong system in place, it’s hard to make a robust product feel simple. Enter context — a designer’s best friend. Your goal as a designer is to clear the way for your user to realize their intention as easily as possible.
You will never be able to read their mind, but you can tune into their needs based on everything you know about them to cater their experience.
Are they a repeat user or is this their first time? Where are they in their larger journey? Did they finish what they were doing the last time they came? Will they do that again? What time of day is it? Are they late for something? With other people? What’s the weather like? 
Depending on your product, these kinds of questions might be relevant and can inform how you structure your customer’s journey to present a set of relevant options catered to their current mindset and moment. 
I like to offer three things they’ll likely want to do, rather than 20.  If they’re essential but not everyday features (like a permission setting), then consider tucking them away under a menu. 
Remember that you’d rather have your product do a handful of things really well, than a so-so job at many.
5. Put time on your side
You’re focused on the most critical use cases. You’ve got a strong system. You’re paying attention to your customers’ context and usage patterns. As needs emerge for more feedback and features, make sure you’re not forgetting the fourth dimension in experience or product design — time.
Leveraging the temporal is like the atomic level of context-sensitive design. You can address so many needs in a customer’s journey with just-in-time information, options, or feedback that responds to their smallest interactions. 
Think of auto-complete search suggestions that appear and disappear at the stroke of each letter. Or hint text in a form field. Options that reveal under your finger when you swipe an email in your inbox list, or rest your finger on a like button. 
These are all examples of temporal, context-sensitive features that respond to the user’s slightest interactions to make things feel easy and natural. By layering the options and suggestions in time, the design feels simple and intuitive. 
6. Leverage human senses and the current environment
Since so many products are digital, it’s easy to design only for a four-sided visual interface. Remember that your customer uses that screen in a big and messy world. They’re with people and usually doing other things while they’re using your product. 
If your product is screen-based, find opportunities to layer the experience using media like sound and haptics (vibration on a phone), and other interactions like voice or gesture. By using different media together, you provide some relief from one mode of interacting and minimize overloading the screen with everything you want to communicate. 
But make sure these are additive and don’t let your experience depend on them since some of your customers may have limited or no vision or hearing. For that reason, also ensure you design inclusively and follow a11y best practices. 
Think of yourself as the conductor and your product’s surfaces as the orchestra. Use them together in harmony, and remember that they work together to create an experience bigger than any one touchpoint. How can haptics in your app create subtle feedback to support your design system? How can audio help your customers read an environment or know when a transition is happening?

Reduce your design to the most essential elements and words to create focus and calm for your customer.
Sometimes design doesn’t need words at all. But, when it does, it requires an investment in UX writing. Why? People don’t read. At best, they scan.
Every word needs to be right for the reader so you need to understand the words they use. Do people “launch” apps? Probably not. They might say “open” or “start” apps. Do people “enable” things? Chances are they simply turn them on. 
These differences matter. As designers, we live in a world with its own language that’s often pretty jargon-filled. So stay in touch with how everyday people speak and match your language. 
Try testing the reading level of initial drafts with Hemingway or Readable apps, then test proposed options with actual users. To help with scanning, messages also need to be presented in the appropriate hierarchy. 
Start with formatting and style best practices from existing guides like Google’s Material and Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines, but then document and develop your own. Establish, and record, what words work best for your product and experience so that language becomes consistent and follows repeatable patterns too.
The challenge of unlocking new possibilities for people in simple and human ways is what inspires me most about design. It’s hard to do, but it’s our job to create simple, delightful products that promise a better outcome than what came before. 
At Waymo, we’re building something that gets people where they want to go, safely and comfortably, while also requiring less of them on the journey. That new freedom is for riders to use as they please. They can talk and text on their phone, put on makeup, stare out the window, eat, even sleep! 
That’s the outcome my team and I aim to deliver — more time for yourself, more freedom to do as you please, more independence, and hopefully, more joy. And I use these seven principles to do it.

Future-proofing your business isn’t about tech — it’s about these 3 key elements,Michel Koopman,2021/04/7,"
2020 offered valuable lessons about how and why technology business leaders need to future-proof their business models — whether we liked it or not. The pandemic sent normal operations out the window and forced companies to take huge leaps forward in adopting and advancing new technology. 
Now, it’s time to harness the lessons learned from this pivotal year to create lasting changes to strategies and infrastructure.
During the pandemic, I worked closely with chief nursing officers and healthcare technologists to implement virtual care solutions. As hospitals scrambled to keep up with an unprecedented number of patients and medical staff tried to protect themselves and others from a virus we knew very little about, I watched leaders implement new solutions in a high-stakes environment. 
As I’ve observed, I’ve gleaned several lessons about how organizations can look forward and leverage technology to set themselves up for success in the future — whatever it might hold.
Here’s what you, as a technology business leader, need to know to create a truly future-proof business model:
1. Future-proofing doesn’t have to be complicated
The idea of future-proofing might sound intimidating to many because it’s wrapped in troubling notions about long-term commitments. Many leaders hear “future-proof” and envision committing to an entire suite of technology that they’ll have to keep around forever. They think they won’t be able to change the tech to accommodate new business needs, but that simply isn’t true.
There’s really no such thing as a future-proof piece of hardware or software. (Does anyone still own a PalmPilot?) All tech eventually becomes obsolete, which is one reason only about 30% of digital transformations are actually successful.
So what is future-proofing really? Future-proofing is not about adopting any specific piece of technology. It’s about creating an evergreen business model supported by infrastructure that will not need to be changed significantly as the technology advances.
Thankfully, the basis of a future-proof platform only has two requirements: power and a high-speed internet connection in every room. 
Once you have that, you don’t have to be stuck with any specific piece of tech forever. The software should be a service that can evolve, and the hardware shouldn’t be so expensive that it can’t be updated, upgraded, or replaced over time.
2. You’re subscribing to a strategy — not a piece of technology
When organizations set their sights on digital transformation, too often, they become fixated on point solutions rather than platforms or strategies. A point solution is a device; a platform has the ability to add on other components as necessary. This is where I find many organizations falter.
During the pandemic, for instance, I saw healthcare organizations using iPads for virtual care to minimize patient contact. While iPads work great as a stopgap measure, consumer technologies have limitations in a hospital setting.
FaceTime on an iPad is a point solution. What hospitals really need is a virtual-care strategy and a care delivery platform that addresses the entire continuum of healthcare. Deploying iPads is like installing a Ring doorbell when you really need a comprehensive, integrated security system.
If hospitals want virtual clinical services to be a permanent component of bedside care, they have to invest in strategies that drive permanent change. In addition to perfecting their virtual bedside care, they have to be the best place for their nurses to work, they must be the hospital of choice for patients, and all improvements must help them outperform their financial goals. Then they need the platform that best supports that strategy.
These concepts have direct parallels in the wider technology business space. Future-proofing efforts must make work more efficient for employees. The company must be an attractive home for top talent, and business innovations must help the company become more competitive.
3. Future-proofing business strategies must revolve around employee concerns
The two most important stakeholders in any organization are your employees and your customers — in that order. In a world of online reviews, it’s easy to become fixated on your customers and forget about your people. But if you take care of your employees, they will take care of your customers.
The situation in healthcare is a little different, of course. Nurses will take care of patients no matter what. I’ve seen that they will make the best of whatever tools they’re given to provide the highest possible level of care, but that doesn’t mean they’re immune to burnout or stress. No one is.
In a recent study, Gartner found that moderately stressed employees underperform by about 5%. This costs the average company tens of millions each year. In 2019, employees saw, on average, 12 changes in their day-to-day work. Now consider how many changes they saw in 2020 and the massive amount of stress essential workers experienced.
Change fatigue can create stress, so any future-proofing efforts should answer the question, “What’s in it for my employees?” Addressing their concerns goes a long way toward building trust and cohesion, which are two key factors in combating employee fatigue and paving the way for change.
The new way of doing things has to be better than the old way — for your employees and your customers. One trend I’m seeing in hospitals and tech companies is a move toward using a combination of in-person and virtual staff. This is effective because employees and customers are better off with a hybrid of physical and virtual services.
Now that more than a year has passed since the beginning of the pandemic, you’ve hopefully had a chance to catch your breath and reevaluate. This is the year when you take what you learned through hard times and use those lessons to create lasting change in your organization. 
At its core, future-proofing your business model means laying the groundwork for adaptability. It means improving operations for your employees and your customers — now and in the future.

Want to scale fast? Make developer productivity your top priority,Nicholas Mills,2021/04/6,"
One of the hardest processes for business leaders to control, encountered by every growing organization, is how to scale successfully. I’ve found this is even harder when scaling tech teams. Investing in the right places at the right time can be pivotal to the future of the business, as time and again these teams are the nucleus of value creation. 
I’ve heard it said — seen it attempted — that building larger teams is an easy fix, but for every order of magnitude increase, a new layer of management needs to be designed to operate the system. This becomes even more difficult if your team isn’t equipped with the right tech.
In my experience working with leading European tech companies, the most successful have flourished when their leaders do a resource balancing act. To support this, it is important that they empower their developers and engineering teams with both freedom to work in the best way for them, and well-suited tooling early in the lifecycle.
Building an effective team with a well-matched stack is the stuff of startup CEO dreams, but not all manage to achieve it. 
Productive developers make your dreams come true
The performance level of a software engineering team has become a key indicator of a company’s future success. It may sound obvious, but if you’re a startup founder or working for a startup that’s looking to scale confidently, having highly productive engineering teams goes a long way in bringing your products to market faster.
If you find you have more limited resources than you hoped for, being deliberate and efficient with funds and operations is key to drive that growth. Using your developers’ time in the most effective way possible is just as important as having the right product to begin with. 
For context, the cost of a developer minute is roughly $1.65, and the cost of a compute minute for automating an otherwise manual process is only around $0.006. Your developer efficiency can have a huge impact on the profitability.
Team structure and insights can be a vehicle for increased growth 
When you take a step back and consider how to facilitate positive communication by design you help contribute to your business’ growth environment. A lightbulb goes off when you realize that team size is an important factor in your operational efficiency. 
I’ve always found groups of between four and eight people are optimal, but when the number exceeds 10, it becomes challenging to communicate well enough on a weekly basis to get everything done on time.
So it’s crucial to empower your developers to make decisions and implement changes on their own, using timely platform data and insights — and that’s where the business leader makes their mark. 
When operating at scale, your empowered and efficient engineering team will be the difference between hitting a plateau in growth and reaching clear market leadership.
Make sure you scale effectively with the right tech
While empowering your teams with the right mindset is one part of the puzzle, doing the same with the tools they want to use to get the job done is the other. 
As a leader, a key part of building a positive environment for your engineers is enabling them to work in their own way so they are happy and productive. 
As the people on the front-line of the tech teams, they are equipped with the unique combination of business and technical information for what tool will work best for the job at hand. They often know what works better than you! This empowerment not only contributes to their output but also their talent retention and in attracting more top talent.
Working with technologies that scale well, rather than always adopting the newest up and coming solutions, provides the stability you want. With this, the tools can become a competitive differentiator and create success throughout the business.
Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), for example, is used to better understand the software development requirements and expected strain on the growing team. 
When scaling at speed, priorities can change daily, so having a clear view of what is required and being able to automate as much as possible can allow teams to be flexible in their approach and adapt to shifting demands.
As you grow, keep an eye on these factors, and look ahead to when strains may become fractures, and ensure your teams and your technologies will adapt before that time comes around.

Poll: Employees would rather make less money than go back to an office,Napier Lopez,2021/04/5,"
For many people, one of the few good things about this pandemic has been the ability to work from home. The past year has shown both employees and employers that many jobs can be done effectively from home.
In fact, the desire to keep work from home has been so strong that it appears a significant majority of people would rather turn down a $30,000 salary increase than lose the ability to work from home.
A poll posted on Blind, an anonymous forum for employees, asks:
Would you rather make $30k more switching to a new job that requires you to work in office or would you rather keep your current salary but wfh anywhere after covid?
It’s far from a scientific survey, but with over 3,000 votes so far, 64.3% say they would rather keep working from home, while 35.7% would opt for the extra cash.
A representative for Blind further elaborated with some specifics, such as that 71% of Airbnb, 81% of Lyft, 89% of Twitter, and 100% of Zillow employees would rather keep working from home.
A simple poll like this obviously misses some nuances, such as how much money the employees are making in the first place, or how often employees would have to go back to work. Because the question asks about switching jobs rather than, say, getting a raise at your current job, the results may be further skewed.
Still, this is not the only poll to suggest employees largely want more ability to work from home.
A survey run by the Harvard Business School Online and research firm City Square Associates polled nearly 1,500 professionals between March 2020 and March 2021 and found that “81% either don’t want to go back to the office or would prefer a hybrid schedule going forward.”
More specifically, 61 percent would like to be able to work 2-3 days from home, while 27% hoped to work remotely full time.
Only 18% of respondents wanted to go back to the office full-time. Curiously, parents with kids at home and married people were more likely to want to go back to work full time than singles.
As someone who’s been working from home for years before the pandemic, it’s hard to imagine going back to the office. Time is money, and the time wasted commuting is something that’s hard to put a price tag on.

How to successfully expand your brand into China,Ainar Abdrahmanov,2021/11/9,"
The Chinese market is one of the most appealing for brands looking to expand into new territories. And it’s clear why — the ecommerce market in China is $2.7 trillion, four times the size of the US ($843 billion), and is growing twice as fast. What’s even more exciting is that the share of ecommerce sales to total retail is expected to be at about 52.1% in 2021, growing from 44.8% just a year before.
While this is promising, I’ve found that there’s a widespread delusion among many executives that since there are 1.4 billion people in China, they’ll definitely be able to sell something due to the market’s sheer size.
But that’s not necessarily true, and we know many examples of a brand that failed to do so. Companies ranging from Tesco and Uber to eBay and Google have been on that path and had to exit or rebuild their strategy entirely.
So let’s dive into what’s the right way to approach the opportunities the Chinese market has to offer.
It’s all about ecommerce
Since ecommerce sales are about half of the total retail in China and even more than that in particular categories, I’d advise any brand interested in this market to focus on a digital-first strategy.
If a brand is used to offline distribution, its management and owners will repeat their usual strategy when entering China.
They think the following way: “Hell, we entered the USA, Brazil, and Japan. We know how distribution works, how advertising works, how to build relationships. We will enter major local retail chains just like we entered Walmart, Carrefour, and others. Each store will provide us with an expected monthly sales volume (100-200 kilograms or 200-500 packages on the shelf). That’s it”.
But if you want to export to China, the biggest mistake is repeating your strategy from other regions, even if it works outstandingly. In China, things are different.
Beware retail
In China, retail chains are overloaded with demand from all kinds of suppliers. You will have to pay for the shelf space, for a listing, promotion, and generally be offered pretty terrible terms. This means you will pay a lot, and you’ll get a wildly unpredictable result. Put simply, the market is saturated, and you’re new here.
Even if you’re large enough, you will be working through distributors with no control over your sales. And unless Chinese consumers already know about you, the retail chains have a minimal incentive to let your products on their shelves.
Ecommerce is different. Online marketplaces have infinite shelf space. Anyone with a bit of reason can put a product there. Compared to the time, effort, and cost of offline distribution, ecommerce is quick, effective, and scalable.
So the first question is to assess whether you’re ready to go online as your market entry strategy. If so, your team needs to understand how the ecommerce market works in China. Unlike ordinary retail, it’s pretty much unique regarding customer behaviors, habits, and the local ecosystem.
The local ecosystem helps you
In China, selling online is much more efficient because of the uniquely powerful marketplaces and supplier/vendor ecosystem. We do have bloggers and influencers in the US and Europe, but they’re more than just influencers in China. They are the media, and they control consumer trends.
We may have Instagram Live, but brands market their products through endless live streams performed by popular influencers, bringing their audiences to you. On platforms like Taobao or Douyin, they take the products they’re interested in and help you convert their audience into your customers. You instantly get connected to them, communicate with them, follow up, and market your products even further.
You might think that it’d be hard to top Amazon in terms of network power. But in fact, Amazon is just 5.8% of the US retail sales ($234 billion versus $4.04 trillion). And while it’s generally pretty good for consumers, suppliers have had significant and constant issues selling their products through Amazon, including some that have led to antitrust lawsuits. Unlike Amazon, Chinese ecommerce platforms help businesses grow.
Most importantly, platforms like Taobao and Alibaba provide us with data on sales for each product category and for each merchant — something you’d be surprised to see on Amazon. That allows anyone to adjust their product offering and adjust their listings for improved results.
The cost of customer acquisition through the Taobao live streaming or Douyin is much smaller than the investment required for offline retail. And most importantly, the ROI on the amount of money and efforts invested is significantly higher. Online sales are comparable in volume to offline in China, and for some products, even more significant.
Almost any brand, small or large, can start selling on Chinese online platforms, and for the following two to four years, you won’t even have to think about offline retail at all. And then, when the audience has already had a taste of your products — when you have proven there’s a demand for them — and have a few years of performance data, you could go to retail chains, show it to them, and get placements with more ease.
Essentially, you’ll de-risk your products for the Chinese brick and mortar retail outlets, and who’s not interested in profits with minimal risks?
Get local help
To market your products effectively, you will need to find a TP — a trading partner handling marketplace operations and managing live streaming platforms and blogger relations. Finding the right partner is a big part of your success. There are several agencies whose entire job is to help you find the right contractors. But you can’t just outsource these responsibilities straight away.
You need to have people explicitly focused on Chinese markets, talking to your trading partner, providing messaging points, basic marketing materials, and other details. Nobody knows your product better than you, and nobody will do that job for you.
A good trading partner always asks many questions and demands data to run successful campaigns, helping you flourish within the Chinese market.
Some of the companies that tried to enter China and failed believe there was something wrong with their brand. They pity themselves and explain to all others they just were too different and unique for this market, and there was nothing they could do about it.
The problem is not that your brand is unsuitable for selling in China or that you do not have enough money. The problem is neither in legal questions nor logistics. It’s about your competencies, experience, and psychology.
Success in China depends on whether you have people in your team who have experience working with the unique challenges of the region or at least are willing to learn and adapt because they understand it’s a different beast.
To successfully sell products in China, you need to look at companies that have operated there successfully for many years. Or, even better, at the ones that failed and rebuilt their operations. If Pizza Hut can make its product appealing to Chinese consumers, you can do that as well.

How to bootstrap and scale your SaaS startup the RIGHT way,Saravana Kumar,2021/11/1,"
As the founder of a bootstrapped startup, people often ask me how I decided on which funding route I’d take when there are so many options for founders to consider.
While I don’t have a short answer to this, there’s one thing I can say: your choice of funding needs to be based on the nature of your business and the product you are dealing with.
The exact type of your business can be determined in a number of ways, but I find ‘Red Ocean’ and ‘Blue Ocean’ can be quite helpful. Coined by acclaimed business theorists, W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne to classify all market strategies, Red Ocean refers to when there are a lot of competitors and you need a substantial amount of money to survive in it. Whereas Blue Ocean refers to a very niche market wherein you might see a lower growth rate but survive with considerably low investment.
While being helpful, there is of course no hard and fast rule to this theory — it’s often purely situational.
Our first product, BizTalk360 falls within Blue Ocean (no competitors, focused segment, and low customer acquisition cost) while our latest product, Document360, falls under the Red Ocean strategy.  With that product, we’re competing against companies like Zendesk, Freshdesk, Confluence, Notion, and so on, so we end up spending a lot on customer acquisitions for this product.
Now that I’ve given you a bit of the background on where I’m coming from, let’s dive into what made me ultimately decide on going the bootstrapping route.
The decision to bootstrap
The initial product idea for BizTalk360 was seeded at the Microsoft Global MVP Summit in Seattle in February 2010. The first version of the product was very well received by MVPs in 2011, which led to me to officially launch the startup the same year. Within a year, we onboarded 65 customers.
As we started to launch new products, we sort of banked on the success of our previous products and reinvested the revenues into the company to fund them. All our products have their own engineering, marketing, and sales teams working on improving the products and acquiring customers.
Today, our parent company kovai.co has 1500+ customers. We have not had to seek external funding since all our products are generating revenues.
Great products will sell
When we launched BizTalk360, we knew that we still had a long road ahead. Building the product was not much of a challenge since I have the required technical know-how. Selling the product was the tricky part as I didn’t have much experience doing that.
I started blogging very early in my career. My blog used to be very technical in nature as I specialized in a particular domain which is the BizTalk server and gradually I was able to build an audience of 15,000 followers.
When I developed BizTalk360, the blogs helped me get my first customer (a casino) all the way from Hong Kong, which was completely unknown to me until that point. While my blogging activities might’ve landed us the first customers, it was the value of the product itself that kept customers loyal.
So no matter how good your acquisition is, the retention will always come down to quality.
Scale at the right time
In my opinion, most startups fail due to premature scaling. That’s why knowing when to scale your startup is one of the most crucial decisions you’ll face as a founder.
Most entrepreneurs just assume that once their product has been successfully launched, it’s time to scale up. But that’s not how it works. The product has to be periodically monitored and improved to make sure that it is not being overtaken by competitors. Your product needs to scale up along with your business.
Since our flagship product, BizTalk360, is a niche segment, we were able to be the market leaders right from the beginning and still continue to do so. The product matured completely in about fives years and the goal was all about maintaining the product, taking care of existing customers, and adding new ones. We then decided to diversify and move to new products, we simply replicated what had worked for us in similar situations.
Another thing you should do is structure your work model and business process. You should have systems in place to effectively monitor the stakeholders and processes in the organization.
But once you actually pinpoint problems through that monitoring, you need to react to them the right way. Many startup founders think that just hiring a person can magically solve all their problems, but let me be clear: it doesn’t work.
For example, hiring a Sales Manager when your product isn’t working properly is a rookie mistake. You need to be extremely patient and persistent in the process. Ensure that your product is a market-fit product before you consider scaling your startup.
Scaling your startup might seem tempting sometimes, but nothing is better than the slow, steady, and organic growth of your startup.
Check your finances — cash flow, sales, expense, and revenue — before deciding whether you want to scale up. It’s easy to overlook certain aspects when you are trying to manage multiple things at the same time. Even then, you should have an elaborate financial plan with forecasts for the future.
The bottom line is: take time to lay the groundwork before taking your startup to the next level.

Even your ‘good’ decisions might be bad — so learn to rectify them,Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten,2021/10/28,"

When you’re launching a new company, product, or service, there’s an incredible amount of little decisions to make.
Of course, you’d like every single decision to be the perfect one, but that never happens. Instead, most of your choices will be mediocre, with many bad ones and only a few good ones. At the end of the day, you just have to hope your mediocre and good decisions make up for your many bad decisions.
And, unfortunately, the same goes for ethical dilemmas. Although you’ll aspire to be a saint and always choose the righteous path, no doubt at some point, you’ll end up negotiating on your ethics.
The reason for that is that ethical dilemmas are rarely clear-cut. You’ll have to figure out the many variables and decide which choice is the ‘least bad.’ And before you know it, you’ll do something that’s not straight-up evil or unethical… but close enough to make you question the tally of your karma points.
I heard about one such example from a manager at a startup recently. He had hired a salesperson, who was performing very well. And I mean seriously well.
They continuously outperformed everyone else in the sales team and landed the most impressive clients. But… this particular person was highly aggressive, impolite, and often almost abusive to prospective clients and coworkers.
Whenever the manager would overhear one of those sales calls, he would cringe and feel uncomfortable with the whole thing — although the salesperson hadn’t crossed any clear boundaries. The numbers also seemed reasonable, so he didn’t interfere.
Over time though, it became too much, and the salesperson was let go at one point. Sure it was a bit of a setback in the short term losing a high-performing salesperson, but after a few months, the company started gaining momentum again. They even got coverage on their favorite tech review site, amazing!
The article was comprehensive and cheerful and everything you’d hope for in a review… but then came the comments.
The first and most visible comment was from a CEO of a respectable company who described how awful the reviewed company’s sales approach was. He went on to explain, in detail, the aggressive stubbornness of the salesperson who hunted him, and how for him it stood out as an example of how not to do sales. He then concluded that if this reflected the company’s culture, he would never want to do business with them.
This was an important moment in the manager’s career because he instantly knew he deserved the criticism.
He knew the risks of allowing the successful but questionable salesperson to continue working at the company — but he was blinded by the revenue it generated.
So was it unethical to keep the salesperson on? No, but it was close enough to make the manager consider his karma points, and by then it was too late, the damage was already done.

Relying on a single cloud provider is hella risky — here’s a smarter strategy,Saidat Giwa-Osagie,2021/10/28,"
On 4th October 2021, millions of unsuspecting online users were surprised when a sudden internet blackout shut Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and Whatsapp down. The six-hour outage left many people without access to these platforms, which have cemented their place as the everyday cornerstones of modern communication. 
The significant outage lost Facebook billions on the stock market and made businesses that run on their platforms vulnerable to losses. Facebook’s data center issue shook the world, and a smaller Instagram outage a few days later highlighted how vulnerable we are to any disruption in our connectivity. And this isn’t the first time. 
Who could forget Fastly’s outage earlier this year that affected sites including Reddit, eBay, and The New York Times? Similarly, AWS Frankfurt experienced a major outage that took servers down when employees could not resolve the issue due to environmental problems preventing access to the data center. 
With 96% of companies depending on the cloud, digital platforms going down is a real and present threat. As companies revisit their crisis plans to avoid similar calamities in the future, the question is: what does a smart cloud strategy look like for companies today?
While not too long ago, everyone was talking about moving to the cloud, now we’re waking up to the fact that simply putting our data out there isn’t enough. A well-developed cloud strategy could save your business aches, pains, and even potential shutdowns. 
Configuring a cloud strategy
The majority of businesses on the cloud are using public services provided by giants like AWS. The benefit here is that companies can easily store their data in warehouses without needing the large budget and staff that housing the data themselves would require. 
There can also be substantial discounts available to a company investing heavily with a single provider due to economies of scale. However, these discounts can often come with a vendor lock-in, making it contractually impossible or more expensive to switch or access other cloud providers. For example, some cloud providers offer startups free cloud credits at first, then lock them into paid plans later on.
And, as exemplified by the Fastly outage, depending on a sole external cloud provider can have disastrous consequences if an outage occurs. The same goes for data leaks and cybersecurity threats; storing all of your data in one place makes it more vulnerable to attacks. 
Vendor lock-in also limits the amount of data sovereignty your organization can maintain. For example, with many larger cloud services based in the US or Asia, only a small portion of European data is actually stored in the EU. This could above all mean that your data is vulnerable and potentially visible by non-European authorities, due to extraterritorial legislation like the US Cloud Act. With 36% of EU based companies now using cloud computing, this could become a bigger issue in the coming years.
Finally, it also means less flexibility to take advantage of alternative configurations and possibilities that could work better for other parts of your business. For example, your accounting team’s data needs may be very different from what you need to properly store your client data. 
Pros and cons of having one sole provider:

Easy to move to an existing service
Discounts may be available
Possible vendor lock-in 
Vulnerable to outages and security leaks
Less flexibility and data sovereignty

Configuring a multi-cloud strategy
Instead of relying on one provider, many are creating multi-cloud environments across multiple vendors. According to a study by Accenture, out of enterprises that have already moved to the cloud, 93% have adopted a multi-cloud strategy. 
Going multi-cloud also offers flexibility by enabling companies to optimize workloads according to different providers’ capacity, performance, location, environmental efficiency and costs. With other USPs provided by various vendors, companies have the luxury of selecting the best aspects of each provider. 
A multi-cloud strategy also enables companies to avoid lock-ins with a sole provider, giving them the ultimate choice and flexibility in their cloud infrastructure. For example, this means you can also choose between multiple payment models (hourly, monthly, yearly) and multiple resource types (virtual, baremetal, homegrown).
Of course, as with any plan, there are some drawbacks to consider. One is that you really need to do a lot of initial research to choose which cloud providers can offer what you need to build a cloud strategy that meets your company’s needs. 
Diversifying cloud platforms may also require internal staff to manage your cloud strategy, adding to operating costs. Providing the needed security measures for a multi-cloud setup is another vital requirement and adds a layer of complexity.
Pros and cons of building a multi-cloud strategy:

Less vulnerability to shutdowns and attacks
Less prone to geopolitical risks when the cloud mix is diverse/international
More flexibility and options in building your cloud strategy
Lower operational costs when adopting a pick and choose strategy
Higher contract and operational costs unless the architecture is multi-cloud by design 
Need to develop a strong security strategy

What to consider when pursuing a multi-cloud setup
Even with a reliable cloud provider at hand, one bad downtime situation is all it takes to ruin a priceless reputation. At the same time, working with multiple cloud platforms can also increase the complexity and workload associated with cloud configurations, so balancing the benefits with the drawbacks of multi-cloud environments is essential. With those factors in mind, there are several steps to consider when deciding on a multi-cloud strategy. 
Identify how and why a multi-cloud would benefit your organization. A clear understanding of its usefulness in your context will help to shape your strategy and deployment. Ask yourself the following questions:

Are you using a multi-cloud setup for dynamic provisioning in the event of an outage or heavy usage demands? 
Could this approach save or make more money? 
What operational steps are necessary to make multi-cloud viable in your organization? 

The answers to these questions will differ in each instance but are vital in illuminating the processes moving forward.
Steps to set-up a multi-cloud strategy 
Let’s say you’ve decided going multi-cloud is the right move for your organization. How can you get there?
1. Identify all the different cloud vendors and contracts tied to your company 
Firstly, getting the big picture of your various cloud configurations is essential because it will help you understand the state of your organization and define how you want cloud operations to evolve onwards.
2. Determine which services you would like to integrate or stop
Once you’ve got a picture of the state of the cloud in your company, the second step is to determine which services you’d like to integrate or stop altogether. Are there opportunities to combine different services that would optimize performance or lower operating costs? Approaching the situation with a strategic lens will tease out your roadmap.
Multi-cloud enabling products could help you make that move without damaging the integrity of your current setup. Products like multi-cloud load balancers can help manage online traffic with third-party integrations and guarantee more server availability in the case of debilitating cyberattacks. Mapping out your multi-cloud plans will help you figure out where these sorts of products fit into your organization.
3. Build and develop a team with multi-cloud management capabilities
Thirdly, building a team that can manage the multi-cloud configuration is essential. Using different cloud operators can increase the complexity of an organization’s cloud setup, so having a skilled and collaborative team to oversee the architecture and operation of the cloud setup is necessary to instate and evolve your multi-cloud mission.
4. Create cloud governance procedures in tandem with cloud management tools
Finally, cloud management is a defining aspect of the multi-cloud approach. Assessing how you’ll handle integrations and accessing a vendor‘s APIs across multiple providers without incompatibility issues should be explored ahead of long-term implementation. If you can figure out how your separate deployments will work in tandem, this will help make your multi-cloud setup less complicated. 
With such a variety of cloud vendors available today, a multi-cloud or hybrid approach is fast becoming one of the trusted cloud strategies. As more companies consider how to maintain a constant online presence, really taking the time to build out a clear cloud strategy can give companies and users peace of mind during an otherwise unpredictable situation.

The ultimate employee benefit you need to offer: Purpose,Bob Lord,2021/10/27,"
The world’s labor markets are currently bracing for a mass exodus of workers in what some experts are calling “the Great Resignation.” 
Recent surveys indicate more than a quarter of the global workforce, and perhaps as much as 40%, is considering quitting. Meanwhile, U.S. Labor Department data reveals Americans are already leaving their jobs at the highest rates in two decades.
Why? Because with crisis comes perspective.
As many around the world emerge from the most difficult year in their professional lives, a steady job with fair pay and decent benefits is no longer enough. 
Even work-from-home options aren’t enough, with data indicating many workers are itching to get back into the office: 63% of people with kids under 12 and 40% of childless workers are ready for the end of work-from-home, according to a recent Haven Life survey. 
If, as employers, you want to keep employees engaged and productive for the long term — which I think you definitely should — let me tell you, the game has changed. 
You must now meet a higher standard. You must imbue their jobs with meaning. You must offer work with purpose.  
Create meaningful opportunities for employees to become activist engineers
Of course, not all lines of work come with an inherent sense of purpose. This is why nearly two-thirds of employers now offer some sort of paid-time-off program to encourage volunteering. That’s commendable. 
But these programs leave it to employees to identify and engage with an overwhelming and often unfulfilling array of volunteer opportunities. As a result, only about a third of employees take advantage of these programs.
To truly inspire employees to make a difference, I implore you to create volunteer opportunities that allow employees to become activists, applying the same skills they use in their day jobs. 
One example that I know well is Call for Code, a program IBM launched in 2018 with David Clark Cause and The United Nations Human Rights Office, to provide resources, funding, and open source technology to empower developers to create tech for good. 
The response has been staggering, with over half a million developers across 180 countries to date having contributed solutions to address societal problems. For example, four developers from Taiwan, Brazil, Mongolia, and India built an app to bring the power of artificial intelligence and weather insights to help rural farmers struggling with the effects of climate change. 
In this way, I view the traction we’ve witnessed with Call for Code as evidence that developers truly crave outlets for activism and a deeper sense of purpose – while also further developing their skills and exercising critical problem-solving skills. 
Offer to fulfill “stretch” assignments
Traditional stretch assignments serve an important role by acknowledging the tedium inherent in some roles. But these extracurricular opportunities often wind up being little more than a repository for unwanted, non-critical work.
To foster a sense of purpose in these assignments, you need to — as a business leader — identify or co-create opportunities to give back to communities while honing existing skills. 
The health fitness company Equinox, for example, funds The Heroes Project, which provides personal and physical training to severely injured veterans. SMBP, the large recruiting company, donates resume services and career coaching for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
So look at where you can give back and use it to inspire your employees.
Build ecosystems of support
Solving difficult, societal problems requires a variety of expertise and perspectives. But I feel like organizations limit too often the scope of their outreach based on artificial barriers. 
When trying to change the world, collaboration with customers, business partners, and even competitors are both necessary and deeply rewarding. This is a wonderful opportunity for deep employee engagement beyond their typical role.
In California, for example, The San Francisco Chronicle heads the San Francisco Homeless Project, which brings together reporters from dozens of competing news organizations and outlets to report stories that shine a light on the city’s homeless population. 
In Nigeria, the consulting company Accenture created a new e-learning platform to reach students in Africa in innovative ways, part of the Junior Achievement Nigeria initiative, a collaboration between many of the world’s leading consultancies and banks. 
In both cases, competitive boundaries were crossed in the name of purpose, which is a lesson to us all. 
Two years ago, before the start of the pandemic, the CEOs of the largest companies in America, including former IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, redefined the “purpose of a corporation.” The statement they issued made manifest the corporate philosophies many companies already held. Namely, that the responsibilities of the modern corporation should extend far beyond shareholders to include customers, employees, suppliers, and communities.
They also understood that today’s workforce needs more than stock options and profit-sharing to stay motivated. They need a sense of purpose. A connection to something bigger. 
And to be honest, it shouldn’t take a global crisis to make us deliver meaningful opportunities to the workforce so they can apply their shared desire and aptitude for activism to drive social good. 
So as the job markets begin to thaw and competition for talent heats up, I believe companies of all shapes and sizes, in every part of the world, need to start investing in purpose the same way they invest in marketing or product development, for the good of their business, and the good of society.

Your startup isn’t ready for Europe’s privacy shake-up — but here’s how it can be,Peter Day,2021/10/26,"
For decades, people have proclaimed the now-common refrain that “privacy is dead.” I often think back to Scott McNealy, then CEO at Sun Microsystems, claiming in 1999 that “you have zero privacy anyway… get over it.”
I wouldn’t go as far as saying that leaders at startups hold such a strong disregard for privacy, but I do find many taking the stance that the world’s strictest data privacy laws don’t apply to them. If you fall into this category, you ought to know that privacy isn’t dead, and a new era of privacy is being quietly ushered in across Europe.
Earlier this year the European Commission (EC) issued its long-awaited update to ‘Standard Contractual Clauses’ (SCCs), which represents the most frequently used mechanism to transfer your customers’ personal data out of the EU, including to the US.
If you’re a business that operates in or with Europe, these new updates – and the constantly shifting privacy landscape more generally – matter. If followed incorrectly or not taken seriously at all, it can be extremely costly. 
So, let’s look at some of these new privacy updates in more detail and I’ll then share some lessons I learned while working on privacy issues at a startup that processes vast amounts of user data.
A new era of privacy, and the fine print you probably missed
The question of where your data exists and who has access to it is becoming one of the most complex and significant questions in startup land.
On the one hand, the booming SaaS startup ecosystem means that we are now more reliant than ever on the cloud, where servers often reside abroad. On the other, there are ever-changing regional data rights as different jurisdictions embrace data sovereignty and privacy rights for users.
This friction has now made its way to the courts, and just last year the EU issued a ruling (dubbed ‘Schrems II’) that invalidated the ‘Privacy Shield,’ or the mechanism that was being used to get data out of Europe and into American data centers for processing. Then came the update to the SSCs. 
The basic premise of this update was to bring in new SCCs to govern the transfer of personal data from the EU to third countries, designed to better protect Europeans from mass surveillance, specifically a concern with regard to the US.
If you’re operating in or doing business with European residents, international data flows are probably an essential part of your business in an increasingly digital global economy. You might not even be aware that your digital product relies on microservices from a partner that sees user data processed in a third country.
Let’s take for example our product at Mixpanel. We provide SaaS-based product analytics technology, which by its nature, tracks user behavior within apps so product experts can improve the user experience. 
If you use our product, until recently you’d have been sending data to us that was processed in the US, perhaps without fully realizing the implications. We’ve now got full EU data residency to overcome this issue, but we’re very much in the minority.
And this should be the number one issue concerning startups. Has our surface area for liability and risk just been hugely expanded? If I put this in simpler terms: you’re a fintech that has contracts with seven companies providing services via APIs. Those seven companies also contract with a further 10 companies each, which now means your risk surface has expanded from seven companies to 70.
So, what can busy startups do to reduce their risk and ensure they’re delivering on privacy obligations for the people that use their services? 
In my view, there are three golden rules that can help a startup navigate this complexity.

Locate user data in Europe whenever possible: Depending on your infrastructure and ability to invest, you’ll need to form a judgment as to whether you can ensure your user’s data is stored and processed exclusively in Europe.  
Always maintain a ‘data map’: It is vital to take an “audit” of the microservices and ancillary support services that underpin your main products. In doing so, you can better understand that data ecosystem and your risk surface across third-party suppliers.
Seek European legal entities as partners: It’s possible authorities in the US could access data that was in the Netherlands, but was operated by a US-based company. The contracting party matters, so it’s important to partner with legal entities across different regional operations based in the EU. 

There’s simply no avoiding this issue in the long term. People increasingly care about data privacy and with the changes to the SCCs the EU has further signaled the importance it attaches to data residency. With local regulators soon to release their guidance and interpretation within member states, now is the time to act. 
The movement for improved privacy isn’t dead, it’s just getting started.

"Hybrid work isn’t perfect, but SCIENCE can help us improve it",The Conversation,2021/10/25,"
COVID-19 has changed the way we work.
Even before the pandemic, the U.S. workforce increasingly relied on remote collaboration technologies like videoconferencing and Slack. The global crisis accelerated the adoption of these work tools and practices in an unprecedented way. By April 2020, about half of companies reported that more than 80% of their employees worked from home because of COVID-19.
That shift was made possible by decades of research into, and then development of, technologies that support remote work, but not everyone uses these technologies with the same ease. As early as 1987, groundbreaking research identified some of the challenges facing women working from home using technology. That included the difficulties of child care, work-home separation and employee growth opportunities.
Since that time, we have learned much more about virtual collaboration. As an associate professor of information systems, I’m interested in what we can expect as we eagerly anticipate a post-pandemic future. One thing stands out: Hybrid work arrangements – that is, employees who do some tasks in the office and others virtually – is clearly going to be a big part of the picture.
One survey from April 2021 shows 99% of human resources leaders expect employees to work in some kind of hybrid arrangement moving forward. Many have already begun. As just one example, Dropbox, the file hosting service, made a permanent shift during the pandemic, allowing employees to work from home and hold team meetings in the office.
The definition of “hybrid” varies in other organizations. Some workers might be in the office a couple days a week or every other day. Other businesses may require only occasional face-to-face time, perhaps meeting in a centralized location once each quarter.
Either way, research does show many companies fail in their implementation of a virtual workforce.
Remote work versus in the office
In-office work promotes structure and transparency, which may increase trust between management and workers. Developing an organizational culture happens naturally. Casual office conversations – a worker walking down the hall for a quick and unscheduled chat with a colleague, for instance – can lead to knowledge-sharing and collaborative problem-solving. That’s difficult to replicate in a virtual environment, which often relies on advance scheduling for online meetings – although that’s still feasible with enough planning and communication.
But if you look at different metrics, in-office work loses out to working from home. My recent research discovered remote workers report more productivity and enjoy working from home because of the flexibility, the ability to wear casual clothes, and the shortened or nonexistent commute time. Remote work also saves money. There is a significant cost savings for office space, one of the largest budget line items for organizations.
Hybrid arrangements attempt to combine the best of both worlds.
It’s not perfect
It’s true that hybrid work faces many of the same obstacles of face-to-face work. Poor planning and communication, ineffective or unnecessary meetings and confusion about task responsibilities happen remotely as well as in-person.
Perhaps the largest issue when working at home: technology and security concerns. Home networks, an easier target for cyberthreats, are typically more vulnerable than office networks. Remote workers are also more likely to share computers with someone else outside of their organization. Hybrid organizations must invest upfront to work through these complicated and often expensive issues.
With hybrid work, managers cannot see the work taking place. That means they must measure employee performance based on outcomes with clear performance metrics rather than the traditional focus on employee behavior.
Another potential pitfall: Fault lines can develop within hybrid teams – that is, misunderstandings or miscommunication between those in the office and those at home. These two groups may start to divide, potentially leading to tension and conflicts between them – an us-versus-them scenario.
Establishing a hybrid environment
Numerous recommendations exist on the best way to develop a hybrid model. Here are a few of the best ideas.
Meeting too often or with little purpose – that is, meeting for the sake of meeting – leads to fatigue and burnout. Not everyone needs to be at every meeting, yet finesse from management is required to make sure no one feels left out. And meeting-free days can help with productivity and allow employees a block of uninterrupted time to focus on complex projects.
Listening to employees is critical to making sure the hybrid environment is working. Continually seeking feedback, through one-on-one conversations, focus groups or human resources surveys, is important too. So is recognizing and rewarding employees with in-person or virtual kudos for their achievements. Performance incentives, such as financial rewards or tokens of appreciation including food delivery, help develop a supportive culture that increases employee commitment.
Finally: Both managers and employees must be transparent in their communication and understanding of hybrid plans. Policies must be in place to define what tasks happen in the office and remotely. Access to reliable communications is essential, particularly for remote work. All employees must receive the same information at the same time, and in a timely manner. After all, whether in the office or online, workers don’t want to feel they’re the last to know.

4 tips for startups in the booming plant-based dairy market,Carolina Lapa,2021/10/22,"
People care about climate change and animal welfare — so it’s no wonder the demand for plant-based products has exploded in the last couple of years. The alternative dairy market is expected to triple over the next decade, reaching a whopping $32 billion USD by 2031.
But what exactly is it that will determine success within this fast-growing industry? And what do startups need to know in order to attain partnerships with the corporates that can get their products on the map?
Well, in my experience, it all boils down to four key lessons — but let’s begin with outlining the research I’m basing this on before diving into each of them.
Getting to know the field
My team at TNW works with industry-leading companies and governments all over the globe looking to partner with or support small innovative businesses in expanding their reach. Two of our most interesting recent projects involved scouting plant-based dairy startups for industry leaders in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector.

My following insights derive mostly from working on this report, in which the TNW scouting and research team, along with nlmtd, mapped a couple of the most promising startup-corporate collaborations in the plant-based dairy space.
Of course, I recommend you check out the full report — it’s a thrilling read — but what we basically saw was that while the number of bets on plant-based startups has been growing, the bar remains pretty high for the adoption of these products on a large scale.
So, here are my four key insights for startups and scale-ups who want to attract the right partnerships to succeed in the alternative dairy market.
Tip #1: Nutrition is one, naturalness is two
What I heard a lot in my conversations with industry leaders was that nutrition and naturalness are often misunderstood by consumers and sometimes miscommunicated by startups. 
Claims that refer to the amount of a certain natural ingredient (for example, ‘this product is 35% almonds’) say very little about the level of naturalness of that food product. 
In fact, naturalness, as seen by FMCG leaders, has more to do with the content of artificial sweeteners or preservatives — as well as other elements.
A study conducted by Hero Group with the University of Murcia and ETH Zürich, published in 2017, provides a helpful three-part organization to define naturalness: 

If the origin of the food includes the use of organic raw material grown locally
If the production of the product is free from artificial ingredients, preservatives, additives, artificial colors and flavors, chemicals, hormones, pesticides, and GMOs
And finally, if the end product is healthy, eco-friendly, and fresh

Nutrition, on the other hand, is more straightforward. In dairy, it often relates to the protein content versus the levels of fat and sugar. While high protein amounts are highly desired, fat and sugar are unwished for. 
The balance between the three is really key if your aim is to impress nutrition experts in FMCG corporations. So if you want to woo partners, compensating the taste of your plant-based ingredient that is high in protein with loads of sugar might not be the best way forward.
Tip #2: Taste and texture as the gate-keepers of future demand
Another two criteria that FMCG corporations repeatedly brought up when discussing new plant-based dairy concepts were taste and texture. 
It didn’t matter whether we were talking about milk, yogurt, butter, cheese, or spreads — taste and texture cannot be left aside if the goal is to choose a product that consumers will change their diets for. 
While the untapped demand for plant-based products is big, the curiosity of consumers for product experimentation might not always be this high. 
Once a few players achieve in plant-based dairy what consumers are used to experiencing in traditional dairy products, the market will be theirs for the taking — or at least that is what industry leaders bet on.
Currently, the levels of taste and texture of plant-based dairy products vary a lot from product to product, and that is of course natural to the experimental and radically innovative period that the market is in. 
But when consumer preferences consolidate, a premium experience of taste and texture is going to make the difference between a successful and a forgotten plant-based dairy brand, especially when we talk about indulgent dairy products, such as flavored yogurts and cheese.
Tip #3: Cheese is the Holy Grail

Cheese alternatives are considered the next frontier in product development and plant-based innovation. 
The market of alternative milk and yogurt — either made from legumes, nuts, or grains; or developed in laboratories based on cells — is in a period of expansion and global adoption. The market for alternative cheese is growing alongside the new milk trend, but at the same time, it faces more scrutiny from traditional dairy and a level of skepticism from consumers.
For an ambitious startup, a challenge like that is just another word for a business opportunity. In fact, we can easily observe the huge appetite for entrepreneurship in the plant-based cheese category. 
The way things are set up now, to me it seems like startups in North America, Europe, Latin America, and Asia are working non-stop around the clock to find what is the best possible combination of ingredients and which process produces the tastiest plant-based cheese. So you better be quick if you want to beat them to it.

Tip #4: Online, transparent, and (better if) local
Sustainability, animal welfare, dietary requirements, healthy lifestyle. All of these are consumer trends that have been directly boosting the growth of the plant-based dairy industry. 
Complimentary to that, I also see trends of convenience, consumer ethics, and community-driven economics are expected to have a significant impact on the direction in which plant-based entrepreneurship moves.
Our scouting research and discussions with FMCG industry leaders indicate that the need for convenience and flexibility creates space for new product formats as well as business models. 
For example, consumers are already open to experimenting with subscription models, in which plant-based products such as oat and almond milk are delivered to their door at regular intervals of their choice. Another growing product offering is ready-to-go plant-based yogurts and milk bottles, a format already known by the traditional dairy industry.
But I also feel we can’t overlook the fact that consumers have a broader understanding of the impact their choices have on the prosperity of society, the environment, and the economy. 
Information and transparency are key for individuals to build trust in both new and traditional brands. This has led to a preference for plant-based products that openly share information about the sourcing of their ingredients, as well as production methods and impact across the value chain. 
Sure, established global brands may be far ahead when it comes to scale, expertise, and reach — but young companies can outshine them when it comes to connecting with consumers. 
So if your startup is aiming to make big waves in this space, I recommend you work with the local communities and wisely choose the source of your products. That way can stay ahead by being more in touch with what future generations really want.

How to say ‘no’ to your customers and still provide great service,Ana Gotter,2021/10/19,"
I’ve worked in customer-facing roles in the retail and hospitality industries, and now I’m a freelance writer. In all three roles, I quickly learned that there are plenty of times when the customer is most decidedly not always right.
But even when they’re dead wrong, what do you do?
As a service-based business owner, I pride myself on delivering exceptional customer service, and I’ve learned how to create a strong client experience while also standing my ground. Here are my tips for how to walk that fine line as a service provider.
1. Don’t fall for an ambush
In order to stand your ground, you need to be prepared. Being caught off guard is a one-way ticket to being taken advantage of.
Here’s an example. I had a contract to write some website copy. I followed all of the instructions (including vague and frankly strange ones like “write sexy like James Bond”). I got great feedback from the client, and the project was complete.
Then the client “wanted to talk.” They insisted on a phone call at a ridiculous hour and refused to talk by email. I woke up at 6 a.m. for the call, and they promptly informed me they’d been working with two copywriters at once — and they liked the other person’s copy more. Ok, no problem. Except they didn’t want to pay me what we’d agreed upon, even though I’d completed the work exactly as specified.
It was an ambush. I knew it then, but I was too flustered to do much about it. They demanded an answer right away, and because I was still building my client base, I wanted to be agreeable. I said yes, I would take a discounted rate, and walked away with only half of the amount I had rightfully earned.
It was a mistake: the correct and only answer was no — to the call initially and to the request of a discounted rate. We had a contract, I delivered, and I even got positive feedback. I hadn’t been participating in some competition; it was a job, and I did it.
Since then, I’ve had a few (now ex-) clients try to rattle me with last-minute calls or Zoom meetings to try to increase the scope of work without payment. I stick to email, and it prevents an ambush.
If you’re ever caught off guard, try saying something like: “Let me consider it, and I’ll get back to you through email later today.” Maybe you’ll decide they’re being reasonable — and that’s fine — but it puts you back in control of the decision.
2. Communicate standard policies upfront
If you communicate your policies right off the bat, you’ll have something really clear to point to when standing your ground, which makes it a lot less fuzzy.
For example, one of my standard policies is that my prices include one round of revisions that allows for up to 15% changes in the text. I made this policy because I had clients who would approve outlines and then ask for multiple rounds of edits that completely revamped the entire post — they didn’t know what they wanted, and even if they were well-intentioned, it ended up losing me money.
Sometimes clients still ask for multiple rounds of edits. But I stick to my policies and let them know we can either use the existing edit or I can charge more for additional revisions.
For your most important policies, I’d suggest reminding clients a couple of times: once when they first sign on and then again when you start your first “project” with them (for me, that’s when I submit my first draft).
3. Put everything in writing
I essentially run my entire business through email. There are a few reasons for that:

It’s convenient
It prevents those ambushes I mentioned earlier
Most significantly, it allows me to keep a record of all communications

There’s no confusion when I can literally point to what I or the client said in an email two months earlier. Even after client onboarding calls, I send a written summary of everything we discussed and ask the client to confirm that the details are correct.
Of course, if you’re in a situation where you need to show your clients that you’re right, do it delicately. Here’s my go-to response:
I completely understand where you’re coming from, but for reference, I’ve attached the original email where you approved having this blog post be 1,500 words. Please let me know if you have further questions.
No one can argue with that, so you’re able to protect yourself while ensuring the client that you’re not trying to pull the wool over their eyes.
4. Know your boundaries in advance
Boundaries are hard: in life, at an office job, and especially when you’re running a business. When I started my business, I had no boundaries. I felt like I couldn’t say no to anything — it cost me money and was terrible for my mental health.
When I realized what was happening, I realized I needed to officially set some boundaries. They didn’t have to be part of my standard client-facing policies, but I needed to write them down for myself and stick to them.
I started delineating what I would always say yes to (e.g., NDAs) and what I would always say no to (e.g., non-competes). This means:

I don’t get decision fatigue every time I’m faced with a client request that I’m not sure is fair — I just follow my own boundaries
I have a clear understanding for myself of what’s good for me and my business, and I don’t accidentally lose sight of that for edge cases

I had a client, for example, who emailed me because a post with my byline mentioned one of their competitors. That mention had been added by my editor — I had no idea what the client was even talking about.
They asked me to remove the mention. I said I couldn’t: my editor put it there, and I don’t own the content. They then asked me to sign a non-compete that would be “at our discretion at any point” for direct and indirect competitors. This was a client who hired me for 3% of my annual income, and they wanted almost full control over my client relationships.
I’d really liked working with this client, but I said no. It meant I lost the client. And it hit: it was right at the beginning of the pandemic. But I had a clear boundary I’d established for myself long ago — no non-competes — so I confidently knew that I was making the right choice.
It’s worth reviewing your boundaries (and your policies) every so often to be sure they’re still relevant and meaningful for the current stage of your business, but don’t do it so often that they’re no longer helping you stand your ground.
5. Remember that clients who walk aren’t a good fit
Not all clients will be a fit for your business — and if they aren’t, it will be almost impossible to deliver the experience they’re looking for.
If you have a potential client that’s trying to get you to do something that doesn’t align with your skills, your contract, your availability, or your agreed-upon deliverables after you’ve said no, walk away.
I had a client who requested more content than I had time for one month. I told them I could write two blog posts for them, but I wouldn’t be able to do the website copy they requested. They continued even after I’d said no, and even accused me of “letting greed block my blessings.” I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt and explained how the site copy would take four times as long as the blog posts, but even then, they said I should cut my Christmas break short to make time.
That was the end of that client relationship — and that’s ok. Losing a client is never easy, but if it’s not a good fit, you’re better off for it.
More than 90% of all of the clients I’ve worked with as a freelance writer have been exceptional, and all of my long-retaining clients are a dream to work with. But there will always be clients with unreasonable expectations. Others will blatantly try to take advantage of you. And some will simply misremember or misunderstand something to the point where you risk a potential issue.
Knowing how to stand your ground — both proactively and after the fact — allows you to keep your business running smoothly while offering great customer service at the same time.

In defense of the sensible embargo: How tech startups can do PR right,Ayelet Noff,2021/10/18,"
There’s no denying it: the trusty embargo remains a positive and productive tool for professionals on both sides of the press-PR divide. If anything, embargoes have only become more important in recent years, and they’re certainly not going anywhere. 
Why? It’s simple. Virtually every industry that depends on new releases and new information to push its news cycle forward makes use of the embargo. This includes arts and entertainment, publishing, science and medicine, gaming, and, of course, tech.
Whether B2B or B2C, large corporation or startup, tech PR relies on embargos to manage constantly changing product release schedules and updates. This is an industry that likes to keep things under wraps — if not totally secret — until launch day, and that requires a dizzying amount of coordination, calendars, and planning to make happen. 
It also requires real relationships with journalists. It’s no secret that good ol’ fashioned human relationships are key to getting your story in front of the public — whether or not it’s embargoed. 
But simultaneously juggling multiple journalist relationships while preparing a big PR push comes with its own set of challenges. That’s where the embargo comes in.
Embargoes are valuable in part because they prevent inadvertent favoritism. Embargoes allow every journalist you pitch an opportunity to cover your news at the same time, meaning no publication feels like they’re starting in second place. 
Top-tier publications naturally want to publish first, but embargos make sure nothing is announced before it’s ready and that all journalists pitched have the same amount of time (and breathing room) to cover, no matter where they work.
Journalists will not only welcome your embargoed scoops, but cooperate with you if you treat them like actual people with specific beats and use only the embargos you absolutely need. When used correctly, embargos give the right journalists time to write the kind of coverage you want and do it well. 
Avoid opening a communication channel with a journalist you’ve never worked with before with an embargo. There’s no good way to soften the but-what-can-you-do-for-me implied in that kind of unsolicited introduction.
Learn to prioritize and personalize. In other words, know who you’re talking to. 

my favorite kind of PR emails are the ones telling me I’m under embargo for some information that I didn’t ask for and have no interest in knowing
— Dylan Hafer (@thedylanhafer) April 30, 2021

First things first: does the journalist you’re pitching accept embargos? If they do, they may want all the information up front, or they may prefer to get a quick primer before agreeing to anything. If you’re not sure, ask. Don’t guess.
No matter which publications you want to embargo, you should be mindful of the constraints of their editorial calendar. No dropping an embargo on a reporter two days before it lifts. Yours is never the only story a writer is working on, and 48 hours from embargoed press release to publication just isn’t going to cut it. 
It may also have the inadvertent effect of making you look both disorganized and inconsiderate of their time. Try two weeks instead.
Know when it’s news, know when it’s not
In my experience, startups sometimes struggle to distinguish between what is promotional and what is truly newsworthy. This is totally understandable, as it can be tricky to tell when new developments are happening quickly inside your business. 
It’s nonetheless a crucial distinction if you’re going to keep journalists on your side and not stuff their inboxes with unnecessary embargos.
Be considerate by being discerning and realistic. At its heart, the embargo is about keeping things quiet, so only embargo news items that are tied to a specific date and that journalists will need additional time to research and write. 
Nurturing your relationships with journalists means valuing their time and not treating every single item of your public-facing strategy as uniquely precious.
This means deciding what’s truly newsworthy rather than promotional, then only embargoing the most important newsworthy developments. This includes brand new models and launches, top-to-bottom software overhauls, and game-changing funding announcements with lots of zeros. 
High-profile partnerships that coincide with a previously unseen special edition version of your product? Sure. High-profile endorsements and big awards? Those are no doubt wonderful to have, but they land firmly in the promotional camp. 
Calling an embargo truce
It’s no accident that despite some determined detractors, the embargo has held on. Part of the reason for that is practical. Startups and tech businesses deal with time-sensitive information by nature, and an evolving effort to prevent leaks will always be part and parcel of this industry. 
The best communications people for tech startups and tech giants understand this, and public relations for any industry will always depend on relationships. 
That’s why a little courtesy works wonders when it comes to embargoes. Eager startups chomping at the bit can sometimes struggle to see the forest for the trees when trying to get the public excited about their story. Journalists, in turn, can (not unjustifiably) find startups’ public relations efforts a little too persistent or impersonal. 
Consider both sides of this coin when deciding what and who to embargo, and scrap the mass blast while you’re at it. It’s no PR industry secret that this strategy is the surefire way to get actual results, delivered when you want them, without making any enemies along the way.

When should you listen to investors? And when should you ignore them?,Már Másson Maack,2021/09/27,"
As a founder, you’re bombarded with tips and tricks on how to secure funding and woo potential investors… but what happens after that? What do you do with their advice? And what happens if you don’t agree with their suggestions?
That’s why I called up Heini Zachariassen, Vivino’s opinionated and vocal founder, who’s got tons of experience listening to — and not listening to — his investors to shed some light on this awkward little dilemma.
You’re the right person to lead the company
For Zachariassen, the most important thing to remember is that you landed a financial backer based on your vision and ideas: “Investors know that the best person to run a company is the founder. If they didn’t, they wouldn’t have invested in the first place.”
And it seems this philosophy has really paid off for Vivino. The platform, which emerged from Zachariassen’s simple frustration of not knowing which wine to buy, has now grown to a community of 50 million users. It’s also raised $221 million in funding and rolled out a global wine marketplace. 
You know your company best — that’s why Zachariassen believes you shouldn’t let investors get involved with details. 
“We have product and engineering teams that work all day and night on the product, so they are going to decide what that button is going to look like and what color it is. Not the investors. There’s a level of granularity here that’s important. Investors shouldn’t get operational because they’re simply not qualified to do so.
Heini Zachariassen, founder of Vivino and host of Raw Startup.
Be careful though, this doesn’t give you a blank cheque to do whatever you want and just ignore your investors. Sure, in the early stages of Vivino, Zachariassen and his co-founder Theis Søndergaard fought investors to postpone their demands for profitability in order to secure the market. But in later stages, he followed one of the most seismic suggestions from his investors: moving to Silicon Valley.
This was a big change that reached far beyond just the scope of the startup. It meant Zachariassen had to uproot his entire family and all the challenges that come with that (there’s actually a whole documentary on this journey on Amazon Prime Video). But this was a big-picture suggestion from investors that Zachariassen could get on board with, as the connection between being based there and winning the US market was clear.








So you should sometimes listen to investors… and sometimes not? That doesn’t sound particularly helpful. 
Don’t worry though, Zachariassen breaks down his approach to listening to investor feedback. The first point is to be aware of is at what stage the investor joined. The second, investors will eventually ‘pull rank’ — but when they do, confirm that’s really what they’re doing and then deal with it accordingly.

Angels aren’t divine
“Getting angel investors can be a bit of a minefield. It’s the point where you have the biggest risk of getting someone on board that’s… really shit. The further you go up the chain, usually the better investors you get. That’s at least my experience,” says Zachariassen.
Of course, Zachariassen isn’t denying how important angel investors are to founders — he’s even made a whole video about how to attract them on his YouTube channel, Raw Startup. 








Instead, he wants to point out the simple fact that at this stage in your startup’s journey, you’re unlikely to attract specialized investors. And because these angels aren’t professional investors, they might be more prone to pushing for making returns quickly — rather than focusing on long-term growth and pay-off. 
“The solution is just making sure you get new investors in that are more ambitious all the time. Then you can keep postponing major shifts until you get people on board who are aligned with you,” Zachariassen recommends. 
The best situation would be to get the perfect investors on board early… but you usually don’t have the luxury to decide that kind of stuff. So be open to angel investors’ input, but try to kick the can down the road until you’ve got experts on board. 
But should you then do everything bigger investors say?
The great thing about bigger venture funds is they think, uhm, bigger. Zachariassen really enjoys working with VCs like Balderton as they’ve seen multiple companies they’ve invested in become unicorns.
“They know if we do this right and keep going, this could also become a unicorn,” says Zachariassen. “But that doesn’t mean they say you should do a particular thing. A good investor doesn’t do that.”
Zachariassen actually just finished a script for his next YouTube video which goes into the six signs of bad investors, and getting too operational is definitely one of the cardinal sins. 
“Good investors will nudge and say things like ‘have you thought about this?’ And provide examples from other portfolio companies. They should never tell you what to do, but they should definitely influence your direction.”
Sounds good enough, but what happens when an investor you’ve already committed to working with puts their foot down? 
“When it comes to the later stages — or actually as early as A and B rounds — the truth is that most of these people are really fucking good,” Zachariassen emphasizes. “They’ll rarely say to you ‘I’ve seen this 100 times, you’re doing it wrong,’ but they will use that card at some point. And when they do, they’re usually right.”
But there’s an important caveat here: you shouldn’t fold as soon as you hear a partner or a fund say that. Zachariassen says you should always push back if that’s your conviction, to make it absolutely clear that the investor is indeed pulling rank. Because once you do, you know it’s serious enough to listen to.
“Founders always say the same thing, ‘yeah you’re right, but we’re different.’ You always think you’re so fucking special, but maybe you’re not. Certain things are just the same no matter what.”
So be careful of letting angel investors dictate your strategy, especially when they’re not thinking big enough. Then find smart, experienced investors to nudge you in the right direction and when they play the ‘I know better than you card’ — confirm that they are, then fucking listen.
Update: Heini Zachariassen is speaking at TNW Conference 2021 on September 30th and October 1st about the personal challenges entrepreneurs face. There he’ll be joined by 150 other amazing experts who will share their latest insights from the world of business and tech.

"Dear Venture Capitalists, you can help save the world — by investing in carbon neutral startups",Cate Lawrence,2021/09/24,"
Did you know SHIFT is taking the stage on Sept 30 and Oct 1? Together with an amazing line-up of experts, we will explore the future of mobility during TNW Conference 2021. Secure your ticket now!
Technology is evolving faster than ever before. It creates the opportunity for new products, business models, and bringing products more quickly to market. But what does it mean for industries such as mobility and energy? I spoke to Girish Nadkarni, the CEO of TotalEnergies Ventures, to find out.
TotalEnergies  Ventures focuses on finding, funding, and fostering high-potential startups that will create a low carbon future. This encompasses areas such as renewables, distributed energy, new mobility, energy access, energy storage, bio-plastics and recycling, AI, and IoT.
The challenges for B2B startups in the Venture Capital space
According to Nadkarni, success in the B2B space is markedly different from B2C.
In the B2B industrial space, it’s not just that technology takes time to develop. It’s a sector characterized by long development and sales cycles. In the B2C world, within nine to 18 you know whether or not you will be successful.
Industrial B2B startups disrupt large established companies, and traditional industries like utilities and manufacturing. They often focus on internal transformation or introducing new products to mission-critical functions and tasks. Therefore, startups need experience in the industries they aim to disrupt and support from a solid network to open doors. 
TotalEnergies Ventures focuses on later-stage investments. Nadkarni explains:
There are three risks that startups face: technology, market, and financing. So we say, ‘Okay, show us that you have customers willing to pay.’ We have a business development team, which works with our portfolio companies, and we address the barriers to success, make sure they talk to the right people.
Over the last couple of years, TotalEnergies Ventures have negotiated 25 different pilot projects and agreements and has another 55 under negotiation. According to Nadkarni:
We are making sure that we are not just a passive investor but a value-added partner.
Venture investment in companies like ChargeTrip unlocks the potential of electric mobility.
Failure and barriers to innovation
Nadkarni sees failure as part of progress for startups as it provides a learning opportunity. He notes that:
Sometimes you thought the project through only at a very superficial level, so the crucial success factors are not in place yet. Maybe the infrastructure is not there yet. Or sometimes, you’re applying an old mindset to new technology.
His favorite example is when desktop computers first came to people’s homes:
“People said, ‘Oh, now I can store my recipes conveniently.’ Well, yes, you can, but that’s not leveraging the power of the computer.”
In technology, being too early is sometimes the same thing as being wrong. Nadkarni explains:
A company called General Magic actually designed the functional equivalent of an iPad. The only problem was, they were five years too early. The processors didn’t go that fast. Touchscreen technology was not that good. The cables and the cellular connections weren’t great. So now they had everything that was sufficient, but not everything that was necessary.”
The future of venture capital is green energy 
Venture capital support accelerates carbon dioxide recycling efforts by B2B startups like Deep Branch.
Total Energies is a founding member of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, a CEO-led initiative that aims to accelerate the industry response to climate change. Nadkarni has a significant interest in hydrogen infrastructure and is leading an initiative with Air Liquide to raise a 1.5 BEUR clean hydrogen infrastructure fund. He notes:
The point of the fund is to kick start the hydrogen ecosystem and not just let’s find the best investments. We realize that there are many players just waiting in the wings for somebody to start the race. So what we want to address is the major sectors such as mobility and generation of green hydrogen. Regarding mobility, it’s about avoiding the chicken and egg problem by picking a territory at a time, and then funding the acquisition of the truck fleets and setting up all the hydrogen refueling stations at the same time.
Nadkarni assets that large companies are recognizing the need to get lower their carbon emissions:
There is pressure from regulators and reporting requirements. There’s pressure from investors. Incentives increase through governments offering subsidies. Additionally, younger consumers are becoming more aware. Even if it’s more expensive, companies like Tesco and Stella McCartney will pay more for bio-plastics. All the stakeholders are putting pressure. So there is no place to escape.

I don’t do meetings on Fridays — here’s why you shouldn’t either,Denya Beaudry,2021/09/17,"
Sometimes the smallest change can make a big difference for your mental health. For me, it’s keeping Friday completely clear of meetings.
I’m a manager at Zapier. I work on the success team, which means I need to have time to take care of my customers and my direct reports, all while getting through all the other work I need to do.
It’s… a lot.
And I’m not alone. I’ve talked with other managers here, and they feel the same way. It’s easy for scheduled meetings and calls to multiply until they take up every moment, and at that point, necessary work is going to fall through the cracks.
There are many solutions for this, but what’s working for me right now is to block out one day of the week on my calendar to be fully free of meetings. That day is Friday — here’s why, and how it’s working out for me.
Why Friday?
My work tends to build up and snowball throughout the week. You know how it is: you plan on working on something, then something else comes up. That happens to me several times a week, meaning there are all kinds of things on my to-do list I never quite get to.
That’s why meeting-free Friday is so great. First of all: I look forward to this day all week. It’s like a reward for getting through all of my calls.
But meeting-free Friday also gives me a chance to catch up on everything I dropped throughout the week. I’ve been trying this for a while, and I have to tell you: I’m much more productive on Fridays now. I consistently clear my to-do list.
That, in turn, makes my weekends better. I got everything done, so there’s no list in my head of things I’ll need to do Monday morning. This is a big part of the mental health benefit — my downtime is more relaxing now.
Like I said: it’s a small thing, but the benefits are huge.
How to set up your own meeting-free day
If you want to try something similar, don’t overthink it. Block out one day a week during which you won’t have any meetings, then stick to it. Let your coworkers know you’re doing everything possible to avoid meetings on that day.
If you work at a company that uses shared calendars, mark yourself busy on your meeting-free day. Here’s how that looks on my calendar:
Credit: ZapierYou could even use Google Calendar’s out-of-office feature to automatically reject meeting requests on that day, but that’s an extreme measure.
I fully endorse having a meeting-free day on your calendars — it’s a 10/10 strategy. I don’t know if I can ever go back.

The problem with looking happy at work,Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten,2021/09/16,"
Boris is the wise ol’ founder of TNW who writes a weekly column on everything about being an entrepreneur in tech — from managing stress to embracing awkwardness. You can get his musings straight to your inbox by signing up for his newsletter!
There’s a Seinfeld episode where George explains how he ‘works’ without actually doing anything. When Elaine and Jerry ask him how he gets away with doing nothing, he shares his simple trick: look serious and annoyed, and people will assume you’re busy.
We then see a few scenes of George looking angry, shaking his head, and mumbling as he paces around the office, while his coworkers treat his dedication with great reverence.
Not a bad tactic, George, although I completely disagree with it.

I recently met up with a friend over drinks and vented about a stressful project I was dealing with. I was slightly more open about my feelings than usual and at one point he remarked: “Wow, you always look and act so happy that I never realized you would feel stressed too.”
I was surprised for a moment and also oddly proud that I could hide my feelings well, but also aware of the cons of this tendency. There have been moments in the past where I’ve literally had to tell people, “don’t mistake my kindness for weakness.”
I’m a friendly fellow, which sometimes gives people the false impression that it means I’m also gullible or easy to take advantage of. So I guess it’s time I’ll have to add another warning to my collection, “just because I’m smiling doesn’t mean I’m not serious.”
I wish I wouldn’t have to do that, but it seems George was right about how people perceive ‘doing business.’
For me though, I’ve always believed in doing it with a smile, in being optimistic, and in acting friendly. The upsides of that are probably obvious, but the downsides are that we do think people have to look annoyed or brooding to be serious and think deeply about important things… while people who smile a lot must be a bit dumb.
I think that’s why it can seem attractive to some people to act more concerned or say they’re stressed about certain projects as it’s the only way we know how to interpret importance. And it’s understandable, as you’re not really allowed to deviate from that path.
If someone asks you how you’re doing and you say ‘great!’ with a smile, they might think you’re crazy. Haven’t you read the news? The world is going to shit! So why aren’t we all depressed?
Maybe that’s a fair question. In the face of doom, in the middle of a crisis, and with an uncertain future, it would be easy to lose your faith and stay optimistic. But there are people, more than you think, who are naturally optimistic and perk up when a challenge is presented.
They’ll smile comfortingly when you cry. They puff their chests up and laugh in the face of evil. They might go down in flames along with everyone else, but they’ll do it proudly and optimistically — and I feel that’s completely fine.
You shouldn’t need to act like George Costanza to be taken seriously at your job. You can be serious and dedicated while smiling and be quick to laugh. You don’t need to fake unhappiness to show you care about important issues — you should just be yourself.

What Spotify’s mess (and its clean up) can teach startups about long-term brand thinking,Claire Huxley,2021/09/14,"
Did you know Growth Quarters is taking the stage this fall? Together with an amazing line-up of experts, we will share key insights into entrepreneurship during TNW Conference 2021. Secure your ticket now!
Former Spotify boss Jim Andersen caused a stir earlier this year when comments surfaced that reignited the debate about the streaming platform’s motivations.
In his words: “Spotify was created to solve a problem. The problem was to overcome piracy and get artists’ music out there. The problem was not to pay people money.”
Unsurprisingly, this wasn’t well-received. The feedback was swift and sharp, with commentators across the board slamming Spotify’s attitude as harmful to artists and the music industry at large.
And yet, was this backlash fully deserved? A glance at Spotify’s website suggests that its current leadership are singing a very different tune to their former colleague. 
The company’s mission in 2021 is “to unlock the potential of human creativity.” This is accompanied by a list of commitments that Spotify is making, such as equipping artists with the data and training to maximize their streams and earnings on Spotify. In other words, to get artists’ music out there, and to pay them money.
So what’s at play here? Is Andersen a cynic, or is Spotify trying to tape over reality? I’d argue the answer lies somewhere in between. Let’s take a look how Spotify’s ‘mess’ and its solution serves as a useful blueprint for any startup on the road to scaling into a long-term, much-loved brand.
Laying a roadmap
From easily ordering take-out to seamlessly splitting bills, many of the apps we use every day were created with a singular “solve” in mind. And often, this singular fixation is a core factor in success. 
But, as any seasoned founder knows, for every problem solved, another 99 can pop up in its place. And without a clear overarching vision for how to respond, growth can quickly be derailed.
Take Uber. For years its team was driven by a singular cause: build an app that makes hailing cabs easier. What they didn’t anticipate, was that realizing this goal would trigger up a new series of challenges. 
Regulatory restrictions, passenger safety, drivers’ rights, disenchanted employees; suddenly, a simple “solve” didn’t seem so simple. And without a clearly defined brand strategy to help focus and communicate their efforts, Uber found itself at risk of grinding to a halt.
Uber’s challenges represent those faced by many startups when they pursue product development without engaging in long-term brand thinking. Defining a brand is about much more than choosing a logo; it’s about establishing clear and coherent principles that direct everything a business does, today and tomorrow.
Shift perceptions
What Spotify has done right is adapt its approach — moving beyond the simplistic technological approach so awkwardly put by its former chief.
 When Spotify speaks about “unlocking the potential of human creativity,” they aren’t trying to distract people from the streaming solution they once were. Rather, they’re setting their sights on everything they want to be tomorrow.
By broadening its focus to creativity and putting an emotional need at the heart of its mission, Spotify has a more widely applicable and emotionally appealing organizing principle than a pure technical solve. The brand can position itself as engaging with users and artists in a way that a functional piracy-fighting platform would struggle to do. 
Engagements like the Year Unwrapped round up – in which Spotify puts users at the heart of their own story by celebrating their listening habits – and the Loud And Clear resource for artists are an example of putting this emotional promise into action. 
Not only do initiatives like this help win brand loyalty by humanizing Spotify beyond a functional faceless tech platform, they also differentiate the brand from other competitors: anyone can create a new streaming platform, few can replicate strong brand love.  
Spark innovation
By defining their brand in terms of unlocking creativity, Spotify gives themselves a license to play far beyond the confines of a specific product, platform – or even industry. To quote CEO Daniel Ek’s response when he was asked about the competitors that concern him: 
I am looking at Fortnite, or Minecraft, or Roblox. All forms of media and entertainment is minutes that could have been spent listening to audio instead.
The inference is clear: to Spotify, “creativity” doesn’t stop at streaming songs – it encompasses all forms of self-expression. And viewed through this lens, the businesses’ potential for innovation is enormous. Whether by offering artist-controlled tiers of access, experimenting with forms of visual media, or even dipping a toe into NFTs, the opportunities go far beyond music.
Spotify’s past might have been to solve a single issue, but thanks to a bit of long-term brand thinking, its future is multi-faceted.

Forget ‘networking’ — just connect with people you find interesting,Justin Pot,2021/09/13,"
Did you know Growth Quarters is taking the stage this fall? Together with an amazing line-up of experts, we will share key insights into entrepreneurship during TNW Conference 2021. Secure your ticket now!
The idea of networking makes me cringe. Here’s the thing, though: I actually love connecting with people, and that enthusiasm works out for me professionally. I was referred to my job at Zapier because of a friend I made on Twitter, and the job before this was the same way. That’s networking.
Now, I didn’t reach out because I wanted a job. I reached out because I thought the people in question were interesting and doing admirable work. I wanted to talk with them…so I did. Connecting with people on those terms doesn’t feel cringey to me because it isn’t. It’s human.
People are more important than your career, but that doesn’t mean your career doesn’t matter. So if you struggle with networking, don’t make connections — make friends. Actual, human friends.
How to connect with people online without being a creep
I’m a writer. My background is in technology journalism, mostly on the service journalism side, and Twitter is the main place I connect with other writers. I follow writers I admire, occasionally respond to their messages, and become close with them over time. We help each other find work. If someone’s in town, we’ll hang out. It’s nice.
Connecting with people improves your life, but it’s hard, especially online. If you don’t know how to start, you might think that you’re being a huge creep. You’re not. I’ve written about how to small talk while working remotely, and the general principles are the same on just about any social network. Here are a few tips:

Compliment people’s work. Very few people take the time to reach out when they like one of my articles, and the people who do make my day. I bet it’s the same in most industries. If you admire what someone does, tell them. It’s not weird — it’s the best. Just don’t be transactional about it.
Don’t compliment people’s appearance. In the immortal words of the best account on Twitter: THIS ? IS ? NOT ? A ? DATING ? SITE ?. Seriously, though — compliment people on the things they do and create, not their physical attributes. The first thing is kind; the second is bordering on illegal. This is not particularly complicated.
Respond to questions. People post questions on social networks because they want to start a conversation. Take that opening, say something insightful, and follow up if the conversation starts flowing.
Don’t insert yourself into conversations. Sometimes a stranger will follow me on Twitter and immediately join a conversation between me and one of my friends (who they also don’t know). This is uncomfortable — don’t do it. Get to know one person, or ideally both people, before inserting yourself into conversations.
Be funny. Humor is the single greatest tool for connecting with others. If you spot an opportunity to be funny and think the person would enjoy it based on what you’ve learned about them, go for it.
But don’t force humor. If you don’t know someone’s vibe, you don’t know what they find funny. Lurk for a while, then respond when you have a feel for their sense of humor.
Bring up interesting information. Knowledge is cool, links to read are great, and sharing it makes the internet a better place. If someone shares something interesting, share something similar you think they’ll like. That way there’s more interesting stuff, which is great.
Don’t argue with people you barely know. Rule: if you have the urge to begin a message with “Well, actually,” consider instead throwing your phone into a volcano. You might love arguing…that’s great. Not everyone does, and the internet is exhausting enough. Don’t try to connect with someone by telling them they’re wrong — it doesn’t work.

In summary: try to be a good hang.
If you add to the conversation, and make using the internet better, people will like having you around online. If you make life worse, they won’t. Over time, you’ll find yourself in online friendships, which are actually just friendships.
Connect with people, then connect them to each other
I’m an immigrant — at least, I’m an immigrant if you consider Canadians who move to the United States immigrants. At one point, a fellow immigrant — this one from Russia — asked me how one goes about getting jobs in America. Specifically, jobs in tech.
I had no idea how to answer that question. First of all, while I work in tech, I hardly took a traditional path. I went from journalism to IT to tutorial writing to somehow writing about my feelings and calling it content marketing. I couldn’t help anyone recreate my career trajectory if I wanted to.
So I said what I’d say to anyone: connect with people. Go to meetups. Hang out with people online. Don’t do this with the expectation of getting a job; do this because talking to people is great, and talking to people interested in the same things as you is even better.
Then, when you need help, ask. I sincerely enjoy connecting friends who are looking for jobs with friends who are trying to hire. I promise your friends will feel the same way. This isn’t why you should connect with people — that’s a terrible way to live. But your career, and everything else about your life, will be better if you connect with people, online or off.

Play to your strengths and DON’T forget them,Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten,2021/09/9,"
Boris is the wise ol’ founder of TNW who writes a weekly column on everything about being an entrepreneur in tech — from managing stress to embracing awkwardness. You can get his musings straight to your inbox by signing up for his newsletter!
Wow, this has been an exciting week! On Monday, I announced I would transition into a new role at TNW and introduced our new CEO. You can read all about it in the official announcement here.
Of course, I didn’t come to this decision overnight. I’ve been TNW’s CEO for 15 years and thought about this meticulously before acting on it. Big decisions mean spending ‘big’ time pondering them.
But what I didn’t expect was how much time I’d need to just decide how to break the news.
Myrthe (TNW’s amazing new CEO and former COO) and I had so many discussions on if, how, and when would be a perfect moment to make this announcement.
In the end, we got to a decent draft announcing the change… but it stayed a draft for quite a while.
There were just so many things we had to organize in terms of workflow, internal organization, et cetera, et cetera, that the announcement kept getting deprioritized. I mean, surely a simple announcement can’t be that important?
Then, last week, it was finally time. Everything was in place and now we only had to push out the announcement post. But as I read it, something didn’t feel right.

Then it dawned on me. I’d been trying so hard to write a ‘standard press release’ and doing things like you’re ‘supposed to do’ that I’d failed to use TNW’s greatest strength.
For the last 15 years, one of the things we’ve always tried to do is NOT using the standard format for anything.
When we first started organizing events, we didn’t look at other events. We just organized a conference that we thought was interesting, and we ignored all the rules and what was generally accepted common practice. And I, who’s been CEO that whole time, forgot!
So when I realized this, I stopped laboring over a ‘press release’ and switched to writing a story — just as if it was this newsletter. That resulted in the fun little article you can now read on TNW.
Before we published it though, we also realized we didn’t have a good photo of me and Myrthe together.
So we checked our calendars to find a moment to get a photographer in for an official portrait and… starting to sound a bit like how things are ‘meant to be done,’ right?
Luckily, it didn’t work out. So we had to improvise.
I suggested taking a photo that looked like it was made in a photo booth at the train station. The advantage, I thought, would be that the images wouldn’t have to be high quality in themselves and could even be slightly blurry and black and white.
And since those photos always come in fours, we wouldn’t have to worry about finding the ‘perfect’ shot — we’d just combine four funny photos into one.
I found a room with a curtain, and then we asked the first person who walked by to take photos on my iPhone. All-in-all, the photoshoot took about 15 minutes, and we had a lot of fun thinking of different combinations; and had a nice symbolic last photo with Myrthe pushing me out of the picture.
I guess this announcement was one of the final ‘important things’ I did as a CEO, and it felt terrific to do it the TNW way. It also shows that you can achieve a lot with some creativity, defiance of the rules, and enthusiasm. And that you need to keep reminding yourself of it.
That’s certainly how I look back on the past 15 years as CEO of TNW.

P.S. Don’t worry about the title change, I’ll still write my newsletter! So until next week!

Whenever I discuss my startup with someone, I get asked how I am going to “scale” my business. My usual response is that I am happy with its current size and don’t plan on expanding. The looks I get after this exchange make it seem like I’ve either badmouthed a universally loved celebrity or confessed to a horrible crime. 
Let me give you some background; I run an affiliate marketing business with my husband. We have four employees. We promote online coupons of different e-commerce sites on search engines and receive a commission every time a customer redeems it. 
It’s a small gig. It’s relatively simple. And it’s been this way for nearly five years now. Perhaps it’s the last bit that annoys a lot of my peers the most. 
Five years is a long time for a startup. I should be looking to expand, go public like some of my competitors, or even more ambitiously — eyeing the cover of the Forbes magazine. 
But I want none of these things and I will tell you why.
I like my tiny company
Business owners are obsessed with growth. But not a gradual growth that companies usually experience. They want to SCALE FAST. This sentiment has given birth to an army of influencers with each one promising to have a secret scaling formula through their clickbait articles. 
But is it necessary to relentlessly pursue growth? I would argue otherwise. Now, I will not go all philosophical or give you a lecture on minimalism. Instead, I will make a simple argument:
Organizations become much more complex as they scale. Ultimately, you would have to hire more employees, work with freelancers, and partner with other businesses. Some of this would require you to give up personal control. 
As someone who has worked in major corporations and dealt with ridiculously complex hierarchies, I would never want my company to transform into something similar. More importantly, I don’t want a “Chief Identity Consultant” walking around my office without knowing what their job is and why I hired this person in the first place. 
The little workforce I have performs exceptionally well. I know what each employee brings to the table. This isn’t remotely possible with a big workforce. 
I get to help out other businesses
Most entrepreneurs want to be a force for good. We hope to bring about a positive change through our ventures even though the scale of this change might be different. 
Admittedly, I am not one of those geniuses that are revolutionizing medicine or creating sustainable energy solutions. But my business model allows me to do something for the community.
As I explained before, I do work in the e-commerce space but don’t sell anything of my own. Instead, my website promotes coupons and promo codes of different online stores. It’s a form of affiliate marketing that has gained significant traction in recent years. 
With the current status of my business, I can promote small businesses, particularly those run by women and minorities. We can prioritize these companies and even be lax when it comes to commissions.
Scaling would require us to put money at the forefront and work with industry leaders. In other words, it would suck the soul out of my business. 
I get to better rather than bigger
Whenever I explain my nefarious plan of not scaling, one question is constantly thrown my way; “How do you stay motivated?” The answer is simple; I am striving to make my company better and not bigger. There is a difference between the two. 
Bigger businesses don’t necessarily provide the best of services. They’re just able to reach more people and able to serve a larger clientele. 
What I hope to create is a business that is efficient, innovative, and above all, able to manufacture impactful solutions. These solutions might not reach everyone but that’s beside the point. Getting this right will reflect well on the bottom line as it has for me in the last five years. 
If my business grows as a by-product of this then I wouldn’t go out of my way to stop that. However, growth is and will never be the ultimate objective for me.
I make enough money
I know what you’d be thinking; “enough money? ENOUGH MONEY?”THERE’S NO SUCH THING. You’re either in it to kick Jeff Bezos off the top or you can pack your stuff and go home.”
Once again, I would like to provide a different perspective. Money is a great thing. It’s the primary reason we do this business. It pays the bill and lets us buy cereals for our kids. 
However, there’s a point at which money becomes an obsession. You start valuing your work through a number and not before long, it’s all about increasing this number at the cost of your health and personal well-being. 
My husband and I have a specific income target for each month. Other than the office rent, employee salaries, and our personal expenses, the amount needs to be enough for us to save for the future and take a nice trip to Tahiti every once in a while. There’s no point in working our backsides off for more. 
But hey, that’s just my opinion
I will leave this little disclaimer at the end; this is just my opinion. Different entrepreneurs have different motivations. If you’re someone that’s looking to scale then that’s completely fine. I don’t look down on you and wish you nothing but the best. 
What I wish to explain is that business owners who choose to stay small are neither lazy nor uninspired. They are simply motivated by things other than growth. 
Businesses CAN choose to stay small and there’s nothing wrong with that. So if you’re happy running a small gig; find comfort in knowing that there’s more of us out there. 
"
Your startup must begin climate action TODAY — here’s how,Már Másson Maack,2021/09/7,"
We all know mitigating the climate crisis is important… but it’s still weirdly easy to push any action to ‘tomorrow’ — especially if you’re a founder stuck in the daily chores of keeping a startup running. 
But you and I both know you need the push to act today. Not only to save the planet (this big round thing we live on), but also to make sure your business will survive.
That’s why I spoke to Tom Raftery, SAP’s Global Vice President and its Futurist & Innovation Evangelist, who’s made it his mission to inspire organizations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions before it’s too late. 
Raftery has suggestions for what you can do right this second, next few weeks, and before the end of this year. But first, let’s get into why exactly you’ve got to get started on your startup’s climate action — even if you’re fully digital. 
Bunch of laws are coming, stay ahead of them
Raftery, who’s speaking at the upcoming TNW Conference 2021, is well aware of the financial pressures startups and bigger organizations face when it comes to decision-making. But if you apply logical thinking, you’ll see the cost of emissions is way higher than the money you may save in the short term.
First up, legal troubles. Raftery says a whole host of climate legislation is coming worldwide and points specifically to the EU’s goal to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030. 
“I know 2030 sounds like a long way away, but it’s only about eight years. It’s as far away as 2013 is now,” Raftery warns and predicts the actual pressure will be felt much sooner.

“We’re going to get to 2025 when politicians around the EU will realize ‘uh oh, we’ve only got four or five years left and we’re nowhere near where we need to be.’ So there’s going to be a scramble.”
Bigger companies will have to start officially reporting on their sustainability in 2024, but Raftery believes it’s good for startups to begin preparing. Of course, the carbon footprint of individual startups is minuscule compared to larger corporations, but collectively startups make up almost 80% of the economy, making them a prime target for government climate policies.
So sooner or later, every single business will have to have rigorous reporting on its carbon footprint — no matter the field they’re in.
Oh, and it’ll also help with recruiting
“Startups don’t only need to act because there’s more of them, they also need to take action for recruitment and retention of employees,” says Raftery. 
As any good (and maybe even bad?) business leader knows, it costs a lot to find, hire, and train a new employee. So if they leave within a year, you’re looking at a lot of sunk cost. But what exactly does this have to do with climate action?
“Having a good climate and sustainability story to tell makes people proud to work for you. And therefore, that helps with your recruitment and retention. It also helps attract customers,” says Raftery.
And by “having a story,” Raftery doesn’t mean you can just have your marketing department churn out some greenwashing phrases. No, a climate story is about being able to point out the specific actions you take and how it relates to your company’s mission.
So let’s get into what exactly you can do to create your authentic climate story.
Credit: Climate 21Tom Raftery publishes the ‘Climate 21’ podcast where he interviews climate change experts, executives from companies rolling out the best climate initiatives, and other stakeholders in the space to educate and inspire everyone to action.
Right this second: Contact your energy provider
“Switch to an energy provider that gives you 100% renewable energy,” says Raftery. “Changing your electricity to clean energy gets rid of a huge amount of emissions instantaneously. It really is the low-hanging fruit of climate action.”
It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes to find the most climate-friendly energy provider, but it’ll pay off for years to come as it’ll make the rest of your journey that much easier. 
How? Well, once you’ve made your utilities are powered by clean energy, you should work towards electrifying all your energy consumption — whether it’s removing the gas stove in the office kitchen or updating your car fleet with EVs. This will make all future climate reporting easier as you’ll have a single central point of measurement.
Next few weeks: Change who’s responsible for your climate action
Raftery says reporting will only become more rigorous from now on, so it’ll affect companies’ bottom line even more. “This is why it needs to fall under the CFO’s organization.” 
A company’s climate action will soon be reported the same way as financials are — through yearly or even quarterly ESG reports — so it’s only logical to make it the responsibility of your CFO. 
The sooner you make the mental shift internally that climate action and sustainability do belong with the CFO, the better your chances become to grow. 
“The investment community will be monitoring this,” explains Raftery. “People whose ESG reporting is deemed to be good will have easier and cheaper access to capital. Poor ESG reporting will be seen as a more risky investment proposition. So the cost of capital for them will be significantly higher — if they can get it at all — and that will also obviously impact their share price.”
Before the end of this year: Start reporting diligently 
Once you’ve made it clear that climate action and sustainability reporting are the responsibilities of your CFO, it’s time to start producing actual ESG reports… or at least lay the groundwork if your team is small.
“For example, for any RFPs [request for propals] going out, mention that you want the emissions associated with those products and services included in the response. That will start putting people on notice,” says Raftery, who encourages businesses to work with their suppliers to make this shift.
He also adds that if you’re a startup servicing bigger corporations, you’ll have to be especially quick to adjust. It doesn’t matter if your startup isn’t big enough to fall under the EU’s reporting mandate, as your clients will ask for detailed emission reporting for their own ESG reports.
Use your agility to save the planet and flourish
The most immediate pressure for climate action and reporting will be on bigger corporations, but it never hurts to be prepared. It can take a couple of years for cumbersome corporates to redefine their processes and priorities, but you can avoid all that hassle by setting a climate-friendly agenda from day one. 
The next time you think “I’d love to work on my startup’s climate action, I just don’t have the time,” remind yourself that the hammer of the law is coming down just a couple of years from now and your clients and employees care about the planet. So you might want to make it your priority.

Get a bigger exit: Build your executive team’s personal brand,Randy Baker,2021/08/30,"
Did you know Growth Quarters is taking the stage this fall? Together with an amazing line-up of experts, we will share key insights into entrepreneurship during TNW Conference 2021. Secure your ticket now!
It’s pretty likely you’re able to pull up an anecdote about the life of a top entrepreneur without much effort. From Bill Gates’ divorce proceedings to Elon Musk’s opinion on crypto and Richard Branson’s love for kitesurfing, there’s no doubt that high-level executives are now expected to be public figures.
More than ever, it’s people – not companies – moving the world of business forward. 
There is a reason why a February 2021 Harris Poll indicates that 85% of Americans believe that CEO reputation significantly impacts the perception and valuation of a company. Teams aren’t merely the people behind the face of the product anymore; they become the faces themselves.
We all like to be liked; it makes us feel good… but apart from that, it’s extremely good for business. In fact, VCs deem the founding management team to be even more important than a startup’s business model, according to HBR. 
The average value of an exit is $242.9 million.
Let me show you how to utilize executive branding to achieve this and possibly much more.
Mine reputational capital
Working with founders every day, it still dumbfounds me that leveraging the reputational capital of the executive team remains a highly underutilized technique for a better exit. 
Whether you like it or not, there’s immense value in letting customers, investors, stakeholders, and even current and future employees peek behind the curtain and learn about the personalities representing the company.
After all, following the year of uncertainty that fully tested leadership, people have become far more sensitive to what company executives stand for. 
Remember when a decade ago, the ultimate flex was having your brand name printed on a t-shirt? Today, that’s nowhere near as important as actually having that t-shirt made from sustainable materials. 
In our interconnected society, everyone can form an opinion of what the world should look like and what the role of their companies is in that process. Branded products are great to boost team spirit, but won’t get you very far in terms of your sales goals. 
Consumers are highly aware of the power of their dollar and won’t think twice about opting for a competitor with ethics or values that better connect with theirs.
Half of investors already use digital platforms to learn what CEOs are saying. But it’s not enough to stop there. If your team has a CFO, COO, and CMO, they should all invest in building up their personal authority platforms. 
A team that not only works but also lives your mission and vision lifts the visibility of your company and makes you more attractive to potential investors. 
Only you know how to be you
Here, let me borrow the words of Tom Peters, a prominent business management author: 
To be in business today, our most important job is to be head marketers for the brand called You.
So, remember that your personal reputation is equally as important as your products.
Startups are hectic, yes. You are probably too busy trying to hit that next milestone – before you run out of cash – to dedicate the slightest bit of energy to what the “world” out there thinks of you. But trust me on this — if there’s anything you shouldn’t outsource, it’s your personal brand.
There is no such thing as business-to-business. Have you ever seen a “business” buy anything? No, it’s always person-to-person. There is someone that makes the decision to sell and someone that makes the decision to buy. 
Executive branding is all about creating motivational levers that drive people towards becoming a customer, and it’s something that needs to come from you.
There are a few simple strategies that won’t have you work your fingers to the bone. Podcasts, for example, are extremely powerful. 
In just an hour, you can create a bank of valuable content that can then be spread across multiple channels and is directed towards a specific outcome or behavior you want your listeners to take.
If your team makes an effort to represent itself consistently, it’s best equipped to build long-term trust in its abilities and decisions.
Avoid avoiding yourself
In executive branding, there’s only one rule: be yourself. 
You can’t show up in your crisp suit anymore, so don’t waste time on the polish. Statistically, CEOs who display authentic qualities are outranking those who do not.
When crafting your narrative, avoid the temptation to share professional updates only. Showing off by only recognizing your successes will not score you many points – it’s the matrix of your actions, values, skills, experience, all sprinkled with personality, that works best. 
Whether it’s jokes or puppy videos, there’s a space for everything. People want to know what you did on the weekend, how you feel about the latest Reddit chain, and what your struggles are.
Also, realize that your executive story didn’t begin when you started the company – it was long before that. 
What strange things happened to you? Did you spend a summer juggling your way through Europe? Have you had a near-death experience? What was weird about your great-grandparents? Never avoid your back story – embrace it and own it.
The likes of Richard Branson and James Altucher do this incredibly well, but for inspiration, don’t shy away from exploring platforms like TikTok (yes, seriously). 
The young and rising influencers of today are building their followings through two-sided community engagement. Bold, edgy, and fun bits connect them with micro-communities, one after another. Not that you should become an influencer – just think of Elon Musk’s doge memes.

You might ask if there are any limits to being yourself. My simple response is that there aren’t — though brace yourself for backlash. 
Still, it’s always a push-and-pull situation. Not everybody is going to like you, so push away those that won’t and bring closer those that want to hear what you have to say. 
Gary Vaynerchuk is the perfect example: he built up his audience through brutally honest advice and occasional swear words – and his fans love him for that.
Find your process
Speaking of Gary, he is huge on his personal brand: 
Your reputation online, and in the new business world is pretty much the game, so you’ve got to be a good person. You can’t hide anything, and more importantly, you’ve got to be out there at some level.
And where else to cultivate that brand than on socials? Today, 82% of consumers are more likely to trust a company whose CEO and leadership team engages on social media, so that’s another big reason to put yourself out there.
 Yet, these platforms are full of rabbit holes that can lead nowhere. One of the easiest ways to get started is to make informed comments on interesting or trending posts.
When posting, get out of the fog and tell the real story. Apart from overly promotional contributions, forget about low-quality, spammy content. 
An emoji-vote LinkedIn poll about a preferred work modality was cool at the beginning of the pandemic, but everyone’s fed up with it now. Instead, find a steady pace that allows you to share content of value.
You don’t need to be a wordsmith, but writing articles or even a short book can bring you a lot of traction. A process that only takes a couple of weeks can give you enough information for months in terms of content bits. 
Promoting the cover page as you work through the piece is a great way to get the conversation going. Then, especially if printed, books build authority and trust like no other medium – and they don’t need to end up in Harvard Law School library.
The beauty of personal branding is that there’s no one recipe to get it right. If you aren’t exactly one to start a new Reels trend, it’s fine. Just find your process and keep it up.

"State of the internet July ’21: Audiences swell, but advertisers are anxious",Simon Kemp,2021/07/21,"
Despite the rapid increases in digital adoption and use that we’ve seen since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic more than a year ago, the latest update in the Global Digital Reports series reveals that digital growth rates remain elevated as we move into the second half of 2021.
DataReportal‘s Digital 2021 July Global Statshot Report – published in partnership with Hootsuite and We Are Social – shows that social media continues to drive connected activity around the world, with global social media user numbers fast approaching another impressive milestone.
This quarter’s data reveals some potential challenges ahead for marketers though, with the impact of changes in Apple’s privacy policies and the rollout of the EU’s ePrivacy Directive starting to appear in some of our numbers.
You’ll find a handy summary of this quarter’s top stories in the video embed below (you can also click here), but read on below for the full report, and for my in-depth analysis of the latest essential trends.

Just before we dive into the data, I’d like to say a big thank you to the partners who make our Global Digital Reports possible: GWI, Statista, Semrush, Skai (formerly Kenshoo), SimilarWeb, Locowise, and App Annie.
Full report
You’ll find the complete Digital 2021 July Global Statshot Report report in the SlideShare embed below (you can also click here), but read on past that to understand what all these numbers might mean for you.
﻿﻿﻿
Essential headlines
Let’s start with the key figures for digital adoption around the world in July 2021:

Global mobile users have reached 5.27 billion, equating to just under 67% of the world’s total population.
The number of mobile users has grown by 2.3% over the past year, increasing by 117 million in 12 months – that’s almost 10 million new users per month.
Internet users have increased by more than a quarter of a billion since this time last year, registering year-on-year growth of close to 6%.
There are 4.80 billion internet users around the world today, equating to almost 61% of the world’s total population.
Social media user numbers have jumped by more than 13% since this time last year, with the latest data showing an increase of more than half a billion users in just 12 months.
There are now 4.48 billion social media users around the world, which is equal to almost 57% of the world’s total population.


Social media growth continues
Despite COVID-19 restrictions easing in some parts of the world over recent months, the pace of growth in social media users shows few signs of slowing.
The global unique user total grew by 520 million over the past year, representing annual growth of more than 13%.

For context, that means that more than 1 in 9 of today’s social media users started using social platforms for the first time within the past 12 months.
Furthermore, today’s user total is 147 million higher than it was just 3 months ago, equating to quarter-on-quarter growth of nearly 3.5%.
This is one of the fastest quarterly growth rates that we’ve reported in the Global Digital Reports series, but it’s important to stress that the latest figures have benefited from a meaningful upward correction in Facebook’s ‘family active people’ numbers.
As the company noted in its 2021 Q1 earnings announcement, 
“In the first quarter of 2021, we updated our metrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately 70 million [users] to our reported worldwide [total].”
However, while this correction may have inflated the latest quarterly growth rates, Facebook appears to update its models and metrics on a regular basis, so the 13% annual growth rate that we’re reporting this quarter should still be representative of actual year-on-year trends.

At an individual platform level, Facebook is pushing ever closer to the 3 billion monthly active user milestone, with current trends suggesting that it may reach this level by early next year.
However, the company’s investor reports indicate that roughly 3.5 billion people already use at least one of Facebook’s ‘family’ of platforms – Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger.
There were no updates to user numbers from YouTube, WhatsApp, or Messenger this quarter, but the latest data from Instagram suggests the platform has enjoyed significant growth over recent months – a story that we’ll explore in more detail below.
TikTok is still keeping its latest user numbers close to its chest too, so we’re unable to report any ‘official’ updates to its monthly active user figure this quarter.
However, data from Sensor Tower indicates that the TikTok mobile app was downloaded roughly 57 million times in June 2021 alone, so there’s a good chance that the platform’s active user base continues to grow (note that we’ve removed figures for China from Sensor Tower’s total, because we treat Douyin as a separate app).

Reporting of internet user growth continues to lag
Despite the latest data showing that internet user numbers have increased by more than a quarter of a billion over the past year, it’s clear that internet user data continues to be impacted by research limitations caused by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
In particular, many countries in the developing world haven’t published updates to internet user numbers since the outbreak of COVID-19 more than a year ago, and these are the countries where we’d expect to see the most significant increases.
As a result, we continue to anticipate a meaningful upward correction in internet user numbers once research and reporting can return to normal.

Internet time decreases
The average amount of time that people spend using the internet each day dipped slightly in the past 3 months, compared with the values we reported in our Digital 2021 April Global Statshot Report.
Data from GWI shows that average daily internet use dropped by almost a minute per day, with people spending roughly 30 seconds less online on computers, and 30 seconds less online on mobile devices.
People are still spending close to 7 hours per day using the internet though – more than twice the amount of time that they spend watching television.
However, it’s worth noting that people have been spending more time watching television in recent months.
The ‘typical’ internet user around the world says that they watched an average of 3 additional minutes of TV per day compared to the previous quarter, which equates to more than 5 additional hours of television content over the past three months.

Meanwhile, despite the drop in overall internet time, people say that they’ve been spending more time using social media.
GWI’s most recent survey found that people spent roughly 2 minutes longer on social platforms each day over the past 3 months, compared to values for the previous quarter.
Interestingly, GWI also found that people have been spending more time with ‘conventional’ media in recent months. 
Survey respondents’ self-reported values for time spent reading physical newspapers and magazines increased by 8.5% over the past three months, equating to an additional 4 minutes per day – faster than the increase we’ve seen for online press consumption.
Similarly, the amount of time that people say they spend listening to broadcast radio has increased by 3.5% over the past 90 days, equating to an increase of 2 minutes per day.
An increase of just a few minutes per day might not sound like a lot, but added up, these increases mean that the typical global internet user spent an additional 6 hours consuming print media over the past quarter, and an extra 3 hours listening to broadcast radio.
Social media dominates the world’s online activities
New data from GWI reveals that more than 95% of the world’s working-age internet users now use social networks and messaging services each month.
Interestingly, this data suggests that the use of social networking platforms like Facebook outranks the use of messaging services like WhatsApp, albeit only by a tiny margin.

More than 5 in 6 internet users between the ages of 16 and 64 also visit search engines and web portals each month, but this figure is more than 10 percentage points lower than the figure for social networks.
Meanwhile, roughly 6 in 10 internet users say they’ve visited some kind of online shopping platform in the past month, and more than 50% of internet users say that they shop or browse for products online every week.
Instagram reach soars, but points to potential trouble ahead
Recent months have seen some interesting changes in the numbers that Facebook’s tools report for Instagram’s advertising reach.
Overall, these tools show that Instagram’s advertising reach has jumped by 100 million users over the past 90 days, representing quarter-on-quarter growth of more than 7.5%.

However, this growth rate is all the more impressive when we look at changes in reach figures for countries in the European Union.
For context, changes in EU legislation – including the roll-out of the ePrivacy Directive – are already starting to impact companies’ ability to target and track audiences across the EU and the UK.
As a support article in Facebook’s Business Help Centre states,
“[We]… anticipate an impact on campaigns active in the European Region. Businesses that advertise to people in the European Region might experience decreased performance… We expect that the impact will unfold gradually, over the course of several months, as additional product updates are released.”
It’s worth noting that these changes will affect all advertising platforms that are active in the EU – not just those owned by Facebook.
But despite Facebook’s expectation that the impact of these changes will “unfold gradually”, it seems they may have already started to affect Instagram’s advertising reach numbers.
Compared to the figures that the company’s self-service tools reported just 3 months ago, Instagram’s advertising reach has dropped by a whopping 5 million users (14.7%) in the United Kingdom, and by 3 million users in Italy, Germany, and Spain.

Overall, Facebook’s data suggest that advertisers can now target 25 million fewer users across Europe than they could as recently as April of this year.
However, these drops only seem to have affected countries in the EU and the UK.
It’s also critical to stress that these figures likely only affect the degree to which advertisers can target ads to users in Europe, and they most likely do not represent a drop in actual users. 
Indeed, given the rapid growth in Instagram’s reach across all other markets over the past three months, there’s every chance that Instagram has grown its active user base in Europe since April.
Moreover, the company’s latest numbers show no evidence of a drop in Facebook’s advertising reach across the region, which may provide some level of reassurance for investors.

But it’s not just marketers in Europe who face mounting challenges.
In a separate advisory within Facebook’s advertising tools, the company warns that potential reach figures all over the world “may vary significantly as people opt out of tracking on iOS 14.5, or use other data controls.”
The tone of these messages suggests that Facebook expects Apple’s recent iOS changes to have a meaningful impact on the performance of its advertising products over the coming months.
These changes will affect many other platforms too – not just Facebook.
Despite these challenges though, it’s worth reiterating the point that I made at the start of this section: overall, Instagram’s advertising reach has increased by more than 100 million over the past 3 months – despite that big drop in EU reach.
So, the takeaway here is that changes to privacy policies, cookie support, and online tracking regulations may have a significant impact on marketers’ ability to target ads over the coming months – at least until publishers and platforms find ways to adapt.
However, those changes don’t diminish the broader opportunities available to marketers within digital and social media platforms.
Recent data from eMarketer shows that digital channels now account for nearly 6 in every 10 ad dollars spent around the world, and we don’t anticipate that the challenges outlined above will make a significant dent in that share.

Marketers will need to change how they use digital and social media platforms over the next few months though, to ensure that their activities are as efficient and as effective as possible.
For example, you may want to experiment with contextual targeting opportunities, instead of relying solely on audience demographics – at least until you’re better able to identify how new policies and laws will affect your advertising strategy.
Mobile connection speeds accelerate
The latest data from Ookla shows that the average mobile connection speed around the world has increased by 60% over the past 12 months.
The typical mobile user now enjoys data download speeds in excess of 55 Mbps, compared to the 35 Mbps that the company reported this time last year.

Based on Netflix’s guidance, these figures indicate that the typical mobile user can now simultaneously stream two 4K movies via a single mobile connection.
According to Ookla’s latest findings, only two countries in the world now suffer from average mobile connection speeds below 10 Mbps: Afghanistan and Venezuela.
At the other end of the spectrum, 13 countries now enjoy average mobile connection speeds in excess of 100 Mbps, with average speeds in the United Arab Emirates already close to 200 Mbps.

To put that figure in perspective, the typical mobile user in the UAE can now download internet content 3,450 times faster than they would have been able to by using a 56K modem just 20 years ago.
The latency of mobile internet connections continues to improve too, with Ookla’s latest data showing that the ‘lag’ between a device sending a data request and it starting to receive the requested data has fallen by 7.5% over the past 12 months.
The latency of the average mobile connection continues to be almost double that of the average fixed connection though, so there’s some way to go before mobile gamers can enjoy the same speed advantages as their peers who use a fixed connection.

When it comes to fixed internet connections, a total of 10 countries now enjoy average download speeds of more than 200 Mbps, with Monaco and Singapore enjoying average speeds in excess of 250 Mbps.
However, 7 countries continue to suffer from average fixed connection speeds below 10 Mbps, and Ookla’s data reveals that mobile connections now outpace fixed connections in more than 40 countries.

Chinese websites move up the rankings
The latest data from Alexa (the analytics firm, not the voice assistant) suggests that the share of global internet traffic attributable to Chinese websites continues to grow.
The company’s latest rankings show that websites managed by companies based in China now account for 7 of the 10 most-visited sites in the world, and half of the global top 20.
Chinese ecommerce platforms are particularly popular, with three of the country’s online merchants – Tmall, Taobao, and JD – all ranking above Amazon’s ‘.com’ store at a worldwide level (note that Alexa treats each top-level domain separately, so traffic to Amazon’s local country stores are not included in the values for its .com store).

However, almost all of the traffic to Chinese websites appears to come from within China itself.
Alexa’s data shows that more than 95% of Tmall’s traffic comes from its home market, while that figure is 94% for Taobao, and 95% for JD.
Across each of these three sites, visitors from the United States and Japan account for roughly 3.5% of total traffic, meaning that the rest of the world accounts for barely 1.5% of each site’s worldwide total.
This data clearly demonstrates just how quickly China’s connected population is growing, but it also illustrates just how different China’s internet behaviors are to those of the rest of the world.
People increasingly rely on internet translation tools
The latest data suggests that online translation tools are becoming increasingly popular with internet users around the world.
Google Trends data shows that 3 of the worldwide top 20 Google search queries between April and June 2021 related to converting content between languages, with “translate”, “traductor”, and “Google Translate” all now top queries at a global level.
 

GWI data reinforces this finding, with the company’s latest survey revealing that roughly 1 in 3 internet users between the ages of 16 and 64 use online translation tools every week.
However, GWI’s data reveals some fascinating differences between countries and cultures.
Internet users in Latin America are the most likely to make use of online translation tools, with more than half of internet users in Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina saying they use these tools on a weekly basis.
However, internet users in countries where English is the dominant language appear to be far less likely to want to translate content from (or into) other languages. 
For example, fewer than 1 in 5 internet users in the United Kingdom and the USA say that they’ve used an online translation tool in the past week.

Even more tellingly, searches for ‘traductor’ rank relatively highly amongst Google queries in the United States, suggesting that many of those who do use online translation tools in the US are not native English speakers.
Around the world, younger people are also more likely to want to translate content than their parents’ generation.
GWI’s data shows that Gen Z internet users are almost twice as likely to have used an online translation tool in the past week than Baby Boomers are, with nearly 4 in 10 female internet users aged between 16 and 24 translating content online in the past 7 days.

Overall, these findings indicate that people are increasingly consuming content in languages other than their own native tongue, which represents some interesting new opportunities – and challenges – for marketers.
For example, as we reported this time last year, we’re seeing increased prevalence of cross-border online shopping, especially outside of North America.
However, as international content becomes ever more accessible, and as more people visit online merchants outside of their home country, brands may find it increasingly difficult to justify different prices – and even different product ranges – across different countries.
It’s also worth noting that Amazon appears to have increased the visibility of reviews from shoppers in other countries – some of which may be in different languages – which adds a whole new dimension to the factors that marketers need to consider when it comes to online shopping.
Digging deeper into video game behaviors
We’ve teamed up with GWI to bring you some detailed insights into gaming activities this quarter, taken from the company’s new Gaming dataset.
85% of the world’s internet users say that they play video games, so gaming environments represent a huge opportunity for marketers.
Moreover, 1 in 3 gamers around the world say that they play video games on a daily basis, with that figure rising to more than 40% in the USA, Japan, and the Philippines.
Meanwhile, more than 5 in every 6 gamers (84%) around the world say that they play video games at least once per week, with that figure rising to 87% in Mexico and India.

As you might expect, younger people are more likely to play video games, but GWI reports that more than 2 in 3 internet users aged 55 to 64 also identify as gamers.
Men are also slightly more likely to play video games than women, but amongst older age groups, women are just as likely to be gamers as men are.
The gaming ‘gender gap’ is also much smaller than many marketers might think, and when it comes to certain ‘casual’ game genres – particularly those on mobile devices – female players often outnumber their male peers.

The data also shows that people play a wide variety of different kinds of video games.
Action adventures like Assassin’s Creed and shooter formats like Call of Duty top the global rankings, with more than half of all gamers saying that they’ve played at least one title in these genres over the past year.
However, 10 distinct gaming genres have attracted more than a quarter of the worldwide gaming audience during the past 12 months, including puzzle formats like Limbo, simulation games like The Sims, and role-playing games like Mass Effect.
This highlights the fact that gaming opportunities cover a wide variety of contexts, making video games an even more compelling opportunity for marketers.

Opportunities aren’t limited to in-game activities either; gaming livestreams and related social media conversations are often just as compelling as the games themselves.
YouTube attracts the largest share of social media activities related to gaming, but – perhaps surprisingly – Facebook ranks ahead of Twitch and Discord, despite those platforms’ strong association with gaming communities.

Gaming environments are quite different from other kinds of media though, so it’s important for marketers to invest time in understanding which kinds of gaming genre and marketing activity will be most relevant to their specific audiences, as well as to their brand.
Online news behaviors
To round out this quarter’s analysis, let’s take a look at some key headlines from the 2021 edition of the Digital News Report, published by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.
This annual study provides a wealth of insights into how the world consumes news, which has particular importance when we consider GWI’s finding that “keeping up to date with news and events” is one of the top 3 motivations driving global internet use.

This year’s Digital News data shows that 82% of adults aged 18 and above now consume news online – significantly more than the 64% who say they watch news content on television.
Moreover, people are now more than twice as likely to get their news from social media as they are to look for it in newspapers and magazines.

Overall, 56% of respondents in the Digital News survey say that they use social media to access news content, but that figure rises to more than three-quarters of all adults aged 18 and above in Thailand, Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa.

Younger people are particularly likely to turn to social media for news, with two-thirds of respondents aged 18 to 24 saying that they use social platforms to access news content.
However, roughly half of all adults aged 55 and above say that they use social media for news too, so this behavior is by no means limited to Gen Z audiences.

Once again, these findings reinforce the data in GWI’s survey, which shows that news content is a strong draw for social media use.
Indeed, GWI’s latest data reveals that news content is a primary reason why more than 1 in 3 internet users aged 16 to 64 visit social platforms.

The Reuters Institute’s new report shows that Facebook continues to be the top social destination for news, with 44% of worldwide respondents saying that they use the platform to discover and consume news content.
YouTube ranks second at 29%, while WhatsApp is now the third most important social channel for news, with almost a quarter of survey respondents citing the platform as a regular feature in their news repertoire.
This year’s data also highlights Twitter’s outsized role when it comes to news content.
Despite claiming three times fewer monthly active users, Twitter is almost as popular as Instagram when it comes to news content.

However, people have significantly lower levels of trust in the news content that they find via social channels, compared to news in other kinds of media.
Overall, 44% of survey respondents say that they feel they can “trust most news content most of the time”, but positive sentiment falls to roughly half that figure (24%) when it comes to news content in social media.
So, while social media continues to play an important role in people’s news habits, it’s critical to remember that social media environments may have a negative impact on news credibility.
As a result, marketers and publishers may want to think carefully about how they use social channels to promote and distribute news content, especially if that content relates to potentially sensitive or contentious topics.

Perhaps ironically though, despite the relatively low levels of overall trust in news, people are still reluctant to pay for digital news content.
Fewer than 1 in 5 adults aged 18 and above around the world say that they currently pay for digital news, with that figure falling to less than 10% in Germany, the UK, and Croatia.

Outlook for the second half of 2021
Once again, the data in this quarter’s report demonstrates elevated growth in digital use and adoption around the world, creating a variety of opportunities for marketers everywhere.
However, I confess I’m surprised by these sustained high levels of growth, especially when it comes to social media user numbers.
The initial spikes in user growth that we saw at the start of the coronavirus pandemic were perhaps to be expected, but I’m unsure as to why those growth rates haven’t already returned to the levels we saw prior to the outbreak.
So, while my expectation is that we’ll start to see quarter-on-quarter growth rates fall from their recent highs later this year, I wouldn’t be surprised if that deceleration is still a few months away.
Furthermore, with ongoing delays in reporting updates to internet user numbers, we may see a significant jump in those metrics as new data starts to become available.
But what does this mean for marketers?
Here are my top tips for the second half of 2021:

Focus on macro trends: it’s easy to get distracted by short-term changes in the numbers, especially when fluctuations make for great headlines. However, the underlying story seems clear: our audiences have significantly increased their use of connected devices and services over recent months, and it’s unlikely that they’ll completely return to their pre-COVID habits. As a result, growth trends in digital activity don’t face the same risk of a downward ‘correction’ that we might expect to see in areas such as stock market prices.
Prepare for change: new privacy policies, the demise of third-party cookies, and changes to online legislation are combining to create ideal conditions for advertising’s ‘perfect storm’. Of course, this may all turn out to be another Millennium Bug, but with evidence of change already visible in some of this quarter’s numbers, I’d recommend opting for safe instead of sorry. If you haven’t already done so, now is the time to review which of your marketing activities depend on data and targeting practices that may be affected by these changes, and to develop contingency plans that will ensure your marketing efforts can continue.
Embrace digital utility: many of today’s most successful digital companies focus on two key industries – communication and entertainment. However, the next wave of digital innovation will likely focus on everyday utility, with the rapid digitization of education, banking, and healthcare leading the way. These industries offer fewer advertising opportunities than a new form of entertainment might do, but the changes they’ll bring to people’s everyday activities will likely have a knock-on effect on people’s digital expectations. As a result, I’d recommend exploring how you might use digital channels to create new kinds of value for your audiences, rather than using them solely to promote existing products and services. Entertainment will always be a compelling option, but with a bit of careful thinking, inspirational content and how-to videos can be just as engaging as the latest dance craze on TikTok. 

That’s all for this quarter, but we’ll be back with another Statshot report in October.

‘I don’t know’ is the best phrase for your career,Justin Pot,2021/07/20,"
I used to do sales, and I found three words very helpful: “I don’t know.”
The internet is full of articles for salespeople offering alternatives to saying those three words, all with elaborate ways to avoid admitting ignorance. And I get it: telling someone you don’t know something is hard, especially when you’re trying to convince that person to give you money.
But that’s why saying “I don’t know” is so powerful. In a world full of BS, the best way to stand out is to resemble an actual human being. Admitting you don’t know something is the most human thing you can do.
You don’t know everything — which makes sense
I used to build WordPress websites for local businesses in Boulder, Colorado, and I never impressed potential clients more than the times I admitted I didn’t know the answer to a question. It caught people off guard, in the best way, because they were so used to people pretending or weaseling their way out of corners.
“I don’t know,” I’d tell people. “Let’s see if we can figure it out together.”
And then we would. If I wasn’t sure what a setting did, I’d experiment as the customer watched. If it was something that would require more research, I’d commit to figuring it out. But first, and always, I’d admit that I didn’t know.
I built multiple relationships using the words “I don’t know” because people knew I wasn’t trying to hide anything. There’s trust in that. And you know what? The clients this impressed were by far the best people to work with. They were, on the whole, more curious, kind, and generally just the sort of people you want to work with on a project.
Our culture values confidence — it should value competence
I should clarify: I’m not saying you should be proud of your ignorance. Far from it. I’m saying that, when you don’t know something, you should admit it. You can’t learn something if you think you already know it.
This is a hard thing to realize. If recent history has taught me anything, it’s that American culture values confidence more than competence. Being loudly incorrect gets you on TV more often than being quietly curious, and it sadly seems like a quick path to success in business. There’s every incentive to pretend you know everything, and doing so can easily become reflexive.
Unfortunately, respecting the “I don’t know” isn’t universal. I asked my Zapier coworkers, and many of them told me that, in previous roles, they’d been punished professionally for admitting they didn’t know something. That’s a shame. Those companies missed out on the best possible version of my coworkers — the version that admits they don’t know something and tries to learn.
Just admit you don’t know
None of this is to say that admitting you don’t know something is easy. It isn’t. My Zapier colleague Breetel Graves recently wrote a Friday update on our internal blog that I can’t stop thinking about. She outlined her internal monologue in the lead-up to asking a question:
Breetel: I’m so dumb, I can’t ask this question. I can’t reveal how dumb I am!
Other Breetel: Ok, let’s say you are that dumb. What will happen if you reveal how dumb you are?
Breetel: I’ll get fired.
Other Breetel: You probably won’t be fired immediately. It’ll take a bit. You’ll probably have some warning.
Breetel: But then I’ll get fired.
Other Breetel: Yeah, but you’d probably get another job. The local cheese shop is hiring. You love cheese.
And then I asked the question.
This is so human it hurts. I do the same thing: I wonder if admitting I don’t know something will result in some sort of catastrophe.
But you know what? It hasn’t, at least for me — and it shouldn’t for anyone.

There’s a story about one of the chief innovators at Nokia, who receives a call while walking at the beach. After a few minutes, the person calling him asks about the noise in the background, prompting the Nokia chief to explain where he is. The caller then says, “Oh, I thought you were working,” to which the innovator replies, “I AM WORKING. I’M THINKING!”
It’s a funny story that’s always stuck with me. At a lot of companies, there’s an obsession with productivity that seems to overlook human nature… or even actual results.
Basically, if you look serious and your hands are moving, you must be working hard. But if you’re staring at the ceiling with a smile on your face, well, that obviously means you’re slacking.

I feel like this outlook is based on the archaic master/servant relationship which defined work-life at the beginning of the previous century: the boss tells the manager what to do, who then makes the employee do it.
And although I’m not a fan of design by decision, or even democracy as a management form, I do think that empowering your people and allowing them to do their best work is a more enduring and scalable strategy than treating them as soldiers in your imaginary army.
Every now and again, you hear a story about a company that blocks social media or specific websites to save their staff from ‘distraction.’ The theory being that people should work at work, and only engage in distractions during their off-hours — such as social media or calling your significant other about whether there’s enough toilet paper at home.

But this doesn’t describe the reality of employees’ lives. It isn’t binary with work and private life neatly compartmentalized.
You worry about a client while you’re preparing dinner. You think about a proposal you’re writing while the kids swim, and you might reply to a few emails or write a memo in bed when you’re finally relaxed enough to get your thoughts straight.
Sure, some people clock out at 5 pm and stop thinking about everything. But I’m guessing those people probably spend less time on personal stuff at the office. In the end, life is chaotic and fluid, and we should allow people to feel human at work.
If that means taking a call from a friend, then so be it.

Turning my startup’s office into an art gallery was a weirdly good business move,Daria Leshchenko,2021/07/9,"
I came into the office completely drained after a difficult meeting. But when I looked up I stopped awestruck: someone had hung a painting on the wall. Suddenly the boring hallway had been turned into a room with personality and mood. 
My business partner had decided to hang up an abstract painting by modern Ukrainian artist Anton Popernyak he owned. The painting undeniably brightened up the space, but its real value was the course it put us on — turning our office into an art gallery.

Putting on an art exhibition in your office might sound like an indulgent thing to do for a startup, but we discovered that it actually led to a lower turnover rate and increased offer acceptance among candidates we interviewed. 
So here’s how we came up with this idea and what results we got from it. Hopefully, it inspires you to do the same!

Why we did it
My business partner is an experienced patron of the greatly underappreciated Ukrainian art scene. He’s always been keen on bringing art closer to people and wanted to help introduce the team to their local culture. I wasn’t as involved in art as he was, but I’ve always cared about making our workplace an inspiring creative space where people would want to come back, not be obliged to come in. 
So when we saw our business would be expanding, we decided to combine our interests when designing a new office. 
Credit: SupportYourApp
We invited ten muralists, graphic designers, and calligraphists and gave them carte blanche — a censorship-free opportunity to use our office walls as a canvas. Five months later, our 350-person office space had turned into a modern art gallery. 
Now what did our team think? They loved it.
Of course, we had hoped for the project to be a morale boost for the team and maybe increase people’s interest in their local art scene. But in the end, what we got was so much more. 
Credit: SupportYourApp
Decreased turnover rate
We work in the customer support industry which has one of the highest employee turnover rates of any field. While the average rate for companies in general is 15 percent, for customer service centers it can reach 30-45 percent. 
This is a big problem for businesses as the cost to replace a person varies between $10,000 to $15,000 and can add up to a lot of money for big call centers. 
But since we gave our office an art makeover, our turnover rate dropped by 16 percent. All of a sudden our fun art initiative had a real measurable impact on our bottom line. 
Increased number of job applications
Credit: SupportYourAppAs a customer support company, our recruiting process is continuous and requires a huge pool of specialists who speak foreign languages. Just last year, during the challenging 2020, we hired 658 people. 
Most of our candidates come from job searching sites or are referred by current team members. But after we introduced art to the office, the word got out and the number of organic job applications increased 1.5 times. 
When asked, people said that they’ve seen the photos of our office on the job sites, on their friends’ social media, or in the press, and it made them want to apply. To them, our company seemed interesting and innovative and stood out among other offers. 
Judging by the incredibly positive results we’ve gotten, I believe that our investment into the space paid off with increased interest among potential candidates. 
Increased offer acceptance rate
We have three-stages job interviews and in the case of a local hire, the last stage is an in-person conversation in the office. We noticed that an average acceptance rate is 50 percent higher among the candidates interviewed in our new ‘art office’ in comparison to the old one. 
And it’s clear why from the feedback we’ve gotten from newcomers:  “The minute I saw this, I knew I wanted to work here.”

Credit: SupportYourAppTo give you a bit of perspective on why this has been so successful, I think it’s good to note that 42 percent of our applicants are millennials. 
Since 78 percent of them consider the quality of the workspace important when choosing an employer, it’s not surprising that a creative workplace attracts candidates’ attention. 
However, they are not the only ones who care about it: 81 percent of all applicants would reject a job offer if they didn’t like the workplace. That’s why I consider resources put in the office a long-term investment into our recruiting efforts. 
Increased brand awareness
Introducing an art project like this also drew the attention of local media and put us on a map of global office spaces. It helped us reach a new audience outside our traditional channels and cement a reputation as a responsible employer. 
A lot of factors contributed to getting us there. Team members shared photos of the office on social media and brought their relatives to our corporate Family Days. I also found employees were also more willing to promote the company among their friends. 
And because of all this interest, we introduced tours of the office for the public so more people could come to see the murals. All of this combined increased interest among potential candidates and, subsequently, clients.
Credit: SupportYourApp
Clients’ recognition
Since we’re in a competitive sector of the B2B industry, relationships and reputation are crucial for us. 
Before signing a contract, clients sometimes go on a tour checking out different service providers. Before COVID-19, we hosted on average four client visits per month. Having a unique office makes a memorable impression and lets us stand out among the competitors. 
The contact center industry is stereotypically perceived as a toxic work environment with gray open-space and no air conditioning. We bust that myth and make our clients see how their money is spent: on happy representatives which means happy customers. 
Clients, who value commitment to the team’s wellness, appreciate our efforts and tend to choose us as a partner. 
Credit: SupportYourApp
Of course, we can’t credit all the above-mentioned achievements solely to art in the office. You can’t just hang a painting on the wall and expect the turnover rate to go down — that’s not how it works. It has to be a part of and supported by other strategic efforts to improve the overall employee experience. 
However, the massive introduction of art into our space definitely played a key role in how our team perceives its workplace and the company. Still, one of the less visible yet priceless benefits I love the most is when I overhear two people chatting in the kitchen… about which mural they liked more — the one by Manzhos or by Kondakov.

3 semi-useful tips on office ‘conversation pieces’,Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten,2021/07/8,"
Boris is the wise ol’ CEO of TNW who writes a weekly column on everything about being an entrepreneur in tech — from managing stress to embracing awkwardness. You can get his musings straight to your inbox by signing up for his newsletter!
I recently learned a technique for enabling connections and conversations during dinner, and it’s called… the conversation piece. 
Apparently, in previous centuries, it was common practice for the wealthier families of Amsterdam (where I live) to place an object in the middle of the table, so your guests could discuss it. A literal conversation piece.
They’d host prestigious dinner parties where the pieces were crafted by commissioned artists. Some were abstract, some more classical and poetic, and some were downright pornographic. So conversations never stalled, the more audacious and controversial the piece was, the more there was to talk about — especially once the alcohol started flowing.
[Read: The ‘five whys’ will make returning to the office less awful]
I greatly enjoy hosting dinner parties as they revolve around good conversations and exchanging ideas, so I was really inspired. But I was also inspired because I could see how the benefits can reach far beyond dinner parties.
I want to have great discussions in my management team, good exchange of ideas with other teams, and engaging one-on-one conversations with my employees.
So here are my three tips to improve your communication, based on the age-old conversation piece.
Tip 1: Choose your piece
Let me be clear: don’t bring an erotic centerpiece to your next team meeting. But what you can do is think about the general concept of having a conversation piece to enable great conversations.
I love the story of the founder of Palm when the company was first starting out. He chose what sparked conversations by actually fashioning a Palmpilot prototype out of wood, drawing a screen and buttons on it with a pencil — and then he carried it around the office and pretended it worked.
He’d come into meetings, place a block of wood on the table, and act as if it was a fully functioning machine. Now that’s a conversation starter.
But a conversation piece doesn’t have to be a physical object or a thing. At our conferences — next one in 84 days, see you there in person? — I like to use our speakers as the conversation pieces.
No matter who you run into or what field they’re in, it’s so easy to encourage a discussion with a simple “have you seen this speaker?” And the beautiful thing is, it doesn’t even really matter whether the answer is yes or no because you now have something to kickstart the conversation.
Tip 2: Shut up
As great as it is to come prepared for conversations, there’s one undeniable fact we have to acknowledge: you talk too much.
If you want to have a good conversation, learn to shut the fuck up. Or as more eloquent people would say: you’ll never learn from just hearing yourself speak.
I know you agree with me when I say the best conversations are when you’re genuinely interested and ask lots of questions. It’s amazing when you have chats like these with friends and family, but they’re even more precious in company meetings.
That’s why I find the most powerful thing you can do in a meeting is to start by saying, “I’m here to listen.” Then hold your tongue and absorb what others have to say — you’ll learn a ton.
So not only can a ‘conversation piece’ be abstract rather than physical, the intentional absence of one can start a deeper discussion.
Tip 3: Walkie-talkie 
The physical conversation pieces of old also remind me of a conversation technique I picked up a while back. When you want to discuss complex topics, go for a walk together.
Why? Because it works so much better than a rigid chat sitting across from each other.
When you’re walking, you can stare into the distance and speak your mind more freely. When you’re sat opposite each other, you won’t be able to avoid eye contact, and that can make it harder to think out loud as you feel more scrutinized or worried about how the other person will react to a half-formed thought.
This is just one reason video chats can be so annoying: the constant and unavoidable eye contact.
A walk can therefore make sure the wrong thing doesn’t dictate which direction the conversation goes — for example, perceived judgment by the person sitting across from you.
So to sum up… 
Want to ask someone a tricky question or discuss a complex topic? Don’t schedule lunch but go for a walk, or meet in a museum, or find a sunset or fireplace to stare into. And then shut up and listen.
Don’t try to impress others with your stories or insights, but dive deep into their background and reasoning. And lastly, define your conversation piece — whether it’s physical, abstract, or non-existent — then let the conversation develop on its own from there.

Open-plan offices make you stressed and moody: We’ve got the data to prove it,The Conversation,2021/07/7,"
If you’ve ever felt your noisy open-plan office makes you cranky and sends your heart racing, our new research shows you aren’t imagining it.
Prior to the pandemic 70% of office-based employees worked in open-plan offices. Employee complaints about this design are rife.
Yet there is little experimental research investigating the effects of office noise on things like cognitive performance, physiological stress , and mood.
The results of our study, in experimentally controlled conditions using heart rate, skin conductivity, and AI facial emotion recognition, shows the effects of that noise are very real.
We’ve found a significant causal relationship between open-plan office noise and physiological stress.
Our results show such noise heightens negative mood by 25% — and these results come from testing participants in a simulated open-plan office for just eight minutes at a time. In a real office, where workers are exposed to noise continuously during the day, we would expect the effects on stress and mood to be even greater.
How we simulated open-plan office noise
We used a simulated office setting with volunteers to compare the effects of typical open-plan office noise to a quieter private office on a range of objective and subjective measures of well-being and performance. Our carefully manipulated soundscapes included people speaking, walking, printing papers, ringing telephones, and keyboard typing noises.
Our study involved observing the same individuals “working” — participants were asked to complete a proof-reading task — under the two noise conditions. We varied the order of the sound tests to avoid bias due to fatigue and training effects.
This “repeated measures experimental design” allowed us to make causal conclusions about the effects of the noise on well-being indicators.
We used sensors to track changes in heart rate and sweat response — both reliable indicators of physiological stress. We used facial emotion recognition software to assess emotional responses. We also had participants self-report their own feeling using a mood scale.
Even after a short exposure, we found a causal relationship between open-plan office noise and both stress and negative mood. Negative mood increased by 25% and sweat response by 34%.
While there was no immediate effect on reduced work performance, it is reasonable to assume such hidden stress over the longer term is detrimental to well-being and productivity.
Credit: The ConversationNegative effects of open offices

Precise causal relationships
Our study addresses a gap in the literature by using a simulated office environment with objectively manipulated noise levels and a wide range of objective and subjective dependent variables.
Reviews in research in this field show past studies have tended to only use self-reported measures. They have not used controlled experimental conditions, nor tested sound parameters.
Comparing multiple output measures has allowed us to investigate cause-effect relationships. Much research on open-plan offices has not established direct causal connections, which is necessary to understand precise relationships, and thus the how to most effectively and efficiently reduce these stressors.
Although open-plan offices rarely present an immediate physical danger in terms of sound levels, unrelenting exposure all day intensifies their effects.
Chronically elevated levels of physiological stress are known to be detrimental to mental and physical health.
Frequently being in a negative mood is also likely to harm job satisfaction and commitment. It potentially increases the likelihood of employees leaving.
What to do about it
The pandemic has changed our tolerance for office work. Surveys show up to 70% of employees will seek new jobs if their employer does not offer flexibility to work from home some of the time. So creating a healthy work environment is more important than ever.
As organizations seek to adapt to COVID-19, many are reconsidering how they set up and use the office. Though open-plan offices are unlikely to go away any time soon, our study highlights the importance of understanding employee needs in designing work spaces.
One advantage of more employees working from home at least some of the time is a less crowded office, reducing both visual and auditory distractions.
But there are other things that can be done. Acoustic treatments and sound-masking technologies — ambient sounds designed to make other people talking less intrusive — can help. Good old-fashioned walls or partitions may also assist.
Such interventions can be costly, but so is the impact of poor office environmental quality on productivity.
And we might all feel happier about going back to the office.

The process of building great tech teams is broken — here’s how we fix it,Sachin Gupta,2021/07/6,"
Today’s world of software development is different from the proprietary software of years past. Open source enables speed, agility, and flexibility. APIs connect disparate processes into ecosystems of solutions that easily plug into each other and speak a shared language.
While software development itself is now extremely collaborative, I’d say the process of hiring and upskilling talent in this world is just the opposite. 
It’s fragmented with siloed teams and technologies that don’t work together. Individual recruiters, hiring managers, HR teams, and strategic leaders work independently like the legacy software that the developers they’re hiring, in many cases, are replacing.
Misaligned expectations between recruiters and hiring managers is a common pain point, but the problems with building great tech teams go much further up the organizational pyramid than you might expect.
For example, Chief Learning Officers rarely consult with hiring managers when they develop L&D initiatives. At first glance, that might make sense… but not when you really think about it. 
If you want to start prioritizing certain skills at your organization and develop entire courses to promote those skills, wouldn’t you want to understand the skills that are being prioritized when hiring prospective employees from day one?
This is why I believe we need strategic communication between teams so that everyone is aligned on who to hire, why, and how to upskill them into the most complete talent that fits the technology trends and business needs of the present, AND the future. 
Here are some ways we can get there:
1. Build a skill-based organizational culture
Some cultures are fun. Some are rigid. The joke in the VC world here in Silicon Valley is that the culture of Venture Capital firms can be summed up in one item of clothing: Patagonia vests.
But culture of course far exceeds clothing — and it starts in the hiring process.
As I’ve argued in the past, the idea of hiring for culture fit is changing. Organizations used to hire archetypes that looked and felt the same, risking inclusivity in the process. Today, culture fit is more about aligning values at every stage of the interview process. 
These values must be inclusive at their heart, but once you know that a candidate has a similar world view, a hunger for excellence, and customer-centricity, for example, then you simply must prioritize skills.
What my team and I do is put skills at the heart of our organizational culture. We hire for skills, agnostic of gender or racial background. In fact, we mask personally identifiable information like name and gender during screening and even, sometimes, during interviews so that unconscious bias won’t impact a hiring decision. 
I think everyone can recognize that interviews are often a source of subjectivity where it’s easy for someone’s decision to be based on personal preferences over actual skill. 
We ensure that objectivity is at the heart of coding interviews by designing a way to accurately measure skills, even during a face-to-face interview so that there is absolutely no room for subjectivity or bias in the process.
But we go further than just hiring. We design our learning and development programs around strategically prioritized skills. That way, we know we have a pipeline of developer talent that will meet our needs, but we can also tailor L&D programs to further strengthen their skills and make them future-ready.
With our skill-based organizational culture in place, it was easy to get stakeholders to collaborate to define skill-based objectives and work towards helping new and old developers alike grow in a strategic manner.
This is also something that we’ve put into our solutions for companies worldwide. We not only help you hire based solely on skill, and nothing else, we also enable you to identify skill gaps within your current organization so that hiring and even L&D programs can be aligned seamlessly.
2. Continuous assessment to ensure continuous learning
People who develop products often follow this procedure: design, test, iterate. 
I’ve found that many learning and development programs don’t emphasize the last two steps. Companies design these great programs, but it’s hard for them to understand and quantify success.
In fact, Deloitte’s 2021 Human Capital Trends Report highlights that reskilling and upskilling programs must “gather and act on workforce data that provides a real-time view of workers’ skills across the entire talent ecosystem.”
Part of this will, of course, be gathering employee feedback on individual programs, but you also have to test their skills in quantifiable ways. Can you build an assessment that gauges their ability to code in Go, a highly sought-after programming language, for instance? 
Their assessment data then needs to be tracked against performance data. Are they succeeding in their role in the way their assessments might predict? Why or why not? How can the L&D program be tweaked to impact real-world applications of skills?
If you aren’t assessing the skills that you’re prioritizing, you’re building skill infrastructure blind.
3. Apply D&I insights to your upskilling programs
Though the corporate world doesn’t necessarily have a strong track record of supporting diversity and inclusion, something did seem to change in the aftermath of last year’s BLM protests. Many organizations have prioritized D&I hiring initiatives, but where their efforts fall short is in upskilling and promoting diverse talent from within.
For instance, women are more likely to take a career break than their male peers, and D&I upskilling programs can be effective ways to help them quickly reacclimate to a different work environment that places emphasis on different skills.
With the skill gap very much heightening competition for tech talent, your HR department can add a lot of value by simply working with your hiring managers to highlight these upskilling programs as an attractive draw to your organization. 
On the flip side, the hiring managers themselves can really help inform elements of these programs by communicating areas of growth needed from their candidates.
This collaboration allows you to not only hire diverse talent, but also tailor programs to their needs to put diverse talent in positions of leadership.
The connective tissue to build great tech teams
It’s funny how sometimes we fail to learn lessons from the things we study day after day. We focus on the minutiae of execution rather than seeing strategic changes as they happen. 
When it comes to tech, we’ve embraced the collaboration of APIs, but we haven’t sourced, screened, interviewed, and upskilled our tech talent nearly as comprehensively. 
It’s time to build connective tissue between the structures of tech employee lifecycle management so that organizations can act and move as a single unit when building great tech teams.

The ‘five whys’ will make returning to the office less awful,Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten,2021/07/1,"
Boris is the wise ol’ CEO of TNW who writes a weekly column on everything about being an entrepreneur in tech — from managing stress to embracing awkwardness. You can get his musings straight to your inbox by signing up for his newsletter!
I was talking to a woman the other day about how much she liked the company she worked for. It’s fun and modern in most ways, but there was one big catch — the management team is still stuck in the past when it comes to this year’s biggest challenge for employees and companies… returning to the office.
Their CEO had recently announced that they expect employees to work from the office again five days a week as soon as things return to normal.
She was dismayed and annoyed and told me most employees don’t want to return to the office five days a week. Some are fine with three days. Others would prefer two days, and a few are happy with just one day a week at the office.
[Read: The secret to personal growth? Be scared and show up]
Now faced with a forced five-day week back at the office, the employee told me she and her coworkers are ready to revolt. They thought about going to the office and spending less time working and more time drinking coffee and chatting. Performance would drop, and management would be forced to allow work from home again.
The response? Management took the position of look, you’re being paid to work from the office, so if you don’t like that, you can quit and find a different company to work at.
Both responses are incredibly human and understandable knee-jerk reactions — but they won’t lead to a solution. And I truly believe that in the end, both employees and the company will be worse off.
So how do you solve it…?
I don’t have the perfect solution to this problem (I never do), but I think it’s important to realize that frustrations with decisions like these are usually just the tip of the iceberg, while there’s so much more going on below the surface.
In this situation, I think it would’ve made more sense for the management to ask themselves, “Why exactly do we want people to work from the office? Why really?” And the answer can’t be “just because.”
To me, the answer would most likely be “because I want people to perform” and the logical follow-up would be “and I can’t ever be sure if they work from home because I can’t check up on them as easily.”
Now that’s a trust issue — and it’s an indictment on management and its approach. But trust is also something you need to earn, so both management and employees need to think hard about how to build that trust.
The logical next step is to look at performance. If you’re an employee and can show you’re more efficient and reach your goals faster while working at home, then surely that should be a persuasive reason to allow you to work from home.
But I can also see the manager’s point of view who wants to inspire people by having them in the same space because group spirit can be incredibly energizing. A good office creates a lot of space for serendipitous encounters and it can be the glue that holds a company together — which is extremely difficult to replicate online.
So despite the fact we’ve all seen that we can work and be productive from home, I think we should never underestimate the magic that can happen when you get people together in the same place.
That’s why if you’re an employee, you need to be honest when asking yourself this question: “Does working from home really make me more efficient, or is it just slightly more comfortable?”
Now, these questions won’t resolve the issue on their own, but they’re a good start of getting into the habit of asking yourself the ‘five whys.’
Try solving issues with the ‘five whys’ technique
In my mind, if you want to solve a problem, you’re going to have to stop looking at it superficially and look for its root cause. Just thinking about it a minute longer might help, but I’m quite fond of the ‘five whys’ technique.
How does it work? You just need to ask ‘why?’ five times.
If we apply it to both the employee and management in the problem above, we get something like this:
Why do you want to work from home?

1st why — because I like it
2nd why — because I can focus better
3rd why — because there are fewer distractions
4th why — because the office is too loud and I’m pulled into too many meetings
5th why — I need silence and no interruptions to do my work more efficiently

All of these reasons are completely understandable, but using the five whys forces you to see that working remotely might not be the only solution.
These issues could, for example, be addressed with a quieter office space and a rule that limits the number of meetings throughout the day. So you staying at home or coming into the office might not be the root cause, but rather the company’s culture.
But let’s see how it works for management:
Why do you want your employees to come to the office?

1st why — because I don’t think they work as hard from home
2nd why — because I believe they will be too distracted at home
3rd why — because their cat demands attention, the dishwasher needs to be emptied, and their kids are running around
4th why — because that means they won’t spend all their time on their work
5th why — and that means I’m paying 100% and only getting 50% work back

‘Butts in seats’ isn’t a solution to not having control over productivity. Instead, just focus more on output rather than hours or being physically present.
Implement a clear KPI and OKR system and make sure you’re happy with those goals, and then when employees meet those goals… who the hell cares about hours worked?
And if you’re worried about morale being low due to lack of face-to-face interactions — or see more confrontations and criticism happening — then organize more events at the office or create other reasons to entice people to get together and interact more with each other.
If we break it all down, I think the primary reason people want to work from home is comfort. And the reason managers want their employees close to them is control. But both comfort and control can be achieved by other means if we’re all able and willing to look at the root cause of our desires.

How to organize your horribly chaotic Slack sidebar,Justin Pot,2021/07/1,"
Do you ever wonder why your coworker’s Slack sidebar looks so much better than yours? It’s probably because they organized it. You can tweak all sorts of settings in Slack, from how the sidebar behaves to how it looks.
Let’s outline these tweaks one at a time.
Only see unread channels in the Slack sidebar
By default, Slack shows every channel you join and the person you DM in the sidebar, which means it can get cluttered quickly. That’s why you should customize your Slack sidebar to only show what matters.
I recommend that you first set the Channels section to only show unread channels. Hover over Channels, click the three dots to the right, then click Unread channels only.
You will now only see channels in the sidebar if there’s something unread. You can repeat this process for direct messages, if you like, and things will look really clean really quickly.
Create personalized sections in the Slack sidebar
Of course, there probably are some channels you want to keep track of, so I recommend that you create sections for them. Click the three dots next to Channels again, then click Create new section.
You can now create a section for your sidebar, complete with an (optional) emoji.
You can add as many sections as you like, then drag DMs and channels to the relevant sections. I opted for the clean look, free of emojis, that allows me to see different things in the sidebar depending on which team I’m working with right now.
My coworkers have customized this in all sorts of creative ways.
Tweak this until it looks just right for your usage.
Change the order that channels are listed in
You can also tweak what order your Slack channels show up in. Click the name of your organization, at top-left, then click Preferences.
Now head to the Sidebar section.
The default option, alphabetically, is probably best for most people. If you’re feeling brave, though, Slack can sort things “By priority,” which means the channels you use most often end up on top. You can also decide here whether private and shared channels show up in their own lists.
Once you’ve grouped your channels into sections, you can also drag and drop each channel into a new order, or even a new section.
Change the Slack sidebar color scheme
Now that you’ve organized your sidebar, it’s time to get to the fun stuff: customizing how Slack’s sidebar looks. Go to Preferences > Themes, scroll down, and you’ll see a few default themes to choose from:
These are fine, but I’m sure you were hoping for more options. Good news! You can design literally whatever theme you want using the Custom Theme option.
This is, of course, way too much work, which is why I’m thrilled to share even better news: you can quickly grab themes from SlackThemes.net. There’s a bunch of good ones here.
Just find a theme you like, copy the values, then paste them in back in Slack. You’ll have a great-looking Slack in no time.

How a 1930s Soviet miner helped create today’s toxic work culture,The Conversation,2021/06/30,"
One summer night in August, 1935, a young Soviet miner named Alexei Stakhanov managed to extract 102 tonnes of coal in a single shift. This was nothing short of extraordinary (according to Soviet planning, the official average for a single shift was seven tonnes).
Stakhanov shattered this norm by a staggering 1,400%. But the sheer quantity involved was not the whole story. It was Stakhanov’s achievement as an individual that became the most meaningful aspect of this episode. And the work ethic he embodied then – which spread all over the USSR – has been invoked by managers in the west ever since.
Stakhanov’s personal striving, commitment, potential and passion led to the emergence of a new ideal figure in the imagination of Stalin’s Communist Party. He even made the cover of Time magazine in 1935 as the figurehead of a new workers movement dedicated to increasing production. Stakhanov became the embodiment of a new human type and the beginning of a new social and political trend known as “Stakhanovism”.
Credit: SOVFOTO/TimeUSAAlexei Stakhanov on the cover of Time in 1935.
That trend still holds sway in the workplaces of today – what are human resources, after all? Management language is replete with the same rhetoric used in the 1930s by the Communist Party. It could even be argued that the atmosphere of Stakhanovite enthusiasm is even more intense today than it was in Soviet Russia. It thrives in the jargon of Human Resource Management (HRM), as its constant calls to express our passion, individual creativity, innovation, and talents echo down through management structures.
But all this “positive” talk comes at a price. For over two decades, our research has charted the evolution of managerialism, HRM, employability, and performance management systems, all the way through to the cultures they create. We have shown how it leaves employees with a permanent sense of never feeling good enough and the nagging worry that someone else (probably right next to us) is always performing so much better.
From the mid-1990s, we charted the rise of a new language for managing people – one that constantly urges us to see work as a place where we should discover “who we truly are” and express that “unique” personal “potential” which could make us endlessly “resourceful”.
The speed with which this language grew and spread was remarkable. But even more remarkable are the ways in which it is now spoken seamlessly in all spheres of popular culture. This is no less than the very language of the modern sense of self. And so it cannot fail to be effective. Focusing on the “self” gives management unprecedented cultural power. It intensifies work in ways which are nearly impossible to resist. Who would be able to refuse the invitation to express themselves and their presumed potential or talents? Stakhanov was a kind of early poster boy for refrains like: “potential”, “talent”, “creativity”, “innovation”, “passion and commitment”, “continuous learning”, and “personal growth”. They have all become the attributes management systems now hail as the qualities of ideal “human resources”. These ideas have become so entrenched in the collective psyche that many people believe they are qualities they expect of themselves, at work, and at home.
The superhero worker
So, why does the specter of this long-forgotten miner still haunt our imaginations? In the 1930s, miners lay on their sides and used picks to work the coal, which was then loaded onto carts and pulled out of the shaft by pit ponies. Stakhanov came up with some innovations, but it was his adoption of the mining drill over the pick which helped drive his productivity. The mining drill was still a novelty and required specialist training in the 1930s because it was extremely heavy (more than 15kgs).
Once the Communist Party realized the potential of Stakhanov’s achievement, Stakhanovism took off rapidly. By the autumn of 1935, equivalents of Stakhanov emerged in every sector of industrial production. From machine-building and steelworks, to textile factories and milk production, record-breaking individuals were rising to the elite status of “Stakhanovite”. They were stimulated by the Communist Party’s ready adoption of Stakhanov as a leading symbol for a new economic plan. The party wanted to create an increasingly formalized elite representing the human qualities of a superhero worker.
Such workers began to receive special privileges (from high wages to new housing, as well as educational opportunities for themselves and their children). And so the Stakhanovites became central characters in Soviet Communist propaganda. They were showing the world what the USSR could achieve when technology was mastered by a new kind of worker who was committed, passionate, talented, and creative. This new worker was promising to be the force that would propel Soviet Russia ahead of its western capitalist rivals.
Soviet propaganda seized the moment. A whole narrative emerged showing how the future of work and productivity in the USSR should unfold over the coming decades. Stakhanov ceased to be a person and became the human form of a system of ideas and values, outlining a new mode of thinking and feeling about work.
It turns out that such a story was sorely needed. The Soviet economy was not performing well. Despite gigantic investments in technological industrialization during the so-called “First Five-Year Plan” (1928-1932), productivity was far from satisfactory. Soviet Russia had not overcome its own technological and economic backwardness, let alone leap over capitalist America and Europe.
‘Personnel decides everything’
The five-year plans were systematic programs of resource allocation, production quotas, and work rates for all sectors of the economy. The first aimed to inject the latest technology in key areas, especially industrial machine building. Its official Communist Party slogan was “Technology Decides Everything”. But this technological push failed to raise production; the standard of living and real wages ended up lower in 1932 than in 1928.
The “Second Five-Year Plan” (1933-1937) was going to have a new focus: “Personnel Decides Everything”. But not just any personnel. This was how Stakhanov stopped being a person and became an ideal type, a necessary ingredient in the recipe for this new plan.
On May 4, 1935, Stalin had already delivered an address entitled “Cadres [Personnel] Decide Everything”. So the new plan needed figures like Stakhanov. Once he showed that it could be done, in a matter of weeks, thousands of “record-breakers” were allowed to try their hand in every sector of production. This happened despite reservations from managers and engineers who knew that machines, tools, and people cannot withstand such pressures for any length of time.
Regardless, the party propaganda needed to let a new kind of working-class elite grow as if it was spontaneous – simple workers, coming from nowhere, driven by their refusal to admit quotas dictated by the limits of machines and engineers. Indeed, they were going to show the world that it was the very denial of such limitations that constituted the essence of personal involvement in work: break all records, accept no limits, show how every person and every machine is always capable of “more”.

On November 17, 1935, Stalin provided a definitive explanation of Stakhanovism. Closing the First Conference of Stakhanovites of Industry and Transport of the Soviet Union, he defined the essence of Stakhanovism as a leap in “consciousness” – not just a simple technical or institutional matter. Quite the contrary, the movement demanded a new kind of worker, with a new kind of soul and will, driven by the principle of unlimited progress. Stalin said:
These are new people, people of a special type … the Stakhanov movement is a movement of working men and women which sets itself the aim of surpassing the present technical standards, surpassing the existing designed capacities, surpassing the existing production plans and estimates. Surpassing them – because these standards have already become antiquated for our day, for our new people.
In the ensuing propaganda, Stakhanov became a symbol burdened with meanings. Ancestral hero, powerful, raw, and unstoppable. But also one with a modern, rational, and progressive mind which could liberate the hidden, untapped powers of technology and take command of its limitless possibilities. He was cast as a Promethean figure, leading an elite of workers whose nerves and muscles, minds, and souls, were utterly attuned to the technological production systems themselves. Stakhanovism was the vision of a new humanity.
‘The possibilities are endless’
The Stakhanovites’ celebrity status offered enormous ideological opportunities. It allowed the rise of production quotas. Yet this rise had to remain moderate, otherwise Stakhanovites could not be maintained as an elite. And, as an elite, Stakhanovites themselves had to be subjected to a limitation: how many top performers could really be accommodated before the very idea collapsed into normality? So quotas were engineered in a way which we might recognize today: by the forced distribution or “stack ranking” of all employees according to their performance.
After all, how many high-performers can there be at any one time? The former CEO of General Electric, Jack Welch, suggested 20% (no more, no less) every year. Indeed, the Civil Service in the UK operated on this principle until 2019 but used a 25% top performer quota. In 2013, Welch claimed this system was “nuanced and humane”, that it was all “about building great teams and great companies through consistency, transparency and candor” as opposed to “corporate plots, secrecy or purges”. Welch’s argument was, however, always flawed. Any forced distribution system inextricably leads to exclusion and marginalization of those who fall in the lower categories. Far from humane, these systems are always, inherently, threatening and ruthless.
And so Stakhanovism is still flowing through modern management systems and cultures, with their focus on employee performance and constant preoccupation with “high performing” individuals.
Something that often gets forgotten is that Stalinism itself was centered on an ideal of the individual soul and will: what is there that “I” am not able to do? Stakhanov fitted perfectly this ideal. Western culture has been telling itself the same ever since – “the possibilities are endless”.
This was the logic of the Stakhanovite Movement in the 1930s. But it is also the logic of contemporary popular and corporate cultures, whose messages are now everywhere. Promises that “possibilities are endless”, that potential is “limitless”, or that you can craft any future you want, can now be found in “inspirational” posts on social media, in management consultancy speil, and in just about every graduate job advertisement. One management consultancy firm even calls itself Infinite Possibilities.
Indeed, these very sentences made it onto a seemingly minor coffee coaster used by Deloitte in the early 2000s for their graduate management scheme. On one side it said: “The possibilities are endless.” While on the other side, it challenged the reader to take control of destiny itself: “It’s your future. How far will you take it?”

Insignificant though these objects may appear, a discerning future archaeologist would know that they carry a most fateful kind of thinking, driving employees now as much as it drove Stakhanovites.
But are these serious propositions, or just ironic tropes? Since the 1980s, management vocabularies have grown almost incessantly in this respect. The rapid proliferation of fashionable management trends follows the increased preoccupation with the pursuit of “endless possibilities”, of new and unlimited horizons of self-expression and self-actualization.
It is in this light that we have to show ourselves as worthy members of corporate cultures. Pursuing endless possibilities becomes central to our everyday working lives. The human type created by that Soviet ideology so many decades ago, now seems to gaze at us from mission statements, values, and commitments in meeting rooms, headquarters, and cafeterias – but also through every website and every public expression of corporate identity.
Stakhanovism’s essence was a new form of individuality, of self-involvement in work. And it is this form that now finds its home as much in offices, executive suites, corporate campuses, as in schools and universities. Stakhanovism has become a movement of the individual soul. But what does an office worker actually produce and what do Stakhanovites look like today?
Today’s corporate Stakhanovites
In 2020, the drama series, Industry, created by two people with direct experience of corporate workplaces, gave us a glimpse into modern Stakhanovism. It is a sensitive and detailed examination of the destinies of five graduates joining a fictional, but utterly recognizable, financial institution. The show’s characters become almost instantly ruthless neo-Stakhanovites. They knew and understood that it was not what they could produce that mattered for their own success, but how they performed their successful and cool personas on the corporate stage. It was not what they did but how they appeared that mattered.



The dangers of failing to appear extraordinary, talented, or creative were significant. The series showed how working life descends into unending personal, private, and public struggles. In them, every character loses a sense of direction and personal integrity. Trust disappears and their very sense of self increasingly dissolves.
Normal days of work, normal shifts, no longer exist. Workers have to perform endlessly, gesturing so that they look committed, passionate, and creative. These things are compulsory if employees are to retain some legitimacy in the workplace. So working life carries the weight of potentially determining a person’s sense of worth in every glance exchanged and in every inflection of seemingly insignificant interactions – whether in a board room, over a sandwich, or a cup of coffee.
Friendships become impossible because human connection is no longer desirable since trusting others weakens anyone whose success is at stake. Nobody wants to fall out of the Stakhanovite society of hyper-performing top talents. Performance appraisals that may lead to dismissal are a scary prospect. And this is the case both in the series and in real life.
The last episode of Industry culminates in half the remaining graduates getting sacked following an operation called “Reduction In Force”. This is basically a drastic final performance appraisal where each employee is forced to make a public statement arguing why they should remain – much like on the reality TV series The Apprentice. In Industry, the characters’ statements are broadcast on screens throughout the building as they describe what would make them stand out from the crowd and why they are worthier than all others.
Reactions to Industry emerged very quickly and viewers were enthusiastic about the show’s realism and how it resonated with their own experiences. One YouTube channel host with extensive experience of the sector reacted to each episode in turn; the business press too reacted promptly, alongside other media. They converged in their conclusions: this is a serious corporate drama whose realism reveals much of the essence of work cultures today.
Industry is important because it touches directly on an experience so many have: the sense of a continuous competition of all against all. When we know that performance appraisals compare us all against each other, the consequences on mental health can be severe.



This idea is taken further in an episode of Black Mirror. Entitled “Nosedive“, the story depicts a world in which everything we think, feel and do becomes the object of everyone else’s rating. What if every mobile phone becomes the seat of a perpetual tribunal that decides our personal value – beyond any possibility of appeal? What if everyone around us becomes our judge? What does life feel like when all we have to measure ourselves by are other people’s instant ratings of us?
We asked these questions in detail in our research which charted the evolution of performance management systems and the cultures they create over two decades. We found that performance appraisals are becoming more public (just as in Industry), involving staff in 360-degree systems in which every individual is rated anonymously by colleagues, managers, and even clients on multiple dimensions of personal qualities.
Management systems focusing on individual personality are now combining with the latest technologies to become permanent. Ways of reporting continuously on every aspect of our personality at work are increasingly seen as central to mobilizing “creativity” and “innovation”.
And so it might be that the atmosphere of Stakhanovite competition today is more dangerous than in 1930s Soviet Russia. It is even more pernicious because it is now driven by a confrontation between people, a confrontation between the worth of “me” against the worth of “you” as human beings – not just between the worth of what “I am able to do” against what “you are able to do”. It is a matter of a direct encounter of personal characters and their own sense of worth that has become the medium of competitive, high-performance work cultures.
The Circle, by Dave Eggers, is perhaps the most nuanced exploration of the world of 21st-century Stakhanovism. Its characters, plot and context, its attention to detail, bring to light what it means to take up one’s personal destiny in the name of the imperative to hyper-perform and over-perform one’s self and everyone around us.
When the ultimate dream of becoming the central star of corporate culture comes true, a new Stakhanov is born. But who can maintain this kind of hyper-performative life? Is it even possible to be excellent, extraordinary, creative, and innovative all day long? How long can a shift of performative work be anyway? The answer turns out not to be fictional at all.
Stakhanovism’s limits
In the summer of 2013, an intern at a major city financial institution, Moritz Erhardt, was found dead one morning in the shower of his flat. It turns out that Erhardt really did try to put in a neo-Stakhanovite shift: three days and three nights of continuous work (known among London City workers and taxi drivers as a “magic roundabout”).

A year on from intern Moritz Erhardt’s death, has the banking industry changed its ways? http://t.co/SHEDDFOOfb pic.twitter.com/ZetsLV4Oga
— The Independent (@Independent) August 10, 2014

But his body could not take it. We examined this case in detail in our previous research as well as anticipating just such a tragic scenario a year before it happened. In 2010, we reviewed a decade of the Times 100 Graduate Employers and showed explicitly how such jobs can embody the spirit of neo-Stakhanovism.
Then in 2012, we published our review which signaled the dangers of the hyper-performative mold promoted in such publications. We argued that the graduate market is driven by an ideology of potentiality which is likely to overwhelm anyone who follows it too closely in the real world. A year later, this sense of danger became real in Erhardt’s case.
Stakhanov died after a stroke in Donbass, in eastern Ukraine, in 1977. A city in the region is named after him. The legacy of his achievement – or at least the propaganda that perpetuated it – lives on.
But the truth is that people do have limits. They do now, just as they did in the USSR in the 1930s. Possibilities are not infinite. Working towards goals of endless performance, growth and personal potential is simply not possible. Everything is finite.
Who we are and who we become when we work are actually fundamental and very concrete aspects of our everyday lives. Stakhanovite models of high-performance have become the register and rhythm of our working lives even though we no longer remember who Stakhanov was.
The danger is that we will not be able to sustain this rhythm. Just as the characters in Industry, Black Mirror, or The Circle, our working lives take destructive, toxic, and dark forms because we inevitably come up against the very real limits of our own purported potential, creativity, or talent.

Work and life should NOT be ‘balanced’,Justin Pot,2021/05/28,"
It’s hard to notice oddities in your culture — they just feel “normal.” But there’s nothing universal about what you consider common sense. It’s all shaped by the world you grew up in.
The book American Ways by Gary Althen taught me this clearly. The intended audience is non-Americans who need to interact with Americans, so the book is full of tidbits that make me feel like an alien specimen undergoing examination. Like this:
When they first encounter another person, Americans engage in a kind of conversation they call small talk. The most common topic of small talk is the weather. Another very common topic is what the speakers “do,” meaning, normally, what jobs they have.
The book goes on like this, for 300 pages, describing all kinds of behavior I consider normal in clinical terms. It’s mind-bending.
But pay attention to the second example of small talk: what you “do.” Think about that: one of our most common subjects of conversation is, more or less, “what labor do you engage in so that you can earn money?”
This is not universal. In some cultures, the answer to “what do you do?” is to talk about what you do for fun. But here, in North America, we talk about work. That means something, especially in our current “hustle culture” moment.
Which brings me to the idea of work-life balance, as understood by knowledge workers.
“Work-life balance” is kind of a messed up phrase
Picture, if you will, a scale.

No, not like that. Picture an old-timey balancing scale.

Yeah, like that. Imagine, if you will, putting your work on one side of that scale. Then imagine putting literally everything else about yourself — your friends, your hobbies, your family, your relationships, your beliefs, your favorite sports team, the movies you like, and so on — on the other side.
Do you think the scale should be tilted evenly?
Balance is a bias
The phrase “work-life balance” is, itself, an argument. Those words put the world into two categories — work and everything else — and imply that these two categories should be given more or less equal weight. And this, mind you, is the phrase used to suggest a healthier alternative to burnout.
I’m not saying we should all stop using the phrase “work-life balance.” Workplaces where employees put in grueling hours, to the point where it’s impossible to have a life outside of work, really are a problem, and all too often, workplace culture reinforces this. It’s easy for that to develop on a team if leadership isn’t intentional about it. I believe most managers and executives who use the term “work-life balance” are trying to make life better for their employees.
Having said that, I think our culture’s obsession with work is easy to ignore, and I think the phrase points to it.
Work and life aren’t opposites
Our culture glorifies work. Most of our TV dramas and sitcoms are set in workspaces. Social media feeds are full of hustlers working long hours in the workplace, then heading home to work on their side hustle. It’s easy to feel like work is the place where you should try to find meaning in life, and that you should constantly be trying to get to the next goal by working harder.
But you don’t have to. You can stay where you are, if your needs are being met. There’s no rule that says you have to advance, or that your business has to keep growing. You can get yourself to a reasonable place, and then stop. Turns out that’s perfectly legal.
That isn’t to say you can’t get satisfaction out of work. You can. I get a lot of joy out of writing and would probably spend a good chunk of every day doing it even if no one was paying me. Every so often, I write things I’m proud of. Sometimes strangers get in touch to tell me it meant a lot of them. It’s a great feeling, and I could imagine spending all of my time chasing it.
But there are other things worth chasing — sunsets, music, conversation, mountains, perfect pets, pizza, friends, laughter, and so much more.
This might seem obvious to you. I, personally, have had to learn this lesson over time, in part by having friends repeat it to me multiple times in situations where it should be obvious.
So I’m learning to put work in its place. I’m setting up guardrails so that I remember to stop working when it’s time. I try to automate busywork, then use the time I free up to do something else. And I try not to use working from home as an excuse to work more often. It’s not about balance — it’s about keeping things in perspective.
Work might be personally meaningful to you, or it might not be. But it’s not who you are, or even necessarily the most interesting thing about you. Work can just be a thing you sometimes do and occasionally bring up in conversation (when the weather isn’t interesting enough, anyway).

How to make it as a ‘non-specialist’ founder,Andrea Hak,2021/05/27,"
What do you need to start a successful business? Common sense would say business smarts and of course the know-how to succeed in your industry. But what if you only have the former?
The rise of serial entrepreneurship has brought about the era of the non-specialist entrepreneur. These entrepreneurs are generalists who specialize in starting, operating, and scaling businesses and not in the ins and outs of the industry they’re looking to disrupt. 
You’ll find them across all industries, with the most lucrative being those still on the cusp of their technological revolution. If your aim is to build and scale a successful business, why would you enter the overcrowded world of dating apps or food delivery? It’s the (let’s admit it) ‘less sexy’ industries like manufacturing, construction, and real estate where the real potential for disruption and success lies. 
Agritech in particular is a great example of an industry that was lagging behind in terms of tech adoption but is now experiencing a boom, with entrepreneurs applying new technologies to solve the biggest challenges facing farmers. 
But can non-specialists actually be successful in industries they don’t fully understand? And, perhaps key to this question, how do they actually gain trust from customers who are experts in their field?
We spoke with three Agritech entrepreneurs from X-Europe‘s Deeptech accelerator program about why they chose this field, how they broke into the industry, and what it took to develop and scale a successful business as a non-specialist. 
Could Agritech be a gold rush sector for serial entrepreneurs?
The global population is set to reach almost ten billion by 2050. In order to feed a population of this size, we’ll need to produce 60% more food. 
The problem is, farming is also one of the most taxing activities on the planet, taking up 70% of freshwater resources and 38% of the world’s land surface. The conundrum we find ourselves in is the need to increase food production at a rapid rate, while also decreasing our impact on the environment. 
Investors are already pumping money into this fast growing industry. In 2019, the global Agritech market was valued at $17,442.7 million and is projected to reach $41,172.5 million by 2027.
According to estimates by McKinsey&Company, with the rise of frontier connectivity technologies like LPWAN, 5G, and LEO satellites, roughly 80% of the world’s rural areas will be connected by 2030. This means greater access to data for the farming industry and a realm of new digital tools. The endless possibilities that increased connectivity could bring has the potential to add an extra $500 billion to global gross domestic product.
All of these factors make the industry ripe for disruption. But what if your only farming experience comes from playing hours of FarmVille?
Are tech expertise and entrepreneurial smarts enough to break into a completely foreign industry?
Alban Pobla, CEO of Dilepix, is the perfect example of an entrepreneur who doesn’t want to limit himself to one field. Instead, he’s used his expertise in robotics to explore new possibilities across industries.
As an entrepreneur, I’ve always been involved in projects working to solve the world’s major problems. Now, as an ‘agripreneur’ I try to make industrial agriculture (which will feed ten billion people in 2050) sustainable and lucrative with the use of technology and innovative business models. 
Agriculture is a great playground for those, like me, who love computer vision, edge computing, robotics, artificial intelligence, big data analysis and remains one of the last industries to have not yet made its digital transformation. This sector is full of opportunities for those who know how to seize them.
And that’s exactly what he did with Dilepix. The company’s software solution combines computer vision, deep learning, and robotics to help agricultural businesses solve a wide range of challenges including detecting crop diseases and weeds, fighting off pest invasions, monitoring livestock, making machinery more precise and autonomous, and more. 

For those who believe specialists are the only ones with the know-how to break into an industry, Pobla and his team are proving them wrong. As he explained, their experience and knowledge in the latest technology and how to apply it to different markets has actually really helped the team see problems from a different perspective.
Having experience in other industries keeps us from having blinders on. We’re ready to reconsider all the assumptions of the agricultural industry, because technological advances allow today (or will allow tomorrow) solutions that were once impossible and long ruled out, when they now have their place. 
Finally, there are always good practices which are universal and which we do not hesitate to apply at Dilepix, in particular, in terms of marketing, communications, customer relations, open innovation with large distributors, etc.
He shared that the key to closing the knowledge gap when breaking into a new industry is to get out there and start talking. 
Before and since the creation of Dilepix, we have carried out many interviews (over a hundred!) with all the players in the agricultural value chain to understand their needs. We go out into the fields and farms and compare our proposals with the daily reality of our customers. We started with the early adopters who were interested in technology and ready to follow us. Then we gradually moved up to those who have a functional interest in our solution. 
We always give ourselves time to discuss and exchange again and again with our prospects and our customers!
Winning over trust with the experts
Even with all the latest cutting edge technology in the world, as an outsider, it must be difficult to convince farmers who’ve been working in the industry their whole lives to try new ways of doing things. How do you win over their trust?
Tamás Bodnár, CEO of Agroninja knows this struggle well. 
It’s a challenge, even if you’re in this business for ten years, because you don’t have a farm. If you don’t have a farm and you’re not a farmer, and you are even further if you’re a tech guy from thousands of kilometers away.
His company’s first product, beefie, is a user-friendly application that solves what some might call a very large problem in the cattle industry. Like paying taxes, weighing cattle is one of those necessary evils that takes time and causes stress for both the animal and the worker tasked with leading and keeping a stubborn steer on a scale. 
With beefie, farmers can simply take a photo of the cattle in question with their phone, without having to disturb them from their grazing. Within 20 seconds they’ll have an accurate reading of the animal’s weight. 

I think the most effective way to gain trust is to be humble and ask good questions. Even if you don’t know everything about the industry, knowing the right questions to ask the experts (your customers) is the most important thing. 
We never want to tell them how to do their daily work, we just try to show them how our application could help complete a task (which is really a pain) in a way that’s faster, not stressful for the cattle or the individual, and much more cost effective.
When it comes to converting that trust into higher volumes, Bodnár admitted that, in the Agritech industry, it’s difficult to grow by word of mouth. He explained that, even if a farmer is happy with your product, they’re unlikely to spread the word to other farmers in the area as they’re usually not as extroverted as your typical influencer.
The Agroninja team also tried connecting with national bodies like agricultural chambers, breeding associations, and agricultural ministries, but this didn’t have as big an impact as expected. 
Instead, the company’s (quite unexpected) breakthrough came from a small article in a Dutch agricultural magazine. Somewhere along the way it was picked up by Brazilian farmers, translated into Portuguese, and as Bodnár described, Brazilians soon ‘stormed’ their website. Now a lot of their customers and newsletter subscribers are based in Brazil. The jump from their much smaller Hungarian customer base to Brazil opened up a huge market for growth. 
You may be surprised to find there are a plethora of trade magazines and media for the agricultural industry, even drilling down to niche topics like cattle herding or poultry. A placement in one of these publications could just give you the reach and credibility you need. 
Convincing customers to take the first bite
If you thought convincing farmers to adopt new technology was hard, imagine trying to convince the wider public to add a pinch of grasshoppers to their daily diet.
Hargol FoodTech grows grasshoppers for human consumption with their main focus being in two sectors: 

 The ‘New Meat’ market – improving meat products and plant based meat products with a boost of protein, health and environmental benefits, and added functionality including natural colors, flavors, and the enhanced ability to bind water and fat. 
 Fuel for fitness buffs –  their research shows grasshoppers are superior to whey protein and provide better amino acid distribution to athletes. 

As CEO Dror Tamir explained: 
Seven years ago I became aware of the global protein challenge and started looking for solutions. I remembered a story my grandparents told me as a young boy in Kibbutz Ma’anit. In the 1950’s Israel suffered from food insecurity and locust swarms (grasshoppers) flying in from Africa and destroying crops. While the Kibbutz members tried to save the crops and scare the grasshoppers away, they saw Yemenite Jews coming to the fields to collect and eat them. 
I learned that grasshoppers are food for many people around the globe. They’re actually nature’s most efficient protein source.
Even for a completely different and unconventional niche like grasshopper farming, Tamir shared that the same tried and tested business rules still apply.
Like in any other sales process you need to understand the needs and pain of your customer. We did a lot of research into the pains of the meat industry, the fitness industry, and the benefits grasshoppers can provide. 
The first thing we learned was that it’s important to keep the message focused and simple. Customers’ attention nowadays is very short. The second was to prioritize the benefits and focus on one or two that matter most. 
The education process is long for this kind of product, so third was full collaboration with media and opinion leaders on social media to achieve maximum and long term exposure.
For those thinking about starting a business as a non-specialist, whether in Agritech or any other field, Tamir left us with the following tips:

 Learn, learn, and learn. Never stop learning.
 Build a founding team with experts in the fields you lack knowledge in, especially the ones that matter the most for your new business.

Finally, the most important piece of advice all three entrepreneurs shared was to listen to your customers. They’re the real experts, and if you gain their trust by showing you really want to build a product that works for them, you’ll get the key insights you need to build a successful business.

I bootstrapped my company to a $500M+ valuation — here are my top 5 learnings,Ross Andrew Paquette,2021/05/25,"
I’m a big advocate of bootstrapping a startup’s growth rather than taking on VC funding. It’s an approach I took from day one with my company and it undoubtedly contributed to our success. 
I want other startup founders to know that it’s possible to build a wildly successful SaaS business without VC funding, angel investors, or taking on shoulder-crushing traditional debt.
Those who have bootstrapped a startup previously will more than likely relate to the lessons I’m going to touch on, which I hope will inspire and help those who are looking to start their first business.
We didn’t use any top-secret growth hacks or have game-changing connections in the early days of Maropost. We started at zero and grew our user base and MRR entirely bootstrapped throughout the years.
Whether you have struck out in pursuit of funding or simply don’t want to give up equality and face possible dilution down the line, I hope my lessons inspire you to consider bootstrapping and take the entrepreneurial leap.
1. Focus on building a brand from day one
The only way you will differentiate your company from the other options available is to have a strong brand, from the name of your company to its messaging. We put a lot of thought into branding from the beginning.
It’s much harder to backtrack and try to establish a brand down the line if you realize you swung and missed. A company may offer a quality product or service, but a generic non-brandable name will leave them sitting dead in the water.
There is an element of trust associated with a strong brand name. With a SaaS, the name is extremely important. A strong brand name is short and unique, while also having unlimited branding potential. I felt “Maropost” checked all of the boxes.
2. Get your MVP to market quickly for valuable feedback
Many founders want to wait until their product is deemed “perfect” in their eyes before launching. This is the worst mistake you can make — it’s never going to be perfect. Get your MVP (minimum viable product) live ASAP, and get it in as many hands as possible.
The early feedback and input you receive will allow you to make a much better product that the masses will love. If you keep waiting for perfection and delaying, you will never launch. This is also a great way to get a feel for overall interest and set realistic early revenue goals.
I’m a perfectionist just like every entrepreneur, but I learned first-hand the importance of getting your product into the hands of users quickly provides you with invaluable feedback. This ultimately helps you to build a much better product.
To this day we continue to listen to our users and take their feedback seriously when developing new features. Listen to your users — they are your most valuable asset.
3. Make profitability a focus and know your numbers
Being self-funded forces you to know your numbers. Each month’s budget is determined by what you made the month prior. I quickly learned the importance of knowing our numbers and I believe it makes you a much more disciplined founder when you are not spending someone else’s funds.
When you are bootstrapped you have to generate revenue to stay above water — there are no other options. It’s sink or swim, and that pressure will force you to make running a profitable company a priority.
I would highly suggest that you re-invest every possible dollar back into your business. When you start out you will be running as lean as possible — we were in the same boat. Once we became more profitable we kept the same bootstrap mentality, re-investing into the business.
The difference down the road is that you now have other options — you can put more money towards content marketing, paid advertising, etc. — to fuel your customer acquisition growth.
Even when the flood gates open and your profitability increases, continue to run a tight ship budget-wise and use your money intelligently. The more focused you are on profitability, the more cash you can deploy into growth initiatives. This is how we were able to scale to the point we are at now.
4. Hire the best talent slow and fire fast when necessary
Your business is only as good as its employees. They represent your brand and they are ultimately the reason your business experiences success and growth. I made it a point to always hire the best talent for every position, from entry-level to executive.
Take your time during the search process. With so much technology available to aid your search for the best candidates there is never a shortage of applicants. I made it a point to be highly diligent, continuing to barrow down the candidates until I found the best person for the role.
Not every hire will be your best, either, and that is to be expected. Sometimes it’s a bad judge of character or you may have been rushed due to fast growth and the immediate need to fill a position.
If you have a bad hire fire them as quickly as possible. I’ve learned that people typically don’t change — the sooner you remove a problematic employee the better. Trust me; the damage will be far more severe if you keep a cancerous employee around.
5. Automate everything you can
I love automation, and I have found that it can be one of the most crucial aspects when it comes to scaling and growth. There are services, SaaS tools, and apps that can help you automate so many different parts of your business and its operations.
From automated payment and billing notifications to onboarding and feature emails, we have streamlined as much as possible. This frees up your team to focus on the most important tasks. 
This doesn’t mean that you should rely entirely on automated workflows — some parts of your business still need that human touch to satisfy the needs and wants of your customers.
Finding the perfect balance between automation and human interaction will vary greatly from company to company. It’s important to find the balance that works best for your business.

Even ‘dream jobs’ have their flaws: Why honesty is the best recruiting tool,The Conversation,2021/05/20,"
What happens when you land your dream job but it turns out to be anything but?
Friends, career consultants, and the media inundate us with a constant barrage of advice telling us to follow our dreams, find our bliss or pursue our passions in our professional lives. Yet this kind of advice is not always easily followed.
Even when it’s heeded, the advice can come with downsides, especially when it turns out that those aforementioned passions involve jobs with routine, day-to-day tasks that people are less than passionate about. In short, work is often hard work.

We’re told to follow our passions in our careers. But what happens when the job you’ve clamored for is mired in drudgery?
People land jobs in data science and artificial intelligence, for example, expecting to create brilliant algorithms that will solve big problems. But they often end up performing menial data collection and cleaning tasks. The excitement of working for a startup loses its luster with difficult and boring work often outside an employee’s primary areas of interest.
And not everyone promoted to the lauded ranks of management is thrilled to be there performing management tasks, or even see the job as a step up.
 
People romanticize working in the media, fashion, film, fine and performing arts, and other cultural industries, but the work often ends up being more drudgery than glamour. Any job, especially an entry-level position, has elements of drudgery.
‘Glossy work’ is lackluster
This gap between expectations and the day-to-day reality of jobs is a phenomenon we’ve labeled as “glossy work” in a recently published study.
For the study, we interviewed magazine fact-checkers who worked for high-status organizations in a glamorous industry while performing menial tasks every day. They experienced a kind of dissonance between their work and its setting.
As one fact-checker described it:
“Because you’re affiliated with the magazine, people think you’re a strange type of royalty no matter how you’re affiliated.”
We examined how this phenomenon affects them.
For employees, the glossy work dissonance can spur attempts to change the actual job, frustration, and a quick exit from the position. Glossy work also creates a dilemma about how to present the work and themselves to the world. How do they balance their simultaneous needs for self-enhancement and to be fully understood and authentic?
Glossing over mundane work
We find they do so by differentiating their descriptions of their jobs across different audiences. When talking to complete outsiders — people at social gatherings, for example — they focus on the more glamorous aspects: working in journalism and for glossy magazines.
For the high-status writers they collaborate with, they focus on their own expertise and other status markers. And to insiders, they present a more complete view of their work.
Presenting themselves differently depending on who they’re talking to can mean that anyone who is not a true insider at the company ends up with a partial or biased view of the work. The full nature of the work is often glossed over, and that’s a problem for those considering taking one of these jobs.
When they only hear about the gloss, prospective employees end up with false expectations that tend to fuel the cycle of disappointment.

If you’re only hearing about the glossy elements of a potential job opportunity, you’ll end up feeling disappointed.
Potential employees can get around this by doing more careful research on the true nature of the jobs they’re considering taking. They should ask questions about the position’s day-to-day requirements and consult a range of people who currently have the job or who have previously held it.
What employers can do
“Glossy work” also comes at a cost to employers as they try to manage worker frustration and staff turnover. They can stop this vicious cycle by providing realistic job previews. This doesn’t mean they should only show the negative side of work, but they should provide an honest balance of the glamorous and less glamorous aspects of the job.
Employers may also want to consider alternative ways of assembling tasks so that the less pleasant tasks are spread across employees and jobs.

Allowing employees to help craft their job descriptions and create new opportunities can be helpful.
They may also want to be open to employee efforts to craft and tweak their jobs and create new opportunities within their organizations.
Ultimately, however, performing many mundane tasks remains a reality in all jobs despite the promise that AI will eliminate more and more rote chores.
What’s more, hiring managers should exercise caution when listing “passion” as a job requirement. In an analysis of more than 200 interviews for a project on startup hiring, passion was a frequent subject of discussion. Hiring managers looked for it. Potential employees wanted to live their passion.
Yet none of the hiring managers who were looking for passion in their prospective employees could describe how they would assess passion in candidates, or why it was important for the specific job being filled. The risk here is that they hire people who are passionate and then provide work that either doesn’t match or douses that passion, creating a problematic situation for both employee and employer.

My team had a ‘no meeting week’ to ease Zoom fatigue — here’s how it went,TJ Leonard,2021/05/14,"
After one year of working from home, I knew my team needed a change. 
Judging by conversations I had with colleagues, family, and friends, it was becoming very clear that the new-to-remote workforce was on the fast track to hitting a collective wall.
 Generally, we try to keep our ears close to the ground when it comes to listening to employee feedback at Storyblocks so we can spot any mounting issues and nip them in the bud quickly. In the early days of the pandemic, this meant figuring out creative ways to maintain our company culture while working remotely. 
So we went all-in and enrolled in virtual cooking classes, collaborated to crack the code in a virtual escape room, and gathered employees based on shared interests outside of work with interest-based clubs like podcasts and book clubs. 
We also launched some of our newest business resource groups (BRGs) in an effort to unite employees within our workplace based on shared characteristics or life experiences as our team continues to grow and evolve.
But while these initiatives helped foster an increased sense of connection and belonging among employees, they did not address the percolating problem that many companies are up against now – employee burnout.
Enter: No Meeting Week
After surveying Storyblocks employees and doing some digging to find the spark that lit the match of employee burnout, we found that Zoom fatigue was a recurring theme driving burnout. 
When we looked at how much time Storyblocks employees were spending in meetings across all of our departments, we found that it ranged from around 40 to upwards of 80% of their workday, with certain teams that meet as a core function of their productivity (i.e. product and marketing teams) over-indexing on time in meetings in comparison to time in “deep work” phases. And while this percentage of meetings may have been similar to pre-pandemic, there was one main difference – meetings were now on video.
Zoom fatigue has become a common culprit of employee burnout throughout the pandemic. According to the Zoom Exhaustion and Fatigue Scale, created by Jeremy Bailenson, founding director of Stanford University’s Virtual Human Interaction Lab, there are five different types of fatigue associated with video calls: 

general (overall tiredness)
social (wanting to be alone)
emotional (being overwhelmed and “used up”)
visual (symptoms of stress on one’s eyes)
and finally, motivational (lacking the drive to start new activities).

Additionally, video calls contribute to the “always on” mentality that has resulted from working from home during the pandemic, which has made it difficult for many people to discern where work ends and home life/personal time begins. 
When doing research on employee burnout, we quickly found that this problem was something many companies are also up against. For example, to persuade people to take time off, Google has started offering a bonus vacation day for those who book time off. PwC has also started offering their US-based employees $250 for every full week of vacation booked, up to $1,000 a year. 
But while these programs are substantial and tackle the problem of employees not taking their PTO, we wanted to make sure whatever initiatives we put into place hit at the real root of our employees’ burnout. 
That’s why we decided to initiate a ‘No Meeting Week’ to enable heads down, uninterrupted work time that would help our employees recharge and catch up on larger projects.
What we found
Following No Meeting Week, we conducted an internal survey to get a sense of whether or not the initiative was successful at easing employee burnout, and I’m happy to say the feedback was overwhelmingly positive. 
In fact, nearly three-quarters of employees who participated in the survey said they had more time for their personal life throughout the week and nearly 90% of employees said they were more productive compared to a normal week. 
They also said they appreciated the added flexibility of not being tied to a strict meeting schedule, and felt like everyone they spoke with were in a noticeably better mood throughout the week. 
Other positive outcomes included: added flexibility, more consistent sleep patterns, slack traffic decreased, and more time for reflection and ad-hoc discussions. 
Interestingly, while it technically was No Meeting Week, many employees found that they collaborated much more in an organic fashion than they normally do throughout the week, and ad-hoc meetings felt more purposeful and organic. 
Last, but definitely not least, our employees across the board reported having a more positive attitude toward the work they were doing. That’s a big win in my book.

Keeping up the momentum
In order to keep up the positive momentum from No Meeting Week, we will be testing out a summer break in July, where all employees will be taking the same week off. 
I’m hoping this will enable employees to really disconnect and focus on personal time by reducing back-and-forth emails throughout the week. 
Additionally, we have reinforced the idea that going “camera-on” for meetings is optional, and we’ve encouraged all employees to “audit” their meetings to ensure that they are productive and actionable for all attendees.
While we are all still new to remote work, the solutions we’re uncovering to combat the issues that come with it are building the framework for a more positive work culture than we’ve seen in years past. 
Over the past year, our experience learning how to tackle these new workplace challenges will be an important skill for us as we move toward ironing out what the best hybrid model will look like for current employees and future generations.

3 big mistakes I’ve made in my career as a software engineer,.cult,2021/05/13,"
This article was originally published by Emma Bostian on .cult by Honeypot, a Berlin-based community platform for developers. For the latest updates, follow .cult by Honeypot on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin, and YouTube.
I vividly remember my first week as a Software Engineer at IBM. I was bright-eyed out of college and slightly egotistical.
“I deserve this job,” I thought, “Web development is easy; I’ll get promoted in no time!”
And then I made my first huge mistake: I forgot to test my code before merging it to master.
In college, I took one entry-level web development course, where they taught you that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript exist and you should use Bootstrap and PHP. Testing was never discussed and as a result I was embarrassingly unaware that just because my pull request was approved didn’t mean I could merge without second glance.
I promptly received an angry phone call from a Scottish senior developer reprimanding me for my lack of oversight. I had broken everyone’s development environment. We quickly rolled back to the previous version while I scowled in my office.
I never forgot to test my code from that day forward.
We all make mistakes; it’s part of the learning process. But making mistakes doesn’t have to be a bad thing as long as you learn from them.
Here are three of the biggest mistakes I made during my career. I hope you can learn from them, as I have, and grow as a developer and as a person.
1. Not asking questions
As a new hire, and even more so as a woman in a team full of men, I was nervous about asking questions for fear of sounding stupid.
I was afraid to ask questions which would expose my programming ignorance, and this greatly impeded my growth as a developer.
Once I built a strong rapport with my team members, I began asking more questions. I learned how to strike the balance of researching the answer and not wasting time looking on my own. And once I got over my fear of asking questions I learned more quickly.
Every developer starts from zero, and while we all learn at different speeds, we all have to go through the same process.
It is vital to ask questions if you don’t understand.
When you ask questions in-context, both you and your colleagues waste less time. If your question can be easily solved by a quick Google search, first take the time to do some high-level research. This will save your colleague the frustration of answering a question you could have found the answer for on your own, and it will save you the embarrassment of being told so (this happened to me at IBM and I will never forget it).
2. Assuming everyone communicates the same way I do
At IBM I worked with international colleagues, and now living in Germany as an American I work on a team with six different nationalities. And it wasn’t until a year of living abroad that I realized every culture has a different idea of what “good communication” means.
I had numerous miscommunications with my German manager as we would both walk away from a meeting with different ideas of what the next step was, and this led to frustration and inadvertent turmoil within the team.
Then I stumbled upon the book The Culture Map by Erin Meyer in the Frankfurt Airport and it changed my outlook on life.
Different cultures have different communication processes; some are high-context communicators and read in-between the lines (like people from Germany) while other cultures are low-context communicators and require explicit and redundant communication (like people from the United States).
It’s no wonder I had massive communication problems with my team and my manager; we were communicating differently!
From that day forward I vowed to learn more about communication and building solid professional relationships, and it has greatly improved team rapport.
Multi-cultural teams need low-context processes. All communication should be explicit, spelling out exactly who is responsible for which task, and backed-up in writing which is then distributed to the team through Slack or email.
Learning some of the cultural differences between you and your coworkers, as it relates to giving constructive criticism, communicating, even scheduling meetings, will greatly enhance your interpersonal relationships and your team dynamic.
3. Taking constructive criticism personally
Constructive criticism is important to grow as a developer and also as a human, yet to this day I struggle with taking constructive criticism personally.
When someone gives me constructive criticism, my first instinct is to interpret this as a reflection of my personal identity; it feels as though they’re attacking who I am.
In reality my colleagues are helping me by identifying the areas for improvement, and this is truly a gift. It demonstrates that they see potential for me to be successful, and they’re helping me reach that milestone.
Create a safe space to receive and give constructive criticism. It’s best to set a meeting to discuss this topic, where both parties know exactly what to expect, and to do it in private.
And when someone gives you a piece of constructive criticism that you don’t believe is true, don’t immediately get defensive and shut down. Take some time to process what they’ve just suggested and truly see whether their feedback holds some truth.
These are only a handful of mistakes I have made during my career, and I hope you can learn from them. You’re not expected to be a perfect employee and teammate, but having the ability to understand your flaws and learn from your mistakes will improve your job performance and set you on the road to success.

My startup tripled in size in 2020: Here’s what I learned,Thierry Schellenbach,2021/05/12,"
Many founders openly talk about the challenges and triumphs that come with expanding product offerings and adding customers. But adding colleagues — especially in a remote environment — comes with its own set of growing pains and valuable lessons. 
I experienced that first-hand last year when my team tripled in size. It wasn’t easy, but I learned great lessons that made me a better entrepreneur. So let me share what I discovered while scaling our team at a rate that none of us had anticipated.
First up: Context
When my team closed our $15 million Series A funding round last August, I wouldn’t have guessed that just six months later we would follow up with our $38 million Series B round. 
However, as a provider of enterprise-grade cloud components that enables software teams to add in-app chat and activity feeds to their products, maybe it shouldn’t have come as a surprise. Our rapid growth came as chat emerged as the dominant medium for day-to-day communications in our new virtual reality. 
So to sum up our growth: in 2020, we saw a 517% increase in revenue from our chat API product, while more than doubling our user base to support more than a billion end users. 
Our team size tripled from 31 to 93 employees, and the headcount continues to increase almost daily. Today, we employ 116 people across our offices in Boulder, Colo., Amsterdam, and remotely worldwide. 
A lot of people and a lot of challenges, here’s what I learned from it.
Take one step back, two steps forward  
One of the most pressing issues we faced as a team while expanding was a customer onboarding bottleneck. We prioritize supporting our customers with quick response times and thorough solutions, and this became increasingly difficult to maintain while simultaneously ramping up hiring. 
As Stream’s customer base grew, I found it presented a catch-22: there was a need to focus energy on onboarding new customers and ensuring customer satisfaction, but we needed the personnel resources to do so. 
Then to keep up with customer demand, our new team members had to hit the ground sprinting. While that might be an easy default when things are hectic, it wasn’t setting employees up for success.
That’s why my team and I took a step back to assess our processes, and ultimately, we temporarily shifted our focus to ensure we were properly hiring and training new employees. Of course, doing so required resources from existing team members, and as a result, some core competencies and initiatives had to be paused. 
For many founders and leaders, this might feel like a hard pill to swallow during a high-growth period, but I think it can definitely be worth it. It’s a short-term decline in speed that will allow you to pick up ten-fold in the long run. 
Support existing employees  
As the team grows, existing employees will naturally develop in their roles. Particularly, employees who were previously one-person departments may start managing teams for the first time. 
This was especially true for us because we often intentionally hire people who might be one level below the title, and we encourage them to grow at Stream. Snowflake CEO Frank Slootman writes about this concept in his book Tape Sucks, if you want to dive deeper into it.
While there is ample value in this hiring approach, I soon realized I needed to make sure new managers had the proper resources and felt supported in their accelerated growth. 
Over time, I became better at coaching managers to clearly communicate goals and check in regularly with their direct reports. I think it’s also smart to look for the tools that can help you at this point. For me, Lattice was the right to help us streamline this process and create organized accountability. 
I also discovered that as a founder of an early-stage startup, you’re directly leading people who do the work and execute. As the team expands, that leadership role evolves and becomes more indirect. 
So in order for your startup to successfully scale, it’s imperative that you and early employees trust incoming leadership hires to run their respective departments. This process can be hard because founders especially are used to having a hand in everything, but it’s necessary to relinquish some control and let others make decisions.
Evolve the culture
Lastly, the culture will evolve whether you want it to or not, and it’s essential to take an active role in shaping it. 
In the early days of a startup with a small team, you naturally develop close relationships with your co-workers as you’re working long hours in close proximity. As that team doubles, triples, and even quadruples, the dynamic will inevitably shift. This is where it’s key to step in with intention. 
Initially, my co-founder Tommaso Barbugli and I leaned on HR for help, focusing on the obvious things like benefits, perks, and fun team-building events. However, as the dust settled, we realized we needed to think bigger in terms of the culture we wanted to cultivate. 
We agreed that it’s important to us to make Stream a place where people can learn the skills they might need to pursue their own projects or startups in the future, as I believe employees feel most content when they are progressing and acquiring new abilities. 
To accomplish this, we’re starting to develop open resources such as dedicated Slack channels for learning about startups and certain coding languages, weekly technical training opportunities for employees outside the engineering department, and more. 
The lesson here is that during this liminal (and hectic) period, there’s actually ample opportunity to thoughtfully mold your company culture. A happy, healthy team is the best investment you can make as a founder to sustain your business for the long term. 
Scale with intention
Ultimately, the resounding lesson in scaling our organization can be best summarized as pause, assess, and move forward with intention. 
I know it can be tempting to continue at full speed when the momentum of growth really sets in, but a purposeful slowdown to address necessary issues can go a long way in achieving organizational goals. 
Moving quickly is a non-negotiable in the startup world, but that doesn’t mean you can’t also move purposefully.

Here’s what Freakonomics gets wrong about advertising,Michael Cross,2021/05/11,"
Freakonomics recently applied their formula of Pop Economics to put a challenge to the efficacy of advertising: “Does Advertising Actually Work?” where the hosts lay out a compelling narrative to suggest that advertising may have little uplift… but it’s just not that simple.
“Guess what? Advertising doesn’t work!” makes a great narrative hook for a podcast, but it’s not helpful if what you’re trying to do is measure advertising effectiveness. 
My concern here is that a lot of decision-makers believe Freakonomics’ general premise that advertising is “guilty until proven innocent.” However, anecdotes aren’t a substitute for a rigorous measurement strategy bespoke to a brand’s characteristics and conditions. 
Instead of trying to find “smoking guns” that highlight the inadequacy of advertising, the more productive path for a CEO or CMO is to understand the inadequacy of measuring advertising correctly.
How do I know? Over the last 20 years, I’ve measured advertising for hundreds of brands and witnessed the refinement of measurement to a point where advertisers can reliably predict business outcomes. 
So let’s do a point-by-point walkthrough of how to think about advertising measurement in a more productive, less knee-jerk way:
Freakonomics conclusion #1 — Teasing out the causal part of TV uplifts is a near-impossible task
I went back to this company and I said, ‘I’m really sorry to say, but with the data you have, with nothing like a randomized experiment, it’s just possible that the return on investment could be anywhere from zero to infinity.’
Freakonomics presumes here that academic studies have failed a number of times to understand the causal impact of ads on sales because there was no randomized experiment to examine. 
While randomized experiments are preferable when conducting research, they aren’t always achievable, especially in the case of advertising where countless variables must be accounted for. 
Evaluation techniques, such as Market Mix Modelling (or MMM) can pull apart all sales drivers without the need for prior tests to be set up.
Freakonomics conclusion #2 — You can’t disentangle seasonality and media uplifts
 So, of course there was a correlation between the TV advertising and store sales. But it’s not necessarily or even primarily because of the ads. It’s because the company knows when the big selling days are, and they target the ads around it.
Brands will indeed — and quite rightly — advertise during seasonal peaks. The podcast puts forward an endogeneity problem: brands that advertise over seasonal peaks are getting advertising uplift confused with seasonality (seasonal demand spikes that would have happened anyway) and “it’s impossible to disentangle” the two.
 Approaching this problem the wrong way can cost brands a great deal in mis-allocated spending. Seasonality and media uplift can indeed be disentangled by analyzing a longer time series of data. 
For example, analyzing three years of data builds up as much real-world behavior as possible to inform the measurement model, giving you three chances of isolating seasonal effects (e.g., 3x Christmas, 3x Easter, etc). 
Also, advertising when customers organically look for your product doesn’t have to be a bad thing. For some brands, seasonal peaks are the highest-ROI opportunity for advertising, so it makes the most financial sense to advertise over the highest possible baseline of demand.
Freakonomics conclusion #3 — Using randomized experiments to measure advertising uplifts in its entirety
So, one of the challenges with measuring the effects of advertising is that firms aren’t out there assigning their advertising randomly across geographies and across time periods.
Freakonomics presents randomized experiments — or A/B testing — as the best method to measure media uplifts. 
While I think A/B testing is great — it is after all one of the most common means of measuring uplifts — it has its shortfalls. It can miss the mark on advertising uplift as it:

May only measure the initial sales lift and doesn’t measure the long tail effect or memorized effect of advertising; and
Can miss local nuances. For example, a geographically split experiment may miss: different responsiveness to price by geographic area (DMA, postal code, etc), climate factors, store closures, local marketing, etc.

Market Mix Modelling considers the initial sales lift of the advertising, as well as measuring the short to medium-term impacts, sometimes lasting up to three years. These kinds of longer-term branding impacts can add around 250% on the initial uplift.
Freakonomics conclusion #4 — TV ads are unprofitable
We find that almost all brands seem to be over-advertising, and that they are earning a negative R.O.I. from advertising in an average week. And if they were to instead decide not to advertise in a given week, they would earn higher profits.
It’s put forward that TV is unprofitable, and the uplifts are underwhelming. Now to break it down, I’d say there are two things going here: one is the uplift, and the second is the way ROI is measured. 
Firstly, the initial uplift suggested by Freakonomics of between 1% and 10% rings about true, but this is true of a consumer packaged goods (CPG) brand, which is the use case the paper is derived from. 
Media uplifts for CPG are notoriously small, not because the media impacts are nominal, but because CPG brands tend to spend 10x their total media budgets on trade promotions (temporary price reductions, multibuys, etc.) and this dwarfs media uplifts. Outside of CPG, you can expect to see media uplifts anywhere between 5% and 40% of sales. 
Secondly, the ROI calculation is a bit squiffy — they are calculating the marginal ROI rather than the absolute ROI. Freakonomics puts it thusly: 
The vast majority of brands over-invest in advertising and could increase profits by reducing their advertising spending
This is a very different point to whether the advertising is paying back or not. It is simply saying the ROI will increase if the budget is reduced. It is not an absolute ROI. 
Increases in spending will tend to lead to lower ROI/efficiency, but not the absolute profit uplift. In my experience, 8 times out of 10 clients can increase their spend on media and enjoy higher absolute profits.
Advertising doesn’t always work — the key is being able to tell when
While entertaining, sensational anecdotes from Freakonomics aren’t helpful for brands and decision-makers when it comes to understanding ad effectiveness. The key is to measure and find out what works specifically for your brand.
In your personal life, I hope I haven’t diminished your enjoyment of Freakonomics. In your professional life though, I hope this has been useful input for the next time you are drawn into an “advertising doesn’t work” debate.

Why companies must be critical of workplace surveillance practices,The Conversation,2021/05/10,"
With so many more people working from home during the pandemic, employers have stepped up the extent to which they are monitoring them online. Not so many years ago, employees were having to adjust to having their work emails monitored; but that seems almost quaint compared to the digital surveillance we are seeing today.
Employers can use specialist software to track workers’ keystrokes, mouse movements, and the websites they visit. They can take screenshots of employees to check whether they are at their screens and looking attentive, or even use webcam monitoring software that measures things like eye movements, facial expressions, and body language. All this can be checked against a worker’s output to draw conclusions about their productivity.
Besides specialist software, managers can view statistics from their corporate private network to see who logged in and for what duration, and again cross-reference this to workers’ productivity data. In some organizations, staff who do not open work applications early in the morning could potentially be viewed as late for work or not productive enough.
Home-working has also raised the prospect of more informal staff monitoring. For example, if a worker would normally log in to meetings by turning on their video, but one day they are in a car or a new location, the employer might think they are not committed or focused enough.
This all raises questions about how such surveillance is affecting people’s work practices, privacy, and general wellbeing. Given that home-working looks set to extend beyond lockdown for many people, this is clearly a moment for some serious reflection.
The productivity dimension
Managers justify this kind of surveillance by claiming that it is good for productivity. Some workers even seem to agree with this – provided the monitoring is done by a peer and not a manager.
Many have signed up to an online service called Focusmate, for example, which matches anonymous strangers on “work dates” where they briefly say what they will be doing during the appointment and then they can rate one another’s approach to work at the end. The service aims to make workers more productive and to feel less lonely at work.
That said, home-working during the first UK lockdown in spring 2020 did not have a major effect on productivity. Workplace surveillance may even have held it back, given that it appears to have increased at the same time. Certainly, there is evidence that such techniques can make people feel vulnerable, afraid, and less creative. It can also reduce their job satisfaction and lower their morale.
Also bear in mind that this surveillance is taking place in someone’s home, which may make them feel particularly vulnerable. Some people have struggled with their mental health while working at home, and many have had to fit in other responsibilities such as caring for children and home-schooling.
Next steps
In view of all this, companies need to adopt an “ethics of care” approach to their workers, meaning they make a commitment to take care of them. They need to investigate their surveillance practices and analyze how exactly line managers use them to check up on workers.
While carrying out such an investigation, companies should recognize that some employees might be finding workplace surveillance more difficult than others. This will depend on to what extent they think it invades their privacy, and how they weigh the risks and benefits of sharing their data.
This is likely to be affected by things like their cultural background, gender, and the context in question. Those already struggling with home-working, perhaps because they have to care for children at the same time, are particularly likely to feel that this surveillance is making their lives even harder. Workers can therefore try and evade surveillance techniques – for example, by keeping an automatic mouse-moving application open to make sure they appear online all the time.

Companies should be ensuring from these investigations that employees are aware of what data is collected about them and how it’s used. They should hold open discussions with workers and unions on how these monitoring practices affect workers, and allow workers to have their say without threatening disciplinary action. If workers feel that their employers care about them as individuals, they will hopefully feel empowered and trusting towards them, and less likely to find workarounds or to react negatively.
Equally, it is important for regulators like the UK Information Commissioner to reflect on how surveillance in the workplace is changing. The UK code in this area broadly requires that any monitoring be fair to workers and that any adverse impacts – for example, on workers’ privacy, damage to trust, or demeaning workers – be mitigated. The rules may now need to be updated to reflect some of the latest forms of surveillance, and there is a role for researchers in looking into this as well.
Researchers have tended to look at workplace surveillance from the perspective of productivity where workers are viewed as resources, but we need to start thinking in terms of data justice. This has been described as “fairness in the way people are made visible, represented and treated as a result of their production of digital data”.
In a world where computers and smartphones are all around us, we need to negotiate our private spaces and our control over the data we produce online. Just like this has implications in our private lives for our relationship with Facebook or Google, the increases in workplace surveillance make it just as important at work.

Beat imposter syndrome by developing ‘true confidence’ as a software engineer,Dale Markowitz,2021/05/7,"
Let me start this post off by saying that impostor syndrome has already been covered profusely and at length, and there’s probably nothing new I can add to the discussion, so let me stop here, thanks for reading, and sorry for wasting your time.

Ahem. While there’s already tons of advice for overcoming impostor syndrome, I find it usually falls into one of two buckets:

YOU! An impostor?! No way! Just stop thinking that!
Fake it ‘til you make it. If you just keep acting confident, one day you will be.

The first angle is clearly useless, and the second, I’d argue, is neither possible nor advisable.
Hot take: you cannot successfully fake being confident. Not to say it wouldn’t be useful if you could. Research shows that when it comes to appearing competent, confidence is as (or more) persuasive than actual competence in getting people to think you know what you’re doing. Overconfidence can get you far in life. But the same studies show that it’s not enough to merely fake being confident. You have to actually believe it–you have to be “honestly overconfident.” In a fantastic piece for The Atlantic, Katty Kay and Claire Shipman write of their interview with the confidence researcher Cameron Anderson:
True overconfidence is not mere bluster. Anderson thinks the reason extremely confident people don’t alienate others is that they aren’t faking it. They genuinely believe they are good, and that self-belief is what comes across. Fake confidence, he told us, just doesn’t work in the same way. […] Most people can spot fake confidence from a mile away.
“Most people can spot fake confidence from a mile away.” It’s a result that’s borne out in the lab, and one I’ve validated in my own life tons of times.
If you write software for a living, then you likely spend your days interacting with people who argue with such monomaniacal vigor about optimal keyboard shortcuts you’d think they were defending their PhD theses. On top of that, if you are a woman, you probably also spend lots of time convincing people you really do know how to code. Combine these two and the fact that programming is actually hard and it’s no wonder so many of us feel like impostors. I first learned the name for this feeling in 2013, when I was a sophomore college and got my hands on Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg’s new book, Lean In. Thanks to that book, I (and so many others) started asking myself, “Is the problem that I’m an impostor, or that I have impostor syndrome?”
It would be hard for me to name a single female software engineer who doesn’t wonder this on the regular (surely many men do, too–but I find it’s rarer). But this is where things get complicated, because when you know you may be suffering from impostor syndrome, you feel the need to counteract it. You come to the conclusion that the queasy feeling in your gut is wrong–that the insecure part of you is delusional–and that you should no longer let your gut instinct guide your actions. Instead, you enable manual override, behaving in the way you think a confident person would. You start conversations by listing your credentials; you find every opportunity to name drop your alma mater; you post your every accolade on social media. (I’m guilty of all of these things.) It feels like bragging, but it’s hard to tell, because isn’t that what somebody with impostor syndrome would think?
But my take is that this sort of self-promotion rings hollow. Meanwhile, in the midst of our credential-dropping, we often fail to show confidence in situations that actually do sway people’s views of us. For example, I have a tendency to give an opinion and immediately caveat it with, “but I have no idea what I’m talking about,” and, “but you should definitely Google that.” And this type of back-talk absolutely does make me appear less competent.
In other words, when we force ourselves to ignore the “delusion” that is impostor syndrome, we end up behaving in ways that don’t feel very human–and don’t come off as genuine to other humans. Meanwhile, we fail to address the root of the problem.
So what’s the solution? For me, the answer has been to focus on acquiring “true confidence”–the type that my brain and my gut both agree I should have. I’ve done this neither by repeating to myself the daily affirmation “You are great at Python developer,” nor by going back to school for my PhD. But here’s what’s worked for me.
Calibrate yourself
There’s a famous Bob Thaves quote that says, of the dancer Fred Astaire:
Sure he was great, but don’t forget that Ginger Rogers did everything he did, backwards, and in high heels.
It may well be true that no matter how qualified you are, if you don’t come in the right package–if you’re not tall or male or confident or charismatic–that you have to work twice as hard for people to realize it. If they ever realize it.
But most of us don’t go from having two left feet to being Ginger Rogers overnight. We start our careers knowing nothing, struggle through the early years as newbies, and eventually learn enough to call ourselves experts. Yet we rarely know at any moment where we fall on that spectrum (besides, expertise is relative, isn’t it?).
Which says to me that all of us must secretly be thinking: “Some people who think they’re impostors actually are! How can I be sure I’m not one of them?”
So my first piece of advice is to try, if you can, to answer this question in some sort of objective way: how competent am I compared to my peers? This isn’t the type of question that’ll make it into the pages of any wellness-minded self-help book, but for me it’s been incredibly helpful (and not because I’m some amazing 10x programmer).
The analytics-crazed field of software development has tools for doing just this. One engineering manager I knew kept a dashboard that analyzed the code commits of all his team members and computed their relative productivity (I’m sure glad he wasn’t my manager). I’m not suggesting you use this Orwellian gauge as a measure of your self-worth, but if you have at least some way of objectively measuring your standing, you can better identify whether your insecurity comes from imagined or real performance differences. And this, particularly in the world of tech, is important, because non-objective measures abound.
You don’t need a college degree in Computer Science to be a successful coder, but taking the traditional university route did give me one irreplaceable perspective: seeing first hand the differences in the way I think about myself, versus the way my classmates–who would eventually become my coworkers–thought and talked about themselves.
Switching into Computer Science as a sophomore, I was already “behind.” Lots of my classmates had been coding since they were in utero. The field is vast, and I had no idea what people were talking about most of the time: Arch Linux? Lambda functions? emacs? Neural networks? And it wasn’t just the lingo that intimidated me. It was also that my classmates had such strong opinions! Why was it so important that I give up my Macbook Pro for a computer with an operating system that couldn’t hibernate or play audio? Why did I have to write code in a text editor with no graphical user interface that was built in the 70s? I had no idea, but I was convinced it was what legit programmers did.
“The thing you don’t realize,” my friend Raymond, a precocious coder two years above me, said, “is that they spend all this time arguing about things they don’t know anything about.” It took me three years of CS education to realize that so many of my classmates were, indeed, casually spewing bullshit, and there really wasn’t any good reason to write code in emacs. (#vim4life)
It’s often easier to become close friends with the classmates you’re pulling the same punishing all-nighters with than it is with your co-workers. And because of that, I saw this pattern play out time and again: a friend speaks at length and with authority about quantum computing, but on further interrogation reveals their entire background knowledge boils down to four Tweets. Their standards for how much they had to know about a topic in order to argue about it were much lower than mine. Which gave me the impression that was a lot further “behind” than I actually was.
The plural of anecdote is not data, but the data do support this “confidence gap” across gender lines six ways to Sunday: in the lab, women thought their performance on tests were worse than men did, even when their scores were the same. In one study, women applied for promotions only when they thought they met 100 percent of job qualifications; men applied when they met just 60. This phenomenon is one of the most repeatable results in psychology.
I’ll always remember applying for internships junior year when my then-boyfriend came to me distraught that he’d been rejected for a role as an Android developer.
“But Frank*,” I said, “you don’t know anything about Android development.”
To which he replied:
“And without this job, how will I ever learn?”
I’ve seen another common variant when my female coworkers are asked if they can complete a task. In one meeting, a project manager asked (the only other) female engineer on our team if she could build out a feature.
“Maybe? I don’t know… I’ve never worked on anything like that. I’ll have to ask my manager about it.”
I’ve never in my life heard a male coworker say anything like that. It’s not that my male coworkers claimed they could do everything. It’s just that they usually placed the blame elsewhere–on complicated software or incompetent coworkers–rather than on themselves. But more often, they’d just say yes, assuming that whatever they didn’t know they’d be able to learn on the job.
Unfortunately, I can’t give you an exact formula for learning how you stack up, but I will say the most useful “calibration exercise” I’ve ever done was becoming an interviewer. In my first job at OkCupid, I routinely reviewed resumes from applicants who listed such achievements as “trained and deployed neural networks at scale” or “built a compiler from scratch” but that, when fingers hit keyboards, couldn’t write a for loop to save their lives.
In other words, if you let your opinions of others be swayed by those who can talk the talk, it’s easy to feel that you’re further behind than you really are. In this way, finding a more concrete measure–whether its lines of code committed, performance reviews, or a candid conversation with your manager–can be useful. Maybe no one measure is perfect, but together they can paint a clearer picture.
Of course, at the end of this calibration exercise, you may learn something that you don’t like. Maybe that means you do need to spend time garnering experience or studying hard to level up your skills. No shame there. It’s an actionable insight. And, if you discover that you really are bad at something, despite hard work, that’s okay, too. I’ve never been happy in a job I didn’t feel that I was good at. But I have stayed in those roles longer than I should have because I spent so much time thinking I just had impostor syndrome. The right move for me has always been to pivot to something that suits my strengths better. Or, of course, you could simply say fuck the competition–you like the job you do and that’s all that matters.
Talk the talk
It’s important to calibrate your abilities against your peers not just so you know how “good” you are, but also so that you understand how your peers (who are sometimes your competition) are representing themselves. No, you don’t want to lie on your resume and say you’re C# expert when all you’ve written is “Hello, world.” But at the same time, if everyone on the job market is listing themselves as experienced C# developers with only a year of experience, shouldn’t you be using that as the same bar for yourself? In fact, if you don’t do this–if you hold yourself to a higher bar–you might be inadvertently misleading folks into thinking you’re less competent than you really are, because you’re using a different scale.

Overselling your abilities is unwise and feels “icky.” But when you really understand how people with your abilities represent themselves, you may find you speak with more confidence naturally, simply because you feel it’s honestly deserved.
And on the topic of talking the talk, here’s another tip: don’t unnecessarily undercut yourself. As stated, I would never advise someone to try to sound like they’re more knowledgeable than they are. But that doesn’t mean you should go out of your way to kill your credibility.
I’m guilty, often, of being so afraid of being “found out” that when I say something like,
“I have 8 years of experience with Python,”
I also tack on:
“But I don’t know anything about Flask or Django or how to author a pip package, and I don’t know the difference between Python 3 and Python 2, and I’ve never used the collections package, and sometimes when I laugh too hard, I pee myself a little bit.”
My fiancé once asked his dad for advice on asking out a girl who was “out of his league.” His father replied:
“Let her figure that out.”
For me and many of the women I’ve spoken to, we are so afraid of saying something that turns out to be wrong that we’re willing to massacre our credibility right up front to avoid that possibility. This is unnecessary. If you say something wrong, someone will look it up and correct you, or maybe they won’t. Big whoop. Just don’t try this on Twitter.
You’re smart even if you don’t know about Kubernetes
Maybe this is the most important tip of all.
For most of this post, I’ve suggested actions you can take to feel like less of an impostor – to change the way you think of yourself, and the way you present yourself to others. But of course, there’s a lot about the way people perceive you you simply cannot control, especially when bias is involved. As a woman in tech, I will always struggle to convince folks I’m competent, and their reactions will always make me feel less so. Plus, sexism aside, tech is filled with lots of jerks, and many more people who aren’t jerks, but that occasionally speak like them. I don’t know how to change that.
But I do think there’s value in recognizing when you’re talking to a jerk, so you don’t internalize this as a flaw in yourself. You cannot reasonably go up to Vint Cerf, the inverter of TCP/IP, and expect to have a debate about network protocols in which you don’t get totally schooled. But no matter how much or how little you know about a subject, you always deserve to be spoken to like a smart person. When I wonder if a coworker is talking down to me, I ask myself, “is this how that person would speak to me if I were Richard Feynman?” Because Richard Feynman doesn’t know about Kubernetes, but you’d never explain something to him like he were a hapless dummy.
Of course, when you identify you’re being talked down to, there’s not necessarily much you can do about it. But sometimes identifying the things you can’t change gives you more time to focus on the things you can.
But what do I know?
A very big thanks to Sara Robinson and Anu Srivastava, two of my wicked smart and thoughtful coworkers, for feedback on this post.

My treadmill desk makes me happier and more productive — here’s why,Stacie Taylor,2021/04/16,"
I love my home office chair — deeply. It feels like sitting in a hug.
Before 2020, I would only see it a few hours a day. The rest of the time, I’d work in co-working spaces and coffee shops, which I walk to. It kept me active.
The pandemic changed that — my chair became part of my body. I coded there, I had meetings there, I ate my meals there, I happy hour’d with friends there, and I watched Netflix there. I rocked my whiny kids there. I did everything in that chair, and my body started to feel it.
We all know that exercise plays an important role in our mental and physical well-being. As a car-less city-dweller, losing the ability to walk around and leave my tiny apartment when the world started to shut down weighed heavily on my mental and physical health. And, as a mom who now had more than one full-time job, I just didn’t have time to dedicate to exercise.
[Read: We spent a workday on a treadmill desk so you didn’t have to]
So I bought a treadmill for under my standing desk. I knew I needed something to get me moving, and I needed to be able to do it while momming, working, or hanging out with friends on Zoom. I needed to get my butt out of that comfy chair and get moving.
Look at my beauty!
It worked! I love this treadmill like one of my children, and I think you should buy one. Here’s why, and a few tips I have for setting up your own treadmill desk. Feel free to march in place while you read.
The benefits of a treadmill desk
So, why have a treadmill at my desk? I have a few reasons.

I can burn calories while I work. There aren’t enough hours in the day for me to work, parent, occasionally socialize, and work out. The treadmill desk lets me do two of those things at once, which makes me feel less guilty about all the Zoom happy hours.
I put less pressure on my back. Moving your legs can mean less pressure on your back than simply standing at your desk. Beware if you have existing joint pains, though — a yoga ball chair might be better in that case.
I feel better. You’ve heard it (and probably ignored it) so many times: exercise releases endorphins, which means you’ll feel happier. We all could use a boost these days, so don’t overlook the upside here.

There are more benefits, I’m sure, but wow do these ones stand out to me. It’s been life-changing.
When should you walk?
I don’t walk all day — I’m picky about it. Some tasks are better with walking, some aren’t. Here’s what works for me.

I walk during informational meetings. You know those meetings where you’re mostly listening, while occasionally sharing opinions? I walk during those ones, around 3.5 miles per hour.
I walk during simple tasks. Whether it’s planning my day or catching up on some reading, some tasks don’t require a lot of brainpower. That’s a perfect time to do some walking. I do around 2 miles per hour.
I walk during virtual dates with my friends. This sounds weird, but it’s wonderful — especially if your friends have treadmills too. Go whatever speed you want — it largely depends on if you’re drinking hot or cold beverages (I do not recommend sprinting with a latte).

This is going to vary for you, obviously, but the important thing is not to do it all day — you’ll get tired (and tired of it). I like to use it for less focus-necessary tasks: when it’s time to focus on coding for a while, I go back to my comfy chair. This might be different for you — maybe the treadmill will get you into focus mode, for example. You’ll have to define your own lines.
So gorgeous.
Tips for your new treadmill desk
When your treadmill arrives, and you start using it, there will be an adjustment period — there sure was for me. Here are some things I learned.

Warn your colleagues. You’re going to be walking during meetings, which will be jarring at first. Be ready to explain yourself (send them a link to this article, maybe?). Your coworkers might judge you a little, but that’s ok. They’re jealous and probably a little sad because, you know, lack of exercise.
Wear headphones. Your treadmill will be noisy. They just are. Make sure you’ve got good headphones, with noise-canceling, and that you wear them during the call. And mute yourself when you’re not talking.
Stay hydrated! Don’t overlook this one — drink water, constantly.
Mark your sweet spot. You’ll be pulling your treadmill out from under your desk quite often, and eventually you’ll figure out the exact place to put it. I recommend marking your floor with a little tape when you find that sweet spot. That way, you don’t have to constantly fuss with awkward or dizzying angles.
Take notes. Find your happy speeds and write them down, so you don’t have to experiment every time you start running.
Wear good shoes. I can’t overstate this: uncomfortable shoes are going to make this miserable. Wear something you’d wear for a long walk.
Get a portable treadmill. You need something that’s easy to tuck away when it’s time to sit again. You don’t want it to be a pain to roll out, or you’ll never use it. I slide mine under my desk. My partner tips his up on its side beside his desk. Find something that works for your setup.

I honestly love my treadmill desk — it makes every workday better. I hope you get one and also love it.

Chaos isn’t always a bad thing,Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten,2021/04/15,"
Boris is the wise ol’ CEO of TNW who writes a weekly column on everything about being an entrepreneur in tech — from managing stress to embracing awkwardness. You can get his musings straight to your inbox by signing up for his newsletter!
When it was time to pick a school for my youngest daughter, we visited a few to see which one would be a good fit. The first one was the most prestigious, and it showed. They were well prepared, all the information was readily available, and nothing was left to chance.
The second school we visited was utter chaos. The teacher was late, she was sweating, and her face was red because she was dealing with some kind of issue with a bunch of kids in the other classroom. I can imagine a lot of people would lose their patience when being met with such ‘unprofessional’ behavior — but I loved it.
It wasn’t just the chaos I liked, it was what was causing it.
I could see that her first priority was the students’ wellbeing. Everything she did and said reflected that. She didn’t produce a perfect video or booklet, and her presentation wasn’t even that well-rehearsed. But it was clear she cared and she was ready to drop everything to help students. That’s why we chose that school for our daughter (but I’m also just a big sucker for chaos).
[Read: What separates a good manager from a bad one? Bullshitting]
Over the next few years, I saw school newsletters going out late and important events not always being announced on time. There were basically a lot of little things that didn’t really go as planned, but the kids loved it because the big picture was all about them.
The school also reflected our own household. I remember duct-taping my daughter’s coat closed (I’m not great at sewing) while she was already late for school. I remember stuffing leftover sushi in a bag because I had forgotten to buy fresh bread.
Basically, I remember not remembering a lot of things — but I know our kids grew up in a household filled with love and attention.
It wasn’t maybe the cleanest or the most organized household, but it was very compatible with a school that also had the wellbeing of their kids as their first priority.
I thought about that school and our experience with it when I read this popular quote attributed to Germans when they were at war with the US:
“The reason the American Army does so well in wartime, is that war is chaos, and the American Army practices it on a daily basis.”
It’s both an insult and a compliment, and the ambivalence of that makes it interesting. I also relate to it in a personal way, as I find chaos often comfortable because I’m a deeply chaotic person.
When a lot is happening around me and structure seems to be missing, I’m both inspired and energized. I love finding patterns in things, and I somehow become relaxed when others are stressing out.
I also think a chaotic situation can be fertile ground for new ideas. When you envision an inspiring environment, my guess is it will be a space with lots of stimulants. Music, images, tools, colors, and all that jazz. Not a clean sterile room with white walls and nothing to interact with.
But… that’s me. It is also important to remember that your friends, children, or employees might have the opposite experience and need order and quietness to perform well.
The goal is to not enforce the wrong structure on your team. Find out who thrives in chaos and who needs order to perform well within your organization.

4 questions you’ll need to answer to win VC funding,Malcolm Thorne,2021/04/15,"
For many people, selling a business for $50 million is a win. But for venture capitalists, it’s a poor outcome. VC success is defined as achieving top quartile return status among your peers. In other words, go big or go home. 
At the same time, barriers to building software are falling exponentially. Many startups are lost in a sea of commoditization, running on other people’s platforms, integrations, go-to-market channels, and data management technologies. Many don’t have a lot of differentiation because their business is a collection of a whole bunch of other people’s stuff.
How do you go big in a world where the barriers to innovation can be so low? How do you hit a home run when the “how will you win” of your startup isn’t yet worked out? 
As a startup founder, you need to understand how you’ll build a sustainable competitive advantage and that everything you do needs to support the creation of that strategy.  
That’s strategy — and that’s also how VCs think about strategy. Here are some of the questions venture capitalists will ask you when judging value creation and whether or not to invest. 
How is your software generating data that can build a wall around your business?
A proprietary data pool creates value. Your core software shouldn’t just be helping your customers achieve a goal — it should also be generating data. 
For example, Rentable (full disclosure: this is a portfolio company) is an apartment listing company that helps apartment companies market their inventory online and enables a digitized buying experience for their customers. 
In that process, Rentable is able to capture info on consumer demand and behavior, like when people buy, how they buy, at what prices, and success rates. 
That’s a lot of data coming out of the back of their core piece of software, and that’s valuable market-specific information that can build a wall around a business. 
Can you build a unique set of analytics or tie more generic analytics to a unique legacy problem?
In my experience, the most valuable analytics come from really understanding customers’ pain points and building analytics into a workflow that is part of the ordinary course of business. When you combine a set of analytics and with a legacy business problem, you have a new opportunity to build best-of-breed capabilities for that particular problem, and “go big” in the process. 
Consider, for example, an inventory manager who uses your analytics to do their job better. Having information on how many units are in a marketplace, what units sell for, and at what realized prices is useful analytics? 
But if you can automate the inventory manager’s daily workflow by providing, automated daily recommendations on what units to buy, sell and reprice and then provide automated functions that execute those recommendations. You now have an automated workflow powered by analytics.
Can you connect this to a unique piece of hardware, such as an IoT device?
Can you pair your software with a device to create something proprietary? Such a pairing takes you out of the world of commoditized software by adding a unique differentiator. 
Let’s say you have software that helps urban planners and real estate developers by providing demographic and population growth information on certain geographies. It’s slick and has analytics, but it’s not a solution. 
What if you add a computer vision system that monitors vehicle and pedestrian traffic, analyzes vehicle and consumer behavior, and combine that with the demographic information, all wrapped into an algorithm to predict best use cases for buildings and transport? Then you have a real differentiator. 
With the explosion of cheap IoT devices and pervasive connectivity, there is a whole host of hardware devices that could be a real source of differentiation for your startup.
Can you build a two-sided network?
Airbnb and DoorDash are classic examples of two-sided networks: startups that serve both consumers and businesses, and build such large networks that the network itself becomes a competitive barrier to entry. Such businesses are frequently winner-take-all markets, and are highly risky and expensive to create.  
Simultaneously convincing both consumers and businesses to participate can be difficult and very expensive, but the rewards can be very large. Given the valuations the public markets have attributed to both Airbnb and DoorDash, they have proven that the risk was worth it for their early investors. 
Unlike with hardware, not all businesses are suited to two-sided networks, and they can be very difficult to scale. If yours is, however, the risk may pay off not just in terms of hitting it big, but in creating a unicorn — which all VCs are looking for. 
There’s a reason that VCs are searching for “unicorns” and not just your basic “good business idea.” To gain the attention of investors, startups need to find the unique qualities that differentiate them from every other good idea. That focus, differentiation, and competitive advantage will attract capital and, ultimately, will enable your company to survive the competitive threats.

3 reasons why I won’t hire you to join my tech startup,Sachin Raoul,2021/04/14,"
1. You want to work in tech, but not at our company
At a startup, the first 20-30 employees are fundamental to the culture and success of the entire enterprise. A startup’s journey is saturated with challenges and difficulties and the thing that’s going to get us through it is purpose. 
If you don’t connect with our purpose, or you don’t feel it, that’s fine — but that probably means this isn’t the job for you. 
It’s easy to spot when this isn’t there, mainly because it’s so easy to spot when it is. Some people are just so excited to join they can’t put it into words. You’ll hear phrases like, “I can’t even describe how perfect this is for me.”
We hear a lot about product-market fit and increasingly about product-founder fit. But there’s also product-employee fit. Do you and your skills and interests make sense for this product? Will your approach and passions fit with the team ethos? 
This is usually why technically amazing candidates are passed over. In the long term, it’s in everyone’s interest. If it’s not a role where you’ll care about the product, then not getting the job means you can pursue opportunities you truly care about. 
2. You’re a brilliant jerk
There are some people out there who are just brilliant. Throughout the interview process, you see some soft-skill red flags, but you want to hire them anyway because you really need their skills right now and their CV is just so good. 
After all, I’m building a team of geniuses, right? Wrong. 
No matter how brilliant you are, if you’re not able to self-reflect and display empathy, it will create issues for the wider team. Every startup is a team, you cannot do things in isolation. 
When a person can’t work collaboratively, their impact on morale is significant. They are, to use Ben Horowitz’s phrase, a brilliant jerk. 
If you’re a CEO, don’t fall into this trap, it’s not worth it. And, if you’re job seeking, don’t forget the vital importance of being a team player. 
3. You’re the right person with the wrong skills
You might find a company that you love and connect with. The role feels like the right fit and you submit an application with excitement. And it’s genuinely fantastic to receive these applications; full of enthusiasm and passion. But that doesn’t mean we can offer you the job. 
A startup requires specific talents at different times. The evolution of the company happens so rapidly, that the team requirements are constantly shifting. Especially in the early days of the company (let’s say, the first 3-5 years) there’s little room for generalists. 
A startup needs experienced people because you’re probably going to be the only person in the team with that skillset, so there’s no one to learn from. 
If you’re a data scientist, you might be the data scientist. You can’t go to someone to ask tricky data questions and if you’re unsure about anything, it’s hard to troubleshoot. You could be setting up an entire function within the business, at lightning speed, with little margin for error. 
If you don’t have that very specific skill set that is needed at that moment, no matter how passionate you are, we can’t hire you. But, I’d encourage anyone who’s fallen in love with a company to get in touch with the founders and tell them that you love what they’re building. 
It might not lead to a yes right now, but when the job does come up, you’ll be front of mind.

"The biggest tech trends of 2021, according to 3 founders",Andrea Hak,2021/04/13,"
2020 was a year of rapid adaptation. Companies quickly, at times haphazardly, pivoted as fast as possible to new digital solutions that would keep supply chains functioning, employees and teams connected, and products accessible to customers.
In most cases, companies found that this quick switch accelerated their rate of new tech adoption and experimentation. Plans on the backburner to ‘eventually’ see how blockchain, IoT, or AI could be leveraged were suddenly added to the list of starters. 
2021 will be a year of refinement. Companies are now wiser about what works and what doesn’t, and will yet again be experimenting with how they can use newly adopted tech to refine processes and innovate in ways not thought of before. 
Techleap.nl’s Rise Program is focused on providing fast-growing Dutch scaleups with the tools they need to take on the global market. We spoke with three of their cohorts to find out what new trends they see on the horizon this year.
Using tech to enhance digital relationships with customers

Online supermarket app, Crisp, started out on a mission to bring fresh products directly from producers to their users’ doors. Not only would ingredients be fresh, their bet was that the convenience and time-saving benefits that online shopping could bring would attract families who wanted to spend less time at the supermarket and more time with their loved ones. 
Of course, when social distancing concerns became a major factor in consumer behaviors, Crisp was already ahead of the game. As CFO Michiel Roodenburg explained to TNW, 
One of the most important tech trends we’re experiencing is an increased level of personalization in B2C. By leveraging the power of large data sets, more online retailers are able to create individualized shopping experiences.
This enhanced capability has allowed them to not only make the shopping experience faster and more convenient; it’s also helped them go beyond simply meeting customer expectations.
“Using data in a smart manner allows us to combine convenience with inspiration,” Roodenburg said. “Users want to buy their usual products as quickly as possible and we can help them by suggesting these. In addition, we offer a layer of inspiration with an offering that is new but equally relevant.
“For example, in our recipe section, our offering is automatically adjusted to make it more relevant. We’ve seen that this also increases the average order value, positively impacting the logistical cost ratio, which is very important in the online food business.”
This has also helped them streamline different aspects of the customer experience. 
“Tech enables our service team to effectively communicate with consumers. For example, by automatically categorizing questions or suggesting useful answers that the employee uses to send a richer answer.”
For companies that want to experiment with new strategies this year, Roodenburg suggests:
Focus on creating customer value as opposed to lowering costs. Improving your value proposition is, in my opinion, often more important. But it only works if the customer is truly the middle point of the organization. Technology does not make the distance with customers bigger; quite the opposite: it can help you become more intimate with the customer.
Easing the transition to the new normal with AI

Just like our shopping habits have changed, so have our work habits. While the quick switch to remote working was a struggle for many in the beginning, with over a year of Zoom meetings under our belts, some have now gotten used to the comforts of a home office, skipping the morning commute, and having extra time to spend with families. 
The question is when the time does come for everyone to go back to the office, will we actually want to go back to the normal nine to five? 
As Judith Huisman, co-Founder of Meetingselect, said, “Nothing can ever completely replace face-to-face meetings,” especially when it comes to team building, brainstorming, or branding activities.
Companies will therefore need to find the balance between in-person and more flexible work options. But this can also bring new opportunities for those willing to adopt new tech.
Meetingselect is at the crossroad between businesses and the hospitality industry, making it easier for organizations and enterprises to provide external meeting spaces, group bookings, and workplace solutions to their employees while helping hotels and venues attract more customers to their meeting spaces.
As Huisman explained, this requires a more strategic use of meeting data and AI-powered automation. 
The meetings industry is a $450 billion industry, yet only 10% of those meetings are booked online. Even though we’re used to booking hotel rooms or car rentals in a few clicks, meeting bookings still haven’t been embraced by 90% of the market. 
A couple of years ago people said, ‘why should I book a meeting online?’ Now no one wants to call and send emails anymore, they just want to search online and book it. That’s why you want to have an automated booking solution backed by Artificial Intelligence. 
We now have large hotel chains that have signed on to our software solution to make that happen. We’ve also developed a booking engine so that small venues or boutique hotels don’t have to invest in the technology themselves.
Looking to the future, when we can begin traveling again for work, Meetingselect is now working on a new feature that will help companies calculate “The Best Place to Meet” in terms of Total Travel Time, Total Travel Cost, and CO2/carbon footprint reduction, and ease the process of flexible workspace and co-working space bookings. 
Digitizing workplace knowledge and learning

One of the biggest challenges manufacturers have faced over this past year has been the breakdown and fragmentation of communication lines. With warehouses and other facilities working at limited capacity due to social distancing measures, supervision and guidance for workers has been limited. As Willemijn Schneyder, CEO of SwipeGuide explained, this experience revealed a serious gap:
Covid-19 has forced companies to fundamentally rethink their approach to building knowledge capital. But as many experts have noticed, it’s also accelerating an inevitable digital transformation within the industry. 
Manufacturers still struggle to capture something we call silent knowledge: the dos and don’ts of the job that live in the heads of long-time expert employees that simply never get recorded. Think about any process at your own job that’s not written down anywhere, it’s simply ‘how it’s done.’
As these employees retire or switch jobs, best practices and crucial operational knowledge is lost forever. Given the scale and tight tolerances of global manufacturing, the resulting errors and lost time can be catastrophic. If you develop the tools to capture this knowledge at scale, suddenly you’re able to improve and distribute it throughout your supply chain.
Not only is this a communication issue, it’s a safety issue. With the technology manufacturers are working with constantly evolving, workers need to be kept up to date with new operational procedures, safety measures, and potential hazards. Ironically, the learning process used to teach workers how to operate high-tech machinery is still low tech, with PDF-based instructions being the norm. 
Much like a CMS, Swipeguide’s platform allows users to create, drag and drop, edit, publish, update, and share instructions with their workforce in real-time. This also allows companies to capture data on these instructions including usage, scoring, and feedback from workers. Best of all, it’s available on or offline and can be easily adjusted to different language and device preferences by users ⁠— meaning workers can easily access instructions wherever they are. 
Schneyder believes this transition to digital workplace learning is just the beginning.
The best manufacturers are solving this problem and also thinking past the pandemic. Yes, the current situation has accelerated the process. But they’re laying the groundwork for future success by investing in digital solutions that will enhance productivity at scale for years to come.
For example, we’re really excited to see the development of something called the Workforce Digital Twin. This is the collection of expert knowledge, captured via apps, that’s stored in the cloud to be distributed among frontline workers. It’s an ever-improving and ever-expanding repository of your best knowledge that’s insulated from turnover, and simple enough to be customized for any person working on the factory floor.
We think of this as a now, near, future process. It’s a matter of taking today’s operational knowledge to build tomorrow’s digital twin, in order to build resilience and efficiency for the future.
Ready to step up your game, but don’t know where to start?
As Schneyder told TNW, “We would tell any company to look at their product and ask themselves: ‘how does our solution help connect people to the resources they need and make them more effective in a world dominated by remote work and new technology?’
“Once you’ve answered this, you can begin to position your product within any digital transformation at scale. We believe that when you focus on empowering the human elements first, the sky’s the limit.”

"
Here’s why you should quit,Justin Pot,2021/04/9,"
Quitters never prosper. Never give up. If at first, you don’t succeed, try, try again.
There are so many sayings with the same basic message: quitting is bad. This idea is instilled in kids, internalized by adults, and generally just considered common sense.
It’s also often wrong.
I once had a job that, in retrospect, I should have quit earlier. I stuck around two years longer than made sense, all because I thought giving up would be a personal failure on my part. That was wrong. When I finally left, I was happier, more productive, and better off.
I quit, and then I prospered.
Why did I keep doing a job that wasn’t working for so long—even when I had other options? Because of the prevailing cultural norm that quitting is bad. I felt like walking away would be a failure on my part, so I put off doing it.
This idea — that quitting is bad — deserves to be questioned.
The sunk cost fallacy is real
Let’s lower the stakes a little. My Zapier coworker Katie recently told me that she used to force herself to finish books she hated. That’s relatable. If you spent money on a book, then spent a bunch of time reading it, it feels like you have to finish it. Wouldn’t that time and money be wasted otherwise?
It sounds logical, but it isn’t. It’s an example of the sunk cost fallacy, a cognitive bias that causes us to commit to continuing to do something we’ve already invested in.
It’s easy to think that, by not finishing a book you started, you’re somehow losing all the time you put into the book so far. That’s not true: your time is already gone, regardless of how you spend it going forward. Finishing the book won’t retroactively justify the bad time you’ve had reading it so far — it just means you’ll have more of a bad time.
Ask yourself: is reading more of a book that you hate the best thing you could be spending your time on going forward? Because that’s what you can control. You can’t change how you spent time in the past, but you can decide what you want to do going forward. You could spend time reading something you actually enjoy but only if you quit reading the thing you hate.
It’s also not true that the time you spent reading the book was wasted if you stop reading. You learned something about the kinds of books you don’t like, which is a good thing to know. You also tried something new, which is valuable in and of itself. And you now have the opportunity to write a scathing review on Goodreads or make jokes with your friends about the terrible book you never finished. These results apply regardless of whether you finish the book.
Quit. You’ll be better off.
It’s also true in business
All of this same logic applies to work, or running a company. It’s easy if you’ve put many hours into a project or career path, to think that you should continue working on that indefinitely — even if it’s not working out. After all, quitting means admitting that something isn’t working, and that’s a really hard line to cross.
The thinking here is exactly the same: if you stop now, all of the time you spent on the project or opportunity is wasted. It’s way too easy for this mentality to lead to spinning your wheels on something that’s not working.
Cortney, executive assistant here at Zapier, told me she had to do this before finding her current profession:
I thought because I got a degree in marketing, and because my first few jobs were in marketing, that I had to stick with it, even though it was making me really unhappy. I quit, and I am much better for it now! Very happy and my current role is much more aligned with my interests and skill set.
In some cases, you can salvage a project if you put more time into it — and some books have twist endings that retroactively justify how hard the beginning was to read. But not every time.
I’m not going to pretend I can tell you how to know which situation you’re in, but it’s important to consider the possibility that quitting is the best option.
Sometimes you have to move on — and learn from it
I already threw out a bunch of cliches, so here’s another one: “The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.” Einstein never said this, but someone did, at some point, and people attribute it to Einstein because they think it’s smart.
There’s no sense in continuing to do something that’s not working for you, and quitting is the easiest way to not continue. Another Zapier colleague Breetel put it well in a message she sent me:
To quit means you have to honor your instincts and the desire for something else, but it also demands that you take a leap of faith. It requires you to trust yourself and the world enough to believe you will be ok without whatever membership, credential, activity, situation, or person you are walking away from.
This isn’t just true when it comes to reading books or doing your job. It’s true in every aspect of your life. Sometimes you’re going to put work into something — a hobby, say, or even a relationship — only to realize it’s not working. Knowing when to walk away is an essential life skill.
This isn’t to say that everyone reading this should quit their jobs if they don’t like them — there are good reasons to keep doing something that’s not perfect, or even far from ideal. But it’s too easy to keep on doing things that aren’t working, and our culture’s emphasis on not giving up only plays into this.
Keep this in mind, and maybe be a little less afraid of quitting in the future.

Waymo’s 7 principles of outcome-centered design are what your product needs,Lauren Schwendimann,2021/04/8,"
While the notion of invisible or boring design isn’t new — after all Dieter Rams’ 10th principle is: good design is as little design as possible — designing for simplicity still seems to be difficult. As designers and creative people, it’s easy to get caught up in the magic of making and the minutia of details. 
Making something simple is hard, and it takes discipline. Our goal as designers is to inspire feelings of satisfaction or delight by meeting a need or solving a problem. It shouldn’t be about keeping people’s attention. Instead, success should look like reducing anxiety or giving people a way of doing things they didn’t know was possible. Or, allowing people to do something faster, to feel more carefree, or to be more independent. 
Giving people less work and worry, and more joy and convenience is what makes your product memorable. And, making a memorable experience is what feeds us as designers. As such, we need to view our role as one that enables people to achieve those outcomes of increased fulfillment and satisfaction. 
Here are seven principles I work by to ensure design feels simple and helps people meet their goals. 
1. Get familiar with your customer’s mindset and motivation
If we’re designing to enable an outcome — more joy and less worry — then we must have a deep and rich understanding of what is and isn’t working for people. The trick is that your customer won’t tell you, “x needs to be easier,” or “I wish there was a better way to y.” 
It’s critical to develop empathy for our customers, and to be familiar with their mindset and motivations. Let’s take transportation for example. 
Why do different people prefer to drive their own car for some errands, but use a ride-hailing service or public transit for others? What if they have a toddler, if it’s late at night, or if they need to make a few stops? Talking to a variety of people about these kinds of questions will put you in their shoes. People consider their goals and circumstances before they use a product, and we need to know what those are so that we know how to make something easy for them.
2. Create focus by clarifying your purpose
Inspired by a deep empathy for our customers, in the thick of product definition and feature roadmaps, we often plan for more features to address problems or indulge cool new ideas. How can we make something simple when there are so many problems to solve? You don’t need to solve every problem for everyone. 
Find an area where you can specialize and have a significant impact. The Pareto principle, or 80/20 rule, applies in design and it’s been a guide through some of the trickiest decisions I’ve encountered. Basically, 80% of the time your customers are only doing 20% of what you offer. 
That’s why you design for the 80% scenario, which is only a handful of use cases. Make those sing. Clear the path for near-zero friction. Get those right. 
Of course, you should always address the 20%, or edge cases, with best practices so that you keep your customers’ trust. But don’t let the low-likelihood ‘what-if?’ compromise your chance to offer the best possible experience most of the time. 
3. Reduce noise with system-based design
A strong system is the foundation for consistent, simple design. Consistency is a hallmark of good design because it reduces complexity and builds trust. A design system leverages repeatable and familiar patterns for your audience, which removes guesswork and lets your product’s purpose shine through. 
You don’t need to invent a new way of interacting to be innovative and memorable. Invest in defining clear guidelines, setting your guardrails, and sticking to them so that your customer feels confident and focuses more on their goals than trying to make sense of the unfamiliar. 
If you are creating a way of interacting that’s new (heck, we do that sometimes!), then the need for a system is even stronger so that your customer can gain confidence and learn each time they use your product. 
4. Clue in to your customer’s context
Even with clear priorities and a strong system in place, it’s hard to make a robust product feel simple. Enter context — a designer’s best friend. Your goal as a designer is to clear the way for your user to realize their intention as easily as possible.
You will never be able to read their mind, but you can tune into their needs based on everything you know about them to cater their experience.
Are they a repeat user or is this their first time? Where are they in their larger journey? Did they finish what they were doing the last time they came? Will they do that again? What time of day is it? Are they late for something? With other people? What’s the weather like? 
Depending on your product, these kinds of questions might be relevant and can inform how you structure your customer’s journey to present a set of relevant options catered to their current mindset and moment. 
I like to offer three things they’ll likely want to do, rather than 20.  If they’re essential but not everyday features (like a permission setting), then consider tucking them away under a menu. 
Remember that you’d rather have your product do a handful of things really well, than a so-so job at many.
5. Put time on your side
You’re focused on the most critical use cases. You’ve got a strong system. You’re paying attention to your customers’ context and usage patterns. As needs emerge for more feedback and features, make sure you’re not forgetting the fourth dimension in experience or product design — time.
Leveraging the temporal is like the atomic level of context-sensitive design. You can address so many needs in a customer’s journey with just-in-time information, options, or feedback that responds to their smallest interactions. 
Think of auto-complete search suggestions that appear and disappear at the stroke of each letter. Or hint text in a form field. Options that reveal under your finger when you swipe an email in your inbox list, or rest your finger on a like button. 
These are all examples of temporal, context-sensitive features that respond to the user’s slightest interactions to make things feel easy and natural. By layering the options and suggestions in time, the design feels simple and intuitive. 
6. Leverage human senses and the current environment
Since so many products are digital, it’s easy to design only for a four-sided visual interface. Remember that your customer uses that screen in a big and messy world. They’re with people and usually doing other things while they’re using your product. 
If your product is screen-based, find opportunities to layer the experience using media like sound and haptics (vibration on a phone), and other interactions like voice or gesture. By using different media together, you provide some relief from one mode of interacting and minimize overloading the screen with everything you want to communicate. 
But make sure these are additive and don’t let your experience depend on them since some of your customers may have limited or no vision or hearing. For that reason, also ensure you design inclusively and follow a11y best practices. 
Think of yourself as the conductor and your product’s surfaces as the orchestra. Use them together in harmony, and remember that they work together to create an experience bigger than any one touchpoint. How can haptics in your app create subtle feedback to support your design system? How can audio help your customers read an environment or know when a transition is happening? 
7. Edit edit edit
Reduce your design to the most essential elements and words to create focus and calm for your customer.
Sometimes design doesn’t need words at all. But, when it does, it requires an investment in UX writing. Why? People don’t read. At best, they scan.
Every word needs to be right for the reader so you need to understand the words they use. Do people “launch” apps? Probably not. They might say “open” or “start” apps. Do people “enable” things? Chances are they simply turn them on. 
These differences matter. As designers, we live in a world with its own language that’s often pretty jargon-filled. So stay in touch with how everyday people speak and match your language. 
Try testing the reading level of initial drafts with Hemingway or Readable apps, then test proposed options with actual users. To help with scanning, messages also need to be presented in the appropriate hierarchy. 
Start with formatting and style best practices from existing guides like Google’s Material and Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines, but then document and develop your own. Establish, and record, what words work best for your product and experience so that language becomes consistent and follows repeatable patterns too.
The challenge of unlocking new possibilities for people in simple and human ways is what inspires me most about design. It’s hard to do, but it’s our job to create simple, delightful products that promise a better outcome than what came before. 
At Waymo, we’re building something that gets people where they want to go, safely and comfortably, while also requiring less of them on the journey. That new freedom is for riders to use as they please. They can talk and text on their phone, put on makeup, stare out the window, eat, even sleep! 
That’s the outcome my team and I aim to deliver — more time for yourself, more freedom to do as you please, more independence, and hopefully, more joy. And I use these seven principles to do it.

Future-proofing your business isn’t about tech — it’s about these 3 key elements,Michel Koopman,2021/04/7,"
2020 offered valuable lessons about how and why technology business leaders need to future-proof their business models — whether we liked it or not. The pandemic sent normal operations out the window and forced companies to take huge leaps forward in adopting and advancing new technology. 
Now, it’s time to harness the lessons learned from this pivotal year to create lasting changes to strategies and infrastructure.
During the pandemic, I worked closely with chief nursing officers and healthcare technologists to implement virtual care solutions. As hospitals scrambled to keep up with an unprecedented number of patients and medical staff tried to protect themselves and others from a virus we knew very little about, I watched leaders implement new solutions in a high-stakes environment. 
As I’ve observed, I’ve gleaned several lessons about how organizations can look forward and leverage technology to set themselves up for success in the future — whatever it might hold.
Here’s what you, as a technology business leader, need to know to create a truly future-proof business model:
1. Future-proofing doesn’t have to be complicated
The idea of future-proofing might sound intimidating to many because it’s wrapped in troubling notions about long-term commitments. Many leaders hear “future-proof” and envision committing to an entire suite of technology that they’ll have to keep around forever. They think they won’t be able to change the tech to accommodate new business needs, but that simply isn’t true.
There’s really no such thing as a future-proof piece of hardware or software. (Does anyone still own a PalmPilot?) All tech eventually becomes obsolete, which is one reason only about 30% of digital transformations are actually successful.
So what is future-proofing really? Future-proofing is not about adopting any specific piece of technology. It’s about creating an evergreen business model supported by infrastructure that will not need to be changed significantly as the technology advances.
Thankfully, the basis of a future-proof platform only has two requirements: power and a high-speed internet connection in every room. 
Once you have that, you don’t have to be stuck with any specific piece of tech forever. The software should be a service that can evolve, and the hardware shouldn’t be so expensive that it can’t be updated, upgraded, or replaced over time.
2. You’re subscribing to a strategy — not a piece of technology
When organizations set their sights on digital transformation, too often, they become fixated on point solutions rather than platforms or strategies. A point solution is a device; a platform has the ability to add on other components as necessary. This is where I find many organizations falter.
During the pandemic, for instance, I saw healthcare organizations using iPads for virtual care to minimize patient contact. While iPads work great as a stopgap measure, consumer technologies have limitations in a hospital setting.
FaceTime on an iPad is a point solution. What hospitals really need is a virtual-care strategy and a care delivery platform that addresses the entire continuum of healthcare. Deploying iPads is like installing a Ring doorbell when you really need a comprehensive, integrated security system.
If hospitals want virtual clinical services to be a permanent component of bedside care, they have to invest in strategies that drive permanent change. In addition to perfecting their virtual bedside care, they have to be the best place for their nurses to work, they must be the hospital of choice for patients, and all improvements must help them outperform their financial goals. Then they need the platform that best supports that strategy.
These concepts have direct parallels in the wider technology business space. Future-proofing efforts must make work more efficient for employees. The company must be an attractive home for top talent, and business innovations must help the company become more competitive.
3. Future-proofing business strategies must revolve around employee concerns
The two most important stakeholders in any organization are your employees and your customers — in that order. In a world of online reviews, it’s easy to become fixated on your customers and forget about your people. But if you take care of your employees, they will take care of your customers.
The situation in healthcare is a little different, of course. Nurses will take care of patients no matter what. I’ve seen that they will make the best of whatever tools they’re given to provide the highest possible level of care, but that doesn’t mean they’re immune to burnout or stress. No one is.
In a recent study, Gartner found that moderately stressed employees underperform by about 5%. This costs the average company tens of millions each year. In 2019, employees saw, on average, 12 changes in their day-to-day work. Now consider how many changes they saw in 2020 and the massive amount of stress essential workers experienced.
Change fatigue can create stress, so any future-proofing efforts should answer the question, “What’s in it for my employees?” Addressing their concerns goes a long way toward building trust and cohesion, which are two key factors in combating employee fatigue and paving the way for change.
The new way of doing things has to be better than the old way — for your employees and your customers. One trend I’m seeing in hospitals and tech companies is a move toward using a combination of in-person and virtual staff. This is effective because employees and customers are better off with a hybrid of physical and virtual services.
Now that more than a year has passed since the beginning of the pandemic, you’ve hopefully had a chance to catch your breath and reevaluate. This is the year when you take what you learned through hard times and use those lessons to create lasting change in your organization. 
At its core, future-proofing your business model means laying the groundwork for adaptability. It means improving operations for your employees and your customers — now and in the future.

Want to scale fast? Make developer productivity your top priority,Nicholas Mills,2021/04/6,"
One of the hardest processes for business leaders to control, encountered by every growing organization, is how to scale successfully. I’ve found this is even harder when scaling tech teams. Investing in the right places at the right time can be pivotal to the future of the business, as time and again these teams are the nucleus of value creation. 
I’ve heard it said — seen it attempted — that building larger teams is an easy fix, but for every order of magnitude increase, a new layer of management needs to be designed to operate the system. This becomes even more difficult if your team isn’t equipped with the right tech.
In my experience working with leading European tech companies, the most successful have flourished when their leaders do a resource balancing act. To support this, it is important that they empower their developers and engineering teams with both freedom to work in the best way for them, and well-suited tooling early in the lifecycle.
Building an effective team with a well-matched stack is the stuff of startup CEO dreams, but not all manage to achieve it. 
Productive developers make your dreams come true
The performance level of a software engineering team has become a key indicator of a company’s future success. It may sound obvious, but if you’re a startup founder or working for a startup that’s looking to scale confidently, having highly productive engineering teams goes a long way in bringing your products to market faster.
If you find you have more limited resources than you hoped for, being deliberate and efficient with funds and operations is key to drive that growth. Using your developers’ time in the most effective way possible is just as important as having the right product to begin with. 
For context, the cost of a developer minute is roughly $1.65, and the cost of a compute minute for automating an otherwise manual process is only around $0.006. Your developer efficiency can have a huge impact on the profitability.
Team structure and insights can be a vehicle for increased growth 
When you take a step back and consider how to facilitate positive communication by design you help contribute to your business’ growth environment. A lightbulb goes off when you realize that team size is an important factor in your operational efficiency. 
I’ve always found groups of between four and eight people are optimal, but when the number exceeds 10, it becomes challenging to communicate well enough on a weekly basis to get everything done on time.
So it’s crucial to empower your developers to make decisions and implement changes on their own, using timely platform data and insights — and that’s where the business leader makes their mark. 
When operating at scale, your empowered and efficient engineering team will be the difference between hitting a plateau in growth and reaching clear market leadership.
Make sure you scale effectively with the right tech
While empowering your teams with the right mindset is one part of the puzzle, doing the same with the tools they want to use to get the job done is the other. 
As a leader, a key part of building a positive environment for your engineers is enabling them to work in their own way so they are happy and productive. 
As the people on the front-line of the tech teams, they are equipped with the unique combination of business and technical information for what tool will work best for the job at hand. They often know what works better than you! This empowerment not only contributes to their output but also their talent retention and in attracting more top talent.
Working with technologies that scale well, rather than always adopting the newest up and coming solutions, provides the stability you want. With this, the tools can become a competitive differentiator and create success throughout the business.
Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), for example, is used to better understand the software development requirements and expected strain on the growing team. 
When scaling at speed, priorities can change daily, so having a clear view of what is required and being able to automate as much as possible can allow teams to be flexible in their approach and adapt to shifting demands.
As you grow, keep an eye on these factors, and look ahead to when strains may become fractures, and ensure your teams and your technologies will adapt before that time comes around.

Poll: Employees would rather make less money than go back to an office,Napier Lopez,2021/04/5,"
For many people, one of the few good things about this pandemic has been the ability to work from home. The past year has shown both employees and employers that many jobs can be done effectively from home.
In fact, the desire to keep work from home has been so strong that it appears a significant majority of people would rather turn down a $30,000 salary increase than lose the ability to work from home.
A poll posted on Blind, an anonymous forum for employees, asks:
Would you rather make $30k more switching to a new job that requires you to work in office or would you rather keep your current salary but wfh anywhere after covid?
It’s far from a scientific survey, but with over 3,000 votes so far, 64.3% say they would rather keep working from home, while 35.7% would opt for the extra cash.
A representative for Blind further elaborated with some specifics, such as that 71% of Airbnb, 81% of Lyft, 89% of Twitter, and 100% of Zillow employees would rather keep working from home.
A simple poll like this obviously misses some nuances, such as how much money the employees are making in the first place, or how often employees would have to go back to work. Because the question asks about switching jobs rather than, say, getting a raise at your current job, the results may be further skewed.
Still, this is not the only poll to suggest employees largely want more ability to work from home.
A survey run by the Harvard Business School Online and research firm City Square Associates polled nearly 1,500 professionals between March 2020 and March 2021 and found that “81% either don’t want to go back to the office or would prefer a hybrid schedule going forward.”
More specifically, 61 percent would like to be able to work 2-3 days from home, while 27% hoped to work remotely full time.
Only 18% of respondents wanted to go back to the office full-time. Curiously, parents with kids at home and married people were more likely to want to go back to work full time than singles.
As someone who’s been working from home for years before the pandemic, it’s hard to imagine going back to the office. Time is money, and the time wasted commuting is something that’s hard to put a price tag on.

"3 tips on how you, a founder, can become more adaptable",David Kolodny,2021/03/18,"
In entrepreneurship, nothing goes as expected. No amount of research and preparation can ensure that a business goes according to plan. This has never been truer than during the past year, as startups battle the impact of COVID-19 in addition to the ordinary challenges of launching a company.
At Wilbur Labs, my team and I recently surveyed 150 founders on why startups fail and found that 70% faced business failure at some point. Among those who attempted to pivot, 75% succeeded. Bob Dylan got it right when he sang about times of change: “you better start swimmin’ or you’ll sink like a stone.” Founders who are willing to adapt their plans have better odds of preventing business failure.
That’s why I believe that adaptability is the most important quality in a founder. It’s also a skill that anyone can develop and exercise. I’ve seen first-hand how three specific tactics can help any founder adapt effectively.
1. Reframe challenges as opportunities
Companies and their leaders are defined by how they respond to crises. When founders look back on their experience, the “war times” will stand out, not the days when everything went according to plan. 
For me, that helps put it all into perspective. Every challenge is a chance to define the company’s trajectory and often brings unforeseen opportunities — even in a pandemic.
A pandemic might seem like a hard time to start a company, unless we flip the script. Arguably, there have never been more problems that companies can help solve.
My team and I are working on more new companies than ever before and putting them through what we call the “COVID lens.” We map consumer behaviors years out, not just in the short term, and look for the opportunities created by new, growing challenges.
Spaces we looked at before the pandemic, like Medicare insurance, real estate, and education, each have new, unique challenges that are becoming larger opportunities as a result of COVID-19. Adaptable founders are more likely to look past the fog and spot opportunities like these.
2. Focus on what you can control
When plans break down, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by the decision of what to do next. While certain items fall beyond a founder’s control, there are always key areas they can control, including how to prioritize and triage the next steps. 
For that reason, there is nothing more tactically important than narrowing the focus to the most potentially impactful items and strategies.
When COVID-19 arrived last spring, my team went into protection mode of our people and portfolio. On the people side, we could ensure that our teams were as comfortable and productive as possible while working remotely. We gave everyone a $1,000 workstation stipend, and IT worked with them to plan and order the equipment they needed.
On the portfolio side, every company shifted attention to direct impact from COVID-19 or critical growth opportunities. We cleared out calendars and scheduled daily meetings with company leaders. We also threw out all annual OKRs and roadmaps. 
Existing KPIs and year-over-year metrics were no longer relevant, so we built new dashboards to track metrics that we could react to and control more effectively.
For example, the travel industry saw a 50% drop in international trips in January 2020 as COVID-19 spread in Asia and Europe. The US was clearly next. For our portfolio company VacationRenter, a vacation rental metasearch engine, the team began tracking cancelations and booking nuances such as “time to check-in” — the time between booking a trip and checking in for it — to better gauge customer behavior and anticipate cancellation or refund trends. 
By monitoring this new data, the team was able to quickly adjust product and marketing strategies, including rolling out flexible cancelation filters and expanding socially-distant travel options like RVs, all of which led to them driving over $1 billion in 2020 gross bookings.
3. Zoom out
In a few years from now, how likely is it that founders will be focused on the same issues they face today?
Sometimes, founders confronting significant challenges get trapped in short-term catastrophizing. Their problems feel eternal and unsolvable rather than temporary and manageable. 
By taking a broader perspective, we can give ourselves the openness and confidence to adapt. We can gain enough perspective to change one thing at a time rather than change 100 things at once, chased by anxiety and uncertainty.
When I speak to potential founders, one question I always like to ask is if they are committed to working on the company for 5+ years. In truth, that’s not much time, and most great companies take much longer to build. 
When you have a long-term vision instead of a six-month plan, rough situations feel less threatening and more navigable; the pandemic — and whatever disruption arrives next — looks like a bump in the road instead of a collapsed bridge.
My co-founder Phil and I talk about a 50-year vision for Wilbur Labs. By thinking and planning for the long-term, it’s infinitely easier to reframe challenges as opportunities and focus on what you can control. You can make steady progress without reacting disproportionately to the inevitable bumps along the way.
The only guarantee is needing to adapt
Challenges will continue to confront every founder, and adaptability will separate lasting companies from the pack. Founders who frame opportunities as challenges, focus on what they can control, and zoom out will have an edge. 
Whatever challenge your startup faces, adaptability will improve the odds of survival.

"To raise funds, or not to raise funds? That is the question",Vadim Rogovskiy,2021/03/17,"
Stats from Crunchbase show that more than 1,900 seed and series A investment rounds happened in June–August 2020, despite it being the peak of the coronavirus. Even a pandemic couldn’t discourage entrepreneurs from seeking capital to fund their dreams.
I think it’d be fair to say that investors have been more cautious than usual as markets have softened globally as a result of COVID-19. Entrepreneurs should be able to seek the money they need to ensure the success of their business. However, many of them have trouble deciding whether it’d be a good idea in the first place…
Dealing with VCs can sometimes feel like you are embarking on a treacherous journey because you may be at a disadvantage when it comes to negotiating a good deal. However, seasoned serial entrepreneurs will tell you that it is possible to get capital as and when you need it, without sacrificing your future options. You should know precisely what you are in for before you step into the fundraising process. 
Having run several companies, worked as an investor, and raised funds from prominent investors, such as Boost VC and Natalia Vodianova, I’m often asked whether it’s a good idea for budding entrepreneurs to look into VC funding.
As someone who understands the ins and outs of venture capital, I can tell you that each company has its own set of circumstances. So, if you are asking whether your business should or shouldn’t raise capital, I won’t be able to give you a yes or no answer. Instead, I recommend the following simple and practical framework to figure out what’s right for you.  
Your appetite for risk
Are you a low-risk/low-reward entrepreneur who wants to grow one company for 20 years? Or do you consider yourself a high risk/high reward entrepreneur who prefers to develop 4 different companies for 5 years on average in a fast-growth mode?
If you chose the first option, the answer is simple — you probably won’t need venture capital investments. You already have enough time and patience to take the company to your target profit/valuation with available resources. Who knows, you may just be able to make it right around time for your retirement!
But if you choose the second option, how long can you keep your focus on one company before switching your attention to other projects? According to my observations, it usually takes 3-7 years for entrepreneurs to move from one company to the next. If that’s your case, you’ll need funding to propel your business to success.
Your financial targets
Are you aiming to have full financial freedom as quickly as possible, or do you want to focus on short-term investments and gradually make your way up? 
If you want to be financially independent within 5-10 years, you will most likely need venture capital investment. But if you are willing to wait 20 years or more — then keep at it because you can do it without the help of VC. But you should make yourself comfortable because it is going to be a long wait!
It’s interesting to note here that there were 273 mega-rounds, i.e., fundraising of $100 million and more for tech businesses last year. So why not stake your claim in these mega-rounds that are creating more startup unicorns with bigger valuations than ever before? That could’ve been you!
Your market growth rate 
It’s essential to know your market’s YoY (year over year) growth rate. These numbers will come in handy when assessing the company’s performance and estimate the future growth prospects, ultimately helping you to make investment decisions. 
At the same time, you must also figure out how quickly this YoY can be commoditized and if there is a risk of competitors taking a share of your growth. Also, how fast are the multipliers growing, if the EBITDA is growing or declining and how external factors like a pandemic might affect it.
It is essential to know the answers to all of these questions to understand the opportunities available to you. This way, you’ll know when and how much capital you need to raise to make the most of your situation.
Profitability or breaking even
Don’t worry about either of these things just yet. The fact of the matter is that profits can be the enemy of success for a startup. This mentality can cause startups to lose the growth rate momentum and market share. 
Founders often think that getting to the break-even point validates their business model. The reality is that they made thousands of times less than what they could have if they had made it to a liquidity event (exit/IPO) without the focus on profitability.
Aiming for profitability makes you complacent and less willing to take a risk. In fact, I firmly believe that you should reconsider working with investors who put too much emphasis on breaking even.
Why does this happen? Let’s start with the basics. A startup is a team of like-minded people who are after maximum capitalization (CAPITALIZATION, not profit). Consequently, any delay in this path jeopardizes the existence of the startup as a whole. 
Only an inexperienced investor will bug you with the question, “So, when is break-even?”
Of course, the focus on capitalization growth, by all means, implies healthy unit economics, which means that the company will be able to make a profit when it becomes the leader of its market, with ARR from $100 million.
It’s very rare, but there are exceptions to this rule. For example, when a SaaS grows at the specified rate, increases capitalization, and also manages to get a positive EBITDA, all at the same time. But I have hardly seen this happen. 
In conclusion
Venture capital can wait, as made evident by the fact that in 2019, the median age of companies raising funds was 2.9 years. 
Raising funds isn’t easy, but examining and analyzing the above points can help entrepreneurs make sound financial decisions on when to approach investors and how much to ask for. Also, look into alternate ways of raising money, such as debt financing or crowdfunding. 
Finally, encourage your team to set goals that can help minimize risk and evaluate reward potentials. And use this guide for the practical insights it offers about ways to improve your business and financial standing.

My website blunder cost me $1 million — here’s how your startup can avoid it,Sagi Gidali,2021/03/16,"
After months of hard work spearheading a total transformation of my company’s website, and what I hoped would also be a transformation in conversions and sales, it was February 2017 when I sat down in front of my laptop and realized that somewhere, we had made a huge mistake.
The previous company I co-founded with Amit Bareket, SaferVPN, had recently brought together the whole team and invested a significant amount to create our new website. This was intentionally on the heels of App Store approval, but more specifically Apple’s approval of our company’s more unique security features.
In the end, the fact that our product was superior wouldn’t matter much. A transformation in sales did come to pass, just as I hoped for, but not in the way I imagined… 
The steep opportunity cost of $1 million in lost sales and ignored leads were the result of our efforts, and it was also a slow and painful lesson on preparation and organization that we quickly and repeatedly implemented since then. 
While we stumbled initially, after we got back on our feet we were justified with a rise in organic traffic that wouldn’t have been possible before. But for a few fleeting moments, as I stared at that laptop screen nearly four years ago and struggled to understand why progress had slowed to a trickle, it seemed like our hastiness and ambition might have cost us everything. 
The $1 million mistake could have been more expensive, but it also could have been avoided. Here’s how to see it coming, when it comes for you. 
Ramping up for success
After three years of building it, SaferVPN was well-positioned for success by the fall of 2016. When the product – specially designed to protect users against online identity theft and public internet exposure started flying off App Store shelves – we knew we were on the right track for explosive growth. But in order to meet the demand we were generating, a new website was the highest priority. 
The entire strategy of this project revolved around targeting new keywords on Google that were important to our company’s advancement. We hired new employees. We uploaded new resources. And we also made changes to the website’s stack, which was created by pure code. 
At the same time, we were designing and writing 120 new pages for the website, forcing us to delegate extra time for maintenance, development, and updating. 
The race for new customers was moving at a breakneck pace, and we were confident we could convert interested audiences with a fresh new site that was built from the ground up. 
Within a single day, our team replaced all 120 webpages and our shiny site was live and ready to convert. The CTAs were convincing, the funnels were airtight, and the product was ready to deliver. 
We avoided the messy, prolonged transitions that founders hate, and seemed on the path to success. I couldn’t have ever anticipated the situation I’d be in just a couple of months later.
A quick reckoning
There was nothing wrong with the site initially, and everything seemed to be chugging along well, but clues started to pile up. Our conversions were growing more slowly than expected, and problems with the pricing page keyed us into the idea that some potential customers might be flying under our radar. 
Once Amit and I had a chance to assess our position and do a preliminary audit, it became clear the launch of the new site wasn’t orchestrated to the level required, with problems like missing elements in the pricing page, and bugs with certain browsers going untested, resulting in a loss of conversions and revenue. 
Our biggest mistake, simply, was that we didn’t catch that the purchase process wasn’t quality assured from every angle at stage one. 
The technical issue was that the site was not working on all operating systems and browsers equally, and because we had neglected simple checks, only 20% of traffic was getting through the funnel as intended. 
Another miscue we discovered related to our infrastructure. When we were launching SaferVPN we wanted to do it quickly, and a PHP stack was the fastest way with a legacy system. 
We didn’t want to put the website on a CMS or other advanced technology because we would have to surrender some control, which we weren’t ready to do at the time. Now that we look back, that urge to exert total control over the entire spectrum of corporate resources was a huge mistake. 
Even though we pursued proprietary and in-house solutions several years later with great success, in these early stages we were essentially building on an untested foundation that couldn’t support agility, efficiency, or easy maintenance. 
Before the new site launched, we were averaging 80-100 new customers per day. That proved unsustainable after our poor launch, and the recovery and eclipse of our initial conversion benchmarks took longer than we thought we’d be able to remain in business.
 A brutal eight long months of fixing pages, processes, and confidence in order to realize the more than 400% organic growth we can now claim.
A not quite obituary
To regain that traction and climb out from the crater we had created after our massive site hit Google like some digital asteroid, we had to make an extreme effort to implement processes that should have been there months ago, like proper QA, deliberate and careful installation of new website pages, and the implementation of a CMS. And all of this had to be done alongside everything else we had to deal with on normal business days. 
Thankfully, we can say that we survived this period where our sales funnel was literally decimated, repaid our tech debt, and climbed out stronger than ever.
This year we launched our very own internal CMS, which has allowed my current company, Perimeter 81, to accelerate the delivery of pages, reduce the load on the dev team, and give the marketing team impressive new capabilities for directly driving success. 
We also hired a QA team and we don’t launch any pages without the proper QA review. This has allowed us to pivot around our original mistake and has resulted in larger projects succeeding at scale.
By their nature, startups are able to move fast. That, however, doesn’t mean they always should. It can be tempting to move quickly in the race for revenue. We learned that when you want to build something great, you must start with a great blueprint — a blueprint that you continually examine and adjust as it comes to life. 
The lesson learned for founders is something that seems obvious on the surface but can be difficult to avoid in practice. Do things gradually, build from an organized place, and know that every interaction and intention present across your product has the ability to make or break the customer experience, from website to platform, payments to UTMs. 
Advice to be first to the App Store or to beta test your product “live” in the marketplace is true to some extent, but clichés lack practicality, and we learned this the hard way.

When should you kill a product? 4 lessons from GitLab’s subscription change,Tien Tzuo,2021/03/15,"
How do you know when it’s time to kill a product? It’s certainly not a decision to take lightly.
In 2011, Netflix tried to steer customers away from mailed DVDs and dropped a 60% price increase in the midst of a recession. That year, the company lost 800,000 customers, its stock price tanked almost 80%, and their management team got turned into a Saturday Night Live sketch. 

Let’s use Netflix’s move as an example of what not to do. But what should we do then?
A decade after the Netflix debacle comes an excellent example of smart product editing from GitLab, a hugely popular developer platform that is growing like crazy. 
GitLab fascinates me with their extreme transparency, even as they prepare to go public. But what they’re doing on the product side interests me even more — and should serve as a case study for the rest of us. 
Here’s what I think their secret boils down to: less is more.
Research from the Subscribed Institute in collaboration with McKinsey & Company backs this claim up: revenues of higher-growth companies are typically concentrated in a more highly curated set of products. 
Earlier this year, GitLab got rid of a paid starter offering, trimming its product catalog from four subscription tiers to three: Free, Premium, and Ultimate. 
Why? I suspected it was because too many of their subscribers were housed in the starter tier, causing a customer/product mismatch that was costing GitLab money. So I reached out to Xiaohe Li, principal pricing manager at GitLab and she was kind enough to get back to me. 
My suspicions were confirmed. Here’s what Xiaohe told me: 
The Starter/Bronze tier was originally designed for a single team and did not have enterprise readiness features or support. However, we had some larger customers on the tier who weren’t seeing the value that they really needed. One of our more sophisticated customers told me directly that everyone should get on Premium at minimum.
It was a smart move. Sure, the bronze plan only costs subscribers $4 a month, but that’s exactly the point. If you want to run a successful subscription business, you should be putting real resources and investments into all of your offerings, not just some of them. As the old saying goes: feed it or kill it. 
But how GitLab went about making the pricing change is where the masterclass starts. Here are four key lessons that I took away from their decision, and you should too:
1. Be generous in your transition offer to help bridge change
Not only can GitLab customers on the canceled plan choose to remain on the same tier until the end of their subscription period, but they can also renew at the current price for one additional year or upgrade at a significant discount. 
2. Avoid pushing upsells
GitLab actually encouraged users of the canceled plan to investigate their free plan! This is a much better way of converting paid customers because it asks users to actually re-evaluate how they use the product, rather than just making a blind pitch to pay more. 
3. Listen to your customers
As they explained in this excellent video, GitLab solicited lots of feedback (on a confidential basis) from customers and internal team members alike before the launch. GitLab then invited its customers to offer feedback in a special section of their community forum on launch day. 
4. Move towards pricing simplicity, not away from it
GitLab’s new pricing page is simple, intuitive, and does an excellent job of communicating value.
And all of this brings me back to my original argument: less is more.
"
Zoom is crazy successful — but did it forget its brand?,Nick Pringle,2021/03/12,"
“Buy Zoom.” That’s what a good friend of mine told me he’d instructed his investment broker to do last March. I was impressed and irked. 
Why had I lacked the foresight and why had he not tipped me off? 12 months later, his monetary investment is probably equal to the number of hours I’ve spent on the video conference platform. My ROI? A stronger contact lens prescription, his… well, best not think about it.
Zoom is the ultimate overnight success, a victor of circumstance. Imagine Facebook’s 2006-08 growth charts, then concertina them into a single week. Friday, March 20th, 2020: a handful of us had Zoom’d. Friday, March 27th: hands up who hadn’t? 
This accelerated awareness is the stuff of an entrepreneur’s dreams, and it’s hard to imagine it will happen again. The circumstances are chance. 
But with product ubiquity and a billion-dollar valuation around the corner, has Zoom really got anything to worry about? Yes, I would argue. And it comes down to brand.
To control, or not to control?

Here’s a thing, Zoom is now a verb. I’ll wager Miriam-Webster’s will rubber-stamp it in their annual update. Entering the dictionary is a kind of marketing erotica: brand managers breathily utter names like Hoover, Biro, or Google in conference rooms around the world. 
But entering the vernacular is dangerous, particularly if you don’t own the narrative that accompanies it. 
For Zoom, the phrasing is mostly pejorative; zoom fatigue, zoom hell, back-to-back Zooms. The platform is becoming the scapegoat for our dysfunctional home life; for boundaries being crossed and toilet breaks lost. 
Brand building is about controlling the narrative. Unfortunately, when a business explodes onto the scene without one, it can be hard to rewrite the one it’s handed. But why does it matter? 
Simply put, it makes Zoom vulnerable to a new, more empathetic alternative. Most established utility companies know how hard it is to retain consumers now adept at switching with just a few clicks.
Digital startups that undergo rapid growth often overlook brand narrative. I’d go as far as saying some roll their eyes at the importance of it — believing ‘if the product is good enough, it’ll market itself’. 
I’ll concede this might be true, up to a point. Disruptors also get disrupted, and without a solid brand narrative, it can get ugly — just ask Facebook or WeWork. 
If your product is your brand, there’s little defense when a storm rolls in. And as sure as nature, it will. It might be an economic downturn, regulation, a rogue exec, or just a better product. Whichever, you need to control your brand narrative and use it to retain people.
How do you create a powerful brand narrative? 
The first thing is to align on a mission, a reason for being: To democratize information (Google); A computer on every desk, every home (Microsoft); Connect the world’s professionals (Linkedin). 
But don’t stop there. Now load the mission with humanity and manifest it in the product, the company, and the marketing. This involves truly understanding people’s needs and wants. 
This is a human-centric approach and it’s the absolute foundation of a brand narrative. Your product will bring people in, but it’s the humanity of the company that will keep them there; particularly if you’re investing in the newest generation of consumers.
Defining the brand and the narrative can easily be deprioritized — but don’t let it happen!
 If there’s one thing the pandemic taught product owners and marketers, speed of response matters. I can tell you first hand that those businesses who knew their narrative, knew how to respond instantly. Consumers embraced them, flocked to them in some cases. Those who didn’t took months to respond, and it has hurt their business. 
Zoom will be worth billions by the time this article is published and many employees will pocket life-changing cheques. It’s a remarkable story, but it doesn’t end with the IPO. Brands have been known to outlive their original products, but products without brands get unstuck at some point. 
I mean… when did you last Skype?

Never only hire the smartest people,Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten,2021/03/11,"
Boris is the wise ol’ CEO of TNW who writes a weekly column on everything about being an entrepreneur in tech — from managing stress to embracing awkwardness. You can get his musings straight to your inbox by signing up for his newsletter!
It isn’t easy to guess how smart you really are. I certainly know people a lot cleverer than me — and I’m regularly dumbfounded by the simplest things. Yet, occasionally I’ll end up doing something ‘pretty smart.’
And this is totally fine.
The older I get, the more I understand (and experience) that intelligence isn’t everything — it’s just a tool. On its own, a tool can’t do much of anything. It isn’t until it’s wielded correctly and used in tandem with other specialized equipment that the real magic happens.
[Read: The one question every leader should ask themselves]
A high-quality camera in the hands of an amateur will probably not produce a better photo than a cheap one in the hand of an artist. Just like how intelligence in the hands of a person who doesn’t know how to use it in a creative way is pretty useless.
I think I’ve gotten a lot of mileage out of the limited amount of intelligence I possess by being stubborn and persistent — and then combining that with creativity and unrestricted thinking.
That’s my full toolset: some intelligence, combined with a lot of creativity and persistence.
There are people who are smarter than me (a lot, actually) but some are just too rigid in their thinking, too entitled to work hard, or not creative enough to come up with even one original thought. They’re damn smart, but that’s all.
Being extremely intelligent will not get you anywhere unless you have the social skills, intuition, and sense of timing to match.
So, how does this knowledge help us? You can use it to put your own talents to good use and discover skills in others. You can be a complementary tool in your team’s collective toolbox (sorry for calling you a tool).
Pure creativity without a sense of marketing and commerce isn’t going to get you very far. And the smartest person in your class isn’t the one most likely to succeed — but they might know the best way to implement your creative solution.
Companies should never ‘only hire the smartest people,’ because intelligence on its own can be pretty dumb.

An entrepreneur’s last attempt at regaining productivity: Ditching social media in 2021,Alexander Lewis,2021/03/8,"
Do I consume social media or is it slowly consuming me? This blurred line has garnered increased attention due to recent documentaries like The Social Dilemma, which popularized deeply unsettling questions about the impact of social media on our mental health, politics, even free will. 
Yet many of us have our reasons for staying in the game. I’m sure there are some prolific entrepreneurs and writers who have no problem managing their social media usage, but that’s not my experience. I find these platforms consistently distract from my most important work. It’s a huge cost that I just can’t ignore anymore. 
I’ve attempted on several occasions to rise above the addiction, placing heavy restrictions on my daily usage. Good intentions only got me so far. Somehow I’ve always been pulled back into social media’s gravity, using it the way it demands to be used (i.e. obsessively). 
That is, until a few weeks ago. I have finally decided that social media steals too much of my time and attention to warrant continued investment. For 2021, I’ve chosen a more clear-cut approach to handling social media: network-cutting. 
The opportunity cost of social media
On a sunny day in the late 2000s, Mom snapped my photo and uploaded it to her computer. There I was, a freshman, grinning and backlit in front of her blinds. Not candid or stylish — just a grainy placeholder photo to help me complete my Myspace profile. Months later, I adopted Facebook as well, and within a couple of years, I had signed up for Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn. 
Unlike most hobbies and habits I picked up in high school, this one stuck. The longer I was on social media, the more weekly time I invested in each platform. I recorded photos from backpacking trips, learned about important causes, shared my own articles and short stories, and networked to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars for my copywriting business — all thanks to social media. 
But the benefits did not come without their costs. 
The most obvious cost was my time. According to Statista, the average daily social media usage was 144 minutes in 2019. Assuming I’m fairly average — a safe assumption — that means I spent almost 900 hours browsing social media websites in one calendar year. Since high school, that adds up to several months of my life in accumulated scrolling, liking, posting, friend requesting, and meme sharing.
Credit: StatistaDaily social media usage worldwide 2012-2019.
But on its own, sunk time doesn’t directly equate to a lack of value. What I gained for all that time on social media — and whether I could have gotten greater value for my time elsewhere — is harder to quantify. 
I think the most apt analogy I’ve heard is that social media is like cognitive junk food. These sites emphasize headlines and hot takes rather than depth and nuance. 
Like fast food, social media plays on my weaknesses by maintaining a close enough appearance to substance — so much so that sometimes I can ignore the difference. 
The problem is, I don’t want a mere passable substitute for tackling big ideas, understanding the news, and connecting with friends. Just give me the real thing. Give me depth, substance, and real connection.
And what about creators who only use social media to spread and publish ideas? Instant publishing offers many clear benefits — but it also offers a dangerous shortcut for anyone who desires to produce work that lasts.
Author and economist Tim Harford put the opportunity cost of his social media usage in exact numbers: “My Twitter habit is more of a problem. I have 145,000 followers, gently persuaded over 10 years and 40,000 tweets to follow me — that’s about 10 books’ worth, or 20 years of weekly columns. This alone was a reminder of just what an effort Twitter could be.” 
How I got here
I’ve never taken more than a single month off social media since my freshman year of high school. And even those few breaks wouldn’t have happened without first discovering the work of Cal Newport, author and professor of computer science at Georgetown. 
Newport writes at the intersection of professional development and technology. From late 2018 through 2019, I read three of his books in rapid succession, with one idea rising above the rest: deep work. Here’s a definition from his website:
The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to concentrate without distraction on a demanding task (what I call ‘deep work’) is becoming more rare at the same time that it’s becoming more valuable in the knowledge sector. As a result, those individuals and organizations who put in the hard work to cultivate this skill will thrive.
Newport’s Deep Work Hypothesis caused me to reconsider how I organize my day, what I value in work and leisure, and my relationship to social media.
As a copywriter, deep work is how I make my living. Unbroken, focused attention is what pays the bills and moves my business forward. The more time I dedicate to the craft and business of writing, the better I become and the more work I produce. When something gets in the way of writing, it interferes directly with my earning and career potential. 
And nothing pulls me away from writing faster than Twitter, Facebook, or even LinkedIn. What began as an innocent high school hobby now steals so much of my time and attention. I knowingly bleed productivity every week. 

*wakes up and looks at phone*ah let's see what fresh horrors await me on the fresh horrors device
— Miss O'Kistic (@missokistic) November 11, 2016

The alternative
Maintaining a social media presence — especially for writers and entrepreneurs — often feels non-negotiable. The choice isn’t whether you use social media, but how. 
In the opening page of Invested, Charles Schwab writes, “The world of business, like the rest of life, is full of wonderful temptations, and making a choice about where you are going to devote your energy is often as much about dismissing things as it is about choosing something. A singular sense of purpose gives you focus and clarity.” 
Cutting social networks from my life for the next year is my attempt to achieve a new level of focus — perhaps one that becomes an advantage. What will a return to focus mean for me this year? Maybe I’ll publish more articles in more reputable magazines than any year before — or earn a book contract. Maybe I’ll finish work early every day and have more time to read, exercise, or call up a friend. 
Think about when was the last time you texted someone, “How are you?” Without the crutch of feeling like I know friends from updates from social media, I’ll have to be more proactive. I’ll have to ask. For now, I have many aspirations and I’m optimistic about what a year without social media could mean personally and professionally. 
Of course, there’s a possibility that things go counter to my plan. Maybe a year without social media will change the way I see it. Maybe the benefits will become clearer to me and I’ll re-log on to each platform with enthusiasm at the start of 2022. 
If I’m honest, I doubt that’ll be the case. I believe the internet is a better place to learn, write, and grow a business when I’m not competing for trivial achievements like a fresh new badge about a single retweet or like. 
I have a hunch that I’ll never choose to go back to social media. Or maybe it’s a prayer. Either way, I’m out.

How to generate buzz in a buzzless industry,Andrea Hak,2021/03/5,"
One of the toughest challenges young startups face is getting the buzz they need to generate media attention, user interest, and VC backing. Even if you know your solution is set to change the world in some way, trying to generate a buzz can sometimes feel like shouting in the middle of Times Square during rush hour. 
Now, what if your solution is so niche, that only a small portion of the population will ever use it? Add to that solutions that are so heavy in scientific research that only someone with a PhD understands how they work.
Sound familiar? Not to worry. 
We scoured X-Europe’s startup accelerator program to find the best examples of startups that, despite the challenge of having an extremely niche solution, are finding ways to get the attention they need.
In the end, we spoke with one poultry sex reassignment startup, one data analysis company specialized in crop science and metagenomics, and one smart beehive maker. It can’t get any more niche than that. 
Here’s what they had to say:
Focus on the wider impact your industry has on society 

No matter what industry you’re working in, there will always be something that makes it interesting for a wider audience. Your best bet is to look at the big picture. How do developments within your industry impact people in their daily lives? How do they impact the causes or issues they care about?
With a very specific customer base (farmers, governments, and others working in the agricultural sector), AgriTech hasn’t always been the sexiest industry. The potentially low public interest and readership levels meant that, in the past, journalists weren’t necessarily clamoring to cover new industry developments. 
Computomics, a data analysis company that offers custom services for next-gen sequencing projects from crop science to metagenomics, knows this all too well. 
But as Managing Director, Dr. Sebastian J. Schultheiss, told Growth Quarters, growing public consciousness about the effects of climate change, food security, and the conversation around sustainability have completely changed this perception.
By 2050, our planet will be home to more than ten billion people, resulting in an estimated 50% increase in the amount of food, feed, and biofuel required. Farmers around the world were producing 30 million tons less grain than required to feed everyone in 2019. As the world population grows, the demand for agriculture is increasing. This puts pressure on farmers, growers, agricultural companies, and food producers to supply more, and to supply faster. The pressure is aggravated by the global effects of a changing climate on food production worldwide. 
At the same time, the technological advances are huge! A farmer 10 years ago worked in a completely different way than they do today. Today’s agriculture uses numerous sophisticated technologies such as robots, sensors for temperatures and soils, aerial images from drones and satellites, and GPS technology. Using these advanced devices, in combination with machine learning technologies, allows farmers to be more profitable, efficient, safer, and more environmentally friendly. Having all these challenges in mind, you just have to get excited about innovation in this sector!
Simplify complex solutions by focusing on added value
Photo by: Eyal Yitzhar, for Globes Israel
Now imagine that you’re not only operating in a niche sector but also have a niche solution within that sector. 
For Yael Alter, CEO of egg sex determination startup Soos, this was a big challenge. 
“There are difficulties in growing while associated with the AgriTech sector. Solutions are complex and heavily dependent on science which requires intense research and the industry demands a 100% complete product before going to market,” Alter explains. 
“In addition, these solutions are usually restricted with heavy regulation and require mass amounts of capital to fund. The biggest difficulty is being in the livestock sector, as the number of investors interested in animal husbandry is substantially lower.”
Soos’ groundbreaking technology makes it possible to determine and change the sex of eggs before they hatch. But why should anybody not working in the poultry industry care about such a niche and technically complex solution? 
Alter laid it out in a way that’s straightforward, easy to understand, and easy to remember. 
“We manage to get people excited about our product via the noticeable benefits our solution provides. Here is an example of a term we coined, ‘The 4 P‘s’, showing our added value:”

Poultry – Our solution has an obvious animal welfare benefit which is saving male chicks from culling. Every year, 7.5 billion male chicks are killed just after hatching.
Planet – Today, the industry expends many resources such as electricity, water, feed, etc., that are wasted due to the production of male chicks. With our technology, these resources won’t be used in vain due to the production of more female chicks.
People – With a growing population and nutritional security a rising issue, our solution will be able to increase egg supply, thus providing a valuable source of protein, especially in developing countries. The human population is estimated to reach 10 billion by 2050 and it is our duty to plan ahead for sustainable production and nutritional security for the next generation.
Profit – The egg market is currently marked at $220 billion. The male-chick culling practice is the industry’s largest pain point as they have a 50% capacity loss and additional expenses that are associated with the culling and regulation. Our solution can provide an estimated $1.5-$2 of added value for every male that is altered to a functional female. This means that our solution can add up to $15 billion of value.

Consider how your product advances a particular tech sector
Of course, not every solution will have such a clear and direct social impact. Instead, consider how your product fits within the current tech trends. As Schultheiss explained:
The attention around everything AI has helped us get conversations started. For example, we are currently investigating the use of Earth Observation data to include in our technology. There is so much diverse data available in AgriTech and many people don’t know how to use it in a successful and meaningful way. 
We developed our technology so it integrates diverse datasets, extracts the most useful and discerning features, and fully leverages the information available in these datasets in a meaningful way, to deliver actionable insights.
Alter agreed:
Our startup is at the junction between AgriTech, FoodTech, and Biotechnology. This certainly has allowed us some flexibility on how we frame our solution for specific audiences. Our technology also has many aspects that allow for the use of buzzwords when needed such as IoT, AI/ML, Big Data, SW, HW, etc. 
Each startup should consider how they can use their product to their strengths. Some investors might be able to overlook the non-buzz aspects if you can create buzz through your technology, market, team, etc.
Choose the right outlets
Consider what your goals are. While making it into a top-tier publication may seem glamorous, if your goal is lead generation, reaching a global audience may not be worth the effort. 
“We’ve found that staying true to your niche is very important,” Alter tells Growth Quarters. “You would be surprised by how specific some niche outlets can be. The specificity doesn’t stop just at agriculture or even livestock, but we have various poultry/chicken media outlets and conferences/events. This allows us to reach our consumers without having to go after very general events/outlets.”
“With that being said, we still believe that you need to spread your efforts to reach a more general audience. While looking for poultry farms to adopt your solution, a niche poultry magazine would probably be your best bet, but not so much if you’re looking for investment for example. Our PR and Business Development team try to find the right balance of effort allocation between niche and non-niche outlets,” says Alter.

Soos itself has been able to get coverage in both Poultry World and The Guardian. Alter shared that the key is knowing what types of stories to pitch to different publications. While the readers of Poultry World may want the nitty-gritty details behind their solution, a wider audience will be more interested in the impact it has:
Each startup should map out their focuses and see what works for them. When spreading out to more general audiences, our efforts are accompanied by finding and emphasizing the appealing aspects of our solution, such as the animal welfare issue and the ‘did you know.’ That way we can attract interest from people who aren’t aware of how the industry or science works.
Focus on your community

But is spending time in gaining media attention really worth the effort for niche startups? 
Ru Wikmann, CEO of BeeSage, isn’t so sure. When he met his co-founder, Girts Kagis, (whose father is a beekeeper) and their advisor, Janis Kronbergs (an avid beekeeper himself), at an IoT hackathon, it was fate. Wikmann and Kagis soon created Beesage, a company that’s developed smart beehive scales to better monitor and maximize honey production, was born.
While Wikmann admitted that press can help with things like word of mouth, SEO, and positioning, he explained:
We’re not overly concerned about media attention at this stage. We rather leave the buzzing to bees. Our customers, beekeepers, don’t read tech media. We prefer to focus on them and make our name within the local communities while building our products and taking feedback from our users.
I’ve found the groundwork of building relationships within the beekeeping community and forming partnerships with synergistic companies to be a much more worthwhile effort.
 It’s important to keep our ambitious impact goals at the back of our minds but, at the end of the day, what will help us get there is building a better product that delights our customers. Hence, most marketing efforts should be completely focused on the niche, if only a tiny fraction of the population can be users of our products.
Get networking
While gaining media attention may not be a priority for every niche business, attracting investment is.

“Very few investors understand hardware and they often regard it as being riskier,” Wikmann explains. “What helped us get the initial funds for starting were some accelerators suited for our overlapping micro-niches, namely, EIT Climate-KIC and Buildit. X-Europe has been a great program too in many aspects.”
Both Computomics and Soos have also greatly benefited from joining accelerator programs and startup competitions. In fact, Soos’ first international pilot was mediated through an accelerator and, in 2020, they won a $1 million investment at the Grow-NY competition. 
Computomics has made the most out of the EU’s various funding opportunities by participating in grant proposals and partnering up with research bodies, universities, and other industry players to apply for joint grant applications. 
Another great way of creating visibility is by joining business networks. Computomics, for example, is a member of the University of Hohenheim’s CANNABIS-NET, CyberValley, and the International Seed Federation (ISF). 
The one golden rule for generating buzz
If after this list you’re still having trouble finding the right channels, not to worry. Sometimes the best strategy to generate external attention is simply taking a deeper look internally. As Wikmann explained:
Focus on building a product that solves important problems for your users and surround yourself with the best people for this journey. Everything else is secondary. 
If there is something interesting or unique about your startup, you will naturally attract attention without any need for buzzwords. Keep an open mind and constantly iterate on the feedback you’ve received. If you have a good thing, sooner or later others will want a piece of it.

The one question every leader should ask themselves,Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten,2021/03/4,"
Boris is the wise ol’ CEO of TNW who writes a weekly column on everything about being an entrepreneur in tech — from managing stress to embracing awkwardness. You can get his musings straight to your inbox by signing up for his newsletter!
I know a business coach who always starts his sessions by asking his clients a single question: ”Who would you be if you weren’t you?”
What he means is; if you didn’t have your current job and responsibilities, and if you wouldn’t have invested time and energy in your current career, who would you be and what would you do?
It’s an excellent question to ask yourself every now and then, but it can be extremely difficult to answer. It’s because you are the result of a very complicated puzzle, consisting of thousands and thousands of pieces, and you’re only half-assembled.
[Read: Stop listening to your #yesbut brain if you want to grow]
The same thing goes for companies and projects. There are a lot of things you do simply because you’ve been doing them for a while. You might stick with projects that you’ve started only to find yourself now stuck with them.
That’s why you should ask yourself — at least once a year — if you were starting today, would you still continue with this project? The answer could be a firm “yes,” and that’s great. But a hesitant “no” is also interesting because it will allow you to reassess your work.
It doesn’t stop there, though, because you can apply the same thinking to your partners and employees.
If the person you work with applied today, would you hire them? It can be a painful realization when your answer is less than an enthusiastic “yes,” but maybe that discomfort shouldn’t be avoided. In fact, I tell my managers to think about employees not as fixed assets but as living beings who change alongside your company and the world — because they are.
I think it’s healthy and respectful to have a conversation with someone you work with and establish how long you’re going to work together. Back in the day, people might’ve stayed at the same job for 40 years, but I expect most people to work for you for about 5 years. Some a little bit longer, some a lot shorter.
The great thing about setting these expectations from the beginning is that when they leave — instead of feeling betrayed and abandoned — you can thank them for their contribution and accept that they gave it all they had.
You can then also view the opportunities it provides clearly and ask yourself: now that I have the budget for a new employee, who can I hire that’ll be perfect for what I want to achieve now?
So when an employee decides to leave, you can both look back on a fruitful partnership, and you’ll both have something to celebrate. You can now hire the perfect person for your next goal, and the leaving employee can move on to their next challenge. Everybody wins.
Back to the original question and your homework for the week: who would you be if you weren’t you?

"‘Chief Awesome Officer’ is an actual job title — suck it, CEOs",Már Másson Maack,2021/03/4,"
There’s a ton of ridiculous job titles in the startup scene, but usually, they’re somewhat transparent. Surely a Chief Meeting Designer must do something related to meetings and a Senior Clubhouse Executive probably spends all their time yapping on Clubhouse.
So that’s why I was a little stumped when I came across Marian Johnson — a Chief Awesome Officer. Does she just go around… being awesome? Why would you pay someone for that? What the hell does a Chief Awesome Officer do?!
“Well, the first thing about being Chief Awesome Officer is that every time I introduce myself, there’s a round of laughter,” Johnson explains when I call her up to bombard her with questions about her title.
“This might actually be the strength of the title,” Johnson says. She tells me it helps get people’s attention and makes her and the organization more approachable by not taking themselves too seriously.
Despite the name, it’s not actually a ‘ministry’.
Marian Johnson heads the Ministry of Awesome — yup, that’s the name — a starting point for entrepreneurs, startups, and innovators in Christchurch, New Zealand. Basically, it’s an independent not-for-profit startup hub dedicated to growing the ecosystem in the country by providing entrepreneurs with the tools they need to grow their ideas.
“The title is also meant to show we’re zero BS… although I suppose Chief Awesome Officer could sound super BS-y, but I think we’re the opposite,” Johnson adds and laughs. “We’re basically making fun of ourselves with stupid titles.” 
This bullshit/non-bullshit method of breaking the ice with a ridiculous title is actually quite effective and has a surprisingly deep backstory.
Back from the ashes

On February 22, 2011, as the people of Christchurch were just finishing their lunch breaks, a 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck the city. Most of the city center was reduced to rubble in the intense quake, 185 people lost their lives, and thousands of people were made homeless.

“The inner city was completely flattened. Any building that didn’t fall down on that day was then taken down later. We lived in a donut outside the city center for a solid five years,” says Johnson.
In the aftermath of the earthquake, many were forced to move away from Christchurch and its population dropped considerably for a while. But the people of Christchurch were determined to rebuild their city and revitalize the community.
It was in this atmosphere that the Ministry of Awesome (MoA) was founded. The informalness of the name and its supercharged positivity was meant to jumpstart the startup ecosystem in a city reeling from a natural disaster.
Marian Johnson spreading awesomeness.
Although construction is still ongoing, Christchurch is bustling again. When Johnson took over the MoA in 2017, the organization pivoted from earthquake recovery to building a more robust startup ecosystem across the country. 
Currently, the MoA has 24 high-growth startups in its incubator program and numerous external innovation engines where Johnson and her team connect corporates with startups to solve the problems they face.
Ok, good to have an over-the-top job title after a crisis — how about now?
“I did think for a moment about changing the title,” Johnson admits. “When I saw the job title ‘Chief Awesome Officer’ it just made me think of all those stupid job titles at Google and I didn’t take it seriously at all “
Johnson could’ve played it safe (AKA boring) and changed it to CEO to appear more serious to the conservative organizations she’d have to work with, like banks and governments. But in the end, she decided to keep the title because of its rich history — and its effectiveness. 
She says the title lays a lot of the groundwork for her. Before she enters a room as a Chief Awesome Officer, people already know what to expect from her and what she’s about.
“The title and the name of the organization shows founders that whatever their moonshot idea or crazy dream, here’s one organization who’s ready to get behind you.”

Marian alongside awesome founders.






She doesn’t envy her peers who have to be content with generic and drab titles. And if for nothing else, at least Chief Awesome Officer isn’t a title you’ll forget anytime soon.





The secret to being a Chief Awesome Officer
We’ve established that despite sounding like startup nonsense at first, the title actually brings a lot of value to the organization’s bottom line. But what makes a good Chief Awesome Officer?
Johnson thinks it all comes down to being an incredibly positive and energetic person, mixed with commercial sense and evangelist skills. Oh, and “you have to say ‘awesome’ a lot,” she adds.







So have all three Chief Awesome Officers so far been like this?







“Yes, and weirdly, each of us… oh, I don’t know if this is good or bad, maybe I shouldn’t mention it? But we’ve all been American, which is strange,” Johnson says and laughs.

"
Why your SaaS success is all about ‘Net Dollar Retention’,Soraya Meirmans,2021/02/12,"
If you’ve ever taken a marketing 101 course, you’ve learned that keeping a customer is much more profitable than acquiring new customers. It’s an old piece of wisdom but still valid today. 
Unfortunately, many SaaS companies forget about it and concentrate their efforts on generating new leads. The costs of acquiring new customers get very high, really quick. And if you’re unable to bind your user to your product, it is completely useless. 
Most people judge the performance of a SaaS-company on its MRR while judging a company on its NDR might give much more valuable insight. 
Why? Well, it’s not uncommon that a company’s MRR increases while their NDR deteriorates. In other words, the company is bleeding money. 
One could argue that NDR is much more than a number; it quantifies how your clients value or love your product and how much of an impact you’re making on their lives… I’d say Customer lifetime value (LTV) is one of the most critical metrics for SaaS companies. 
With that in mind, upgrades or downgrades and churns must be considered while judging a company’s performance. 
What is Net Dollar Retention?
NDR is a metric expressed as a percentage. It illustrates the (change in the) amount of revenue from the current users a company can retain compared to another period with taking downgrades, upgrades, and churn into account.  
NDR, or Net Dollar Retention, is not as well known as MRR, but a very valuable (if not more valuable) metric. Especially for SaaS-entrepreneurs. Why is NDR so important? Well, first and foremost for me is the fact that it’s very much possible to grow your MRR while losing money. 
This scenario occurs when your marketing department is on fire. The acquisition of new users creates a revenue stream that exceeds the net reduction in revenue from your existing user base.  
Let’s say your company starts this month with €100,000 in MRR. It books €50,000 in new subscriptions, zero in expansion revenue, suffers €20,000 in downgrades, and €5,000 in churn.
In this example, your MRR rose by a whopping 50%. And yes, you should bring out the champagne for that. But, your NDR is only at 75%. You lost 25% of MRR from your current userbase. Also, what was your marketing budget? How much did you spend to acquire these new users? Money is leaking from your business…
To understand Net Dollar Retention, you must consider expansion (by marketing), downgrades (of packages), and most of all churn, and their effect on monthly recurring revenue (MRR).
Let’s dig a bit deeper into what this means before we address the essentials of NDR.
Increases in MRR
MRR can increase via two broad mechanisms:

Through newly onboarded customers
Through an increase in usage or upgrades within your existing customer base

Simply put, MRR increases when your existing customers start spending more on your product. By upgrading a standard subscription to a premium subscription, for example. Or when your marketing department does a bang-up job. 
An example of the first would be a user upgrading from a €10 basic subscription to a €50 premium subscription. In this case, the expansion revenue would be €40 or the net increase resulting from the upgrade.
€50-€10 = €40 increase in MRR
Decreases in MRR
Life can be hard, especially when you’re a SaaS-entrepreneur. Sometimes you lose clients, this decreases your MRR. This can happen in two ways: 

Through downgrades in usage within your existing customer base
Through churn, where customers cease to do business you

Downgrades are any decrease in revenue caused by downgrading in use, which is basically the opposite of our previous example. 
A downgrade would be a user moving from a €50 basic premium subscription to a €10 basic subscription. The downgrade in revenue, in this case, would be €40, which is the net decrease resulting from the downgrade. 
€10-€50 = (€40)
Churn
I’d define churn as a disaster. Or, more mildly put, as losing users. 
An example of churn is a user leaving the platform from a €50 subscription. The churn would be €50, the net loss resulting from the user leaving your platform. 
But with that out of the way, let’s get to the meat of this article.
Calculating Net Dollar Retention
NDR accounts for the changes in MRR caused by expansion, upgrades, downgrade, and churn within an existing customer base.
It is expressed as a percentage and calculated using the following equation.
(Starting MRR + expansion — downgrades — churn)/ Starting MRR *100 = NDR
For example, a company starts the month with €10,000 in recurring revenue. Over the month, it added €2,500 in expansion revenue, has €1,000 in downgrades and another €500 in churn.
(€10,000 + €2,500 — €1,000 — €500)/€10,000 *100 = 110% NDR
The company now has €11,000 in MRR and due to an NDR of 110%
Making use of NDR
A Net Dollar Retention below 100% means churn and downgrades were bigger than the growth you realized with your existing customers. You are losing users, or they’re spending less on your product. The role that your product plays in their life is not significant enough. They can do without you. Or, with less of you. Both are a little painful.  
It’s like being dumped. 
If this analogy seems a little far fetched, but I tend to disagree. People don’t leave something that they really love. Or, in this case, a product they really love. Maybe, just maybe, you’re not loveable enough, and it is time to invest in the relationship.
How to improve the NDR?
If your NDR is bad, don’t worry. I’ve worked with many SaaS companies along with my team and we’ve seen it’s more than possible to beat churn and turn your negative NDR into a positive one. 
Of course, there are plenty of ways to turn NDR around, but the one I have the most experience with is through human-centered design. A human connection built straight into your application will make your users fall in love and make sure they’ll stay with you as long as possible. 
Design helps you get your product from liked to loved. What does this mean? Well, your marketing efforts are more fruitful, your clients more positive, and VC’s are banging on your door. Making sure your users never leave you anymore, invest in the upgraded design of your SaaS product. 
So calculate your NDR and find the best way to get it to where you want it to be.

"Speak less, communicate better",Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten,2021/02/11,"
Boris is the wise ol’ CEO of TNW who writes a weekly column on everything about being an entrepreneur in tech — from managing stress to embracing awkwardness. You can get his musings straight to your inbox by signing up for his newsletter!
When we think about communicating more, most of us imagine it’s about talking more. But communication is really about exchanging information — that includes receiving it. You can’t listen when you’re talking, or as Larry King once put it: “I never learned anything while I was talking.”
Despite this, most conversations are composed of two people just waiting for their own turn to speak. Now before you start thinking I’m putting myself on a high horse… I’m definitely guilty of talking too much. Sometimes I come home from an amazing meeting, only to realize I was way too excited and eager to tell my stories that I didn’t let the other person speak
But this isn’t inherently a bad thing, it’s just that the real master of that meeting wasn’t me — it was the other person.
[Read: What I learned from skills I no longer need]
If you want to please someone, all you have to do is encourage them to tell their stories. If you walk out of a meeting having said nothing, and the other person did ALL the talking, they will feel great about meeting you and remember it as an amazing conversation.
The best part though is that YOU will actually have had an interesting conversation. Not speaking will force you to listen, and when you listen, you will learn.
But how do you strike up a meaningful conversation with someone you might not know that well? A father of a friend of mine used to be an airline CEO. Whenever he traveled, he’d always chat up the people he sat next to. He had this great line that’s been a favorite of mine ever since I heard it: “I already know all my own stories, so let’s talk about you.”
It’s a rare thing to meet people who are genuinely interested in you and are willing to really listen to what you have to say. Honestly, you might as well wish for a unicorn.
So for your next conversation, I challenge you to conduct a little experiment: be that magical creature. Find an excuse to not talk. Any at all!
Say you are tired of your own stories and want to hear theirs, or tell them your throat is sore from an intense evening of living room karaoke. Do everything in your power to encourage them to speak more, give their stories space, revel in what excites them, sit back and see what happens.
My bet is that you’ll learn something, and you’ll delight someone.

Here’s how to do PR when your product is a SECRET,Clara Herdeanu,2021/02/11,"
The inherent nature of working in public relations is communicating with the public… hence the term “public.” However, in a strange twist of events, we’re sometimes asked not to communicate (but to also communicate). That can be challenging, but it’s not without merit. This paradox comes into being when there are projects that must remain a secret until launch. 
The trick here is creating a public relations plan that maintains the necessary secrets while still creating enough brand awareness that when the secrets are no longer so, they are able to garner the appropriate level of attention. 
While there are companies that must hold initiatives a secret, the most common situation, and one I can detail from personal experience,  is when you are working for a startup that is launching a product in stealth. 
Prior to a public beta, there is plenty of PR to do, but it has to be done in a way that allows your company to complete the project without actually revealing the project to the public. We dealt with this when we recently transitioned our company from an enterprise solution to launching a consumer app. 
While on the surface it would seem that this would create a circumstance in which there would be little to do from a PR perspective, that would be a misnomer and an assumption that doesn’t benefit a single soul.
Constraints require creativity
Brand awareness is the main mission when the project needs to be kept secret until launch. Those handling PR may feel like their hands are tied. 
You can’t talk about the product at all. You can’t pitch it, you can’t write about it, and you can’t even allude to the solution it offers in casual conversation.
The focus then has to shift from the product to the company. The entirety of your PR at this stage is to lift your company up to a level of market respectability, without revealing exactly what it’s working on. Some of that will inevitably be derived just from the resumes of the founders, but no one will know for sure until the beta launch. 
The artful approach here is to rethink how to publicize your company. Instead of focusing on the product, focus on the founders. Focus on backgrounds and knowledge.
This may seem limiting, but your company is just as important as your product — perhaps more so. It’ll make it that much easier to pitch a product or service if your company and its founders are already recognized as experts in their fields. 
Mindful messages in thoughtful pieces
The strongest way to put your founders out there is through thought leadership articles. There is always something happening in the world that could use their expert opinions. It doesn’t always have to be directly related to the thing they are working on; in fact, it helps the secrecy of your project if it isn’t related. 
As the gatekeeper here, your job is to mind the messaging. That is, you must pour over every written word to be sure that the habit of talking about one’s own projects doesn’t slip into the text. 
From metaphors to direct cause correlations, the habit of permeating one’s own writing with one’s own work is a hard one to break. This is where both your creativity and ingenuity come into play. 
Thought leadership articles are nothing new in regards to PR outreach and building brand awareness. There is a general rule not to speak about your own company when writing about pieces. 
What is not usual is not just adhering to that rule, but speaking in a way that doesn’t reveal what you yourself are working on. That takes some massaging of the messaging, so that your founders are still regarded as industry experts, but aren’t giving away the farm. 
This is where we in PR stand, as editors of the secrets we must keep. There is always another way of saying something if the direct way doesn’t work. We just have to find the right words. 
For instance, instead of saying what you are working on as an example to a solution to a problem, move it to a higher level and suggest an alternative solution that still arrives at the same conclusion. Here, it’s about teaching the audience the issues facing a particular industry and offering advice on how to solve them in a way that would better the industry or even society as a whole. 
Speaking out and getting quoted
Since you don’t have a project to promote to the press, but you do have founders and a company to promote, then it’s time to land them some speaking gigs. 
There are plenty of industry events that offer speaking opportunities, even more now that the market has wholly moved to a virtual setting. Considering the virtual aspect, these are generally low-cost events that give your founders the chance to expand on their knowledge base and gain fans. 
Another way we in PR can get our founders and companies into the press — in a way that highlights their background and experience, rather than current projects — is through a more subtle sort of media outreach. 
Offering our subject matter experts to journalists looking for expert input enables them to be quoted in articles relevant to their area of expertise. This is a no-cost, simple way to build founder and brand awareness.
Being in PR doesn’t always mean we’re spending our days filling up journalists’ inboxes with pitches. Often, especially in internal PR, the daily missive is to make sure the messaging reflects the current state of operations. That sounds like some buzzword bingo phrase, but that’s the gist of it. Being able to separate the company from the projects it is working on goes a long way toward building brand awareness. 
That’s the hook. We often define companies by the products they launch, or by the services they provide. When your company is stacked with knowledgeable experts, brilliant engineers, or highly-educated founders, then you do a disservice to them if your focus is solely on the thing they make. Take the time to lean on their knowledge, and promote that knowledge as part of what makes your company great. Your brand will be better for it.

How to stop yourself from using the wrong emoji at work,Justin Pot,2021/02/10,"
My editor Deb loves to ruin things. One time she used her Ph.D. in Italian to ruin an entire emoji.

The emoji in question is a common Italian hand gesture that, roughly translated, means “what the hell?” This isn’t how our team was using it. At some point, we collectively decided to use this emoji to mean “perfection.”

From what I can gather, people thought it represented kissing your fingertips, the way chefs sometimes do.
Dozens of people used the emoji this way until Deb pointed out the (hilarious) discrepancy. And you know what? Some people still use this emoji to mean perfection. They will probably never stop.
This is a harmless example, but it does point to the inherent ambiguity of emoji — and communication in general. Symbols only have meaning because of a shared cultural context, which means you can’t assume everyone is interpreting emoji the same way. That can lead to some awkwardness — especially in a work context.
Maybe don’t wink at your coworkers
Consider the ?. Some people wouldn’t think twice about using this emoji in a work context; others cringe at the very thought. There’s a gulf in meaning here, just like with the Italian hand gesture.
To some, the wink emoji is a harmless way to clarify that a statement is intended as a joke, or at least intended to be friendly. And there’s a lot of precedents here. The winking emoticon — ;) — was used this way for decades on Usenet and IRC. It’s natural that internet veterans want to use ? the same way today.
[Read: How much does it cost to buy, own, and run an EV? It’s not as much as you think]
The problem: that’s not how everyone understands this emoji. According to numerous sources from around the internet, the wink emoji implies you’re being flirty and/or suggestive. Some people will reflexively interpret any and all ? usage in this manner, which is going to radically change the context of any statement you make using it. The best case is that you’ll come across as oblivious. Worst case… well, I don’t think I have to explain why this is problematic in a work context.
You might disagree with the second interpretation of ?, and that’s understandable. It’s also kind of my point: we’re all interpreting emoji differently, and that can lead to confusion. But it’s not everyone else’s job to figure out what you mean.
Take it from a writer: you can’t control how other people are going to interpret your message. You can only control what message you send in the first place. To quote the philosopher Jeff Probst: “Perception is reality.”
My advice: avoid using ? at work entirely. Maybe also avoid ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, and especially ?, while you’re at it.
Other potentially confusing emoji
The wink is far from the only confusing emoji. Here are a few other examples, off the top of my head:


? is a gesture that means “ok” in most English-speaking countries, but it means… not that in many other countries. So maybe keep that in mind. There are a bunch of emoji, like ?, that have this same problem.


? is officially named “punch,” but some people use it as a fist bump. I’m sure many people are wondering why their coworkers want to punch them in the face (I am not — I know the reason).


? might look like excited jazz hands, but it’s officially named “hugging face.” So maybe don’t send it to anyone you wouldn’t hug. In the face.


? is sometimes used to express that two people are in sync. But the emoji itself is, inexplicably, two women dressed as Playboy bunnies, which in some contexts is going to distract from the whole “twins” thing.


Some people use ? to mean a high five or a thank you; others use it to mean prayer.


? might just look like a bagel, but I recently learned that it’s offensive to New Yorkers.



I could go on. The point is that emoji, like any symbols, have different meanings in different contexts. Effective communication depends on understanding that—especially when you’re working remotely.
There are three sides to every statement
Communication, in theory, is simple: you say something, and the person you’re talking to understands it. But that’s not how it actually works. In reality, every time you communicate, you immediately create three distinct statements:


What you meant to say.


What you actually said.


What your audience thinks you said.


Communication is the art of aligning these three things as closely as you can. This is true when you’re writing a book, it’s true when you’re giving a speech, and it’s true when you’re DMing a coworker.
If this sounds complicated, that’s because it is. There’s a reason robots are so bad at convincingly talking like a human person — conversation is staggeringly complex. There is so much nuance to every word choice — and to every emoji choice. Most of the time, humans manage this without any problem, which is pretty amazing when you think about it.
But every once in a while, confusion creeps in, which is only natural. We’re all making this up as we go along, after all, and communication is also a skill that you have to practice. Part of doing that online means understanding what emoji mean in various contexts.
If you’re ever uncertain about something:


Ask your coworkers what they think emoji mean. The more context you have the better.


If something is confusing to you, point it out! You’re probably not the only one who is wondering.


There is no shame in Googling an emoji to learn more about its meaning in the broader culture.


Remember: we’re all making this up as we go along. There’s no shame in not knowing. Just try to keep learning.

You need to rethink your customer experience for 2021 — here’s how I did it,Andrei Petrik,2021/02/9,"
As the CEO of an SME business, 2020 wasn’t exactly smooth sailing. The pandemic left us feeling like we’d had the light switched off and were spun around until we were dizzy. It wasn’t easy, but it looks like we survived. We weren’t the only ones, and most of our peers obviously felt the same trauma. 
As a B2B business, everybody found themselves in the same boat rocking back and forth. This meant that the way we communicated with, sold to, and dealt with our customers changed. The year 2020 was one that changed B2B business forever. It required the adoption of new approaches and techniques to get by.
I want to share the same customer experience approaches and techniques that I’ll be taking into 2021 with my community.
The success of customers came first

In 2020, it became clear that customer retention had to take priority over customer acquisition. We realized that businesses would minimize their costs, meaning they might want to stop using our software. 
There’s no point in acquiring new customers slower than you’re losing them, so we consolidated and leveled up our Customer Success (CS) program and relied on that as we plunged into the unknown. 
It’s a strategy that involves being proactive to customer problems, instead of reactive. It’s all about getting to know your customers and their product so profoundly, that you can reliably give them the very best of your product for their exact niche and need. 
I could go on about CS strategies until the cows come home. But in the interest of your interest, I’ll break it down into some smaller points.
1. Onboard and activate customers on an individual basis
Before any one-to-one conversation with a new customer, our CS Team does their research. They find out which industry the customer is in, which problems our product should solve, and which processes and workflows they employ that our product can fit in. 
With this information, they can have an educated first meeting, skip the unnecessary questions, and get into the meat of what our product can do for them. 
2. A perpetual education and re-education of customers
CS revolves around shared education. After educating yourself, educate your customers… and never stop. Apart from the newsletter and in-product notifications alongside significant updates and releases, we run live webinars, walk through the features we have added or improved during the assessment calls.  
Furthermore, we continuously produce educational and pre-boarding content on our blog such as guides, ebooks, cheat sheets, and checklists.
3. Stay in touch
We’re proactive. We don’t wait for a customer to contact us with a problem, we set regularly scheduled calls to check in on them and their experience of our product. We’re always adding features and tweaking our system. If that’s relevant to a specific customer, we always let them know so they can get the most out of it.
Above all, a successful CS strategy requires complete internal cooperation of the business that is practicing it. It needs sales and marketing singing off the same hymn sheet, using the same data, and putting out the same message. We do not doubt that our Customer Success strategy was one of the main reasons we survived this year. 
Personalization needed to go further
Let’s bust the myth that calling somebody by their name in the subject line increases their engagement with an email. 
It might be valid to some extent, but in 2020 literally every brand that you could name is doing it. It’s no longer impressive. If anything, it’s the bare minimum. In 2021, we need to go further in our personalization efforts. This all starts with immediate lead enrichment upon a user’s registration with a brand.
Personalisation is easy. Put some effort into it.
In my opinion, the definition of personalization got lost when Mail Merge was invented. In business, personalization should mean giving your brand a personality; humanizing it. 
It means implementing a conversational customer experience and aggregating all communication channels so a customer feels a seamless, personalized brand experience, with no disconnect between the different arms of it. As the pandemic adds to even more uncertainty about buying power of leads, this only becomes more important.
1. Conversational Customer Experience (CCE)
A brand providing CCE is one that provides continuous support and guidance and support for customers on an individual basis. It opens up a two-way channel of communication between a brand and a customer, ensuring a smoother path to customer success. 
We provide timely, relevant, and helpful information on request, and our relationships with our customers consolidate and grow. 
2. Omni-channel, personalized communication
We try to meet our customers where they are, and I appreciate that this sounds somewhat vague at first. Simply put, our different buyers have different preferences. 
This means we can’t expect the same approach to work for everybody. Ideally, we should be able to provide different, preferred channels without losing any information; a seamless buying experience. In 2021, we plan to experiment with even more promotional, distribution, and purchase channels.
Continuity is the cornerstone of customer relationships, and our end goal should always be for a customer to become a brand advocate.
We all needed each other
One of our biggest successes of 2020 was our user community, which was set up as a direct response to the coronavirus pandemic. It was initially set up as a simple Facebook page, titled ‘Crisis-Proof Community’, but the success of it meant we coded a section into our product as a new home. Eventually, it just became a general user community, rather than being focussed on pandemic response.
Our community empowered us in so many different ways, giving us benefits that we never planned for.
It lifted the weight off our Customer Success Team’s shoulders, simply because they had to deal with fewer queries and calls for the more simple, more common questions they receive. 

It gave us more visibility on Facebook because we would pop up on the timeline of our users’ friends. Now the Facebook group redirects users to the native group.
We found a new source of product development leads, meaning we could hone our SaaS product. We could gauge how much a particular feature was wanted simply by the number of people who engage with the request for it. 
It added more personality to our brand because we could reply from our individual Facebook accounts on different user posts. It gave us another, specific channel upon which to share content.

The pandemic drove both brands and consumers into deeper relationships with technology. We’ve been able to take advantage of that by bringing our whole customer base; people who share the same values, interests, and challenges together under one URL. 
A little bit of humanity goes a long way

The last point I’ll make is a little bit more common sense. Above everything else in 2020, we understood just how nice it is to be nice. Our users, the exact ones that gave me this platform to share my advice, needed us. 
They required us to show compassion and empathy to their situation because not everybody was able to weather the storm to the same end. A chatbot is suitable for solving minor problems, directing a customer to the right department… but it’s no shoulder to cry on. 
Now, it’s more important than ever to close feedback loops promptly and satisfactorily to our customers. In 2020, our customers needed us more than ever, they needed our product — not only to drive them to success, but to help them keep their heads above water. 
Regardless of whether we were able to implement a request or not, we listened and considered each individual one. If the request was related to their subscription payment, we’d trust our front-line employees to offer the correct discount, payment holiday, or additional service.
In return, we were able to ask our customers for something in return.

A recommendation for our product to partners and friends.
To host a partner webinar if you have an audience overlap.
A success story to share on our social media or a blog. 

Going forward in 2021, we will continue to be flexible for our customers in the hope that our customers can be flexible for us. A business can get bogged down in bad times at any time, not just during the pandemic. Sometimes it’s easy to get lost in the suit-and-tie of it all; to lose faces behind company logos.
Overall, we’re grateful that we were fortunate as a SaaS business. We’re blessed to be online, with the coronavirus’s impact kept to a minimum. We’re blessed to have been able to learn from it, rather than to be beaten by it. I’m blessed to be able to share the lessons I’ve learned from this year with my fellow business community. After all, as I said in the article… we need each other.
I hereby proclaim 2021 to be normal.

Here’s what all successful AI startups have in common,Ben Dickson,2021/02/8,"
With tech giants pouring billions of dollars into artificial intelligence projects, it’s hard to see how startups can find their place and create successful business models that leverage AI. However, while fiercely competitive, the AI space is also constantly causing fundamental shifts in many sectors. And this creates the perfect environment for fast-thinking and -moving startups to carve a niche for themselves before the big players move in.
Last week, technology analysis firm CB Insights published an update on the status of its list of top 100 AI startups of 2020 (in case you don’t know, CB Insight publishes a list of 100 most promising AI startups every year). Out of the hundred startups, four have made exits, with three going public and one being acquired by Facebook.
A closer look at these startups provides some good hints at what it takes to create a successful business that makes use of AI. And (un)surprisingly, artificial intelligence is a small part — albeit an important one — of a successful product management strategy. Here are some of the key takeaways from AI startups that have managed to reach a stable status.
Lemonade: AI complements a successful product strategy


Lemonade Inc. CEO Daniel Schrieber at TC Disrupt 2018

Lemonade, an insurtech startup founded in 2015, made its initial public offering in July with a $1.7 billion valuation. Lemonade is an online platform that aims to address some of the key problems of the traditional home insurance industry. The company has been able to develop its business through smart design and a good marketing strategy. The AI component was built on top of that.
The company’s website and mobile app are very easy to use. The process of buying insurance and filing claims with the app and website goes through digital assistants and is much faster than traditional insurance companies. As one of the first movers in the insurtech space, Lemonade had the edge over other similar companies that have cropped up in recent years, and it was able to quickly snatch a lot of users who were looking for a shift from traditional insurance model to one that was more tech-focused.
[Read: How much does it cost to buy, own, and run an EV? It’s not as much as you think]
Lemonade’s business model and messaging are also interesting. The company takes a flat fee from premiums, which means the company doesn’t make a profit from denying claims. The unclaimed money goes to charities of users’ choice. The company also says that it will not invest premiums into heavily polluting industries and companies that cause harm. So, basically, Lemonade is marketing itself as the good guy in a historically reviled industry, on a mission, per the company’s words, to “transform insurance from a necessary evil to a social good.”





Insurance depends a lot on data, and established agencies have more than a century of data they can use to develop risk models and create insurance policies. Lemonade didn’t have the data of traditional agencies, but it also didn’t have their baggage of customers and old policies. It was able to create its entire technology stack from the ground up to cater to the needs of an AI factory.
With the entire experience being digitized, the company can collect a lot more data from each customer interaction, including data points that other agencies do not capture. This enables the company to create machine learning models that not only predict insurance risk with growing accuracy over time but can also create automation and personalization opportunities that were impossible before. The company has two AI chatbots: Maya helps you create your insurance plan in a few minutes, and Jim handles the claims process. According to the company, AI handles a third of the cases and pays claims in a matter of minutes. The rest of the claims are transferred to human agents. The chatbot continues to improve as it gathers more data.
The company believes that with time, the AI will give it the edge over traditional agencies and allow it to provide much more affordable plans to customers. And its $480 million pre-IPO funding and its post-IPO growth show that investors believe its plan can work.





Lemonade’s head start is its biggest protection. Other startups that would want to copy its business model don’t have its data and can’t create equally efficient AI models. And it has also created a protective moat against traditional insurance agencies, which are much slower to move into new areas. By the time they do create their own AI factories, Lemonade will have carved a comfortable niche for itself.
Butterfly Network: Specialized hardware with AI enhancements


Butterfly Network iQ ultrasound probe

Butterfly Network will be listed on the New York Stock exchange after a $1.5 billion special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger with Longview Capital later this year.
The company’s product is Butterfly iQ, a medically approved single-probe, whole-body ultrasound device that connects to a smartphone and works with an accompanying mobile app. The device costs $2,000, which is much more affordable than the five- and six-digit-priced ultrasound sets usually found at hospitals. The company aims to make high-quality ultrasound imaging available to communities that can’t afford high-end devices and bring portable scanning to places where the bulky ultrasound sets can’t go.
iQ also uses artificial intelligence to create use cases that are not available on other ultrasound devices. For instance, one of the AI features of iQ is a slider in the app that shows the quality of the image to the user. As the user moves the probe on the patient’s body, the slider shifts to show whether the device is getting a good capture or not. The feature uses an artificial neural network that has been trained on tens of thousands of images to discriminate between good and bad images. For instance, frontline responders or clinics whose staff don’t have the expertise with ultrasound can use the device to get proper images and send them to experts for further analysis.





The device and app come bundled with a bunch of cloud storage and sharing features that facilitate the use of data in a broader health care context.
The company is also working to add new machine learning-powered features to help with measurement and analysis.
So here too, I think that AI is a small but important part of the overall business. The biggest value comes from the hardware. The small, portable ultrasound device allows Butterfly to differentiate itself from other manufacturers and create value for untapped segments of the market. AI is the added value that helps it improve the software stack that builds on top of the hardware. Given that the device uses consumer smartphones, it also has the potential to add new AI features and continually improve its product’s performance as mobile device hardware becomes better.
The one risk I see in Butterfly’s AI business is the possibility of similar moves from household names such as Philips and Siemens. Should health tech giants decide to enter the handheld ultrasound business, Butterfly Network will need to find something that can protect its products against copycats. One possible solution would be for Butterfly to work out a privacy-friendly plan to collect ultrasound data from iQ devices to improve the performance of its AI models. But it will not be very easy, given the sensitive nature of health data.
C3.ai: Enterprise AI can work if you have the reputation


C3.ai website

C3.ai, another one of the successful AI startups mentioned by CB Insights, is a provider of enterprise AI software. C3.ai’s pre-IPO valuation was $4 billion, but on the first day of trading, its market cap skyrocketed above $13 billion.
C3.ai software helps companies build AI models on top of their data for predictive maintenance, improved inventory management, fraud detection, energy management, and other operational enhancements that can reduce costs and increase productivity. C3.ai is not a provider of cloud services but its software is compatible with most top cloud providers such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and IBM Cloud.
Under normal circumstances, C3.ai’s product strategy would be considered risky. From a technical standpoint, it has no key differentiator. It is providing services that can easily be replicated by another company that has the right resources, including the very cloud services its software integrates with. And since its founding in 2009, the company has changed its name twice from C3 Energy to C3 IoT and then to C3.ai, which sounds a bit opportunistic.
What makes C3.ai different, however, is its founder Thomas Siebel, a billionaire and a well-known and respected entrepreneur. C3.ai’s success hinges not on a lot of small customers but on creating ripple effects in different sectors by acquiring big customers. In this respect, having a person on board who has the reputation and experience of Siebel can make a big difference. Currently, C3.ai’s customers include machinery manufacturer Caterpillar, oil and gas services company Baker Hughes, and energy company Engie, all big names in their respective industries. Interestingly, 36 percent of its revenue in 2020 came from Baker Hughes and Engie.
Therefore, although C3.ai provides very good AI development tools, the company’s success can be largely attributed not to its unique AI capabilities but its customer acquisition and retention strategy. I’m not sure if that would have been possible without having someone at the helm of the company who has strong connections in different markets and a reputation for delivering great products.
Mapillary: The value of data


Mapillary CEO Jan Erik Solem at RAAIS 2017

The final company that’s worth examining in the CB Insights list is Mapillary, acquired by Facebook in June for an undisclosed amount. Mapillary launched in 2013 to create a massive dataset of street-level images, rivaling Google’s Street View service.
Since its founding, Mapillary has collected more than one billion high-resolution images from cities around the world. Before being acquired by Facebook, Mapillary had partnered with Amazon’s AI platform to extract information from images through computer vision.
Mapillary didn’t have a super-advanced AI application or a very promising roadmap to making a profit over its data. But its data and services could prove to be a great addition to a larger ecosystem of AI software, such as that of Facebook. There are many ways Facebook, which is in the business of knowing more and more about its users, can turn a profit from Mapillary’s data. For now, we know that it will be integrating Mapillary’s data and applications into Facebook’s augmented reality and Marketplace platforms. And there are many other uses Facebook’s AI research unit can have for exclusive access to this large data set of labeled street images.
Therefore, I don’t quite see Mapillary as an AI success story, but its acquisition highlights the value of data in the AI industry. Large tech companies are often in search of ways to obtain exclusive data to hone their AI models and gain an edge over competitors. And they’re more than willing to take a shortcut by purchasing another company’s data—and perhaps the whole company with it.
The “AI startup” misnomer
I think “AI startup” is a misnomer when applied to many of the companies included in the CB Insights list because it puts too much focus on the AI side and too little on the other crucial aspects of the company.
Successful companies start by addressing an overlooked or poorly solved problem with a sound product strategy. This gives them the minimum market penetration needed to establish their business model and gather data to gain insights, steer their product in the right direction, and train machine learning models. Finally, they use AI as a differentiating factor to solidify their position and maintain the edge over competitors.
No matter how advanced, AI algorithms alone don’t make a successful startup nor a business strategy.

Growth hacking isn’t just a buzzword — let these 20K+ new users be your inspiration,Alan Brande,2021/02/5,"
‘Growth hacking’ has come to take on a not so positive meaning. Many see it as a hyped-up buzzword that indicates a cheap temporary solution — but I couldn’t disagree more. What it’s really about is finding small and effective actions you can execute with the resources you’ve already got.
So to drive you to start looking for the opportunities that are already present at your own startup, I’d like to give you a full rundown of a recent growth hacking process my team did.
Now let’s start by setting the scene the almost all of us are familiar with:
Back in the days where traditional software engineering models were popular — before agile became the ruling and dominant mindset that almost every company shares — the relationship between a developer and a client was one where the client would give the developer a bunch of requirements (negotiated at the start), and the developer dutifully carried them out one by one.
 This led to a ton of problems that you’ve probably heard of before (unable to respond to changing requirements, less user involvement in the process, large time gap between writing requirements and delivery, etc.). 
Collaboration between developers and clients
In modern software engineering, we software development firms try to work alongside the clients from the bottom up, and in every phase of the project. The immediately apparent consequence of this is that the now continuous process of requirement specification becomes collaborative, and better decisions tend to be made because the client and the technical team are aligned.
Less obvious is the fact that when the developer is so intimately involved in all aspects of a project, the situation becomes a fertile land for the growth of innovative ideas. 
If the development firm is encouraged to give insight pertaining to domains that are not exclusively related to the development cycle — such as Marketing, R&D, Human Resources, Production, etc. — they might come up with strategies or solutions that arise from a very different, more tech-oriented perspective. They might end up having an enormous impact, or even be the key to the project’s ultimate success.
The startup
Here at Light-it, we’ve recently had one of these wonderful moments where our marketing team had an idea that ended up delivering tremendous value to one of our clients.
The client in question was job-search startup MjobO. The MjobO platform works in the following manner:

Talented individuals in search of a job upload their resumé to the platform.
Businesses upload job offers to the platform, with a focus on transparency; they need to specify the starting salary, the working hours, and job responsibilities.
Based on a position’s required qualifications, each job offer gets matched with the potential applicants.

We built their platform here at Light-it. In keeping with the philosophy I wrote about in the first section, as we worked on the project, we sought to learn as much as possible about the entire MjobO enterprise. 
The reasoning behind this was that valuable insights only arise when a team fully grasps a project in its complete length and breadth. It needs to understand every area of a project; hyper-focusing on development would make it hard to come up with insights that involve other areas of the project. 
The eureka moment
The eureka moment came as the development team was working on the functionality to upload resumés. When a job searcher fills out the form with all of their qualifications, MjobO automatically generates a consistent, clean looking resumé. Businesses use these to determine the best applicant for the job.
While this functionality was being implemented, the marketing team pitched another use for these generated resumés. The thinking was that applicants might — after filling out and generating a clean looking resumé — want to share it elsewhere other than on MjobO. If it were possible to harness this impulse, an opportunity for viral marketing could arise.
So here’s what we did. In the screen shown after an applicant’s resumé is generated, the developers added a big, eye-catching button that reads “Share on LinkedIn.”
Most applicants are very eager to share their newfangled, updated resumé on their LinkedIn feed. So they do. It looks like this.
Great example of a growth hack in action.
The shared post starts off by mentioning that the resumé comes from MjobO. As you can see, the LinkedIn feed only shows a small snippet of the resumé, and you need to click to see the full version. If you do click, you get redirected to the MjobO website.
This simple idea was massively successful. People who are browsing their LinkedIn feed are almost invariably either people who are looking for a new job, or people that are looking to hire new employees. 
In either case, these people are instantly interested when they find out about MjobO, a job-search platform. That’s why, upon seeing the shared resumé on their feed, LinkedIn users usually click on the snippet and do end up learning more about MjobO.
Growth hacking
So what were the results in terms of new users? That’s our metric of success. And fortunately, in this case, they were staggering. 
Out of 22,000 applicants, 2,500 shared their resumé on LinkedIn. We were able to see in real-time how all the shared posts in LinkedIn were driving traffic towards the MjobO website, and how that new traffic reliably converted into new applicants. This was a viral cycle, because new applicants would then create their own resumés and would share them themselves, which allowed the platform to grow exponentially.
After all was said and done, in just one week after launch, MjobO gained over 20 THOUSAND NEW USERS. This was massive for a new company in a niche market.
The whole affair was an example of the technique referred to as ‘growth hacking.’ This term is an umbrella term for strategies focused solely on growth. These are usually used by startups such as MjobO, which during their early stages don’t have giant marketing budgets. The basic gist of growth hacking is figuring out creative, low-cost strategies to generate as much growth as possible, without spending a lot of money.
That’s precisely what we achieved with MjobO. Without spending a dime, we were able to take advantage of LinkedIn’s scale in order to reach people that fit exactly with MjobO’s target demographic (i.e people looking for jobs or people looking for employees). And we managed to do that by being creative and thinking in terms of what drives MjobO’s growth, and how we could optimize it.

AirBnb took advantage of CraigList’s scale. They started to automatically post their listings on CraigList, allowing them to reach a lot more users than they initially had, and redirecting them to their website.
Hotmail appended a line at the end of each e-mail encouraging people to sign-up.
DropBox used to offer more storage space to people who referred other users to the website.

Get started
The purpose of this post is to inspire you to get started with growth hacking yourself. Start thinking exclusively in terms of growth: what creative way can you think of to grow your product or service in an unexpected way?
I advise you to write down any strategies you can come up with, and start trying them out; you never know which one could actually stick. The key part is to always focus on strategies that allow you to have a measurable understanding of how much growth they are actually driving. Metrics are our bread and butter, use them wisely.
It might also be useful to read more about the subject, and about past examples of successful strategies. I recommend The Definitive Guide to Growth Hacking as a very comprehensive resource.
Now go make it happen!

4 salary negotiating scenarios in tech interviews — and how to navigate them,.cult,2021/02/2,"
This article was originally published by Michiel Mulders on .cult by Honeypot, a Berlin-based community platform for developers. For the latest updates, follow .cult by Honeypot on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin, and YouTube.
You’ve just landed a job interview for a technical role. Congratulations!
As a next step, you’ll likely want to learn more about the salary bands for the role, or a recruiter asks you about your salary expectations. Therefore, different situations can occur when negotiating your salary during a tech interview.  This article presents you with different situations you can expect during a tech interview and how to handle them correctly.
But first, what do you negotiate during a salary negotiation?
What is a salary negotiation?
Let’s make the following clear before we dive into different salary negotiation scenarios. Many developers don’t understand the full meaning of salary negotiations. The first thing that comes up in their mind is agreeing on their future salary. Yet, that’s not all!
Imagine a situation where you get an exciting salary offer that is higher than your target salary. However, the salary offer comes with few vacation days and no budget for personal development. Would you accept this offer even though it meets your salary expectations? Better not.
To make my point clear, avoid focusing on the final salary number. A salary negotiation encompasses many perks besides the final salary number, such as:

Health insurance
Number of days off
Learning budget or days allocated to personal development
Company holiday
Possibility to work from home
Flexible working hours
Company phone or laptop
Subscriptions for popular services, such as Netflix or Spotify
Budget to install a home office

In short, a salary negotiation involves all perks associated with a job offer. Next, let’s handle different situations during a tech interview in regard to your salary.
Situation #1: What’s your current salary?
Many tech recruiters try to figure out your current salary. This information is valuable for tech recruiters. It allows them to optimize their offer based on your previous salary.
[Read: How this company leveraged AI to become the Netflix of Finland]
Remember that tech recruiters work for a company to save them money during the recruiting process. Imagine your current salary amounts to €45,000. A tech recruiter can ask for this number and offer you a 10% increase, which amounts to €49,500. That’s a great offer! However, you might not know that the tech recruiter has a much larger margin for hiring new employees. The tech recruiter has likely received an upper constraint, for instance, €60,000.
Therefore, it’s beneficial for you not to disclose your current salary. Here are possible answers to this question.

Sorry, I don’t feel comfortable disclosing my current salary.
I can’t disclose my current salary as it’s private information that I can disclose only with my hiring manager. I hope you understand this.

Situation #2: What salary do you expect?
Again, try to avoid answering questions regarding your salary expectations. As mentioned before, recruiters receive salary bands for particular skill levels.
Therefore, try to point this question in the opposite direction. It’s best to receive a salary offer from your recruiter, so you can start the negotiation from this point.
The following replies would work well in this situation.

“Thank you for this question. We’ve already had an extensive interview process in which I’ve shown my skills and cultural fit. I trust you to provide me with a salary offer based on this information that fits the company’s needs. We can start the salary negotiation from this point. How does that sound?”
“I’m sure you are familiar with my skill level and what would be an appropriate salary offer. I trust you to provide me with a fair salary offer. I hope you understand this.”

If a recruiter doesn’t want to provide a salary offer before knowing your salary expectations, ask them for the salary bands. This information allows you to confirm that your salary expectations fall within or outside these bands. It should give tech recruiters a good insight into your expectations.
In short, tech recruiters have interviewed plenty of candidates to provide you with a reasonably accurate estimate of your worth. Make sure to first receive a salary offer before disclosing your salary expectations. If that’s not possible, ask for salary bands.
Situation #3: Sorry, we can’t offer the salary you expect
What if a tech recruiter or company rejects your requested salary?
Most often, that’s not a good sign. Perhaps, the company doesn’t have the means to offer you the requested salary.
When negotiating a salary, you should ask for 5 to 10% more than your target salary. This strategy leaves room for negotiation. On top of that, you can opt to negotiate better job perks as a compromise to a lower salary, such as more vacation days or a larger learning budget.
Therefore, not everything is lost when a company rejects your salary request. Send them a counter-offer that is 5 to 10% lower or change some of the job perks in your favor. You show your willingness to negotiate your salary and interest in the company.
Here’s an example reply to handle this situation.

“Hey, I appreciate your honest reply regarding my salary expectations. As I would like to join the team, let’s try to negotiate a job offer that works for both of us. Perhaps you can change the offer by including more job perks, such as vacation days or an increased learning budget. How about that? I’m looking forward to your reply.”

Situation #4: What do you think of a salary worth $X?
Lastly, a company offers you a salary of $X, how do you react? Several scenarios are possible depending on your target salary or current salary.

Your current salary or target salary is higher than the offered salary?

In this situation, it’s important to express your willingness to join the team while asking for their best offer. It’s your final chance to receive a better offer.
“Thank you for this offer. Although I would like to join the team, this offer is lower than my current salary. Is this the highest salary you would like to offer me?”

Your current salary or target salary is equal to the offered salary?

In this situation, you can either ask for a better salary or negotiate job perks such as extra vacation days or more days allocated to personal development. Sometimes it’s worth accepting a job with a similar salary that provides you with more benefits.
“This is a good offer. As it sounds very encouraging, I would say we are close. Is it possible to discuss other benefits, such as receiving 40 vacation days instead of 30 vacation days?”

Your current salary or target salary is lower than the offered salary?

Excellent! Most people would accept this offer. But remember there’s always a margin for salary offers. In this situation, it’s best to negotiate better perks and agree on the salary.
“Thank you for the offer! I think we are on the same page about the salary. Yet, I would like to discuss the number of vacation days. Is it possible to increase the number of vacation days to 40 days? That would be appreciated!”
Should you ask for a higher salary than your target salary?
Many software engineers feel uncomfortable negotiating their salary. It’s a natural response as you aren’t a sales manager, business developer, or tech recruiter trained to negotiate offers.
This section answers your question if you should ask for a higher salary than your target salary. The answer is simple – yes!
To provide yourself with more margin for negotiation, ask for a salary that’s 5-10% higher than your target salary.
Some of you are afraid of applying this strategy as you might miss out on interesting opportunities. Most companies know about the salary negotiation game and won’t abort an interview process based on your salary request. On top of that, they’ve already invested time in you and shown their interest in hiring you.
In the end, if a company aborts the salary negotiation process, perceive it as a good filter. Don’t feel bad about missing out on opportunities that are not worth your attention. Most likely, the company can’t offer you the target salary.
In conclusion, don’t go blindly in an interview. You should know your ideal outcome, what you compromise on, and what’s your lowest outcome you are willing to accept. Also, make sure to research the company. A recently funded company will have higher salary bands than a self-supporting startup.

How to make small talk remotely — without sounding like a weirdo,Justin Pot,2021/02/1,"
Saying good morning, in person, to a coworker you don’t know is perfectly normal. Sending a private message to a coworker you don’t know to say good morning is…weird. If not downright creepy.
Look, that’s just how it is. I don’t make the rules.
Seriously, though: the difference between these two interactions is real, which is part of why remote work is lonely. There’s also not really any context for serendipitous small talk — you won’t run into anyone in the hallway, for example. All of this makes it hard to connect with coworkers, let alone make friends with them.
But that’s not to say it’s impossible. I’ve been working from home for over a decade. Learning to reach out to the people I work with is a key part of how I’ve made it work. The conversations keep me sane when things get hard. The connections give me more reasons to care about what I’m doing. And the friendships I’ve made along the way have lasted much longer than the jobs themselves. But all that only happens if you reach out — without being weird about it.

Need help with small talk? Your friendly neighborhood robot can lend a hand. Zapier connects your favorite apps, so you can automatically send a DM whenever certain trigger events happen. Check out Zapier’s integrations for Slack and Microsoft Teams to get started.
[Read: How this company leveraged AI to become the Netflix of Finland]

Why reaching out can feel weird
Let’s get back to saying “Good morning.” Why is it so different to say that in a direct message, as opposed to saying it out loud in an office? The weirdness, I think, comes down to choice. Saying “Good morning” out loud is reflexive because we’re conditioned to do it. You saw a person, it was morning, so you said good morning like a normal human person.

Typing “Good morning” and sending it as a direct message, meanwhile, isn’t reflexive at all; on the contrary, it’s an active decision you made. You looked for that coworker, clicked their profile, then used your fingers to type a message. That effort, small as it is, changes the context and meaning of the statement. Even if the literal words are only “Good morning,” the context creates the expectation that you want…something. That can feel weird. The good news: we now understand why this is weird, which means we can make it less weird.
The solution: explain why you’re reaching out. It’s really not any more complicated than that.
Don’t say hello without context, and don’t ask someone if they “have time to talk.” Always give a reason why you want to talk to someone.
Reach out to team members and offer to help
Whenever a new person joins my team, I like to reach out and tell them I’m around if they have any questions.

I do this to be helpful, first and foremost, but it’s also a great opening for a conversation. I’ll ask how people are finding the job so far, then maybe ask some questions about where they live. Remember: you’re not going to run into new employees in the break room, so you’ve got to create these sorts of conversations yourself. It can feel a little weird, but it’s the only way these chats will happen.
Respond privately to comments made in public channels
Another way to start a conversation is to respond privately to something someone said in a public channel. My Zapier coworker Katie told me a few ways she’s done this over the years, and I think it’s a great list.

Katie actually reached out to me a year ago with one of these strategies.

It turns out I really like being told I’m funny, because now we talk regularly. I’m not sure what that says about me.
Be vulnerable
Another idea is to share something about yourself. My coworker JC calls this offensive vulnerability, and it works.

It’s also okay if you can’t think of a reason to talk: Just explain that all you want to do is say hello. I find this is enough to remove the weirdness of just saying “hi,” especially if you frame it using a little humor. That’s my general strategy.

Don’t take delays personally
Did you reach out to someone? Good. Now go do something else.
It can be tempting to leave the window open and wait for a response, and sometimes people will respond immediately. But sometimes they won’t, and that’s okay. Everyone at your company has things to do, and that means not responding to every message right away. This can be a bit of an adjustment if you’re accustomed to in-person conversation, but it’s important that you get used to it. It’s nothing personal—just the nature of online communication.
You, presumably, also have things you should be doing. Do them! You’ll hear back eventually.



Respect the back-and-forth
The best in-person conversations are not one-sided—they have a natural give and take. Online conversation also works best this way, even if it doesn’t happen in real time. If you want your conversations to feel natural, you need to respect this back-and-forth. This means asking a question, waiting for people to respond, and only following up after that happens.
Do not, under any circumstances, send a trickle of messages to someone you only kind of know. That is going to be weird for everyone involved.

Don’t make it weird. Send one message, then wait for a response. Assume that your coworker saw the message and will respond, or not, on their own time. Don’t follow up on the same day (unless you actually need a response, for work reasons).
There’s always the chance that someone legitimately didn’t see your message, or saw it and forgot to respond. If you think that’s the case, it’s probably okay to send another message, ideally the following day. But if someone continually doesn’t respond when you reach out, please: take the hint. Some people won’t want to talk to you outside a work context, and that’s okay. Sure, it would be nice of them to be transparent about it and let you know they’re not interested in chatting, but regardless, don’t press the issue.
Respect people’s status and set your own
Apps like Slack let you set a status, which is a great way to let people know that you’re doing focused work or that you’re otherwise unable to respond. Pay attention to these and don’t reach out to chat when someone is busy.
For example, I try not to use Slack while I’m writing, so I set my status in Slack to “Writing,” complete with a typewriter emoji.

My coworkers know that I won’t respond quickly when they see this status.
You should also set up a status for yourself. You can do this manually, or you make it so your Slack status changes automatically based on your calendar, time tracking app, or to-do list. Either way, it helps your coworkers know when you’re available to chat and when you’re not.
Small interactions matter
Working from home can be lonely, but it doesn’t have to be. It’s just a matter of learning how to communicate in a different environment. And you should take the time to learn this skill because small interactions throughout the day matter—and they can lead to lasting relationships.
We’re all human. We want to be seen by others, and to see others clearly. We need connection. There’s nothing weird about that. Just take the time to learn how to best do this online, in ways that make everyone comfortable.
Speaking of weird: the above screenshots where I was being all creepy were staged.

Just wanted to clear that up.

How UK startups are keeping their EU connections alive after Brexit,Andrea Hak,2021/01/29,"
For many startups across the UK, Brexit has been like trying to put together new IKEA furniture with random pieces missing and blank pages in the instruction booklet. 
With freshly published trade negotiations being test-driven for the first time and the UK’s own new national regulations in several key areas still yet to be decided, there’s a lot of uncertainty in the air. But perhaps the biggest question facing founders right now is how they’re going to hold on to their EU customers and partners in a post-Brexit world. 
We reached out to five UK-based startups that recently took part in the EU-backed Data Market Services Accelerator to find out how they’re maintaining their connections on the continent.
Establish an EU-based subsidiary
For founders with established EU customers, keeping a foot in the EU has been key. 
One such founder is Romain Eude, CEO of Utelly, a content discovery technology that solves (these days) the potentially relationship destroying question: “What should we watch tonight?” 
Using metadata aggregation, intelligent cross-linking between assets, AI/ML data enrichments, and more they’ve helped media companies streamline cross-service discovery for their viewers. 
Founded in 2013, when the Brexit referendum hit in 2016, Utelly already had customers across the UK, Belgium, Finland, and France. After the news came out, some of their customers soon began asking what would happen if the UK eventually did leave the Union. Eude and his team knew they needed to take action early:
“We decided to work out a way to structure the company to protect ourselves from Brexit and ensure we could continue business as normal as possible.” 
As a limited company established in the UK, with both private and public investors, they consulted with an accountant as to the best course of action. Ultimately, they decided to establish a subsidiary in Amsterdam with a one-to-one relationship. 
Their subsidiary now takes care of all business in Europe and the limited company continues taking on all customers from outside the EU. Their staff is now split between these two offices.
“Bottomline, I’ve now doubled my work on the admin side. We have two offices, two accounting firms, two payrolls, we have two consolidated accounts so there’s overhead there. But, on the upside, commercially — and that’s what we wanted to optimize for — there was no question. The price we paid was some money and obviously some headache to set it up, but we were able to keep things business as usual for both our EU and UK based customers.”
For other UK startups thinking about opening an EU based entity, Eude shared:
“I would consider what you’re trying to optimize for. If it’s just an administrative problem you’re trying to solve, any part of Europe will work. But if you want to set up an operation there, you have to consider more questions such as: what is it like to do business there? Is there access to talent? Is there a language barrier? Are tax incentives important for you?” Eude says.
“It’s hard enough to get new customers, but when you have unknowns, you’ll have the risk-takers who won’t stress about it and you’ll have the others who will say ‘let me wait and see.’ For small companies that can be the worst news because wait and see doesn’t pay the bills.”
Join an EU-based accelerator or incubator
Mohammed Rahman, COO of Digipharm
Digipharm is at the forefront of the shift towards value-based healthcare, working to automate and execute value-based reimbursement agreements and ultimately help patients get the best possible care. As a business looking to help disrupt an entire industry, it was essential for them to be able to access and work with different stakeholders across borders.
“It was a massive shock when the UK voted to leave the EU. Everyone actually thought that the UK would eventually reverse that decision. But it didn’t happen,”  says Digipharm’s Chief Operations Officer, Mohammed Rahman.
After Brexit, Rahman and his team noticed that “a lot of companies in Europe, when we would speak to them, had a small fear factor of dealing with companies that were based in the UK. Similarly, when we tried to reach out to investors two or three years ago, one of the key criteria was that you had to be based in the EU.” 
Especially from an investment perspective, there are a number of grants that EU-based companies can benefit from. While, as of January 2021, the UK is still participating in the Horizon program (of which Digipharm was a recipient in 2020), a number of others have now been canceled or are now inaccessible to UK startups. And perhaps it’s only a matter of time until the Horizon program is also closed to the UK.
“As a result, we just wanted to be ahead of the game and be available in both Europe and the UK so we opened an entity in Switzerland. It wasn’t primarily because of Brexit, it was just that certain countries demanded that you have a foothold inside of Europe and, from a trade agreement perspective, Switzerland is still part of the EU.”
For startups considering taking this step but uncertain where to start, Rahman says:
“I would definitely recommend other startups to do their research as to which country offers the best benefits for startups. Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland for instance all have startup incubator and accelerator programs. You can really benefit from having these remote offices out there and it’s a very low cost, in some instances completely subsidized.” 
Digipharm themselves have been part of the DMS incubator in the Netherlands, Hatch CoLab in Switzerland, BlockRocket in Germany, and now SimDH in the UK. 
“Getting help from other startups in that environment is also really valuable because you’re all on a journey at the same time so you can learn from each other. This is massively beneficial for getting advice on how to operate your business, target your audience, and raise funding for your startup.”
Reach out to experts and be prepared to educate EU-based partners
Jessica Mendoza, founder of Monadd
Brexit was already in the works when Jessica Mendoza founded Monadd in 2018. If you’ve ever faced the digital hassle of updating all your different accounts when you move, Monadd has you covered. Its platform allows you to easily update your address or cancel services across multiple accounts.
While they had mainly been working with users moving within the UK and from the EU to the UK, they’re quickly adding more functionality to move beyond that point. However, Monadd has hit a few roadblocks.
“Brexit has made it more challenging to work with local governments in the EU. It’s a discovery process for the startup but also for the other end,” Mendoza says.
Many of these local governments are still unfamiliar with the implications of Brexit. But this comes as no surprise as many UK leaders seem to be just as clueless.
Being armed with information to educate, not only your business, but also your EU-based customers and partners is key. She offered four great tips to get started.
1. Understand the basics — “To prepare for the transition, I first found a really helpful checklist on gov.uk of things that you need to do in the countdown to Brexit, so I used that as my baseline.”
2. Reach out to experts — “Contact the Department of International Trade (DIT), they do a lot of work with startups and help them with this process.”
3. Get professional legal advice — DIT also connected Mendoza with some lawyers who could help her iron out the legal details. “We’re lucky to have had great legal advice, especially in terms of developing data transfer agreements. Having great lawyers is key.”
4. Connect with other startups — “Also know what’s going on in the startup community. Often the learning process isn’t just discovery, it’s also peer-to-peer and understanding what other startups have been doing and what’s been working for them.”
However, the future of data transfers still presents much uncertainty for Monadd. As Mendoza shared, at the moment the company is keeping data transfers within the UK and hosting all of their data in AWS servers, allowing them to operate in the EU for the time being. They’re now starting to contact different providers within the EU and familiarize themselves with the different options available. 
“In terms of data transfers, there was a framework in place that was established across the EU, but now the UK won’t be able to use it anymore. The country is going to have to figure out its own way to trade with the EU. Investors coming from the EU will also need to decide what it will mean for them to have their money in the UK. I’m lucky that I haven’t accepted EU funding yet, but there is interest in that realm.”
Consider your options
Graeham Douglas, CEO of Arete Medical Technologies
For many pre-revenue and research phase startups, Brexit has had less impact on their current operations but has factored more heavily into their plans for the future. 
Graeham Douglas, CEO of Arete Medical Technologies, is developing a respiratory preventative health product for asthma, COPD, and other long-term lung conditions. By having patients breathe into their sensor-driven device, medical professionals can identify disease subtypes, better target drugs, and improve medical prevention.
Luckily for Douglas, operating in the MedTech industry, there haven’t been too many changes in terms of data regulations or access to funding after Brexit. However, it has pushed the company to tweak its strategy.
“It did force us to take a more serious look earlier at the US as a market. In medical technology, even US companies often look to the EU first. In part, it’s because the regulations in the EU were easier to comply with for new products. But after the Harmonized European Medical Device Regulations come through in May, this will no longer be the case as the systems will be quite similar,” Douglas explains. 
“But the general uncertainty of market access in Europe did force us to look more at the US and there are some positive aspects of the US as a good initial market for a product like ours. It doesn’t mean that we’ll only look at one or the other, we’ll go to both regions, we’re just considering which one might be the best option for our first launch.”
The major changes that the pandemic has brought to our working conditions have also facilitated this shift.
“In the past, in the US they wouldn’t take you seriously if you didn’t have an office there or if you didn’t have someone on the ground but, now that everyone is video conferencing, this has completely changed.” 
Factor your customers’ demands into your post-Brexit strategy
Christopher Jackson, CEO of Advanced Infrastructure, and Lily Cairns Haylor, the company’s Chief Customer Officer
Like Arete Medical Technologies, being in the pre-revenue stage, Advanced Infrastructure also hasn’t felt a huge impact on their business yet. Instead, Brexit has brought a lot of uncertainties and question marks for the way moving forward. 
The startup is tackling the problem of greenwashing by developing data and analytics tools that make carbon emissions accounting and certification more transparent and traceable.
For Lily Cairns Haylor, Chief Customer Officer, one of her biggest concerns for the future is aligning legislation.

“We’re a startup in the energy sector so it’s very relevant to us what approaches countries take to things like emissions reporting and emissions reduction strategies. The UK has just dropped out of the EU emissions trading scheme and it’s creating its own. But this needs cross country collaboration to be effective.”
CEO, Christopher Jackson, agreed, “The UK’s left a lot of EU institutions so, for example, there’s a grid operating association which the UK isn’t a part of now. So any lobbying we can do is reduced. The way I see it, the UK has two options. The legislation can diverge, and then you end up being excluded from the EU market, or the legislation can just mirror the EU legislation in which case you have no control over it and you can’t influence it. In both cases you stand to lose either market or influence and that’s strategically naive.”
Along with the lack of clarity around legislation, access to EU grant funding has also been up in the air.
“Although Horizon2020 grants have continued, not all of the grant programs have. For example, the EIC accelerator is no longer offering funding to UK-based companies after Brexit,” Cairns Haylor says. 
With all of these factors to consider, the team at Advanced Infrastructure has decided to delay any final decisions until they have further information.

“The strategic choice we have to make is: do we learn a whole new set of rules or do we simply incorporate a subsidiary in the EU. There is a strong case for the second because our customers are more comfortable with it and it could be a similar administrative workload than trying to figure out the regulation changes,” Jackson explains.

“We’re testing the market now. We’re going to see what traction we get with customers, what their demands are, and the impact on the investment environment before we make a decision.” 
Moving forward
Brexit has left us with a lot of unknowns. But, if anyone is equipped to navigate them, it’s the country’s innovative startup community. While there was an air of underlying nostalgia in each interview we conducted, the ambition to grow, disrupt, and experiment with new solutions hasn’t faded. 
While Britain may have left the EU, its startups aren’t giving up on the relationship. 
TNW is a partner in the DMS Accelerator. Applications for year 3 of the program open February 15th, 2021 and are open to startups both in the UK and across Europe. Check it out here!

Week-by-week breakdown of my $15M virtual fundraising journey in 2020,Thierry Schellenbach,2021/01/15,"
My company was positioned to grow rapidly in 2020 — but that meant raising growth capital remotely in a shifting VC landscape. We ended up closing a $15 million Series A without ever meeting an investor in person. Here’s what that process looked like, along with a week-by-week breakdown of how it progressed. 
Let’s start by setting the scene. When I co-founded Stream in 2014, I could never have guessed how 2020 would transform our business. As makers of enterprise-grade APIs that engineering teams use to build in-app chat and social activity feeds, we saw explosive growth last year with our technology in fields like healthcare, edtech, and virtual event live streaming. Suddenly, we found ourselves seeking Series A funding to help us make the most out of that opportunity and deliver more value faster to our growing customer base. 
That fundraising push came much sooner than we’d expected — and it came amidst the chaos of the global pandemic. I knew our team couldn’t afford to lose focus on ambitious product goals, and I wondered what challenges our newly remote reality would present in the world of venture capital. 
As it turned out, many core principles of the fundraising process had not changed — but certain parts of the landscape look very different now, and they require an updated set of skills, tools, and expectations to navigate successfully. 
With the odds for startup success already so low and with many other factors in flux right now, I hope to give fellow founders a leg up by sharing what I learned over the 12-week period that led us to close a $15 million Series A without ever meeting an investor in person. 
Building a strong foundation  
When I say it took us 12 weeks to close our Series A, I’m not counting the fundamental projects that I’ve been working on constantly with my co-founder, our board, and our leadership team ever since we completed the Techstars accelerator program five years ago. 
At its core, fundraising is still about convincing investors that they’ll earn a strong return by investing in your company. It’s what you do when you’re not actively fundraising that sets you apart: talking to customers, solving their problems, shipping your product, and building a strong brand. I owe a debt of gratitude to the VCs and fellow founders who spent hours workshopping my pitch deck and introduced me to people who would understand the value of Stream’s products. 
The best advice I can give at this stage is this: only talk to potential investors when you’re ready to actively raise money. 
Others will tell you to keep in touch constantly, attempting to build and maintain investor relationships over time — but is that really the best use of your time when you have a product to build and customers to talk to? 
Venture capital firms looking to beat their competition will still reach out to you before you’re ready. I’ve found that talking to them too early can distract you from following through on the goals that make your company attractive to investors in the first place. 
Now is also a good time to mention that this article will be most helpful to established startups that have already received seed funding and are now moving into a new growth stage. There are many more variables at play in the seed stage, and I recommend starting with Brad Feld’s book Venture Deals and Alex Iskold’s blog Startup Hacks, along with educational resources from Techstars and Y Combinator.
Now let’s dive into the 12 pivotal weeks of my fundraising journey.
Weeks 1-2: Outreach & connections 
By May 2020, we knew we were ready to talk seriously to investors. I reached out to VCs I knew from my time at Techstars NYC and in the startup world, and I asked our existing investors and community mentors to make as many introductions as they could. 
I can’t overemphasize this step: it’s nearly impossible to connect with a new investor without a warm introduction from a trusted contact. If there ever was a time to leverage your network, this is it. 
During these first couple of weeks, your hours of practice with the pitch deck will pay off. On initial calls, you’ll make the case for your value prop, mission, and vision as succinctly as possible. You’ll talk finance at a high level. I recommend rating VCs in terms of desirability and starting with your second tier for some practice before pitching the top firms. 
At this point in the process, the biggest difference between traditional fundraising and remote fundraising is the sheer number of investors with whom you can meet. In the past, when I’d visit VC firms’ offices in person, travel and logistics limited me to two meetings per day — maybe three if their locations and schedules lined up perfectly. In the spring of 2020, I set a personal record of eight VC meetings in one day.  
Meeting with more VCs in a compressed time period isn’t just efficient — it can also work in your favor by creating competition between firms. When the time comes for negotiations, one term sheet isn’t enough. You’ll need at least two in front of you in order to have a competitive edge.
The increased VC exposure is great, but remember that the converse is also true: investors are talking to many more founders than they could in the past, so the bar for your company to stand out is higher. In this sense, the extensive review and revision of your pitch deck and the warm introduction from a trusted contact are even more consequential than before. 
Not every conversation will get results. From a founder’s perspective, it’s not always clear which niches within tech a VC focuses on or how yours may or may not fit into their portfolio strategy. Don’t get discouraged — I see a lot of first-time founders bogged down by VC opinions. 
Remember that practically every unicorn out there was once rejected by dozens of VCs during early rounds and that it’s difficult for anyone to predict which startups will succeed. 
Weeks 3-4: Deeper conversations
After that first round of intro calls, we started working more closely with investors who expressed interest. This process doesn’t have to be linear, though, and without the need for in-person meetings, it’s even more flexible. We continued to have new intro calls all the way up to the signing of our term sheet. 
As we got deeper into talks with interested VCs, we created a virtual data room and worked on aggregating and sharing more granular financial data. I have to admit that we hit some roadblocks here — it was harder than we expected to get accurate financial reporting out of our billing system.
Billing systems and finance present a dilemma for many tech-first startups: in your earliest stages, you’re likely putting all your resources into product development and not into building out these types of systems. But if you grow as planned, you’ll eventually need them, both for scaling internal operations and for growth stage fundraising rounds.
 Somewhere along the way, you’ll need to prioritize financial reporting systems. I’d suggest doing it sooner than we did so you’re prepared to answer investors’ questions with less manual digging. 
One more note on talking to investors in this exploratory phase: it doesn’t have to be uptight and overly stressful. 
You’ll find guides that recommend obsessing about formalities like attire, your Zoom background, and more. The idea is that a degree of old-school polish will set you apart from so many others pitching their companies from behind the same device’s screen. It’s not a bad idea, but it wasn’t my experience. 
If anything, virtual meetings gave me a chance to be more myself and listen more carefully, so I could answer investors’ questions openly and honestly instead of trying to recite prepared responses. Do what feels right to you, but I think a natural balance of professionalism and approachability works well here. 
Weeks 5-6: Customer testimonials 
At this point, we were having multiple followup calls with several very interested VCs, and it came time for them to talk to our customers. Some of our largest customers were extremely gracious about finding time to talk to our potential investors, and I’m grateful for that.
 If you’ve gotten this far in the startup ecosystem, chances are you’ve figured out how to make sure customers’ priorities are reflected in your roadmap. 
Now, the relationships you’ve built with those customers become even more important. As with in-person fundraising, your ability to connect investors with satisfied customers will be critical to your success. 
Weeks 7-8: Choosing the right fit & signing the term sheet 
By the end of month two, we had received four offers. We found that GGV Capital’s areas of focus and expertise were a remarkable match for our vision, so we ultimately signed their term sheet. 
GGV is deeply involved in the new wave of developer-driven software, recognizing the power of modern developer tools to streamline and democratize software engineering processes. A number of top-tier companies in their portfolio — Agora, HashiCorp, Kong, Slack, and Zendesk, to name a few — provide similar services to ours at the intersection of developer tools and chat/messaging. 
And as an added bonus, we found that many of GGV’s other portfolio companies had a need for a chat API product like ours. If we can help solve problems for those companies, we’ll be well-positioned to hit our growth metrics for future fundraising rounds.  
Remember that as things start to get exciting, it’s easy to feel pressured by the fast pace of new developments and offers. Now, more than ever, is the time to slow down and make sure you get everything right. 
Just as your VC firm has been doing their due diligence to research your company, you’ll want to talk to other founders in their portfolio and get a better feel for the firm’s reputation beyond what you see on paper. 
We checked in with many of GGV’s portfolio companies — even some that had failed — and everyone was extremely positive about their collaboration with GGV. We were impressed by this, as most larger VC firms have several founders who are upset with them.
Weeks 9-12: Final steps 
The signed term sheet creates a framework for the deal to go through, but there’s still more work to finalize a longer-form legal contract and receive your cash deposit. This process took us about four weeks. 
With the bulk of the fundraising work complete for now, a (virtual) champagne toast was in order. Of course, the work of following through on our mission and vision and delivering promised growth has still only just begun. 
The future of tech fundraising 
Startups and the venture capital ecosystem will continue to face uncertainty as global events progress and new technology evolves to meet our changing needs. I hope what I learned while fundraising in 2020 will help teams working to build that technology secure the resources they need to grow and succeed. 
Contrary to some dire predictions, funding for creative technology solutions hasn’t dried up — but a few thoughtful tweaks to your virtual fundraising process can greatly increase your chances of closing a deal.

Why no-code tools in startups should remain niche,Anton Vasin,2021/01/12,"
No-code is a broad term. It describes a vast set of products that help end-users assemble web pages and applications without hiring developers.
In recent years, it has also become an ideology of sorts (praised, for example, in this Forbes column): a promise to get rid of all complications that are intertwined with IT development — its proverbial high costs, unpredictability, and difficulty to scale the teams fast enough.
However, I’d argue the promise is often exaggerated, as the proposed approaches are oversold and/or not particularly new. Still, niche solutions from the no-code toolbox might get your tasks in certain pipeline parts done surprisingly well.
So let’s pick apart the ideology and get into what startups and businesses should consider when thinking about no-code solutions.
No-code is not particularly new
Speaking of no-code, we usually think of it as a recent development, a step made in the late 2010s to emancipate the world from expensive engineers. Be it Notion, Mailchimp, Voiceflow, or Bubble, companies associated with no-code approaches are usually recently found startups. But is the approach actually that recent?
In fact, no-code-like tools were there from the very beginning of the computer era. Take Microsoft Excel: it’s basically a way to embark on visual point-and-click methods to create a simple database instead of using SQL. Or any graphical operating system like Windows, Mac OS, or Ubuntu: they give users a command line functionality combined with visual means, without the need to learn code-like commands. 
This point also perfectly illustrates the limitations of no-code. It is no coincidence that most operating systems still have a command line-based core and give their power users access to it: some things are just intrinsically difficult to visualize. 
Yes, a lot of people don’t touch the Mac OS X Terminal and never will, but in most cases, somebody terminal-savvy needs to be around to perform any actions above a certain level of complexity.
No-code limits patterns of thought
The visualization and simplification, these pillars of no-code, come at a price: no-code tools usually nudge a client to a limited number of patterns — in fact, that’s exactly what allows them to get rid of the code. 
Say, only a certain number of product management techniques go hand in hand with no-code task management tools such as, say, Trello. As a result, the idea itself might become stale. 
The problem with patterns is that they deny you the possibility of learning. A salesperson can’t become an expert in business only by using landing page presets. The code usually gives you almost infinite possibilities of configuring the system (open-source culture and the competition of approaches, programming languages and libraries usually guarantee it in any given field). 
It might not be that important for the first project, but crucial for the growth and future of any professional. There are some domains such as computations or high-load systems performance where you can not simply ‘no-code’ your way out of complexity.

That’s why I and my team at Readymag try to avoid staleness at all costs in our solutions, never limiting our users to presets, always giving them access to a clean canvas. We also give our users tools for coding.
Good tools have precise scope
However, I firmly believe that no-code approaches are great when it comes to a narrow-scope task. Take Zapier, a tool for API integration, that we actually use in Readymag; or Airtable, a tool to automate the creation of CMS. 
The idea here is not to waste your time on something that can be easily automated and configured, still use the power of engineering for the necessary parts. 
Another example is specialized e-commerce tools such as Stripe or Ecwid. Instead of creating our own e-commerce sub-tool, we at Readymag have integrated them. We try to leave each part of the pipeline to the specialized tool, be it code or no-code. 
And we think of Readymag as another such tool — a web editor, great for interactive graphics and interactive UX, but possibly powered up with additional APIs or custom code for larger and more complex projects. A full-fledged no-code approach is limiting, but a specific no-code tool might significantly increase your development process. 
Summing it up — never buy into no-code as a mantra, but always keep an eye out for its niche practical uses.

3 telltale signs your startup has the potential to be disruptive,Razvan Romanescu,2021/01/11,"
There isn’t a term or phrase that’s more buzzworthy than “disruptive” in the startup world. Every startup claims that they are disruptive and that their product or service is going to disrupt the industry.
The truth is that most startups aren’t disrupting anything. What does it mean to “disrupt” and how do you know whether or not a startup is truly disruptive?
While it’s a term that might seem to be fairly new — it’s thrown around nonstop now throughout startup culture — disruption has been happening throughout time. The automobile replaced the horse and buggy, becoming the more convenient mode of transportation. The laptop made bulky home PCs less convenient, and then the smartphone completely changed how we access the internet.
These are all examples of disruption, and they all became the industry standard. A great example is the mobile phone industry. How many people do you see walking around with flip phones? Essentially nobody.
The majority of the population has an iPhone or an Android device — even grandparents. Why? Because they are the industry standard. Those devices disrupted the cell phone industry and continue to dominate.
Would you trade in your iPhone or Android and go back to a flip phone? Of course not. They have completely changed how we access information, perform day-to-day tasks, connect, and communicate with people, etc.
My latest business venture, Gamelancer, has received a fair of press lately and has even been labeled as a disruptor in the gaming industry. This made me ponder what actually makes a startup “disruptive” and I’ve managed to narrow it down to the three telltale signs below — if you demonstrate these, your startup has the potential to be disruptive.
1. Your product or service is very simple
A lot of the misconceptions regarding disruption centers around the thought that a product or service has to be wildly new or advanced. This simply isn’t the case. Some of the most disruptive startups created something extremely simple.
The key is being able to clearly explain what it is that your product or service does, and why it’s a better option for the consumer. You don’t have to try to impress with fancy industry jargon, either. Keep your message simple and explain it using common language — like you are explaining it to a friend or family member.
Look at Uber. It’s fair to say that they disrupted the public transportation industry. “Call a cab” has universally been replaced with “call an Uber.” They also have a very simple product. They made transportation more convenient.
Uber as a service was so easy for its users to grasp and understand, and the company intelligently rolled out its launch. Early users needed to understand the value of Uber, so they strategically launched in New York City.
When you think of taxi cabs New York immediately comes to mind. Its residents, visitors, and tourists hail cabs around the clock. This allowed them to introduce their offering to potential consumers that would instantly understand the value.
The simplicity of Uber was one of the main reasons it was able to explode in terms of user growth at such a rapid rate. It wasn’t complicated at all. It was easy and convenient, which made users instantly adapt.
Why would anyone use a traditional taxi service these days instead of calling an Uber? It’s more convenient and affordable. Being so simple and easy to understand is what led to Uber being disruptive.

2. You change users’ behaviors
You cannot come to the market with a product or service and just claim it’s better than the competition. If your only selling point is stating that “it’s better than” the other options out there you’re not disrupting anything.
You might have a great product or service and you might generate a lot of revenue — but that alone doesn’t equate disruption. We can use Uber again as an example. Their service completely changed the way consumers commute.
They changed how people get to work, meet up with friends, etc. Some consumers made radical changes in their lives, even selling their cars because Uber was so convenient. That is what it means to disrupt an industry.
Some companies disrupt several times over, and an example that most can relate to is Netflix. Remember when it first launched and you would receive that red envelope in the mail with the DVD you selected online? You no longer had to leave the house and visit the movie rental store.
Then, they pivoted to streaming, again disrupting the industry. Now you didn’t even have to leave the couch to visit the mailbox. Disruption doesn’t have to be a one-and-done play — and Netflix is a prime example of that.
3. You serve a neglected market with a large number of users
Some of the biggest opportunities for disruption exist in industries that have remained unchanged for a while. This could be for a variety of reasons — typically the industry leaders are on cruise control when things are running so smoothly and they don’t feel the need to introduce anything new.
This opens the door for innovation and creativity to thrive, especially if the industry is craving something new and exciting. This is how my new startup Gamelancer was conceived — we felt the community was craving something new and exciting.
The gaming industry was already booming, and the recent worldwide pandemic has introduced even more people to gaming. Our platform allows gamers to play their favorite games with their fans, followers, and other members of the community.
Again, it’s simple while changing users’ behavior in an industry that while thriving, has been somewhat neglected — because it’s been doing so well
Final thoughts
A startup doesn’t have to be labeled as being disruptive to succeed. There are plenty of successful startups that do very well. They deliver an outstanding service or product, have happy customers, and enjoy continued growth.
But, for a startup to potentially make waves and truly disrupt, the three points above must be checked off. Those that do could potentially be the next Uber or Netflix, completely changing the behavior of millions of users.

"How startups are using XR to disrupt how we work, learn, and play",Andrea Hak,2021/01/8,"
Emerging tech like AI, robotics, IoT, blockchain, and machine learning are kicking our organizations into high gear by catapulting our ability to process data, build products, and automate repetitive tasks.
Andy Lurling, Founding Partner of impact-driven VC firm, LUMO Labs believes this shift will pave the way for us to find new and better solutions to some of society’s biggest problems.
“If you want to create social impact fast, technology is the way. For example, with AI and data, you can find patterns so much faster and come up with a thousand alternatives that would take people years to work on.”
But in our ‘data-driven’ era, there is one fledgling technology that could (ironically) help us humanize the future of tech.
XR technology is based on enhancing the human experience by bringing our senses into the mix. This helps, not only to make the experience more realistic, but also makes it more personalized and emotional. 
“Take for instance, a digital twin of a city, where you can immediately see all the possibilities instead of simply looking at a spreadsheet. You could ask yourself ‘what would be the effect of having 10,000 fewer ambulances in the city?’ If you instead simulate the experience of being there, it would trigger another part of your brain where emotion is also involved.”
“In a spreadsheet, that’s just a number but if you’re in a VR, where you can see the actual effect, you might have another outcome,” he said.
Speaking with Lurling at ISE’s Rise Spotlight event on XR in Today’s Reality, he shared five examples across industries of startups that are harnessing the power of XR to solve some of society’s biggest challenges.

Learning 4.0
Education, whether in the classroom or in the workplace has been in need of disruption for a long time coming now. 
“We’re still in an educational system that was developed for the industrial revolution but we’re now in 4.0 and we’re still mainly taught by reading textbooks. But the world changes so fast now (especially the world of tech) that, after publishing a book, it quickly becomes outdated,” Lurling said.
This year, the experience of having to study and work from home really pushed a lot of companies and schools to begin using this tech for the first time and, after getting a taste of the potential benefits it can bring, it’s unlikely to slow down. A study by PwC found that VR learners are:

4x faster to train than in the classroom
275% more confident to apply skills learned after training
4x more focused than their e-learning peers

The study also found that, because of the more immersive learning experience, VR learners are 3.75x more emotionally connected to content than classroom learners. And this emotional connection can make a huge difference when it comes to really understanding and retaining knowledge. 
In the high-pressure, fast-paced environment healthcare workers face every day, staying on top of workplace training is extremely difficult. But this can lead to deadly consequences. According to VR startup, Virti, one of the leading causes of death globally is actually medical error. 
The company is using on-demand VR based training, to help improve accessibility, scalability, and knowledge retention of workplace trainings for medical professionals. 
Rather than learning in a classroom or from a text, simulating a patient care experience helps increase a learner’s emotional connection to the content and empathy, thereby greatly reducing the risk of medical error and improving patient safety. 

And it’s not just the medical industry that could benefit from XR tech. 
With such wide-ranging clients as KLM, the BBC, and Gazprom, Warp VR is helping train engineers in workplace safety, simulate sales trainings, and prepare staff for emergency situations. 
Imagine how nerve-wracking it would be to walk into a meeting with a board of directors and pitch your company’s product for the first time? Instead of throwing sales newbies into the deep end, VR training can help provide a more lifelike training experience that prepares them for the real thing. 

Using sensory reality to treat mental health 
There are billions of people across the globe living with mental health issues, from depression and anxiety to dementia. And leading experts from the WHO, the Red Cross, and academic institutions like Harvard University have warned that Covid-19 will only exacerbate this problem, potentially leading to a mental health crisis. 
But XR technology is providing new opportunities and solutions. While we may not be able to fully understand what patients are going through, by combining sight, sound, smell, and touch, psychologists and researchers have been able to simulate emotional experiences, helping them treat patients with different psychological conditions.
One company making particularly interesting progress in this field is the Netherlands-based Sensiks. They teamed up with a clinical psychologist from the University of Amsterdam to help find new ways to treat phobias and the effects of emotional trauma, with a special focus on patients with PTSD. 
With their sensory reality pods that go beyond visuals to include heat, wind, airflow, tremble, light, and sound effects, they’ve been able to recreate the sense of being in wartime or other traumatizing situation. 

This has helped patients to draw out their emotions during therapy sessions, and psychologists to study the effects of different treatments. 
This year they announced a new partnership to provide a short-term treatment strategy for traumatized healthcare workers during COVID-19.
As the company’s philosophy states: “What computer programming did for the digitization of society and economy in the last two decades is what Sensory Reality will do for understanding and optimizing the mental state of human beings.”
Taking consumer personalization to the next level 
This year, with consumers sheltering in their homes, we saw more and more marketing teams begin to experiment with AR and VR tech. From “try before you buy” to virtual expanded product views that allow customers to see the fine details of a product before they drop it into their online shopping cart. 
But Lurling believes this is only the beginning. With looming budget cuts, advertisers will need to focus spending on more targeted bets that will reach higher ROI thresholds. Emerging tech, with a major boost from XR, will be the key to the future of hyper-personalized advertising in our homes and on the streets. 
One great example he shared was Tropos AR, an advertisement solution that allows consumers to choose which types of products they’re most interested in. The solution then uses a combination of AR and blockchain to share personalized ads, discounts, and coupons.

“Tropos AR uses a perfect convergence of technology. What they do really well is that they make a connection with the customer. When you go to a shopping street, you get all the advertisements. But Tropos makes it so that you only see the advertisements that you’re interested in.”
Studies show that 43% of consumers are willing to adopt store tech if it alleviates time and ease. In fact, Shopify found that products with AR content have a 94% higher conversion rate. 
This means, rather than investing in a billboard that only a small section of your target audience may see on the high street, you can instead reach them directly with personalized ads. In this way, putting consumers in control provides better, more personalized deals for them and much better ROI for companies. 
Gamifying our physical health
For most of us, exercise is that annoying chore that no amount of athleisure wear or peppy gym instructors can make even remotely enticing. But what if we could somehow actually make working out fun?
While the world of tech has brought us forward in many ways, it also has its drawbacks. The more screen time we spend, the less time we spend on the move. 
“In 2019, the WHO published a report showing that 80% of young people are developing conditions you normally see in elderly people. And, to a large extent, that group includes gamers,” Lurling said.
In fact, the health organization recently added ‘gaming disorder’ to its list of diseases. But he also believes that XR can provide some solutions that are way more fun than simply hitting the track more often. 
“If you bring a physical element to gaming, you can create an environment which is like Ready Player One,” Lurling said. 
XR is helping us expand our gameplay by combining visuals with interactive touch-based games that follow your body’s movement. And studies show that virtual-reality ‘exergaming’ can actually increase enjoyment and performance.
Eindhoven based Active Sports Arena is one example. Their wire and controller-free VR games are being used by companies to make team building activities and even brainstorming sessions more interactive.

Improving the XR experience 
While XR is helping us in so many ways, in some cases, after prolonged periods of time, VR and AR tech can cause eye strain, headaches, fatigue, and nausea. 
Because the flat plane 3D images we see in XR headsets don’t actually contain real depth, our eyes aren’t able to naturally focus in and out of them as they would with real-life images. But advances in what’s called light-field technology are helping to make XR images more life-like and, of course, easier on the eyes. 
In a market dominated by tech giants, like Facebook’s Oculus, Swiss startup CREAL is bringing some serious competition. Their light-field technology improves depth resolution of virtual objects, allowing them to blend in more easily with the real world. This doesn’t just provide a more immersive virtual experience, it also eliminates the harsh side effects and eye strain.

As we can see, XR is on the rise and it’s only expected to pick up steam moving forward. While the market for AR and VR solutions was less than $12 million in 2019, ABI Research has forecasted the market to exceed $400 million by 2025. 
“I believe in the convergence of technology and that, in the future, our solutions will combine things like AI, machine learning, and blockchain, with XR being how it’s displayed,” Lurling said.
But, while this tech really stepped in during this year to help alleviate the transition to at-home work, learning, patient care, and more, he believes it won’t replace our need for in-person social interaction.
“For learning, shopping, and experiencing, it will grow further. But, my belief is that the social element will shrink after social distancing ends because you can’t replace human connection.”

Need a 2021 work resolution? Procrastinate more,Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten,2021/01/7,"

Last year I bought a rubber buoy to mark the spot where I anchor my boat. What I hadn’t considered though — until I received the deflated buoy — was that I’d have to fill it myself. It made sense, of course, I just hadn’t given it the slightest thought.
This didn’t phase me though, I had a bicycle pump with an adapter, so I’d get it done in no time… but within a minute I was already sweating profusely beginning to doubt if I’d ever inflate it.
The buoy’s air valve was a sturdy one, and it took quite an effort to just get a small amount of air into it. After a few minutes of profuse pumping, I started to think the buoy must have a puncture. No matter how much work I put in, it hardly seemed to move.
[Read: Meet the 4 scale-ups using data to save the planet]
A whole eternity later (or at least that’s what it felt like) my unexpected workout session paid off. The buoy began to inflate a little bit, I kept pumping like crazy, and then suddenly it seemed to fill up completely in one go. My buoy was finally ready to be deployed.
Sounds like a metaphor? Well, I guess it is.
See, I’m a procrastinator. I need time, a deadline, and a reminder — and then a stern warning — to finally get me to make some extra time for the work I need to do. Since we’re entering a new year, I’ve decided it’s the perfect moment to make a change. Am I going to stop procrastinating? Hell no. Instead, I’ve decided to feel better about procrastinating — and here’s where the buoy story comes in.
The thing is, procrastination isn’t ‘doing nothing.’ Just like pumping air into a lifeless buoy, you don’t see any results right away, but you’re laying a foundation for success.
Procrastinating doesn’t just mean you haven’t started the work, it actually signals you’ve begun thinking about the outcome. You’re mentally preparing, turning over ideas in your head, considering them from all angles and how best to implement them.
You should think of work procrastination like marinating your food. It might seem like you’re not doing anything, but it’s actually an essential part of making a great meal.
So I hope you’ll find the time and comfort to procrastinate a little this year. And when you do, please try not to feel guilty about it.
You’re not doing nothing — you’re marinating.

4 founders explain the biggest hurdles to flattening the climate curve in 2021,Andrea Hak,2021/01/6,"
While a lot of our career, personal, and travel plans have been put on hold this year, there’s one thing we as a society cannot afford to put on hold: the fight against climate change. 
Rather than scaling back the progress we’ve made, many are seeing this moment as an opportunity to create a new normal in which sustainability and circularity are integrated into our businesses and daily lives.
With this in mind, Techleap.nl recruited some of the brightest minds in Dutch sustainability tech to join the Rise Programme for up and coming scaleups. The theme for batch two this year was: flattening the climate curve. 
We caught up with four of the Programme’s cohorts to find out what they see as the biggest hurdles to tackling climate change within their industry.
Making sustainable transportation an option for the masses
Transportation is responsible for 30% of the EU’s total CO2 emissions. And cars are the biggest polluters, accounting for 60.7% of CO2 coming from road transportation. 
With the explosion of new electric cars on the market, consumers are being courted with new transportation alternatives and government-backed incentives. But electric car registrations have still only increased incrementally across the EU from just 2% in 2018 to 3.5% in 2019. So what’s holding people back?
While there is a large and growing consumer base who are ready to make the switch, as Lex Hoefsloot, CEO of Lightyear, explained, “If you look at the research into why more people aren’t buying electric cars they come down to: cost, charging, and range. And that’s been the same for the last ten or fifteen years.” 
So-called ‘range anxiety’— or the fear that an electric car could simply run out of electricity at the most inopportune time (like on a dark, creepy horror movie type road at night) — has been one of the biggest concerns voiced by consumers. 
Connected with this are questions about charging infrastructure. There are gas stations set up everywhere, but how many charging points are actually out there for electric cars? What if I want to go on a road trip? Will I have to hitchhike halfway through?
Lightyear is looking to solve both range and charging for consumers who are still on the fence about making the switch to electric. 
“Rather than targeting people already interested in buying an electric car, we want to focus on other people. People who live in apartments and can’t charge at home. Or people who want to drive long distances every day,” Hoefsloot said.
And just how do they plan to do this? 
While studying engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology, Hoefsloot and a team of students were tasked with building and racing a solar car in one year at an annual competition in Australia. After winning the competition with their solar-powered four-seater, Hoefsloot realized that the next step was to bring the concept to the masses. Thus Lightyear was born in 2016.
“We felt, if it’s possible to go from zero to a car built from scratch within a year, and win as well, then the sky’s the limit.”
Set to go into production in 2021, Lightyear One will be one of the first long-range solar electric cars. It has a battery with up to 700km of range plus five square meters of solar panels that add on 12km of range for every hour the car is in the sun. 
They also made the Lightyear One more energy efficient. A normal electric car uses about 200-watt hours per kilometer, while their model uses about 100-watt hours per kilometer. So, for every bit of energy you have, you can go twice the distance. 
As Hoefsloot explained, “Even in The Netherlands – a horribly rainy country – it can charge about 7,000 km per year, which is more than half of what people drive on average in the Netherlands. So in practice, you would only need to charge once every few weeks, rather than every few days.”
The third problem they want to solve for consumers in the future is cost. The Lightyear One will be the company’s first low volume car, but the plan is to later go on to build a high volume model that will be more affordable for a larger audience. 
“A lot of people still don’t have the money to buy an electric car. We shouldn’t judge people for not making the switch because there are simply not enough options on the market yet. That’s why the push coming from the EU with its new incentives for alternative energy vehicles is so important.”
But, for now, Lightyear’s biggest challenge is assembling a winning team that can make their ambitions a reality. They now have a number of vacancies they want to fill on their website. Hoefsloot encouraged anyone who believes they can help the team achieve their ambitions to reach out.
“Frans Timmermans, Vice President of the EU, once said, ‘the biggest misconception is that if you do nothing, everything will stay the same.’ Sometimes, in the Netherlands, I have the feeling that we hold ourselves back. We’re a small country. We’re not the US. And sometimes we start to think: ‘Can we do this? Maybe we should start with a smaller mission?’ But I would encourage anyone who has an idea to just start with it and make it happen,” Hoefsloot said.
Shaping an emission-free energy system
It’s not just our wheels that could use a green energy boost. Moving from the current, fossil fuel-based electricity system, to an all-renewable energy system, is crucial to stopping climate change but also more complex than just installing a lot more solar panels and wind turbines. 
Simon Bushell, CEO of Sympower, believes that “One of the key things we need to do is empower traditional industries to actively contribute to the energy transition. A fully sustainable and interconnected energy system would bring us a big step forward in powering the net-zero future.”  
But, as Bushell explains, it’s not that easy. 
If you look specifically at the electricity system, supply and demand always need to be in balance. In the current model, the large coal and gas-fired power plants that provide electricity constantly look at how much electricity is being used. When they see more is being used, they burn more coal and gas. Similarly, when they see less electricity is being consumed, they reduce output.
What hinders the widespread adoption of renewable energy is that it’s harder to control than fossil fuels.
The challenge with wind and solar energy is that they are variable and not controllable – you can’t just ask a solar plant to produce more electricity, you need the sun to be shining. As increasing numbers of countries are looking to move away from carbon-intensive energy sources, this problem will only become more complex.
Bushell and his team at Sympower realized that the energy transition would require new demand response technology and solutions. That’s why the company focuses on providing flexibility by regulating demand instead of supply. 
Processes such as heating, cooling, ventilation, and water pumping use lots of electricity, however, it’s not necessarily crucial when that electricity is used. Take a fridge, for example – if you turn it off for ten minutes everything inside it will remain cold, but crucially it will use less electricity. On the other hand, you can also make a fridge colder by using more electricity initially, before turning it off for longer. Basically, assets such as fridges can control when electricity is consumed. This is exactly what we do. We make any asset flexible, balancing electricity supply and demand in real-time the same way a coal or gas-fired power plant would.
Sympower has grown rapidly due to a very enthusiastic client base which has helped it spread the word organically. The company is now operating in Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Israel, with plans to expand to three new countries in 2021.
“What we do is something people don’t often know about, so it’s been really cool to see how enthusiastic our clients are to really help enable a fully-renewable energy grid in their country,” said Bushell. 
However, there are still hurdles that Sympower has to overcome to reach a wider audience. Bushell told TNW:
One of the biggest challenges we face is regulation. Before we can start operating in new countries, we need certain regulations to change that will allow us to operate as an independent demand aggregator. Slow regulatory changes are probably our biggest blocker at the moment.
When asked about what the world needs to do now to flatten the climate curve, Bushell told TNW: “I think there’s no silver bullet in the energy transition. If anyone tells you what they do is the one key thing, I would be very skeptical. A combination of solutions is what is actually needed. I do believe that we provide an essential service – the energy transition can’t succeed without flexibility.”
Giving waste a second life
Until recently, a lot of the focus on tackling the climate curve has been centered on improving energy efficiency. It’s only in recent years that waste and the end life of a product or materials have come under closer scrutiny. 
In a TED Talk, Excess Materials Exchange founder, Maayke Aimee Damen, highlighted that, while improving energy efficiency is important, this only accounts for 55% of greenhouse gas emissions. Guess where the other 45% come from: the actual materials/product we produce (including waste).
According to a report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, if we just focused on designing out waste, keeping materials in use, and regenerating farmland in five key areas (steel, plastic, aluminum, cement, and food) we could eliminate 9.3 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions. To put this into perspective, this would be the equivalent of cutting the emissions of every vehicle down to zero.
While this sounds like an amazing opportunity to cut emissions, the truth is, many companies don’t really know where to start. As Damen explained, 
Companies aren’t always aware of what they have because it’s all in different databases and it’s unstructured. Right now they don’t really have an idea of what’s going through their organization. And if they have that, it’s always spread out over different departments, in different formats and databases, some on paper, some online. So if the information is already there, it’s not comparable and it’s dispersed. And that’s where we come in handy.
In 2017, Damen and her co-founder, Christian van Maaren, created Excess Materials Exchange (EME), a self-described ‘dating site’ for excess materials. The team starts out by helping companies to structure the materials and products they have available by providing each one with a ‘Resource Passport’ containing insights into the composition, origin, toxicity, or deconstructability of the item. 
This then allows EME to track and trace these materials throughout the supply chain and match them with other reuse opportunities, either inside or outside of the organization. 
For example, they were able to help one of their customers, Dutch railway company ProRail, match excess rail tracks in one city to other worksites in need of materials across the country. 
This also leads to some unlikely matches. For example, the Netherlands is famous for its tulips, but what happens with leftover flowers after the growing season ends? While in some cases growers have even paid to have someone get rid of the excess flower waste, EME instead has helped connect growers to pigment makers who can reuse them. Clearly, opposites do attract.
And Damen has seen that having a system in place is helping make the business case for recycling much easier:
I think having standardized bookkeeping for resources is going to be a tremendous help in making data-driven decisions. Because that’s what we need if we want to tackle this. We can’t just go on our gut feeling. We see that a lot with circularity ending up as a gimmick. That’s why gathering data is so important.
With a lot of enthusiasm and support coming from their current clients, Damen told TNW that the company’s main goal for 2021 is to attract the investment needed to scale up their operations. 
One piece of advice she would give to companies who really want to begin making a difference is to have clear KPIs in place. 
“The biggest hurdle we see is that the urgency is quite low. People find it hard to relate to something that’s not tangible. It’s on companies right now to reduce their emissions or to start exchanging materials, but they don’t necessarily have a strategy or KPIs to steer them in the right direction. This makes it very hard for individuals within companies who want change to succeed because, if they succeed, there’s no KPI they’re going to be rewarded on and, if they fail, they have a problem. So the incentive scheme isn’t tailored towards taking action in the majority of organizations,” Damen told TNW.
Making international travel faster and greener
Perhaps one of the more difficult sacrifices we’ll have to make to lower our carbon footprint will be our wanderlust. While there are more and more options to cut emissions from our daily commute, for international travel we’re still reliant on flights to get us where we need to go. 
While commercial aviation is only responsible for 3.5% of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions, it’s also growing faster than any other transport sector has increased by 130% over the past two decades. Although electric trains are becoming more popular, a train journey from Amsterdam to Paris or Frankfurt still takes around three to four hours. 
But Hardt Hyperloop is making some exciting new advancements that could cut a three-hour intercity trip down to just 30 minutes. The company’s vision is to replace short-haul air travel across Europe with a 10,000km network of tubes that can zip people and cargo across borders. Not only is the hyperloop system expected to take less time, it’s also powered by renewable energy. 
The energy-efficient tech behind the system is perhaps the most interesting part. Each hyperloop vehicle is pushed through the tube system using a combination of electromagnetic suspension and electric propulsion. This technology, along with the low-pressure environment created within the tubes, helps to propel the vehicles forward at high speeds. 
While it may be a while before we can all jet-set across Europe by tube, Hardt plans to open the first European Hyperloop Center in 2022 where engineers, researchers, and governments can collaborate together to make this futuristic-sounding vision a reality. 
From innovative technology to collecting the right data to government-backed regulations and incentives, there’s still a lot to be done. But one thing we did hear from all of this year’s cohorts was that the most important ingredient is there: the will and motivation to change. As Bushell of Sympower said:
I think it’s definitely starting. I don’t think we’re there yet. But you definitely see that more and more companies are saving energy and reducing CO2 and it’s becoming more important for them. But there’s still a lot of awareness that we could bring.

‘Tangential’ content is the link building tactic your brand is missing out on,Amanda Milligan,2021/01/6,"
Branded content is crucial for many reasons: communicating the value of your product/service, helping people make buying decisions, providing pertinent information to your primary audience, and more.
But if your marketing goals include earning high-quality backlinks, building your brand awareness, and increasing your organic traffic, tangential content needs to be in your content strategy.
So what exactly is it, and how can you incorporate it into your own content calendar?
Defining tangential content
Tangential content is content that is related to a brand’s industry but is not related to its core branding. It doesn’t refer to a product or service offering, nor is it a bottom-of-the-funnel effort to convert.
In the spirit of showing and not telling, here is the difference between content that’s more tangential vs. content that is more topical.
On the top, you see a tangential piece of content by Hershey that provides tips to families on how to be safe when trick-or-treating in 2020. Does this have to do specifically with buying candy? No. But does it provide value to their target audience, candy fans? Yes.
Below that, you’ll see something a little more topical: a recipe that includes a Hershey’s product. Even this piece has a touch of tangential in that it isn’t directly about purchasing the candy, but the candy is necessary for the activity, putting it more on the tangential, product-related side.
Who’s using tangential content
My team and I were wondering the same thing, as we’re huge advocates of the strategy and have been using it for our clients for years. 
So we decided to look into it. We examined the content of all the brands nominated for the 2020 Content Marketing Awards and found a majority of those companies use tangential content on their blog.
That’s a large number of quality content marketing programs using tangential content on their blogs! 
But it’s not just blog content. 31.3% of the brands we analyzed also had tangential off-site content, meaning content they used to acquire earned media. This is what we do at Fractl, and I’ll be showing an example later in the post.
This is why I’m so surprised tangential content isn’t talked about more, and frankly, I think nearly all brands should be giving it a shot because of the advantages it brings.
How you can benefit
Tangential content is powerful for a few reasons.
First, it unlocks a new, broader audience, who becomes aware of your brand and enters the top of your funnel.
Second, since it’s not as salesy, it can help you build backlinks to your site, which builds the authority of your brand and improves the standing of your site in Google’s eyes.
And third, though a bit more nebulously, having to come up with tangential content ideas prompts you to zoom out a bit and explore other issues and interests your audience has, leading to more robust audience personas.
Let’s look at some real examples of how these benefits come into play.
A great example of on-site content is Canva’s Color wheel, which helps you determine which colors go well together.
I’m assuming Canva wanted to broadly target people interested in design elements, as they offer a design tool. 
This makes this strategy really smart, because they created a useful calculator people probably bookmark, share, and link to. (In fact, this page earned more than 4,000 engagements on Facebook, according to BuzzSumo.) And even though it doesn’t relate directly to signing up for Canva, it still appeals to the broader audience they’re interested in connecting with.
Another example is a project we did for Hire A Helper, a company that assists users in finding movers. We didn’t do a project about moving; instead, we surveyed 1,000 people on how they interact with their housemates to unearth new insights about quality time.
Here’s one of the graphics we created based on our analysis of the results.
Because this content is not only relevant to people moving but anyone who’s lived with someone else, it’s much more widely appealing, which is something publishers look for, too. Oftentimes they want what they write about to be significant for a majority of their readers.
We pitched this content to writers and earned coverage on Better Homes & Gardens, which syndicated to Allrecipes and Yahoo!
Without this new, tangential data, it would have been much more difficult for Hire A Helper to reach these large publication audiences and get the SEO benefit of earning high-authority backlinks.
Creating/improving your own tangential content
For tangential content to be worth the effort, it needs to appeal to a larger audience than you normally target, or at least a new audience that’s still somewhat related to your industry. 
This requires a new perspective throughout your entire content process.
Here’s how I recommend tackling tangential content:

Expand your keyword research — Use a tool like Keyword Surfer and get lost in related searches. Explore what related topics people are interested in that you might have stayed away from since they don’t tie to your core branding.
Get inspiration from other industries — Competitive research is crucial, but our team has found that if you get stuck only looking at other brands in your own industry, you won’t find the creative inspiration you need to think outside the box, which is required to come up with great tangential content ideas.
Think laterally — When you have a list of subtopics related to your core brand, ask yourself: what else is relevant to this topic? For example, if you’re a car insurance brand, what else is related to driving? Work commutes, singing in the car, safety, family vacations… the list goes on and on.

Conclusion
My suggestion isn’t to throw away your topical content and make everything more general. But I do think all content marketers should take time to see if tangential content will help them achieve goals they haven’t been able to reach through topical content alone.
As long as you’re still providing value to your audiences and creating engaging, accurate, and new tangential content experiences, there’s a good chance it’ll boost your brand awareness and traffic.

3 efficient tips startups should steal from old-school corporates to grow,Albina Zhdanova,2021/01/5,"
I became a COO at Tools for Brokers when I was 22 years old. Back then, the team consisted of 12 people sharing one office in St-Petersburg, Russia. Fast forward to eight years later, and we have more than 80 people spread across four offices. Our turnover, income, and product range have grown exponentially. Today I have vast experience, and I am confident in my decisions, but it wasn’t always like that. 
At the beginning of my journey, I sought advice and guidance from those I’ve perceived as the ultimate knowledge base — top managers of the big companies. Through multiple conversations with C-level employees of massive industrial companies, corporate giants, and businesses established in the previous century, I have realized that many of the things I talk about are either alien or nonsense to them. 
Despite some obvious differences in our views on the world, future, and management, I have had three major takeaways from our discussions. I believe these takeaways can help many startups evolve and bring their A-game. 
1. Information must flow out of the heads and straight into the text
Sounds poetic, but this one is actually quite straightforward.
In the beginning, startups typically have from one to 10 people in the team. Often, the culture reminds you more of a family, with its unwritten rules, inside jokes, and common understanding of how things are done. It’s all fun and games until you wake up a couple of years later, and you see that some people left, some people joined, and nobody fully understands what the agreements and procedures are. 
Now it may sound boring, but everything must be written down: the processes, the workflow, the decisions made. 
Don’t underestimate the value of a handbook with its basic rules and requirements for work. Not only does it help avoid unnecessary confusion, but it also helps smoothen the adoption process of new employees. People learn better and faster when they don’t need to play the guessing game. 
There isn’t much point in writing things down though if nobody reads it. That’s why you need to make all information readily available to all team members. Keeping a folder with PDFs on your laptop won’t work here, so think through a system where everyone can easily access the data. 
2. Build a clear career path for your employees 
Another common situation in a startup is having a ‘jack of all trades’ attitude: responsibilities vary day by day, multiple positions are combined into one, everyone is doing more than they are supposed to do according to their job description. Again, it is fun and exciting for some time, but it’s not sustainable in the long run. 
If a company truly wants its employees to grow, it needs to let them do the work they are hired to do — and they should excel at it. With everything documented, it becomes apparent when the team is understaffed, and a new person is needed to cover some of the specific tasks. 
Documentation also helps uncover areas for improvement. KPI, or key performance indicator, is a fantastic tool that can and should be used for bonus calculations and potential promotions. 
It feels like KPIs are a bit underestimated in the IT crowd, and there is really no reason for it. Show your employees the roadmap and clearly explain what is required to get a pay raise or a higher position. 
It’s a win-win for both managers and employees when there is a clear path that needs to be followed to succeed. It also gives the team a sense of responsibility and autonomy — they know what is required of them, and they are in control of their future with the company. 
3. Build a forecast to reach your goals
I often hear people complain that it’s impossible to know what happens in the future. Although this feels quite accurate for the past 12 months, generally, you can estimate and plan for what is coming. 
There is a stage in each successful startups’ life when the product is simply selling itself. Whether you came up with a new niche or presented a unique feature to an existing solution, it looks like customers can’t get enough of your product. You might think that it will last forever, but it never does. 
Don’t wait for your sales to sink. Act now: invest in promotion, calculate the time and the size of your estimated returns. You can ‘go with the flow’ and save yourself from data gathering, analysis, and multiple conversations with the teams. However, the result might not be satisfactory in that case. It’s hard to know where you’re going and what will wait for you at your destination if you don’t plan. 
That’s why I urge you to stick to your startup’s vision — but plan ahead for a month, a quarter, and a year like a bigger company. Have your positive and negative expectations of market reaction and be ready to re-evaluate the strategy and final goals. Anyone can start a business. It’s keeping it alive and healthy long-tem that is the problem. 
There is plenty of information online on how to do all of this in more detail, but the biggest obstacle is usually finding the time. My advice is to break the process into smaller steps: start reading a few articles, then choose one area of improvement per week and start analyzing it. You will be amazed at what can be done within one year.

We need to make remote meetings more boring in 2021,Már Másson Maack,2020/12/29,"
It’s been a tough year of pivoting, remote work, and conceptualizing the ‘new normal.’ But as we enter a new year, it’s time to take stock of how we’ve operated professionally and what we’ll take with us into 2021.
So when exactly was the last time life was good? Was it when you were huddled up with your coworkers by the watercooler or spending time with your loved ones? No, it was when you were watching The Office — and therein lies our solution for next year.
With new vaccines on the horizon, things are looking brighter and we’ll probably be able to return to many of our pre-corona traditions. But despite that, the entrepreneurial and business communities seem obsessed with the idea that the ‘new normal’ is here to stay.
But my problem with the ‘new normal’ is that it sounds too perfect. Companies and startups are meant to open up to remote work completely, perfecting asynchronous work, and guaranteeing increased productivity with the flexibility to work during your personal ‘peak performance’ hours.
All of this is missing an essential part of what makes a baseline, a sustainable ‘normal’: boredom.
We’re far from being perfect beings, so I believe we’ll always need to work in some imperfections into our operations. Now how do we achieve that? By taking a page out of The Office playbook.

So here’s my *fuego* take on how to make the ‘new normal’ work: make remote meetings even more boring.
Divisive and brave, I know. Not sure ‘hero’ is the right word to describe me, but I understand it comes to mind when you read this.
Before I drop some knowledge on you, just let me be clear: I’m not saying that endless Zoom calls aren’t frustrating and awful, it’s just that they don’t reach peak boringness, where its beauty is released. They’re just half-assed boringness.
It’s all too easy to just turn off your camera, surf the web, check messages and tweets, and pretty much carry on with the mindless internet habits that you use to fill every other void in your life.
What’s wrong with that? Well, I’ll tell you, we can veer off into deep existential dread because we’re overly-stimulated, instead of embracing the meeting’s banality. This isn’t just me saying it, it’s science (probably).
The Office taught us that in-person meetings, however, prevent you from diverting straight into existential dread, because you’re too occupied having the life sucked out of you in a stuffy meeting room. The camaraderie between you and your coworkers when you see the light in each other’s eyes slowly extinguish in unison is the principle the modern world was built on…
And here’s how you can capture that feeling: BEHOLD, THE BOUNCING DVD LOGO SITE!

Just like when The Office gang obsessed over whether a DVD icon could hit the corner of the screen, you can do the same in your next Zoom call with this neat little site.
As nerdy mathematicians have shown, the logo can actually hit a corner on DVD players. But what’s tricky about the site is that you can adjust the size of the window yourself and the logo will change its bouncing accordingly — adding a whole new exciting layer to your boredom.
Credit: Bill GreenNerd speak for bouncy logo stuff.
Now while most business leaders have tried to find new ways to make remote meetings more engaging — like always starting off with a collaborative video game — I’d like to argue my call for boringness also addresses engagement. You can’t be bored if you’re not fully engaged with how tedious something is, as any distraction would alleviate your boredom. Checkmate.
Having the hypnotizing DVD logo on next to the slides in a monotonous Zoom meeting hits the sweet spot of engagement and utter boredom. It gives you a certain sense of progression, while not taking away too much of your attention.
I already tried the DVD logo out with a couple of my colleagues, and they claimed it had actually gone into the corner TWICE! Not saying they’re liars, but I somehow missed it both times.
So if you’ll excuse me, I need to get back to monitoring my beautiful bouncing DVD logo. Let me know how your boring meetings go in 2021.

I went from software development to HR and back — here’s what I learned,Lena Jaschke,2020/12/23,"
When was the last time you stepped completely out of your comfort zone and joined a department and position that are not in line with your CV? It might feel intimidating for some, a waste of time for others.
Now, let me ask this way: When was the last time you decided to explore something new and ended up gaining a lot of new insights and learnings? I suspect many will recall multiple instances of such situations.
For me, the journey started around one-and-half years ago. Well, to be honest, it actually started earlier, when I decided to join a rotational program within Philips: three different positions in three years. It sounded like a great learning opportunity.
After working on CT detector technology in our Research lab in Hamburg, I joined the advanced development department of Mother and Childcare in the Netherlands, working as both a functional and firmware developer.
I guess by now we see a pattern – yes, I have a background in engineering and I love working on digital solutions that improve people’s lives. Digital signal processing, computer vision, algorithms, and software in general – those are the things that make me tick. So I decided to join the Human Resources (HR) department for Innovation and Strategy to continue my journey within Philips. Wait a second…



An engineer in HR?
“Lena, WHERE are you going to work?” was one of the standard questions I had to answer many times. My friends know me as a true TechWoman: enthusiastic about medical technology, a bit nerdy, and a software enthusiast as software provides me with the short feedback loops which fit well with my actionist character.
Aside diverse reasons, most importantly, I was sure that I would be able to learn a lot in that position. This was proven true for sure. It also turned out that, on the one hand, my engineering and software background helped me to add value and bring about change in the HR department, while on the other, I was able to bring back a diverse set of skills from HR to engineering.
Bringing the engineering view to HR
There is a lot of negative discussion around stereotypes. However, I like stereotypes because they help to explain an archetype (variations for sure possible). So please don’t take my descriptions as universal givens.
Below I would like to focus on four more-or-less concrete examples where the software engineering background helped to bring about change to the HR group I was working in:
Agile WoW
Most properly, HR is not the first term that comes to mind when thinking about agility. So let’s see if that proves true and how to address some of the growth opportunities towards a more agile WoW.
Excel is for sure one of the preferred tools not only in HR, but in many other fields as well: it is used for high-level project planning, data analysis, and a lot more. However, using Excel to track progress on action items related to a specific project is not very practical.
Being a true believer in visualizing current work items, their progress as well as backlog items in the form of a team Kanban, I felt strongly about taking action on that front.
We introduced a team board using Planner and as we were now anyhow in the flow of change, we also tried the approach of stand-ups to replace the weekly one-hour project team meetings. Overall responses in the team were positive about these changes, but I also must admit that sticking to a 15-minutes duration for the stand-ups seldom worked out.



Waste patterns
Waste plays a big role not exclusively but also in product development. The majority of the software engineers I worked with so far enjoy detecting waste patterns in their own work as well as in their team or the value stream they are contributing to. Once waste is detected, solutions will be found or created and as much as possible, e.g., automating recurring tasks.
I was lucky enough to start in the HR department when Microsoft Teams was introduced as the main collaboration tool throughout the company. This gave me a great discussion base for an alternative to sharing a lot of the information via email. So just to be clear, I for sure don’t see emails as waste per se.
However, labeling and archiving each email in my inbox at the end of the day based on the project it relates to and downloading a document that was attached to an email to then, in a next step, upload it to an internal document management system, such as SharePoint, are two of many examples where a different collaboration tool and culture can help to reduce some of the non-value adding activities.
The Agile Manifesto principle “Simplicity – the art of maximizing the amount of work not done – is essential” adds another interesting dimension to this discussion. Maximizing the amount of unnecessary work not done fits in perfectly with Lean principles and the idea of reducing process waste.
In order to be able to deliver the highest value with the fewest ‘lines of code’, I started asking myself and my colleagues every time a decision needs to be taken the question: “Are we really adding value by doing this?”.



Dead ‘code’
There exist multiple definitions of dead code. The term can refer to code that is never executed at run-time or a section in the source code of a program that is executed but whose result is never used in any other computation.
Consequently, the execution of dead code wastes computation time and memory. In software craftsmanship, dead code needs to be carefully taken care of as there are clear risks in leaving dead code in the code base such as that it can be an obstacle to programmer understanding and action as well as the risk that the code is awakened and consequently cause problems. Kelvin Henney once said: “Deleting dead code is not a technical problem; it is a problem of mindset and culture”.
Following this line of thought, we can find equivalents to dead code in diverse working environments and the ability to detect and change it can have a significant impact. Do you take the time to clean-up file repositories from information that is not of use anymore? Do you leave Teams that are inactive and don’t add value to your work, or do you just hide them? Do you know the costs of a culture of duplication?
Sometimes it helps to have a fresh pair of eyes to have a look at your project. Will a new colleague be able to navigate in this environment from Day 1? Will he or she be able to bring the work to the next level by adding the next ‘lines of code’? If the answer to one of the questions above is no, it is time to react upon and start detecting and eliminating the dead ‘code’.
CI/CD pipeline
Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment practices form the backbone of DevOps operations. In software engineering, our goal is to work in a way that allows us to release value to the customer on a continuous base. As opposed to phase-gated development, every milestone involves a portion of each step: requirement, design, development, testing, which together produce an increment of value.
Approaching the end goal by an iterative development and release approach and the integration of customer feedback from earlier releases to optimize the solution over time seems to be a bit far-fetched for some projects executed within the HR domain. However, it turned out to be very well possible. Deep dives with the target audience and ‘product demos’ helped us to continuously improve on the final solution in order to best serve the needs of the customers (in our case our employees).
Key take-aways and learnings
Most roads are not one-way. So, I gained a lot of experience during and after my assignment in HR. Therefore, let’s put a focus now on the learnings and skills I brought back from HR to the engineering world:

People focus: I was amazed of the honest interest my colleagues showed in what others do and what they specialize in, and their willingness to learn more about it and gather insights.
Diversity: Hereby I am not referring to gender diversity, as this looks a bit similar to engineering, however upside down ;). I enjoyed the diversity of backgrounds, personalities, and skillsets I found in the HR departments.
Curiosity in change: As described in the previous paragraph, I tried many new ways of working within the team and I was blown away by the low resistance and change management it required. Everyone was really open to change and happy to try out new approaches and react to feedback.
Collaboration: Not necessarily contributing to one specific business, I experienced a high-level of collaboration and exchange throughout the organization. Looking at Philips as part of a larger ecosystem helped me a lot to make decisions and drive projects with the bigger picture in mind.




Conclusions
One year, two worlds, and 1000s of learnings. That’s how I would summarize my experience going from software to HR and back. I hope this short blog post sheds light on how different disciplines can learn from each other, even if they seem far apart at first glance. On second thought, it might be these differences in the first place that create the opportunity to learn from each other. What do you think?
This article was originally published by Lena Jaschke on TechTalks, a publication that examines trends in technology, how they affect the way we live and do business, and the problems they solve. But we also discuss the evil side of technology, the darker implications of new tech, and what we need to look out for. You can read the original article here.

How to choose a startup accelerator — no matter what’s happening in the world,Yessi Bello Perez,2020/12/8,"
Accelerators form an integral part of many entrepreneurs’ journeys. By definition, an accelerator is a fixed-term program that usually lasts anything from three to 12 months. These programs offer a series of benefits, including education, mentoring, and networking. Some may offer investment to startups and on occasion, accelerators will take equity in the companies they accelerate.
With more than 7,000 of these programs spread out across the globe, entrepreneurs truly are spoilt for choice. But faced with this insane amount of possibilities, how are you supposed to choose the right one? It’s easy, focus on yourself. Hear what other startups have gained, how they’ve made the most of accelerators, and then choose the right program based on your current needs.

There are plenty of success stories that prove the extent to which accelerator programs can benefit a business. For example, the sharing economy giant Airbnb is arguably one of the most high-profile companies to have gone through a startup accelerator.
If you’re now at the stage of your business journey when you’re thinking about possibly joining an accelerator, it’s important to research the market and find a program that suits your business needs — just because a program has had success stories doesn’t automatically mean it’s the right fit for you.
No entrepreneur should enter into an accelerator program lightly; you need to really think about what will be expected of you as a participant and be clear on what you will personally get out of the program.
You also need to — given the current circumstances and business upheaval brought about by COVID-19 — consider whether it’s worth entering into a commitment of this magnitude during a global pandemic.

Before digging in
Now, it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that the best way to know what startups need and could get from accelerators is to speak to actual founders whose startups have gone through an accelerator. Luckily for me, TNW is a founding partner of the DMS accelerator program, and this meant I had easy access to a host of alumni who were able to share their experiences and insights.
Before we move on to this, though, it’s probably a good idea to share some context about the program and to help you get a better understanding of the journeys of the startups I spoke to.
Basically, Data Market Services is an equity-free program that aims to overcome growth obstacles facing startups operating within a fragmented European data market — helping founders with pain-points such as privacy law, intellectual property, and investment opportunities. It’s also worth pointing out that it’s funded by the European Commission. 
As part of the program, 50 startups receive free entrepreneurial training, acceleration, and mentoring for six months. Before the pandemic, 60% of the program took place online, with the remaining 40% spent attending startup events across Europe. Now it’s 100% online, meaning founders receive mentoring and the opportunity to promote their business and network with potential partners from the comfort of their own homes.
Then finally, the top 10 startups are invited to an exclusive DMS Bootcamp composed of workshops and mentoring sessions. All of this is recorded and businesses will walk away with a promotional video — which can be a cost-effective way to bolster marketing efforts.
But now let’s move on to the good stuff.
Signing on the dotted line: What you need to know
All in all, DMS seems to have struck a good balance for its cohort companies but founders still need to consider why they want to join the specific program before applying.
The thing to note here is that much of what you had to think about as a founder in the pre-COVID-19 era still applies:

Take time to ask yourself why you want to join a specific program. For example, are you just after brand-building opportunities or do you merely see it as an opportunity to show off in the industry? If it’s the latter, you should probably reconsider.
Don’t make the mistake of underestimating the commitment required from you and your team and once you’re clear on this make sure it fits around your other responsibilities. No one likes a distracted founder — and especially during times of uncertainty.
 If the program you’re interested in offers funding, it’s likely that the accelerator will like to see some type of return. Figure out who the investors are, what kind of portfolio they have, and why they’re interested in backing a business like yours.
Last, but by no means least, make sure you and the organizers are on the same page when it comes to success metrics. There’s absolutely no point in working together if you’re not working towards a common goal or objective. Your company is your baby so don’t jeopardize your growth.

Credit: Daniel ReicheAccelerators are not just another opportunity to show off your idea within the industry. Take participation seriously or find a more fitting path for you.
First up, the classics: Networking and learning
Jörg Schädlich, co-founder of Memoresa, a Berlin-based platform seeking to make it easier for people to manage their digital estate, went into the DMS program with a clear objective in mind.
He says his company joined to make new contacts with investors, companies, partners, and other startups.
“We also wanted the possibility of having so many experts in the program to learn new skills in the coaching sessions and to get new input and ideas to help us achieve our goals,” he adds.
Things paid off for Memoresa. “Thanks to the helpful coaching sessions we got the chance to learn more about specific subject areas like fundraising, marketing strategies, or getting input about our business models,” noted Schädlich.
I’d say Schädlich and Memoresa is the classic approach, enter a program to get new connections to help you with challenges outside your strengths. But just having a goal isn’t enough, it also matters how you approach reaching it.
Whatever you do, don’t half-ass it
Mark Ferencvari, a co-founder of Inventori Solutions, a Hungary-based blockchain-powered smart logistics and supply chain platform, says the activities proved useful for his company.
In his case, the program helped him get a better understanding of his business operations and to make smarter strategic decisions with his team.
Good mentorship can spell the difference between success and failure. Being able to leverage the expertise of experts on the program proved incredibly valuable for Ferencvari.
“The more a founder interacts with the mentors, the more they can get out of this program,” said Ferencvari. Ultimately, it’s entirely down to you, the founder, to make the most out of the opportunity at hand.
Basically, you reap what you sow. It’s not enough just to show up, make sure you push for the results you’d like to see.
Stage what now?
Early-stage businesses often grapple with the same issues: finding product-market fit, getting access to paying customers, and finding investors willing to take a chance on a product with little, or no, traction. 
The challenges founders face during the early days are vastly different from those seen by entrepreneurs seeking to raise a Series B or scoping potential expansion markets.  
Mindful of this, Antonio Irusta, co-founder of SDX Network, a Madrid-based startup that leverages blockchain technology to analyze third-party data, joined the DMS accelerator because he wanted to get a vision of the different stages and actions required to scale a startup effectively. 
The mentorship he received during the program was priceless: “Having access to experts for one-on-one advice on how to achieve your business goals and execute in specific domains was essential in helping us grow.” 
So sit down and think about where your company is at and what are the most important challenges for you to solve now and what help do you need from the accelerator at this point.
[Read: Biggest challenges and opportunities of expanding a tech business across Europe]
For many, staying in business has been the main priority and while it may seem far-fetched to join an accelerator during such uncertain times, some would argue otherwise. 
Gonçalo Ribeiro, co-founder and CEO of YData, a Lisbon-based startup helping AI adopters improve and generate their data, believes the decision to join an accelerator during COVID-19 should take into consideration where the business is at. In a way, it seems the same pre-pandemic selection criteria still apply.
“It depends a lot on the accelerator,” he notes, adding “the founders should be aware of their company stage and what they are looking for in an accelerator.” 
For example, continues the founder, many accelerators focus heavily on business development, which might be suffering as a result of the pandemic. With this in mind, it’s important that founders refine their approach in order to choose the best program that meets their business needs at this particular moment in time.
Going online… a waste of time?
Like Ribeiro mentioned, you need to be aware if this is the right time for your startup to join an accelerator — and how it’s affected by the pandemic.
While going down the route of a traditional offline accelerator may provide more face-to-face interaction with stakeholders, there are also benefits to joining an online alternative.
Dr. Martin Dinov, the CEO and co-founder of Maaind, a London-based AI and neurotechnology startup seeking to improve mental wellbeing and cognitive performance, is quick to refute the idea that online programs are ineffective. 
“Online accelerators work too. The trick, more so than physical in-person programs, is to actively make an effort to reach out to the organizers and fellow attendees,” adds Dr. Dinov.
Credit: Daniel ReicheLike everything else, accelerators have had to move online. They’re still worth it though, you just need to be more proactive about following up and getting what you need.
It’s important to try and recreate the offline experience in a way that seems natural and organic.
Indeed, having some initial reservations about joining an online program is understandable but Javad Hatami — the CEO and co-founder of Builtrix, a Lisbon-based startup that helps companies understand and reduce energy consumption by analyzing their energy data — said it shouldn’t be a deterrent: “I believe the virtual format has enormous benefits for founders to learn at their own pace.”
Additionally, Hatami says that the program helped him understand the challenges that come with building and scaling a data-based startup and how to avoid these critical mistakes. 
On another note, and something that will surely prove helpful in the future, he says the accelerator helped him fine-tune his investor pitching skills.
So if you’re in an online program, don’t be afraid to initiate follow-ups and be proactive about getting more out of the mentors you come in contact with. Don’t think about whether anything might come across as awkward or too pushy — everybody has entered into this to help each other improve, so get the most out of it.
Time to take stock and act
To say that 2020 has been a challenging year for businesses across the globe would be a massive understatement and while the future remains uncertain there’s no denying that data will remain king across every industry. 
With this in mind, there’s never been a better time to take stock of your current business situation — and who knows — you might realize this is the perfect time for you and your company to join an accelerator to move forward.

The dos and don’ts of creating your product roadmap,Rajesh Nerlikar and Ben Foster,2020/12/7,"
You wouldn’t start a cross-country drive without a roadmap (or GPS), and neither should you attempt product development without one. 
A product roadmap is what connects the near-term product changes to the mid-term strategic milestones and the long-term vision. It communicates the sequencing of priorities and helps you plan all your product-based initiatives.
But many leaders are confused about what goes into a product roadmap. Ultimately, there is no right answer: different types of roadmaps suit different companies. 
They can show lots of detail or very little; they can be intentionally scrappy or highly organized with color-coding, iconography, team associations, and more. We’ve seen them printed on ten-foot-wide poster paper and contained on a simple Google Sheet. 
While there is no “best way of making a roadmap,” there are a few dos and don’ts that can guide you in crafting your roadmap document.
The dos of building a roadmap
Let’s start with the dos.
Do clearly categorize specific roadmap initiatives. Based on our experience, we’ve realized that all product development activities can be placed into one of three categories:

Innovation (making progress towards the vision)
Iteration (getting better results from what you’ve already built)
Operation (maintaining your product and running your business)

If possible, on top of categorizing each initiative, communicate the allocation target for each category to remind the audience the level of investment that was agreed upon.
Do paint a picture far enough in the future that it helps other teams to plan accordingly. For example, marketing may need to start working on communication plans for a large product release well in advance.
Do clarify the rationale behind the work you’re planning on doing. The problems you are solving, the value you are attempting to create, and the key outcomes you are trying to deliver are often more important than the features you currently intend to build.
Do leave room for plans to shift. Development timelines are notoriously difficult to predict in advance. As you experiment and validate assumptions through customer discovery, you will want to be able to react to what you learn, and the roadmap should allow for that.
The don’ts of building a roadmap
And now the don’ts, which are just as important as the dos.
Don’t try to predict development plans so far ahead that you’ll almost certainly change them before you get there. Offering this false precision is a common way to erode trust between product and the rest of the company.
Don’t worry about providing the same level of fidelity for every team. It’s okay for the roadmap to have a “ragged edge” in which some items are better understood than others, or some teams’ plans extend farther into the future than others.
Don’t make commitments that are unnecessary or that are unlikely to actually be met. Generally speaking, it’s better to avoid feature-date pairs unless there’s a specific business reason the date is as important as what actually ships.
Don’t get in the habit of playing roadmap Tetris to force as much in as possible. It’s far better to under-commit and over-deliver than vice versa, and you’ll need some buffer to accommodate the ripple effects when development doesn’t go according to plan or critical feedback comes in.
The dos and don’ts of communicating the roadmap
Building the roadmap is only the first step. After that, you need to share it with all the stakeholders. Here are some dos and don’ts for how to most effectively communicate your roadmap.
Do share it with your executives first, because if you get buy-in from leaders in the organization, they can help build agreement and excitement about its contents with the rest of the employees.
Don’t present it to the whole company at once. Each major group within the company will have different needs and concerns.
By presenting to each group separately, you can best address these needs and concerns and help everyone get what they need out of the presentation. We recommend having separate meetings for each of the following groups:

Engineering, QA, Architecture
Sales and marketing
Account management, customer success, and customer support
Everyone else not in those groups (HR, finance, etc.)

Don’t be boring. Your presentation quality matters tremendously, and it’s your job to make your presentation engaging. Use charts and other visuals.
Do create a system for answering questions and getting feedback. Some of this can be done in the presentation meetings. However, some people don’t feel comfortable asking questions or offering feedback in front of others, so also consider conducting anonymous surveys after the presentations.
One more do and don’t
We’ll leave you with one final do and one don’t.
Do dedicate the time and resources to creating a roadmap. It’s one of the most important documents guiding your company’s actions and initiatives.
But don’t stress about making a “perfect” roadmap. The best roadmaps evolve and develop with the company and serve to spark the right conversations about priorities.
Whether you opt to build a highly detailed, organized roadmap with color-coding and more, or a broader, intentionally rough one, following these dos and don’ts will help ensure that you craft and share your roadmap in an effective way.

These 3 companies are making the products you use everyday sustainable,Andrea Hak,2020/12/3,"
You may be a recycling freak, have an array of solar panels decorating your roof, and only buy green label clothing — but is there more you could be doing to tackle climate change?
Techleap.nl’s latest batch of Rise Programme participants are on a mission to help us speed up our transition to a truly sustainable society with cutting edge technology and new eco-friendly solutions.
We caught up with three of this year’s cohorts to find out how they’re bringing sustainability to the next level.
DyeCoo: Disrupting the way our clothes are made
Trending terms like fast fashion and conscious consumerism are clear indicators of the growing awareness of the negative impact the fashion industry has on our environment. But did you know that one of the biggest culprits is the process that gives us those vibrant shades of electric blue and ruby red?
The textile dyeing industry uses up enough fresh water every year to fill two million Olympic-sized swimming pools. It’s also the second-largest polluter of water (after agriculture), resulting in 20% of industrial water pollution across the globe. 
Micke Magnusson, CCO of Dutch scale-up DyeCoo, told TNW: “There is a sincere wish, not only from consumers, but also from institutions and producers to clean up and do what they can.”
The challenge is: How can we make it possible for people to change processes that have been in place for decades?
Dyecoo invented a new 100% water-free dyeing process that’s set to revolutionize the fashion industry. 
Born out of ground research conducted into the properties of CO2 at TU Delft University, the team made up of engineers, physicists, and material specialists developed machines that can pressurize reclaimed CO2, dissolving dyes deeply into fibers. The water-free process means:

No chemicals are required
Processing times are faster
Less energy is consumed
Best of all: No harmful water runoff 

For Magnusson, it’s way past time for an upgrade. “The machines that are running this industry are 25 plus years old. If we compare that to the cars we drive, in many countries diesel cars older than 2012 are not even allowed in cities anymore.” 
At the same time, this transition won’t be easy. Despite the long-term financial benefits that faster processing times and less energy consumption can bring to potential customers, the machines require a large initial investment which will take some time and convincing.
“We’re a super small Dutch company trying to change a global industry. So we need every support, visibility, push, and pull we can get,” Magnusson said. 
But he sees the current moving in the right direction. Having started his career in the midst of the IT bubble, he feels the same energy coursing through the ESG (Environmental Social and Corporate Governance) movement. 
“This is the next change in our industry. If you compare the sustainability movement with the IT movement, this is just as powerful. I see the same attraction to capital, talent, and business models all moving towards ESG. Now the current is there and it’s going to be very hard to fight against it.” 
Consumers are also playing a very important role in this transition. “If you compare the fashion industry with the food or pharmaceutical industry, today it’s normal to have nutritional information on food packaging. If you don’t disclose this information on a product, it won’t sell. I think the same will happen in the fashion industry,” Magnusson told TNW.
Solarge: Does green always equal good?
Solar panels have long been considered the epitome of sustainable living. Produce your own energy, lower your carbon footprint, and save money! Nothing could sound more like a win-win than that. 
But did you know that solar panels have a carbon footprint of their own?
Your typical solar panels are made from aluminum and glass, two materials that need to be heated at extremely high temperatures. It, therefore, takes roughly two years to offset the CO2 emitted during the production process. 
The second thing to consider is, what happens at the end of your solar panel’s lifecycle?
Traditional glass panels are very difficult to recycle, requiring a considerable amount of energy. And when they’re not disposed of properly, studies show that harmful chemicals can be soaked back into the ground.
This is a huge problem policymakers are only just beginning to grapple with. According to a study by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) there were already between  43,500-250,000 metric tons of solar panel waste in 2016. By 2050 this number is projected to grow to 78 million metric tons. 
Dutch startup Solarge was developed to address this relatively unknown dark side of the solar industry. 
Instead of using glass and aluminum, they’ve developed solar panels made of polymers which emit lower amounts of CO2 when manufactured. On top of that, they’re 50% lighter than their glass counterparts, meaning less energy is needed to transport them. In total, this equals 25% lower CO2 emissions than traditional solar panels.
And they’re 100% recyclable.
But, as CEO Jan Vesseur explained, “There’s very limited awareness of this problem. When you think of solar, you think green and you automatically think good. But what you see today is that the carbon footprint behind solar panels is only just starting to become of interest.”
Unfortunately, the market is now flooded with cheaper but less environmentally friendly solar panels coming from countries where there are fewer environmental regulations. As one study by Northwestern University found, solar panels made in China typically have a higher carbon footprint than those made in Europe. 
“In the solar industry, most people just want the cheapest option,” Vasseur said.
Government incentives targeted specifically at solar panels made with low carbon footprints could really help to change the game. “Unfortunately, in the Netherlands this still isn’t the case so we’re trying to lobby for that now,” Vesseur said.
And this change better happen soon. “Just to give you some perspective, the Dutch Government’s target for 2050 is to reach more than 600 square kilometers of solar panels. Now, imagine that every year 10 percent of those panels need to be replaced. That’s 60 million square meters of solar panels that will have to be recycled every year.”
But Vesseur is positive about Solarge’s potential. Along with the environmental benefits that their panels will provide, the fact that they’re so lightweight makes them much easier to mount on roofs, providing even more opportunities to maximize space. For example, farmers could easily mount solar panels on the roofs of sheds or other existing structures, creating extremely profitable second revenue streams.
And the future possibilities are endless. 
“In the future we will see a lot more prefabricated housing elements and our goal is, wherever possible, to try to include a solar skin to it. And this doesn’t necessarily have to be on roofs, it could be on facades, sheds, carports, etc. There are so many upcoming opportunities to use solar on a grand scale, but we should do so in the most environmentally responsible way,” Vesseur said.
Felyx: Changing the way we move
If you live in the Netherlands, there’s no doubt you’ve seen or even hopped on the back of one of Felyx’s dark green electric mopeds. 
Felyx was originally created to solve a very common consumer problem: how to easily get from A to B in a city. But the founders soon realized their idea would help to solve a wider issue being faced by municipalities: How can we keep cities mobile as populations grow?
As co-founder Quinten Selhorst told TNW:
There’s so much pollution due to the current transportation methods. And, if we look towards the future, this problem is only going to get bigger because more people are moving to cities. This means pressure on public spaces is also increasing because more people will live in a smaller area. Initiatives like the Paris Climate Agreement are putting even more pressure on municipalities to find new solutions to combat air pollution fast.
But Felyx is helping to raise the bar on sustainable transportation in three very important ways: 

It’s a fully electric company. Not only are their mopeds electric, the service vans they use to swap out batteries also run on electricity. 
They’re providing an alternative for people who use taxis, cars, and gas-powered mopeds, particularly for cross-city commuters who would normally have to sit in traffic and then spend time trying to find a parking space. “Now over 20% of all our rides start and end at the train station. This means that more people are using Felyx combined with the train because it’s cheaper and faster than going by car,” Selhorst told TNW.
They’re helping to change habits and behaviors. 

“Instead of people owning their own vehicles, we’re helping people to move towards ride-sharing. This way we have fewer resources that are needed to accommodate more people. Compare one shared e-moped that rides 10 times a day to one person who rides maybe two times a day.”
And with major cities across Europe having introduced plans to ban all diesel vehicles from city centers by 2030, Felyx certainly has room to keep growing. 
Selhorst shared that the company’s future sights are set on expansion, both within Benelux (where they’re already a market leader) and internationally. In fact, for any micro-mobility fans out there the Felyx team is now looking to fill some key senior positions which will aid in their expansion to Germany and France. Check out more on their website. 
It’s time for change
Greenwashing and lip service aren’t going to get us anywhere. It’s time to take a deeper look at how our industries operate, how our products are made, and the impact our daily activities have on the environment. 
As Magnusson said, “If you want to make a change you need to be bold. The word change tends to have a positive connotation but it means that you actually need to sacrifice something. So what are you willing to sacrifice? That’s the question we need to ask ourselves when we want to drive change forward. Change is up to you. If you want change, prove it!” 
And Dutch innovation could just be the impetus we need to drive change. As Veasseur explained:
I think the Techleap.nl concept is a very important initiative for getting attention for what we’re doing in a small country like the Netherlands. We have one of the best R&D in the world, we have great companies and institutions that come up with fantastic new ideas but we’re not so great at marketing and selling them.
If you think about it, a lot of things like Wifi and Bluetooth were actually invented here but they were then picked up by US companies. So I think it’s very important that the Netherlands gets the right buzz around our technology.

Is now the worst time to launch a new brand? These companies are doing it anyway,Rebecca Bellan,2020/12/2,"
Well, that depends on the brand. If you’re launching an intimate wine bar or an international travel app, then you may want to rethink your business model. 
But even in the midst of a global pandemic and a recession, some brands have decided to launch. The ones that have been successful with their launches have recognized the shift in supply and demand, focusing on providing essential goods or structuring their businesses in a digital-first model. 
“What COVID has done has been to accelerate trends that were already starting throughout the globe,” said Jonathan Goodman, COO of Polestar, a luxury electric vehicle, during his TNW2020 keynote (which you can watch at the bottom of the article!). “Three months of lockdown at home showed that working from home was feasible and practical, and at the same time raised a question over the need to go back to being in the office.”
Goodman pointed out the crisis has triggered a tremendous acceleration in the digital transformation of the global economy, from healthcare to food deliveries and more. In fact, IBM’s U.S. Consumer Retail Index, published in August, found the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift to e-commerce by up to five years. 
How some brands are winning in this space
Brands launching during the crisis are likely doing so with an eye to what a pandemic economy values, and what a post-pandemic economy will value. 
1. Essential goods and intelligent marketing FTW
According to a recent McKinsey & Company report, the most successful brands fall within the homebody or essentials category, and there’s been a 20-40% decrease in discretionary spending. At the same time, digital spending has jumped during the pandemic up to 50%, and consumers intend to spend online even after the pandemic.
Wellness brands are also seeing a boost during the pandemic, particularly those that have to do with mental health. WSL Strategic Retail, a marketing consultant, finds that Millennials and Gen Z are more likely to turn to apps to help with anxiety and stress or for affordable wellness options. 
“What this pandemic has revealed is that taking care and control of your own health — individual, family, home, etc. — is even more critical than before,” WSL CEO Wendy Liebmann said in an interview with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
In addition, when consumers do choose to use their money for discretionary spending, they often want to shop sustainably. Many consumers see this as a time to reset our values and to help our fellow human by buying off locally produced or greener products.  
“While purchases are currently centered on the most basic needs, people are shopping more consciously, buying local and are embracing digital commerce,” according to a COVID-19 Consumer Goods and Services report from Accenture, professional services agency. 
So if your company fits both the current needs of the market and the desires of it, then go for it and launch! But if you can’t find the right angle, it might be best to postpone until things settle down a bit. 
2. Rethinking the business model 
New businesses have the chance to set the tone in the post-pandemic world. Everything will be done differently, so a brand that launches during the pandemic will have an edge over legacy companies that now have to shift their business models entirely.
“[The pandemic] has forced companies to change, and even abandon their legacy mindsets,” Goodman said during his keynote. “So is this the worst possible year to launch the car and the brand? Absolutely not.”
Polestar is a standalone electric performance car brand that’s got a digital-first model and a direct consumer approach. 
“We are a brand that’s not weighed down by the legacy that affects the car industry,” said Goodman. “What that means is that we’ve been free to imagine our route to market, enabling us to be hugely adaptable to the changing circumstances.”
The shift to e-commerce has benefited Polestar as one of the only car companies on the market that offers customers the ability to interact with the brand completely online if they want — from learning more about the electric vehicle to choosing a style to having it delivered to your home. 
3. Cashing in on timing
Not only has Polestar been able to leverage its digital strategy to achieve success in launching this year, but it’s launching its star car, the Polestar 2, right at the moment when the whole car industry is starting to move into electric vehicles. 
“Governments are accelerating the move to a zero-emission environment, paving the way of the continued growth of an already dynamic electric vehicle segment,” said Goodman. Additionally, more people are planning national road trips and are wary of public transit, but they still want to be green and travel responsibly. 
Another example of a brand that got the timing right is Neverland, an accessible e-commerce plant and gardening marketplace that found its inception during the pandemic. 
In an attempt to brighten up their small apartments (and now offices) during the shelter-in-place orders, Neverland’s founders discovered that buying indoor plants is no easy feat. One either had to purchase from a conventional superstore or an over-priced boutique. 
When Neverland launches officially in September, it’ll be offering organic seed kits for easy-to-grow indoor herbs and veggies with a mobile app for iOS and Android, cashing in on the fact that more people will continue to be working from home and, coming into winter, will want a life-affirming project to get their hands dirty with. Having an app to guide you through the green-thumb process is also a major perk.
4. The freedom to pioneer and build from the ground up
During a pandemic-recession, there’s less money going around to invest in companies and competitors. But that can be a good thing for brands launching this year. 
According to Tim Chen, CEO of NerdWallet, a company that started up during the Great Recession in 2008, “…you’re actually better off slowing down and building a good foundation and thinking about efficiency and scaling efficiently rather than just optimizing for speed and then scaling as quickly as possible.”
New brands that are operating in emerging industries not only don’t have to worry about as many competitors, but they also are able to focus more completely on developing their offerings. 
“Unlike the rest of the industry, we don’t have any legacy models to maintain over the next few years,” said Polestar’s Goodman. “One of the biggest challenges that’s going to face the traditional OEMs is how do they move into electrification without alienating the buyers of their petrol and diesel cars? We don’t have this problem. We’re 100% electric, and able to focus on this entirely and with all our passion.”
5. Giving the people what they want in this economy
Essential goods, sustainable sourcing, affordable health-focused products, e-commerce. These are all ways that brands are altering their products for a new mindset. But with a little creativity, there are other ways brands can meet the demands of a modern consumer. 
To take the Polestar example again, we’ve already mentioned that the entire experience of buying a Polestar 2 can be completely contactless if the customer so wishes. But there are other neat features to this car that make it a truly premium offering. 
For example, the Polestar 2 is integrated with Google’s apps and services that links customers to their Google accounts, Google maps, Spotify and any other app. With a voice recognition system that actually works, there’s a functionality in this car that’s unique and much sought-after. Other perks include a more intimate and easily accessible showroom experience, as well as same-day maintenance that doesn’t require you to leave your home or office.  
Customers in today’s economy are also more willing to try out new brands, according to the McKinsey report. “With continued pressure on household income, customers are trying new brands and channels, seeking both better value and convenience. For the upcoming holiday seasons, more than half of consumers plan to shop at different retailers than last year, with concern for safety being the most important reason driving this change.”
If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere
It’s a bold move to launch a brand during the pandemic, but the risk is what can make it so exciting. Think of it this way: A company born successfully during a pandemic or a recession will not only have excellent street cred, but it will also have the longest time to go until the next global crisis!

"
7 surprising ways startups can take advantage of a city’s resources,Rebecca Bellan,2020/12/2,"
Any city that calls itself a “startup city” should provide a range of resources for startups to utilize. In metropolises around the world, local ecosystems are dedicating their resources to helping new businesses thrive, from small businesses to scale ups. 
Figuring out how your local government can help you — as well as where to start — can be daunting. We spoke with Bas Beekman, the Director of StartupAmsterdam, on how companies can tap into their city’s resources, from government grants and funds to networks and workspaces. 
1. Seek out entrepreneurship organizations 
A startup city will undoubtedly have organizations that are dedicated to helping startups meet the right people, gain new skills, scale, and grow. Be on the lookout for accelerators or incubators that can provide you with a community, connections to potential investors, and experienced mentors.
While you’re at it, have a look at what coworking spaces exist in your city. Often, local governments want to encourage entrepreneurs to innovate in their city, so they’ll carve out neighborhoods or buildings to provide a hub for startups to work side by side. Coworking spaces provide businesses with a built-in network, people to chat with at the nitro cold brew tap about ideas, strategies, advice, potential collabs, and more. 
You’ll usually be able to find your niche depending on the market you’re looking to enter, whether that’s FinTech or cybersecurity, SaaS or agriculture. And the great thing about these spaces is that they often host startup and tech events or meetup groups. Which brings us to our next point…
2. Get out there and network
The whole point of an ecosystem is that the many parts of a whole work together to create a functional system, so attending events and expanding your circle is one of the best ways to engage. Some cities make it easier than others. 
Amsterdam, for example, ranks very high in Connectedness on StartupGenome’s Global Startup Ecosystem Report due to the Netherlands’ logistical and social connectedness to the world. But within the city itself, Amsterdam has a reputation for being a city with the most meetups, events, and workshops in Europe, right up there with larger cities like Berlin and London. 
“I think that’s one of the strengths of Amsterdam,” said Bas Beekman, Director of StartupAmsterdam. “Everyone is always helping each other by organizing events and sharing knowledge. It’s a very small, dense city. I always say everyone is just a coffee away.”
If you’re lucky enough to be situated in a city that’s walkable and has excellent mobility, like Amsterdam, take advantage of it. Beekman also says the Dutch capital is a true cosmopolitan city, in that no matter where you’re from, it’s easy to really take part in the city and become an accepted citizen, especially since the Dutch speak English almost as a first language. 
“The city itself is an extra resource,” said Beekman. 
Of course, social gatherings are not as feasible during a pandemic, but it still pays to be in a city that continues to find a way to connect with the local ecosystem, even virtually. For example, the City of Amsterdam and Startupbootcamp recently co-launched a fully digital learning and community platform called Amsterdam Squared, which is allowing the startup ecosystem to live on. 
3. Don’t forget to check out government resources
In Silicon Valley, the government largely stays out of the private sector, especially in the tech space. Laissez-faire capitalism is the American way. Not so much in Europe, where the public and private sectors often work together for the good of the industry. In Europe this collaboration isn’t framed as intervention, but rather as a crucial part of the ecosystem. 
Again, Amsterdam is a great example of such collaborations. StartupAmsterdam is a City of Amsterdam initiative to bring the public and private sectors together in order to support the startup ecosystem in a sustainable way, helping the city to become a major global player. 
Beekman recommends that startups just opening up shop in Amsterdam or looking to move to the city get in contact with his team or with the Amsterdam Business Department from the get go. The government wants to welcome startups into the city by helping them find a location and connecting them to peers. StartupAmsterdam even offers a rough guide to connecting to the startup ecosystem in the city.
Checking in with government departments like Startup Amsterdam is a great first step.
4. Connect with universities, researchers, and other educational institutions operating in your area
Any startup city worth its salt has a good talent pipeline, funneling some of the best and brightest in tech from educational institutions directly to startups and larger tech companies. Universities and research organizations alone are great not just for talent, but also for resources that may help move your startup along. 
Amsterdam is a small city with under a million residents, yet it has a reputation for excellence and innovation, which is why a lot of big tech companies from the United States, like Netflix, Tesla, and Booking.com, have offices or headquarters there. 
“One of the reasons these bigger tech companies are coming to Amsterdam is because of the abundance of talent,” said Beekman. “We are really focused on educating more talent with many programs, but we also try to make sure that the connection between the tech companies and the knowledge institutes is strong and collaborative.”
According to the StartupGenome report, Amsterdam ranked very high in Life Sciences Talent, which means it has excellent access to high-quality STEM students and graduates. The Dutch capital offers a range of programs and academies for everything startup-related, from coding and data science to entrepreneurship. 
For example, the founder of the Dutch navigation technology company TomTom created CODAM College, a tuition-free school where anyone can learn how to code, in order to help boost the next generation of developers.
5. Find the right resources for women or minority-led founders
Many startup ecosystems are actively working on creating a more diverse startup landscape, and that includes encouraging women and minority-led founders to succeed. Look out for collaborations of VC firms to achieve this aim. 
Currently, only 2% of all Dutch VC capital is invested in female-founded or female co-founded companies. VC collaborations #FundRight is hoping to change this, and is aiming for a funding ecosystem that includes 35% women by 2023. 
And in light of the pandemic, which threatens much of the progress women have made in the professional realm, a new global program has recently been introduced to support female startup founders. The Female Founder Program, a collaboration between the Founder Institute’s Amsterdam —Silicon Valley Virtual 2021 Program and WomenTech Network, aims in part to establish Amsterdam as a center for women-led innovation.  
Aside from local networks and initiatives, keep an eye out for international networks like Women in AI, which has a strong presence in Amsterdam, or Black Young Professionals Network, which is based in the United Kingdom but advances its cause across Europe. 
6. Identify the VC funds and angel investors 
Typically by engaging in your local ecosystem, you’re already likely to meet potential investors. Rich cities with a diversity of industries are great places to find customers, as well, for the service or product your startup is offering.
But try to pay attention to where there’s already plenty of funding, and what industries are on the rise. Is FinTech big in your city? Maybe Digital Health is the next big thing that VCs are looking to invest in. Does your city boast a big creative scene? Perhaps you might try to connect with VCs that work in SaaS. 
Look out for a tool that will help you find the right investors for you, like Startup Amsterdam’s “Find your next investor” matching tool.
7. Public data is an untapped resource
One thing technology companies always need is data. Rather than paying for it or trying to collect it all yourself, why not see what is publicly available? Cities constantly collect data on everything from transport and maps to IoT and demographics. They visualize it in a way that’s comprehensive, and they’ll often provide you with the csv file to download and utilize as you see fit. 
While offering up better and more comprehensive datasets, cities are also aiming to become more transparent about how they use data and AI. Both Amsterdam and the City of Helsinki launched an open AI register, which allows anyone to see how the cities use data and AI, and also to contribute to the datasets.

3 ways leaders should pursue breakthrough innovation during a crisis,Tim Scott,2020/12/2,"
The COVID-19 pandemic has become an innovation accelerator, igniting a wave of creative problem-solving within organizations in every industry. Resilient companies have quickly adapted to changing market needs and trends and have engaged in continuous learning to survive. But to truly succeed and rise above competitors, companies must embrace “breakthrough innovation.”
What is breakthrough innovation? It’s a new way of attacking an old problem that leads to products or services that can fundamentally change the outlook of a business, industry, or market. Typically, it’s not a single solution but rather the cumulative result of sustained, incremental attempts. 
Some examples of companies that drive breakthrough innovation include SpaceX, the leader in commercial space; Airbnb, which expanded the hospitality industry’s capabilities; and Salesforce, an organization that changed management and client relation software through emerging trends in technology.
In the modern business environment, breakthrough innovation is no longer solely the mandate of research and development departments. Rather, it’s something that technology businesses must weave into the fabric of their organizations or risk becoming obsolete. 
It may be tempting to slow down innovation efforts during the pandemic, but this is the best time to double down. There’s no risk of rocking the proverbial boat if the storm has already hit.
Time for a change
In the midst of heightened uncertainty, technology business leaders are often inclined to place their primary focus on operations as they look to cut costs and maximize profit margins. However, it’s exactly these circumstances in which innovation should become a strategic priority.
The constraints and pressures that accompany uncertain times can reveal new opportunities and challenges that force teams to think differently. The most successful companies — the ones that emerge stronger after crises — reject the status quo and adopt an antifragile mindset. They see opportunity in the face of failure and defeat.
For example, leading up to the Great Recession, Ford was plagued by toxic internal politics that hampered its core automaking function. In 2007, the company’s executive chairman, Bill Ford Jr., was forced to pledge the iconic Ford oval as collateral for a financing package that would help the company survive. 
This risk inspired a renewed focus on innovation that helped the company regain its position as an industry leader. Without the threat presented by the financial crash, Ford likely would’ve continued to stagnate.
Times of uncertainty call for more risk-taking. I once had a client who was on the edge of rolling out a solution that could save their clients time and money and greatly contribute to an improved operating environment. As they began to roll it out, an unexpected event shut down operations for everyone in the industry for a significant length of time. 
Rather than closing down shop, the client took this period to redouble their efforts and make the next level of improvement to the innovation. When their operations resumed, they had advanced far beyond any competitors.
To see a similar success story, you must emphasize transformation over restriction. You can do this by following the three-step journey for breakthrough innovation:
Step #1: Strengthen your core business
Like Bill Ford Jr., you should navigate the current crisis by focusing on what your company does best. As you evaluate your core competencies, try to identify inefficiencies you could eliminate with technology. These are the types of resource sinkholes discoverable in every organization — within supply chains, production processes, project workflows, etc. — if you just look hard enough.
Most leaders probably don’t have to look that hard to find aspects of their technology businesses that could be improved. They know exactly where the problems are, but actually addressing these problems isn’t risk-free. Technology solutions don’t always yield immediate ROI, and some never pan out, making them far less palatable when resources are already tight.
But if you’re already in the midst of a storm, there may be little left to lose. If there’s a chance you can come out on top and shape the future of your industry, why wouldn’t you rock the boat? 
Evaluate which three to five changes would improve your technology business offerings or workflows the most. Once you’ve narrowed down some possibilities, rank them by risk. Select two — one with high risk and one with low risk — to explore further.
Step #2: Uncover new opportunities and potential solutions
Every enduring crisis creates new problems, forcing changes to our daily routines. Some of these changes are temporary, but others are profound and permanent. They might seem alarming at first, but it all depends on your perspective. Do you consider the changes crises or opportunities?
If you’re searching for areas to apply new ways of thinking, start with new problems. Tackle challenges associated with the abrupt shift to remote work or the response to COVID-19, for instance, to practice creative problem-solving. Some of the solutions you devise during these exercises might actually be viable (or even profitable).
Additionally, emerging technologies such as blockchain, AI, machine learning, cloud computing, quantum computing, 5G, virtual and augmented reality, nanorobotics, and many other fields are ripe for breakthrough innovation. If you brainstorm a way to incorporate these technologies into your solutions, you might discover and create new products, services, or business models.
Step #3: Make innovation an organization-wide objective
Everyone on your team would understand if you decided to cut back on investments in research and development, new technology, and new personnel during the pandemic. There’s a chance you already have. After all, you need to survive this crisis.
But a survival mindset won’t drive breakthrough innovation. Fearing failure and disruption during tumultuous times will set you back further because it’ll prevent you from pivoting accordingly. Instead, take up an antifragile mindset and promote innovation companywide. Challenge every team member to think differently about strategies and processes. Now is not the time to say, “We’ve always done it this way.”
I worked with a group that had a strong technical solution for their customers’ problems that was well-regarded in their industry. However, the industry was soon disrupted by new challenges and a demand for more flexibility. 
The group retracted into the apparent safety of its existing solutions instead of embracing the risk and demanding territory for successful innovation. As a result, they saw customer engagement plateau as their customers looked elsewhere for more innovative solutions.
Make sure your entire team knows what your goal is and how to work toward it. This is especially important now, when most of your workforce is likely remote. Clearly communicate your objectives and invest in the training, personnel, and collaboration tools your team needs to actualize them. Don’t try to control or centralize their efforts. It won’t be perfect, but action is what matters most.
Eventually, the pandemic will dissipate. Don’t let the fear of rocking the boat be an excuse to ignore the pursuit of innovation. If you do, you might find that once the storm passes, the “next normal” won’t be as easy to navigate.

3 cliché pieces of startup advice I never want to hear again,Jason VandeBoom,2020/12/1,"
There’s certainly no shortage of advice on how to build and grow a startup. From keeping an insanely packed, no-sleep schedule like Jack Dorsey’s to putting your entire social life on hold, it seems that there’s “wisdom” around every corner.
But I’ve learned through my own experience that, despite the volume of advice out there, much of it isn’t all that useful in most cases. No single nugget of insight will make or break your business. Instead, the secret to success is learning how to follow your gut about what feels right for you, your customers, and your team.
Despite what some advisors might say, there is no “proven” path to success. And over the last 17 years, I’ve encountered lots of bad advice along the way. Here’s some of the worst:
1. Choose VC funding or bootstrap; there is no in-between
Many experts push entrepreneurs to take funding as early as possible. It is sadly seen as some sort of validation. But, this can quickly backfire, forcing you to focus exclusively on growth, expand too fast, and lose sight of delivering what is truly needed and differentiated in your market. 
On the flip side, others will say to bootstrap all the way, that the gritty, buck-the-system approach keeps you true to your roots.
The right answer for many can be somewhere in the middle, and timing is everything. That’s why my company waited 13 years (not a typo) to pursue our first round of funding and another four for a $100 million Series B. 
After years of bootstrapping, I was confident in our vision, our culture, and our product offering. I had a proven formula, a solid market footprint, and we were ready to grow. 
Had we pushed for funding early on, I fear we may have not let enough time pass for our direction to truly be identified. Instead, we kept our bootstrap mentality but took on some funding to grow when the timing was right. 
The better advice is to embrace the best elements of funding and bootstrapping in a way that works for you — it doesn’t have to be one or the other (despite the industry obsession with funding as a signifier of growth and validation — which it is not).
2. Don’t invest in customer support early on 
I get it: customer support is expensive, and some incorrectly think that product-led growth means the product solving things versus people solving things. In fact, many treat customer support as a cost center and even place it inside their finance department, which tells you a lot about their priorities. 
Aiming for quick wins and faster time to revenue, they instead prioritize customer acquisition, but as we all know, it’s so much more costly to add new customers than it is to keep the ones you already have.
In fact, many advisors say that building a customer success program is only appropriate once you’ve secured enterprise-level clients, but customer support has always been our top priority from day one, and it’s worked out very well to our advantage. 
When I first launched ActiveCampaign in college, I handled every customer inquiry myself. I didn’t care if it was a $30 order, I’d spend hours making sure that customer got what they needed. And I saw early on what a huge difference it made in retention. 
So, when I expanded from my solo operation, I made it a priority to invest in wowing our customers and keeping them extraordinarily happy, which has become an essential strategy as we defied conventional wisdom. We listen to what our customers need and have subsequently identified many of the pain points people experience historically in our market. 
We solved a number of those pain points by offering free onboarding, implementation, and training for our platform and free strategy sessions. Most of our competitors charge for those things, and it’s become a huge differentiator for us that’s really paid off in customer loyalty.
3. Pick one thing and do it really well
You’ll hear a lot of startup advice that’s basically some version of “focus on one thing.” This may work out for some companies that offer a single consumer product, but if I had followed this advice, I never would’ve made the pivot from on-premise software to SaaS. 
That switch was one of the driving factors behind my company’s growth and came from throwing the old plan away and starting a new one.
The problem with a hyper-focused approach is that, like it or not, change happens — sometimes unbelievably fast. If the last nine months have taught us anything, it’s that agility is essential, and if your strategy is to “stay the course,” when the inevitable chaos happens, you can’t adapt. 
The idea of staying focused is well-intended to help smooth out some of the chaos of rapid growth. But when my team followed this advice, it stifled our innovation and took us several quarters to get back on track and make progress again. We have found peak innovation by pursuing multiple paths with a mindset of proving the validity of each.
Change forces us to be innovative, nimble, and creative, so you’re better off embracing it. Our team enjoys their work much more when they have the freedom and confidence to tackle new challenges, and it’s a powerful motivator that keeps us pushing forward. 
Entrepreneurs, by nature, are driven by disruption — they want to challenge the status quo. When you ignore those instincts to adhere to some cookie-cutter model of what a startup should do, your business will quickly become stale, stagnant, and stuck.
The best advice
Ultimately, one of the best pieces of advice I ever received is to learn to be OK with not being like everyone else, with not following the typical script and doing things in your own time with your own approach. 
When so many startups come and go, and only a relative few survive, it’s easy to believe that there’s some kind of secret playbook — a singular right way to do it that guarantees success because it worked for all the others that made it.
In reality, the best advice is to ignore all the advice. Stop watching your competitors and other “successful” companies thinking they have some secret answer. Listen to your instincts and your customers. They’ll tell you the right thing to do.

The long-term impacts COVID-19 will have on startups seeking capital,Built In,2020/11/30,"
This article was written by Salvatore Minetti and originally published on Built In.
The world of venture capital has certainly not been immune to the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
But despite the scale and breadth of the disruption, many startups and fledgling companies have discovered new and inventive ways to adapt. Indeed, many have found themselves having to pivot their offering, or shifting their business strategy to ensure that they still secure capital to fund their projects.
Others have been even luckier. For some companies, the pandemic has actually prompted a renewed interest in their business and opened up a field of promising new opportunities. Whether it is digitized customer channels and workflows, or real-time tracking and traceability tools, the crisis has created the need for pioneering solutions, and venture capitalists (VCs) have been paying attention.
[Read: How to build a search engine for criminal data]
No doubt, COVID-19 has presented many challenges to investors. But although there were concerns earlier this year about fundraising and market disruption, the crisis has not shaken underlying confidence. On the contrary, new data shows that funds raised in 2020 have already surpassed the total in 2019. According to a report from PitchBook and the National Venture Capital Association, U.S. venture capital funds raised $56.6 billion as of September 30, compared to the $54.9 raised in all of 2019.
With the promise of new solutions on the horizon and the consolidation of capital continuing to grow larger, emerging companies and the VC ecosystem have shown great resilience throughout such unsettling times.
Globally, we are likely to face further disruption yet in the coming months. As such, business leaders and investors alike will be wondering: What will the long-term impact of the virus be for companies in search of capital?
Sector focus
Understandably, the shift of focus toward pandemic-proof business models and solutions that can help us live alongside the virus might be troubling for some businesses in the long run. Some sectors, like those involving travel or hospitality technology, are likely to face further roadblocks.
Given the current situation, businesses that can sell and offer support virtually will have an obvious and immediate appeal for VCs. But these businesses were always an attractive prospect for investors, and the virus seems only to have accelerated the trend.
Founders should therefore expect to see further VC investment directed toward deep tech startups and organizations that promise profitability in the new normal. They will be on the lookout for long-term survivors that they can steer to sustained success; namely, companies that present clear solutions to modern challenges in the COVID era. Sectors such as biotech, fintech, e-commerce, and cybersecurity software have all been cast into the spotlight.
Investor appetite
While investment activity did slow in the initial period of paralysis at the beginning of the pandemic, it is important to keep in mind that the pace and size of equity investments has remained strong. Indeed, demand for technologies that look to have a big impact by building new infrastructures is exploding, in part driven by the increasing availability of capital and reducing tech barriers to entry.
So, while early-stage funding rounds will still happen, significant emphasis will be placed on cost control and capital efficiency, as well as a plan to conserve cash, as downturns last longer than expected. As such, burgeoning startups in particular would do well to look to venture builders to secure funding, as well as the tools, advice, and network necessary to launch and grow their business.
Will investors become more aggressive on their terms?
Over the last decade, I have noticed that cleaner and simpler terms have increasingly become a norm in the venture investment process. This has been advantageous for all involved and has created more alignment between entrepreneurs and VCs. Using COVID as a backdrop, however, it would be fair to assume that some VCs will now be looking to impose fewer founder-friendly terms in an attempt to de-risk the investment process.
While startups should expect some readjustments as a result of the crisis, it is unlikely that there will be a full-scale return to complicated venture capital term sheets, as bad behavior will likely damage the reputation of investors in the long run.
From my recent experience, founders know their value, and if terms appear to be inequitable, then startups will simply walk away and look for an alternative partner — ideally, one that is able to help them de-risk their offering, rather than merely point out those risks.
The impact of remote working
The pandemic has also seen workforces all around the world trade in their office desks for their kitchen tables — and this has been no different for investors.
While there may have been initial concerns about the potential for mentorship, or the impact on closing deals without the possibility of meeting in person, from a purely mechanical perspective, most VCs have adapted neatly to the changing environment. Whether that is communicating with founders, or completing valuations, remote working has enabled investors largely to continue their business as usual.
Ultimately, even though working from home practices are set to remain the standard procedure for quite some time, VC trends are likely to continue going forward, with an overall increase in the remote mentoring of portfolio companies. Founders should become accustomed to this new process, if they’re not already, and find ways, like streamlining communication, to continue to successfully readjust.
While the VC landscape has endured some substantial change to cope with the pandemic, it is clear that activity is still strong. After all, crises often drive the need for innovation.

What the hell is the Pomodoro Technique and why is it good for productivity?,Yessi Bello Perez,2020/11/27,"
I’ve been covering tech and business for years and I can confirm most people in these spaces, myself included, are obsessed with productivity… particularly new shiny ways to magically become more productive.
Just like in fashion, you can see long-forgotten productivity fads return every few years, and even though it’s been around for a while, you’ve probably recently come across the hot new contender: the Pomodoro Technique.
There’s just one problem with this latest productivity hack — my editor doesn’t quite get it, and appears to be too stubborn to read up on it to understand it.
So let me answer a few of his ‘poignant’ questions and give you a low-down of this great productivity method. It’s no silver bullet but I saw quite a few people talk about it online recently, so I thought I’d give it a go.
[Read: How to build a search engine for criminal data]
“What the hell does it have to do with tomatoes?!”
When I first brought this to my editor, he seemed very confused.
As we are both working from home, he from Amsterdam and me from London, I had to make do with staring at his slightly bemused expression during one of our video calls.
Understandably, he thought I’d gone off on a tangent and had decided to pitch him a story about eating spaghetti infused with tomato sauce in order to boost my productivity.
I get the feeling neither of us is averse to pasta but I had to recover relatively quickly and explain that I was in fact talking about a well-established productivity method that just happened to be named after an edible berry.
[Read: Why this security engineer loves working in infosec]
‘Pomodoro’ does mean tomato in Italian, but it refers to the tomato-shaped kitchen timer the technique’s creator, Francesco Cirillo, used.
The timer is an essential part of the Pomodoro Technique, which Cirillo created in the late ‘80s during his university years. 
It’s a time management method based on 25-minute work intervals, that are then separated by a small break. Each interval is then called a ‘pomodoro’, referring to the tomato timer Cirillo had back in uni — cute, right?
Credit: iStaunchAll hail the magical solution to productivity!!!
“Hmm, fine — but what’s so good about it then?”
The beauty of the technique is in its simplicity. To stick to this time management technique, you only have to follow six basic steps:

Choose the task you want to tackle: This can be something big or simply something you’ve been wanting to do for a while. The only thing you need to bear in mind is that this task should get your full, undivided attention.
Set the timer to 25 minutes and promise yourself that you’ll spend this time fully committed to this specific task.
Work on the task until the timer rings. If for whatever reason you realize you need to do something else, write it down on a sheet of paper but avoid getting distracted.
When the timer rings, cross your task off your list and pat yourself on the back for you’ve just completed your first ever pomodoro.
Take a break. Once you’ve completed your task, take a short break. Don’t spend it at your desk, though, get up, walk around, grab yourself a drink. You get the idea.
Once you’ve completed four pomodoros, you can take a longer break. Aim for either 20 or 30 minutes. Your brain will use this time to assimilate new information and rest before the next round of Pomodoros.

I have to be honest with you: I haven’t actually bothered to get myself a tomato timer. Shameful, I know. Instead, I’ve just given this a go using the stopwatch on my iPhone and by setting alarms every 25 minutes. But if that’s not doing it for you, there are also loads of online timers you can use.
In my opinion, this method is appealing for several reasons. Firstly, it allows me to plan ahead, giving myself clear visibility on all the tasks I need to complete on a given day.
Secondly, it means that I schedule regular breaks — and isn’t this what productivity experts always say one must do?
Thirdly, I really like the idea of spending short bursts on a particular task or project. It makes the working day far less monotonous and actually helps me concentrate more effectively.
More importantly, it’s given me yet another chance to get away from odious to-do lists, which in my opinion, are an unimaginative way to help one remember what needs to be done but do little in the way of prioritizing or incentivizing.
“Why is it trending now though? All my feeds are filled with tomato nonsense!”
I explained all of this to my editor and he finally seemed to get what I was going on about. He did, however, insist on knowing why this productivity method was now back in fashion.
Indeed, it is strange that an old-time management technique is suddenly making a splash in our digitally-driven work lives — but in a way, I think it’s more needed now than ever before.
Think about it: in many ways, technology has allowed us to work more effectively but it’s also increased the number of distractions we’re faced with every day.
Whether it’s Slack, email, or social media, the truth is that we’re constantly having to fight to stay focused. I for one can’t tell you how many times an innocent tap on an Instagram notification has turned into hours of mindless scrolling.
Our attention spans are getting shorter. This is why some people are so intent on doing digital detoxes or making a conscious effort to put down their smartphones during leisure time.
So, what could be more effective, and poetic, than returning to good old fashioned analog methods in order to boost productivity? All hail the tomato.

6 things I wish I knew before I bootstrapped my first SaaS startup,Pierre de Wulf,2020/11/24,"
Three years ago, Kevin, a life-long friend of mine, and I left our jobs and decided to start our own bootstrapped SaaS at the tender age of 25. It was a dream we’d be nursing for a long time as bootstrappers like Rob Walling or Pieter Levels, and communities such as IndieHackers by the Courtland Allen had been a source of inspiration for us ever since 2010. 
So we decided it was finally time to see what we could make of it on our own… but it failed miserably. Here’s what I learned. 
Let’s start off with a bit of background. Before this, Kevin and I launched a small Chrome extension that had around 3000 users. This extension allowed people to save products they wanted to buy online and receive emails once the price dropped. Basically, it was similar to  ShopTagr, just uglier. 
It was a fun project and the first real thing we had released to the world. We quickly realized though it would be tough to grow it into something we could make money from. But we did learn that several of our users were e-commerce owners — rather than regular consumers — who used our extension to spy on their competitor’s product’s prices.
[Read: Neural’s market outlook for artificial intelligence in 2021 and beyond]
From this observation came the idea to build a price-monitoring tool for small and medium-sized e-commerce owners. Both Kevin and I were tired of our 9-to-5 jobs, and we thought this was the perfect timing to try and develop something that belonged to us: PricingBot. 
We thought we had finally found the idea that would make us truly independent. Boy, were we wrong.
Fast forward one year, we were barely making any money and only had three customers. We just barely managed to reach $600 MRR. It was a complete failure. 
After nine months, we abandoned the project (we actually sold it for a small amount of money because the traffic was nice) and moved on to a new idea, ScrapingBee, a web scraping API. We had more success with this one, and we managed to reach $180K ARR in less than 18 months.
So what was the difference between the failure of PricingBot and the success of ScrapingBee? Simply put, experience. Here’s everything I wish I knew when I began my first bootstrapped SaaS — I hope it’ll help you on your own journey.
This thing takes time
One thing you have to realize from the start is that bootstrapping a SaaS is a slow process, very slow. Of course, you’ll hear about fast growth, but real overnight successes are sporadic and not really something you should aim for.
Most of the time, when you look behind a fast-growing bootstrapped business, you’ll find:

Years of building an audience
Several failed attempts 
Consistency

If you take Convertkit, for example, one of the most successful open-startup projects of all-time. Their monthly revenue stalled between $1,000 and $3,000 during the first 18 months, but now they are at $2.1 million MRR!
Credit: BareMetricsConvertkit revenue chart
We can also look at LemList, an email marketing tool that was wholly bootstrapped and is now experiencing incredible growth. They launched less than two years ago and have already reached 3 million ARR! 
That success was far from being an overnight occurrence though. Before its rapid growth, the team had already spent a few years building an audience while launching other tools. You can read more about their story here.
Had my partner and I known how much time it actually takes to make money with a SaaS, we would have probably done A LOT more research before launching PricingBot.
If you need 30 emails to sell a $30/month product, the problem isn’t your emails
With PricingBot, we often had months-long email exchanges to secure a $50-100 subscription. 
It clearly was never going to work.
People don’t like to tell others that they don’t want their product and don’t plan to use it. This is human nature: we tend to avoid conflict and we don’t want to harm. 
So if a lead hasn’t had time to use your product for three months, they probably never will. As a founder, you need to keep that in mind while talking with a potential customer. And if all your discussions tend to span weeks or months before someone even signs-up you probably need to do one of these three things:

You should increase your price, by a lot
You should change your audience
You should change your product

Do not expect to be able to make data-driven decisions from day one

In the early days, data, usage, and user count should be low. That will make your decision process much harder though, as it’ll make it impossible to do things like reliable A/B tests or draw real insights from usage.
Knowing this, it’s useful to look out for clues instead of undeniable proof that something is working or isn’t.
Here are the ones that I find quite relevant.
Clues that you are doing something right:

People are angry when your product does not work
People say that your product is too expensive but pay anyway
People ask you a ton of things, even if your onboarding is awesome

Clues that you are doing something wrong: 

You had a three days down-time and no one bat an eye
You have < 1% conversion rate on your landing page
People love to talk to you but never pay you

Your best source of information won’t be data, but rather a good conversation with your users. Convincing someone to have a quick chat with you can be hard, but Kevin had a great idea when we launched ScrapingBee that allowed us to have around 60 conversations with our users in less than three months.
We offered 10 times what our free plan offered to people willing to spend 15 minutes on the phone with us. And we made sure people knew about the offer by displaying it directly on their dashboard.
Another corollary to that whole “low data” thing, is that even if something is bothering all of your users, you can’t expect all of them to tell you about it. Some people just don’t care enough to tell you.
This is why we have decided to assume that for every customer giving us feedback, ten others felt the same way, but were just not voicing their concern.
Using that, we made a new rule: we’d start talking about implementing a new feature every time three users asked for the same thing. Pareto and all that.
And finally, I want to urge you not to experiment with small changes when your problems are big! If no one is signing up or if no one is using your product, a 10% price decrease or a copy change won’t make the difference. Only optimize once you have something to optimize.
I know it’s hard because most of us would rather try out a lot of small changes instead of rethinking the whole product, but every time you do that, you are lying to yourself.
That’s what Kevin and I did with PricingBot. We thought changing the copy or the pricing would move the needle. The truth was, we had much bigger issues.
When starting, focus on what matters, don’t waste your time on futile things
When bootstrapping, time is both your friend and your enemy. It is your friend because you are owning your time and you can do whatever you want with it. It is also your enemy because this sense of ownership will often make you focus on futile things, and next thing you know, it’s been one year and you haven’t shipped a damn thing.
Here is a list of futile things we used to focus on, and in the end, it does not make any difference:

Product name
Domain
The color of that button (see my previous point)
Logo
Tech stack
Scalability

On the other hand, here are some points that are often overlooked:

Clean landing page. Your landing page must create trust!
Copywriting: no typos and clear sentences
Talking to your users.

Do not expect the acquisition channel to be “plug and play”
Before launching PricingBot I knew that acquisition was hard, but I had no idea it would be that hard. For ads, I thought you only needed to set up a Facebook campaign, add some USD and wait for the money to trickle in. For content, I thought you just needed to write good content and wait for it to rank on Google.
I was wrong. 
Marketing is really hard. And all acquisition channels are very different and complex. It’s ok to try several things in the early days to see what sticks, but once you have found something that works, even a little bit, you should definitely focus on it 200%. If you are new to this and you managed to get something to work, you can get 10 times better at this just by spending time learning about the subject.
It’s not fun because it often means doing the same thing and repeating the same process, but I can guarantee you that this is not a waste of time.
With ScrapingBee, we quickly saw that content marketing was something we were good at. It wasn’t ideal, but it was definitely working for us. 
So we spent the whole year learning a lot about SEO and content marketing — and now we have around 30,000 visitors per month on our website, with (almost) zero ads. Kevin has worked a lot on creating an efficient process to create, publish, and promote our articles, and even it if feels a bit tedious to do the same thing every-time, it’s worth it.

Offer top-notch support
In the early days, your product will probably offer fewer features than your competitors, and it’s nothing to worry about. But that doesn’t mean you can’t outplay them in more than one key area.
One easy way to do it is to offer top-notch support. Install a live-chat on your website and try to be as reactive as possible. Sure, I’ll admit it doesn’t scale and you will lose focus, but honestly, that isn’t important at this point.
By offering top-notch support and talking a lot with your customers, you give yourself a chance to:

Better understand your users
Convince some people to leave a testimonial on your landing page
Prove users that even though you are the new kid in town, you are serious and dedicated to your customers
Find an evangelist who will promote your product for you.

Other key areas to focus on are documentation and onboarding.
Conclusion
All in all those last two years have been crazy and exhausting but I don’t regret choosing freedom over comfort. In retrospect, I think that it would have been hard to not fail with PricingBot considering all the things we didn’t know about how to launch and run a profitable SaaS. I guess the best decision we ever made was to just move over and try something new.
We are now 18 months in with ScrapingBee, a web-scraping API, and things are looking better now. We are building this thing in the open and I regularly share our adventure on Twitter, come and say hi!

3 lessons for every newbie founder competing with industry veterans,Erik Gatenholm,2020/11/10,"
It’s hard to believe it’s been almost five years since I began my entrepreneurial journey within an industry I had heard was nearly impossible to break into, let alone as a young entrepreneur in my 20s. 
The 3D bioprinting industry has been dominated by professors with decades of experience and pharma giants, but I knew with enough passion, grit, and determination, I could break through. I had always been fascinated with 3D bioprinting technology and the life changing opportunities that could emerge if this industry was democratized. 
In 2016 my co-founder and I went full speed ahead to pursue our dream of turning our vision of a world where 3D bioprinting technology was readily available and affordable to the masses into reality. 
While outsiders may see CELLINK as an overnight success story with our recent $1 billion valuation and exponential growth, from an insider’s perspective  the notion of an overnight success is far from reality.
My team and I are extremely thankful for the success we have had but achieving this has meant a lot of sacrifices and we have had to overcome multiple hurdles to get to where we are today.  Below are three things I believe every entrepreneur should consider when breaking into an industry dominated by industry veterans.
1. Do your due diligence
No matter what you want to be successful in, you need to do your due diligence to get a full comprehensive picture of how you can disrupt and contribute to the industry and/or  problem you are trying to tackle. If you’re going after an industry run by a few key players with decades of experience, this is even more imperative. 
Instead of seeing the experience others possessed as a challenge, I saw this as an opportunity to learn. I was maniacally focused on grasping the full picture of the industry I wanted to break into. 
What did they do well? What could they have improved upon? You need to study the history of your industry and take note of the various milestones achieved. Ask yourself, what did it take to get here and why have they not reached the next milestone? What’s holding them back? 
Take small yet impactful steps towards breaking into your industry if you want to truly innovate it in the long haul. Our first step into tackling the 3D bioprinting market was to create a universal bioink for bioprinting of human tissues and organs. We knew that aside from the exorbitant costs of most 3D bioprinting systems, the other challenge scientists faced was having to develop their own bioinks. 
My co-founder and I saw this was a heavily asked question online and decided to take action. Before we even fully launched CELLINK, we set up a webshop to evaluate the demand from our target customers, within 24 hours of launching our universal bionk, we were sold out. At that moment, we knew we were onto something. 
In a matter of months, we decided to take the next leap to developing cost-effective 3D bioprinting technology to accompany our inks and become a full 3D bioprinting solutions provider. It was time to enter the big leagues!
2. Stand your ground
When I started CELLINK, I was 25 years old. I was hungry, motivated, and felt a burning drive to truly disrupt this industry. As my co-founder and I went to raise money, we were quickly met with scrutiny and an onslaught of questions relating to our ability to make a real impact in this field. 
Did we have the experience needed? Did we really have a game changing business model on our hands? Regardless of the numerous negative responses we received, this only made us stronger and more determined to show the world what we were capable of. Giving up simply wasn’t an option. 
We decided to take what many see as an unconventional route of raising money and went public. We took CELLINK public on Nasdaq First North only 10 months after we launched. This to date is one of the earliest IPOs in history.  
We may have been met with a lot of skepticism but found leading industry experts who believed in our technology and us as a team. We began to grow at a rapid pace and started securing partnerships and customers with world renowned research institutions and pharmaceutical companies around the globe. For every shred of doubt we received along the way, we took it with grace and used it to further push us towards our goal.
Even after a $1 billion valuation, acquiring four companies and building a team of nearly 400, we must still be persistent and stand our ground. We continue to have to prove ourselves on a daily basis. It’s part of the job. 
3. Collaborate
Who knows better than your customers? Taking a collaborative approach to work alongside our customers has been instrumental to our success. 
Within the first few months of launching, we developed a Collaborative Partnership Program where in exchange for a discount on our technology, our customers provided us with in-depth feedback on a regular basis and together we explored what it would take to have them reach their goals. 
We knew we had to approach our business through a collaborative lens in order to build products that were not only coveted, but needed. We took a deep dive into the challenges our customers were facing and have continually worked closely to give them what they need to succeed and move the industry forward. 
You can’t play guessing games if you want to succeed, never assume. Taking the time to really get to know your customers and those who you wish to work with can be the differentiating factor that will make or break you. 
Creating our Collaborative Partnership Program has led us to a customer base of over 1,800 labs in 60+ countries.  We now have partnerships with almost every major pharmaceutical company and are working with world leading researchers on groundbreaking drug development, disease model analysis, cosmetic development, and more. 
Collaboration is essential to effectively building relationships, learning, and making an impact. Never underestimate it. 
As I enter my fifth year as the CEO of CELLINK, I look forward to the challenges and victories that lie ahead. As our team and portfolio of products continue to expand, we are taking this next phase to become a bio-convergence company and further provide technologies, products, and services in order to create, understand, and master biology to change the future of medicine. 
Always remember to listen, absorb, and reflect in order to make the right choices to propel your business forward, especially in an industry where you’re seen as the underdog.  Never stop hustling!

Sofia’s startup ecosystem is one to watch — just give it time,Yessi Bello Perez,2020/11/9,"
Bulgaria is yet to produce a tech unicorn, but that doesn’t mean its startup ecosystem should be overlooked.
Over the past decade, Sofia’s startup scene has flourished — even if it’s noticeably absent from the top positions in most tech rankings.
“Sofia is not London, Paris, or Berlin — but it has an excellent shot of coming right after them,” says Svilen Rangelov, the co-founder and CEO of Dronamics, a Sofia-based startup seeking to democratize airfreight.
“Just thinking about how much has been achieved with so little in just one decade, I really believe that in another 10 years, Sofia will be competing for the top three in Europe — and will certainly be in the top five with Tel Aviv,” Mr Rangelov adds.
From communism to capitalism
According to Invest Sofia, which helps foreign companies and entrepreneurs start up in the city, Bulgaria birthed around 2000 startups between 2013 and 2018.
The rise of entrepreneurship in Sofia is particularly significant given Bulgaria’s long-winded transition from communism to capitalism, Mr Rangelov explains: “Ten to 15 years ago, if you were young, talented and ambitious in Sofia, it was most probably the exception. Because the post-communist transition had taken too long, the economy was decimated and the brain drain was brutal.”
[Read: Micromanaging sucks — especially when it’s about your ‘Zoom shoes’]
The demise of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989 paved the way for much needed economic and political change, but it took time for countries such as Bulgaria to catch up with their contemporaries.
Luckily, additional progress was made in 2007 when Bulgaria joined the EU. As a result, multinational businesses opened offices in the country and created jobs that would help attract and retain the nation’s talent. Bulgaria’s famously low flat tax rate may have also played a part in attracting businesses and individuals.
“Tech companies, including home-grown businesses, started competing heavily — some even built their own training academies,” says Mr Rangelov.
“So now, if you’re young, talented, and ambitious in Sofia, you’re either founding or working for a startup.”
Brain drain now seems to be a thing of the past. “There are quite a few founders that have lived abroad and have come back, and quite a few foreign founders are moving here as well, confirming Sofia’s advantages over some of the bigger hubs and contributing to the brain regain that has helped the whole ecosystem grow quicker than any other place in the region,” Mr Rangelov adds.
Struggling beyond Series A
Although the shift towards entrepreneurship is a sign of the times, it’s worth noting that Bulgaria’s startup fabric is far from homogeneous. The vast majority of businesses, according to Mr Rangelov, operate in the software space — and there’s a clear dominance of business-to-business software-as-a-service products.
Sofia is also making waves in financial technology. Cash Credit, which works with mobile network operators to offer microfinancial services to mobile subscribers; and Phyre, a mobile app which transforms a user’s phone into a wallet, are both based in Sofia. In fact, such is the city’s prowess in fintech that fDi ranked the country’s capital as the most cost effective fintech city worldwide for 2019/20 — beating the likes of Vilnius (Lithuania) and nearby Bucharest (Romania).
Sofia’s ecosystem is promising, but it still needs help. Stephane Gantchev, a partner at Launchub Ventures — one of the city’s most prominent venture capital firms — says there are gaps that need to be filled if Sofia is to compete on an equal footing. The arrival of a reputable accelerator, for example, could do wonders for the ecosystem.
As ever, fundraising activity is a great indicator of maturity. According to PitchBook, Sofia’s startups have raised $10.6 million so far this year. Data going back to 2009, shows significant disparities in the deal value year-on-year. The highest figure, $20.4 million, was seen in 2019, and the lowest was raised in 2010.
To put this into perspective — and unfair as it may be to compare Sofia to other more established hubs — UK startups raised a record $12.9 billion in 2019, VCs in France poured a more modest $4.8 billion into companies, and Berlin’s startups received $6.9 billion last year.
If we look at fundraising across other Central and Eastern European countries, we can see Sofia is trailing behind. Poland’s startups — with Warsaw being the main hub in the country — raised $343 million in 2019. Over in Estonia, startups managed to raise $310 million from investors during the same year.
Sofia’s early-stage companies are well-served by local VC funds focused on pre-seed to Series A rounds and an active angel community. Later-stage companies, though, are forced to seek opportunities further afield.
“For bigger funding rounds, it is logical for companies to look for funding outside of Sofia, as at this stage they need a more experienced investor with a larger network and deeper pockets,” adds Mr Gantchev.
This is not an uncommon problem, but much of Sofia’s long-term success hinges on a solution — especially as it affects businesses in several ways. Talent, for example, is readily available, and even though it’s convenient by western European standards, this is both a blessing and a curse.
The capital city is home to 23 universities, more than 100,000 students — 42,000 of whom are in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics — 63 research centers and several independent software schools, including the well-known SoftUni and Telerik academies.
The average software engineer salary in Sofia stands at around $23,000 and senior engineers can expect to earn $38,000 or more, according to local website Obecto. By comparison, the same positions in the UK start at about $44,000, with senior software engineers taking home a minimum of $73,000.
Essentially, this means early-stage startups in Sofia can make investor checks go further, but once a business starts to grow, so do the costs. Eventually, entrepreneurs will look to expand and build teams abroad — and when this happens they usually price themselves out of the local ecosystem, which is no longer able to offer adequate monetary support. In other words, the ticket sizes need to get bigger.
“There are plenty of great funds for pre-seed and seed, but no one is capable of leading a $10 million Series A yet. The money exists, but the type of institutions and family offices that could afford it still prefer other asset classes, and are looking at the sidelines,” Mr Rangelov notes.
Building the future
The availability of early-stage capital has been facilitated further by Bulgaria’s government, which has used EU funds to create a ‘Fund of Funds’, which manages slightly more than $700 million.
The ecosystem is also supported by Besco (Bulgarian Entrepreneur and Startup Community), a non-governmental organization bridging the gap between startups, private and institutional investors, and other key stakeholders in the industry. The hope is that the ecosystem will become more cohesive and that public and private partnerships will spring a new wave of products and services.
Bulgaria will soon see the introduction of a startup visa to make it easier for foreign founders and employers to do business and grow their teams — it is likely to come into effect before the parliamentary election scheduled to take place in March 2021. There’s also upcoming legislation for vesting, option pools and convertible notes, Mr Rangelov says.
There’s no denying that Sofia’s ecosystem needs further support to fulfill its potential — it’s missing much of the infrastructure found in other developed hubs — but perhaps what it really needs is time. For now, the quality of life, cheap rent and nearby ski slopes may be enough to convince founders to set up base there. However, going forward, stakeholders need to figure out how to support the ecosystem’s ambitions of scale and success.

How to make AI work for your business,Ben Dickson,2020/11/7,"
The news about artificial intelligence is mostly dominated by sensational stories such as the ominous threat of deepfakes, deep learning algorithms that create fake blogs, AI bots that create their own language, and generative adversarial networks that create realistic portraits of non-existent people.
But the practical use of AI algorithms is much farther behind than the hype caused by the media. From peer-reviewed breakthrough research presented at mainstream AI conferences to PR-style videos created by large tech companies and well-funded research labs, only a trickle of the innovation we see in the field makes it into real business processes and applications.
And the organizations that are putting AI to good use are those who understand the powers and limits of today’s technology and master the challenges of integrating it into their processes and solutions.
“AI does offer a lot of business value, but much of that value isn’t terribly sexy or visible. Products and processes will be made somewhat better and easier to use. Decisions will be better informed. We’ll continue — and perhaps even accelerate a bit — the amazing progress that we’ve seen over the last couple of decades in data and analytics. But as all of the early adopters have discovered, it’s still difficult to create systems that think and communicate like humans — even in narrow domains,” academic and business author Thomas H. Davenport writes in his book The AI Advantage: How to Put the Artificial Intelligence Revolution to Work.
The book explores the mundane-but-practical side of artificial intelligence that is making a real difference at startups and large organizations. In it, Davenport discusses which organizations and sectors are making the best use of AI, what are the challenges business leaders and decision-makers face in adopting AI technologies, and how to develop a successful AI adoption strategy.
Following are some key insights from The AI Advantage, complemented by some exclusive comments and observations Davenport shared with TechTalks in October.
Hesitation in the adoption of AI technologies
While there’s an impression that AI is seeping into every aspect of life and business (and it eventually will), for the moment, a lot of organizations are on the fence. Albeit interested, many business leaders are loath to invest in a technology that entails a lot of risk.
“Almost every survey suggests that a high degree of enthusiasm about AI exists, but that it’s still early days in terms of broad corporate application,” Davenport writes in The AI Advantage, which is largely based on interviews and examination of AI adoption strategies and outcomes at different firms.
The AI Advantage was written in 2018. Since then and a lot of innovation has happened in the field since then, Davenport stresses that we are still in the early days in terms of production applications.
“A lot of companies did small experiments or pilots, but didn’t fully implement them. I think that companies are realizing that AI will be transformative over the long haul, but only moderately beneficial over the short run,” Davenport said in written comments to TechTalks.
The covid-19 pandemic has also highlighted some of the challenges of AI technologies and has forced companies to reconsider their AI adoption strategies.
“I think the COVID economy has meant that companies are re-prioritizing their applications and emphasizing those that have relatively short payback,” Davenport says, adding that some surveys he has worked on suggest an increased preference in buying AI solutions instead of building them in-house, which may be “a factor of COVID-related conservativism.”
AI adoption limited to tech startups and large companies
Given the barriers and risks involved in the integration of AI technologies, their adoption is currently limited to tech startups and large companies.
“Startups build their businesses around new technologies. Large enterprises are typically next in line; they have the technological sophistication to make informed investments in new technologies, and can hire the people to build and implement new solutions,” Davenport writes in The AI Advantage.
Startups are not bound by established business processes and customers they need to keep satisfied. They don’t have liabilities and commitments that slow them down. They build for the future and raise funding for their ideas and innovations. The founding team already has the required AI talent to build the intended solution. AI is a core component of their business proposition and is integrated into their products from the get-go, therefore they don’t need to worry about making possibly breaking changes to an already working system. Although creating an AI product has many other challenges, startups at least have the fuel and gear to start the journey.
Large tech companies, on the other hand, have the financial resources and the flexibility to launch and manage AI pilot project on the side of their main business. They can create divisions that operate independently and manage their own business models, tailored for the dynamics of new markets created by artificial intelligence innovations. They can hire expensive AI talent and acquire startups that are developing promising technology. And as their proof-of-concept projects meet success, they integrate them into their main products.
More importantly, large companies have a lot customer data, a vital requirement for machine learning algorithms.

Small and medium businesses find themselves in an uncomfortable position. They don’t have the flexibility of startups or the extensive resources of big companies. They are bound to the demands of their current customers and dynamics of the markets they are competing in. They don’t have large data stores and the financial means to acquire AI talent and launch in-house moonshot projects.
And perhaps a key factor that is lacking in small to medium firms from an AI standpoint, Davenport points out in The AI Advantage, is awareness and understanding of what is possible. “Big firms have people whose job it is to look out for promising new technologies and inject them into the organization; small firms usually don’t,” he writes.
“I still see that divide being present. I’m not sure it will change much until traditional software vendors incorporate more AI capabilities into their offerings for SMBs. Then it will be an easy adoption,” Davenport said in his comments to TechTalks. “Before that, I don’t think that most SMBs have the spare time and energy to experiment that large firms do, and they don’t have the pressure to innovate that startups do.”
This does not mean SMBs are entirely deprived of AI innovation. There are established platforms that allow businesses to integrated AI technologies into their processes without much technical effort. One interesting example is natural language processing, which is still one of the most challenging subfields of AI and an active area of research. But while AI researchers continue to advance NLP with new deep learning models, the field has also seen the development of tools such as DialogFlow, which can help you create chatbots for your business and integrate them in your website and social media accounts without in an intuitive way. While DialogFlow is not at the cutting edge of NLP, it is accessible to anyone who can break down interactions with customers into distinct steps.
“Overall, it’s important for anyone implementing cognitive technologies to be aware that they are still somewhat immature. Progress is being made quickly in the current environment, but if your application is on the frontier of that progress you may encounter substantial technical challenges. Before you start with a particular project you may want to assess just how close to the frontier you are likely to come,” Davenport warns in The AI Advantage.
How to integrate AI into your organization’s process

Even when you’re a large company in the right market position, AI adoption is still fraught with perils. “It’s easy to make mistakes if you don’t understand the tradeoffs behind each technology,” Davenport writes. “Understanding these technologies and tradeoffs will inform decisions about which might best address specific needs, which vendors to work with, and how quickly a system of a given type can be implemented.”
The AI Advantage provides some key guidelines that can help companies develop a smooth integration strategy. Here are some of my favorite takeaways:

If your AI integration plan involves machine learning, you’ll need the help of talented data scientists to analytics teams to steer the project in the right direction.
Don’t expect leaps: “In time, cognitive technologies will transform how companies do business. Today, however, it’s wiser to take incremental steps with the currently available technology while planning for transformational change in the not-too-distant future,” Davenport writes.
Plan for redesigning your business processes based on cooperation between AI systems and human operators. “Organizations should think through how work will be done with a given new application, focusing specifically on the division of labor between humans and the AI… Systematic design activity is necessary to determine how humans and machines will augment each other’s strengths and compensate for their weaknesses,” Davenport writes.
No matter how exciting a technology is, if it doesn’t provide business value, avoid it. “Cognitive technology may not result in savings from large layoffs anytime soon, but it does need to provide some business value,” Davenport writes.

The AI Advantage is filled with case studies and examples of successful and failed attempts to integrate artificial intelligence in businesses. The book paints a comprehensive picture of what is working and what isn’t, and how companies can find their way through the treacherous path of achieving AI success.
Per Davenport: “There is no reason virtually every large company shouldn’t be exploring cognitive technologies. Those who explore them earlier and more successfully, those who integrate AI with their business processes, and those who identify and nurture effective collaborations between humans and machines — those companies will dominate the future. They’ll have more appealing products and services, more productive and effective processes, and people who have the time and freedom to be creative and resourceful on behalf of customers.”

Micromanaging sucks — especially when it’s about your ‘Zoom shoes’,Yessi Bello Perez,2020/11/2,"
Approximately seven months ago the world of work — as most of us knew it — was turned upside down. 
As offices shut down and people were sent home to work, the lines between personal and professional became increasingly blurry. Employees had to get used to this new normal but… so did employers. 
[Read: 4 ridiculously easy ways you can be more eco-friendly]
Some managers have embraced the opportunity to take stock of their leadership style, making an effort to ensure their employees feel trusted and appreciated. Others are showing symptoms of micro-managing and paranoia. 
And if you don’t believe me, take a look at this tweet:

This person’s employer makes them show that they’re wearing shoes before Zoom meetings to make sure they’re complying 100% with the dress code while they’re at home. SHOES. Employers, some of you have lost your way.https://t.co/TnQLyn2SSY pic.twitter.com/gPi1WeoIWi
— Ask a Manager (@AskAManager) October 14, 2020

Can you think of anything more awful, or pointless?
Aside from the obvious fact that no one on Zoom can see your feet — if they can, you might be doing video conferencing wrong — this is absolute lunacy.
[Read: What audience intelligence data tells us about the 2020 US presidential election]
Several months ago (although it feels like years), I wrote a piece that looked at four things managers should avoid while their staff is working remotely.
One of the things I spoke about was how there was nothing like a crisis — such as a global pandemic — to highlight a managers’ trust issues.
Here’s the thing: we’re all adults. We don’t need to be told what to wear during a Zoom call in order to seem professional and we certainly don’t need advice on finding a quiet place to work from at home.
What we do need, though, is empathetic, trusting, and transparent leaders who will let us and encourage us to do our best work.
Why it feels like an attack
Olivia James, a London-based performance and confidence coach, says micromanagement is linked to hypervigilance and anxiety.
It can be easy to lose sight of the bigger picture when you’re faced with a crisis.
Yes, having to suddenly send your entire workforce to work from home can be unsettling, I get that. But just because your employees are out of sight, it doesn’t mean they’re not working.
Why would you stop trusting someone to do their job just because you can’t see them?
“Micromanaging is linked to anxiety and hyper vigilance. It is caused by anxiety and it can cause anxiety and frustration,” Olivia James, a London-based performance and confidence coach, tells me.
It’s an attempt by an employer to have control and avoid serious problems with productivity or quality of work, she adds.
The reason why it feels like an attack is because we, the employees, perceive it as a questioning of our professional integrity and competence.
“Our confidence, identity, and self-worth are linked to our pride in our work,” James explains. “This can re-activate the dynamic we may have had with a hypercritical parent, teacher, or partner — making us even more anxious.”
Why managers micromanage
As I’m an empathetic person (read control freak)I can sort of understand why some managers tend to micromanage — especially now.
COVID-19 has caused a lot of stress and uncertainty. Our health — both physical and mental — is under threat and in some instances, job security is hanging in the balance. This is exactly the type of situation where people might subconsciously drift towards micromanaging as it creates a comforting illusion for them. 
“Micromanaging can be an attempt to re-establish a level of control,” James says, adding “It’s also motivated by self-preservation.”
What James means is that employers may think that by keeping a close eye on their newly remote staff they can secure their own survival within a business.
So it wouldn’t be far-fetched to say that if you’re being micromanaged, it’s likely due to your manager feeling anxious too. And if you’re a manager, make sure not to let your own insecurities affect your employees and management style.
Overall, micromanaging can have devastating effects on employee morale, staff turnover, and productivity. It sends a signal of distrust — and let me tell you, in 2020 trust is the cornerstone of survival.

5 tips for global software sales my team learned the hard way,Mikhail Vink,2020/11/2,"
As tech companies expand their reach across the globe, it’s inevitable that some assumptions about various markets will turn out to be wrong, if you don’t rely on the knowledge and expertise of those working on this particular market. 
At JetBrains, which grew from a small startup in Prague to an established company whose tools are used across 213 countries and territories, my colleagues and I had the early assumption that most developers speak English, for instance. It’s a requirement for developers at JetBrains to have good English skills, and most developers in our inner circle are fluent, so we thought it was a safe assumption to make. It isn’t. 
And it’s getting even more demanding when we talk about non-technical decision-makers, which might be the ones deciding on the purchase for their technical team. 
Thus, JetBrains had to learn how to localize its product, marketing, and sales strategy as it expanded. Here are the five top lessons my team and I learned from that experience — read it so you don’t waste time repeating our mistakes.
1. Start small
At JetBrains, we had organic growth across the entire globe, which means our tools were being used around the world before we started local market-specific activities. In Mainland China, which has been one of the most challenging markets to expand on, our software was used and sold prior to our local activities launch back in 2015. 
[Read: What audience intelligence data tells us about the 2020 US presidential election]
That year, as a joint initiative of our Sales and Marketing departments, we launched a pilot program in the country, which is a great way to get your toes in a new market. Mainland China is a huge market, but the culture and purchasing patterns are very different from what we got used to, so we had to adapt our business approaches a lot. 
Moreover,  the company was expected to communicate in Chinese rather than in English, and international credit cards are not widely available in favor of local payment methods, such as WeChat, AliPay, UnionPay, along with many other specifics. 
That all meant we had to localize not just purchasing methods, sales support, and product info, but even the product itself. Only once we saw positive results from our pilot program did we scale that approach to more markets all around the globe, where we have local teams building local operations with an understanding of local business specifics.
2. Do the math
Starting small through the pilot program is important because localizing your business processes, web site, or a product is expensive and cumbersome — especially when it comes to localizing the product itself. 
Our product IntelliJ IDEA is now localized to Chinese, Korean, and Japanese, which requires a lot of investment on our side. And it’s not just the upfront investment, as you can’t localize the product once and then live with it. It requires continuous updates in perpetuity. 
Thus, companies need to do the math and make sure the market in question helps you enough to be worth this lift. In our case, we ran macroeconomics research internally and with third-party agencies. Through that research, we curated countries into different clusters to understand where to go.
The first goal for us was to identify low-hanging fruit where the least effort and expenses can grow revenue the most and then start from there, scaling our local marketing and sales operations country by country, while maintaining a global approach to all other markets.
3. Hire locally
Once you decide it’s worthwhile to expand into a certain market, it’s important to not assume anything. Even if you think you know the market, you probably don’t. Thus, you must hire local professionals who understand the local business. 
I personally had a lot of assumptions about the Russian market, for instance, because I was born there, although I live in Germany now. But it came apparent I didn’t know how sales and marketing worked there, as I had worked internationally for many years. 
Your local team should consist of a regional marketing manager and a regional sales manager to start, and then you can grow the team as required. In Greater China, we also have a developer advocate and support engineers — and we always prefer to expand the team in that order (and it generally corresponds to the market needs as we grow local operations). 
In some countries, like South Korea, we also have a distributor who runs sales, marketing, and support themselves. We quite like this approach, as our partners can help us scale the business a lot, but it’s hard to find reliable partners who would be able to cover all the products and a range of activities required, not acting solely as a billing agent. 
We have resellers and distributors in many countries, and while JetBrains keeps selling directly on these markets and hiring local teams, too, we rely on our partners to provide a truly local experience.
4. Be prepared for unexpected challenges
In general, the Asian market is the most complicated and the European/USA market is the easiest for us since we focused our operations there from the beginning. But despite that, we still haven’t been able to crack the code in France. 
While we expected the market to be similar to Germany (due to macroeconomics similarities and comparable IT industry size), the adoption of our products is roughly four times lower there. Clearly, there are differences in the market structure itself and the way stakeholders learn about products, choose them, and promote them inside their organizations. 
Obviously, we’ve made localization mistakes in other markets as well. For instance, some translations don’t make sense in a particular context (that’s why you always need to localize the experience rather than translate, and why you need to have a local team to verify the artifacts). 
We had a booth at an event in South Korea with an unfortunate banner saying “PyCharm is the best IDE for pythons!” The local contractor did their best but didn’t understand the software development context well enough to localize the slogan. The lesson here is to always be prepared for challenges to pop up — there will be so many!
5. Create a blueprint
Still, we’ve managed quite some successes too, as most of the target markets we chose for local marketing and sales development are outperforming the average worldwide growth of our company revenue. 
As we expanded to new markets, we’ve been able to standardize much of the localization tools, terminology, and workflows. We’ve built out these protocols internally to ensure a high level of quality. 
For instance, we noticed paid events (well, at least when we had events before the pandemics) increase conversions to real participants even if tickets are cheap (we normally set a price tag of a couple of cups of coffee, which is quickly returned by the swag we gave out), while free events tend to lead to a high number of sign-ups but low turnout. 
The former approach also enables predictable attendance forecasts. This has different effects in different markets, but it tends to apply more or less across the board. Some markets and strategies will be useful no matter where in the world your company is.
The bottom line is that expanding across the globe is not easy — but it can be worth it. The key is to identify the markets where the investment in localization is worth your time and effort. Then, hire local people who understand the nuance of that country. 
Doing thorough research and running pilot programs are two strategies that have served us well in numerous countries, but the defining feature of global expansion is not assuming anything and learning as you go. 
Still, there is no silver bullet, and you will need to find your own approaches depending on your industry, product, and business strategy. I hope that some of the JetBrains experiences I’ve shared will come in handy.

Yet another issue professional women need to deal with: LinkedIncels,Anouk Vleugels,2020/10/30,"
This article originally featured in Byte Me, our monthly feminist newsletter that makes everyone mad. In each edition, we choose a “word of the month” that we’ve either made up or found on the internet. Subscribe here to get it straight to your inbox!

Remember when incels would mostly reside in the dark, stinky corners of Reddit and 4chan? They’ve now conquered your father’s favorite social network, LinkedIn — giving birth to an awful new thing:

To quickly refresh your memory, incels are ‘involuntary celibates,’ people (let’s face it, mainly men) who believe they can’t get laid because they’re not attractive enough. Most of them hate women. Some of them shoot up shopping malls.
An incel with a LinkedIn profile might not take it that far — they’re focused on their careers, after all — but that doesn’t mean they can’t hit on random women via Linkedin messages.
If you’re struggling with the word, here’s how LinkedIncel can be used in a sentence: “Welcome to LinkedIncels Anonymous,” said Tom. “A networking club where business professionals can rub elbows and share stories about sexual rejection.”
In a recent piece for Fast Company, author Katie Fiore signals a disturbing new trend on the social platform: women users are increasingly dealing with harassment and misogyny.
Fiore researched the reactions to articles posted by The Female Lead, an online platform that focuses on female leadership. She noted that:

 …many of the comments were filled with derision, marginalization, and even outright hate directed at the female subject of the post. Comments from professional men whose pictures, names, and places of work were visible for everyone to see. Men who felt so comfortable with their misogyny that they were empowered to share it on a platform for professionals designed to help us advance our networks and careers.

And the misogyny on LinkedIn isn’t just hiding in comments and DMs — it’s also in the content itself. Last week, this post landed on my feed:
In addition to being regressive and demeaning — which, for the record, is pointed out by many readers in the comments — why is this post even on LinkedIn?
It’s pretty ironic to suggest that all women should devote their lives to homemaking; the one job you won’t find on LinkedIn. Also, what the hell are safety pads, and why would women need men to buy them?
So what’s LinkedIn doing about all this? According to a recent blog post, the platform will be rolling out some ‘anti-harassment’ features this fall.
Before publishing new posts, users will be reminded to respect the guidelines and keep it professional. Direct messages that are deemed inappropriate by LinkedIn’s algorithm will show up with a warning:

While such a feature lowers the barrier for users to report unwanted advances, LinkedIn is unclear about what will happen after reporting; just that it will take “appropriate actions.”
And, as Fiore states in her Fast Company article, these tools don’t seem to acknowledge the underlying issue: that it’s mainly women who need to deal with this crap. They’re on LinkedIn to further their professional careers, and now they have to become full-time unpaid moderators, too?
So, a closing note to the men: stop using LinkedIn to hit on women. If you come across a pretty profile picture, no need to tell her about it. And please, please don’t send unsolicited dick pics via inMail. Nobody endorsed you for being a pathetic little pervert.

Being a paradoxical manager is a good thing — here’s why,Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten,2020/10/29,"
Boris is the wise ol’ CEO of TNW who writes a weekly column on everything about being an entrepreneur in tech — from managing stress to embracing awkwardness. You can get his musings straight to your inbox by signing up for his newsletter!
The paradox of tolerance states that if a society is tolerant without limit, its ability to be tolerant is eventually seized or destroyed by the intolerant.
I think about this a quote lot these days when I observe politics, but also in terms of social interactions, and even in how I manage my company — which I realize can be quite paradoxical at times.
For me and the people I surround myself with, tolerance comes easy, but applying those values to a whole organization can be tricky. The reason is that for a company or organization to be truly tolerant, you’ll have to be a little intolerant.
As the person that defines a company’s culture and values, you need to set clear boundaries from the beginning and determine what type of intolerance you won’t tolerate — if you don’t, you risk your hard work being undermined.
Tolerance doesn’t work without intolerance, but this paradoxical thinking applies to so many other aspects of growing a company.
I firmly believe you’re most creative when you have clear boundaries or you face seemingly narrow restrictions. NOT being allowed to do something, pushes you to find innovative solutions — something you might never have thought of if you hadn’t been forced to.
I’ve found that if you want your employees to feel free, you’ll have to be very clear on rules and expectations, otherwise everybody will be anxious about misinterpreting how free they can really be.
The same goes if you want to be seen as a kind and compassionate person. Making it clear where the line is gives meaning to your compassion as it makes people understand it’s based on actual values rather than just a blanket response.
And if you’re seeking perfection, you’ll also have to start by accepting some things won’t be perfect. Striving to perfect something means focusing on it, while acknowledging that imperfections will arise in areas you aren’t investing time in. For a process to have perfect results, you’ll have to accept a lot of imperfect actions to get there.
So the next time you feel like you’re contradicting yourself, don’t worry — being a paradox is a good thing.

My failed startup: Lessons I learned by not becoming a millionaire,Daniel Homola,2020/10/29,"
Let’s start with the one minute version: I was part of the EF12 London cohort in 2019, where I met my co-founder. Together, we pursued an idea that I had for a while:
A privacy-preserving medical-data marketplace and AI platform built around federated deep learning.
The purpose of the platform would have been to allow data scientists to train deep learning models on highly sensitive healthcare data without that data ever leaving the hospitals. At the same time, thanks to a novel data monetization strategy and marketplace component, hospitals would have been empowered to make money from the data they are generating.
We received pre-seed funding, valued at $1 million. Then the race for demo day began with frantic product building and non-stop business development. Unfortunately, my co-founder fell out of love with the idea after enduring months of business development hardship. Then we failed to pivot to something we both liked, so we split up and I went on my own way.
The whole ordeal was an amazing mixture of fun, challenging learning opportunities, and uninhibited misery (but mostly fun). Make sure to check out the demo of the MVP I built.
I’ll go into the details for those curious about what you can expect from an entrepreneur journey. But if you’re in a rush, feel free to skip ahead to bullet points of what I learned (just CTRL+F ‘Takeaways’). 
How do you find a co-founder?
Back in early 2019, I left my job at IQVIA to join the London cohort of Entrepreneur First. EF is an amazing incubator / accelerator program that has given the world the likes of Magic Pony and hundreds of other exciting companies.
‘Entrepreneur’ what?
The main thing that sets EF apart from the dozens of similar programs is they focus on the earliest possible stage of companies: sole founders. They take in a hundred talented and ambitious individuals in each cohort (actually almost 200 when you count the other European EF sites: Berlin and Paris).
Then the good people of EF will make everyone go through a weird, speed-dating meets Love Island type of co-founder finding process.
In this phase, for weeks on end, you are simultaneously reading the CVs of super interesting cohort members and having ludicrously blue-sky chats with them, about potentially world changing companies the two of you could build. By the end of this process, you should end up with a co-founder.
EF also gives you a stipend, a place to work and a ton of high quality material on the basics of entrepreneurship and startup building. But I think the real USP of EF, is the access to this pool of pre-screened, highly talented and motivated people, who all left their (sometimes lucrative) day jobs to become members of the cohort and build companies.
From beers to business
As a naturally skeptical person, I wasn’t sure what to think about this process. I did what was expected of me: read CVs, talked to people, came up with outlandish ideas. But I didn’t really click with anyone.
Finally however, after many beers and chats, I found my co-founder, with whom we just had enough in common (interest in healthcare and machine learning) to make our discussions fruitful, but with whom our skills were complimentary enough that we could take advantage of having two people on the team.
This latter point is in fact quite crucial: too often, we’re naturally attracted to people with similar interests, skills and thinking to our own. This is great for friendships, but can be devastating in a startup where you want the co-founders to cover each other’s blind spots.
Both my co-founder and I are “techies” in broad terms. But it was quite clear from the beginning that I am more of a CTO type who loves to build, whereas he liked the process of selling and pitching, which is quite important because that’s pretty much all you do as an early stage startup CEO.
Fortunately (as this is quite rare AFAIK), we both had a good share of the skills of the other’s role too. This really helped with both the technical and business discussions between the two of us.
Do you have a $1 billion idea?
Something we all learned fairly quickly in EF was the economics of venture capital. It’s really quite simple and goes something like this:
Venture capitalism 101:

There’s a huge amount of excess money slushing around in the global financial system.
Most investors stratify their investment portfolios according to some risk profile. This usually means that they are happy to put 1-to-2% of their capital in high-risk ventures. Funding highly risky tech startups is one of these high-risk venture types. Another would be to buy crypto for instance.
VC firms utilize this and go out every x years to raise a round, i.e. pool together capital from wealthy individuals and investment funds.
Whatever they raise is the fund that can be allocated by the partners of the VC firm, as they see fit.
Most VCs work on a 2/20 rule: they will take 2% management fee each year, plus 20% of any profit they make. (It’s worth noting here, that 2% of a billion-dollar fund is still a few million for each partner each year, even if none of their funded companies exit or do particularly well. Yeah, being a VC is quite lucrative.)
VCs promise extraordinary returns to the investors. Certainly well above anything that’s attainable with reasonable risk profile on the market. How can they deliver?

To achieve this they can either fund companies where they expect that most of them will grow 100%.
Or fund companies where none of them will grow a 100%, because most will grow 0%, and potentially one or two will grow 1,000% or 10,000%.



Companies from the first group are called successful medium sized business. The latter ones are called unicorns: startups in hyper-growth mode, overtaking and disrupting a whole industry like AirBnB or Uber did for example.
Not all ideas are created equally
Even though probably both investment models could be equally successful, VCs want to invest in high impact firms that will change the world. Think Google, Facebook, and Twitter.
I’ll leave it to your judgement whether this is a healthy and sustainable business model. I will certainly write more about this in the future, but I will say this: VCs serve a super important function in the global innovation market and without them, the world would be different in countless ways.
The corollary of all the above is that if you go down the VC backed startup building path, you need an idea that can become a 1 billion-dollar company. Yes, that’s a billion with a capital ‘B.’
Start me up!
We spent weeks ideating with my co-founder, but after dozens of discussions we came back to the idea I arrived to EF with. It was the only one that seemed simultaneously ambitious and high impact enough that a VC might take a liking to it, while also having the potential to grow into a multi billion-dollar company. Also, neither of us hated it, which is quite important, I heard.
The idea
I had this idea for a company for months before applying to EF:
The world’s first, privacy-centered medical-data marketplace and machine learning platform, powered by federated deep learning.
I couldn’t wait to tell all the people at the cohort about it, so I did. And they all made the exact same face you just did when you read the sentence above.
The problem with deep tech ideas (besides not fitting on a napkin) is that for the most of us not well-versed in the particular field, they are often indistinguishable from vaporware and snake-oil.
You really have to know a lot about healthcare informatics, medical machine learning, federated deep learning and also the financial incentive structure of the US healthcare industry to properly evaluate that one sentence above.
If you do that, it will not only make a lot of sense but you’ll find that it’s offering one of the very few viable long-term solutions to the impossible trade-off healthcare faces in the 21st century:
The patients’ natural right to data privacy is in direct conflict with data pooling and with how much we can learn from this data with current AI algorithms.
This is bad news, because without the deployment and proliferation of AI, healthcare is doomed. Another indication that the above idea might not be the worst ever is that Google Ventures already backed an amazing team to do exactly this. Yeah, finding that out wasn’t fun…
The idea explained
Probably it’s easiest to explain the idea for our startup by enumerating some of the relevant problems that plague healthcare currently:

Hospitals and outpatient clinics generate vast amounts of incredibly rich and detailed data about patients. We’ll call these institutions providers.
This generated patient data is extremely sensitive, and people are rightly concerned about who gets to use or analyze it.
Pharmaceutical companies, biotech and med-tech AI startups are all hungry for this data and could develop amazing new drugs, therapies, diagnostic tools, algorithms by leveraging it. We’ll call these companies vendors.
Providers are often cash-stripped and as a consequence struggling to provide the highest quality of care for their patients.
Vendors have ample resources (money) and a clear need to access this data. Furthermore, by providing this data to them securely, the world could undoubtedly become a better and healthier place through their innovation.
Even if vendors had access to this data, deploying AI models at scale, in a live hospital setting is still one of the biggest unsolved challenges of digital healthcare.

Once you write down these six simple facts about today’s healthcare systems, it really doesn’t take long for the light bulb to start flashing.
We need to build a marketplace where providers can sell access to their data without compromising patient privacy and where vendors can get access to this data to learn from it and train models on it. Furthermore, once vendors have a model trained, they need to be able to easily deploy it to network of hospitals, where those models could start to generate useful (and potentially life-saving) predictions.
But how could anyone use sensitive data without actually having a look at it, thereby immediately compromising patient privacy?
The answer is quite remarkably simple, and it’s been powering all sorts of technologies (like predictive texting on your phone) for years. It’s called federated learning and it’s first real-world, large scale application came from Google (as far as I know) following this paper. Then, many – more – followed and amazing open source libraries were released like PySyft by OpenMined, or FATE by WeBank.
Federated learning’s simplest explanation can be boiled down to a single sentence:
Instead of moving the data to the model, let’s move the model to data.
Suffice to say that this idea has found applications in several security and privacy conscious industries, but its impact on healthcare will truly be transformational. Have a look at these two recently published Nature articles to see what federated learning holds for the future of multi-institutional medical studies and digital health applications.
If you’re curious about the technical details and implementation of our idea, make sure to check out this page about the MVP I built, or watch my demo of it below.

To recap:

We wanted to build a platform to enable researchers and data scientists of pharma and biotech companies to access highly granular and information rich patient data from US hospitals to train models on it,
without the data ever leaving the four walls of those hospitals and without the researchers ever being able to actually look at the data.
We wanted to leverage federated deep learning and a federated data query engine to achieve this.
The best part? The hospitals would have made money out of the mountains of data they are sitting on, without ever compromising patient privacy, while simultaneously enabling vendors to innovate, research and develop therapies.
Furthermore the learned algorithms could have been deployed back to the federated hospital network and put to good use.
We wanted to charge vendors according to the well-known SaaS business model and share a sizable fraction of our revenue with the hospitals so they become financially incentivized to partner with us.
How? Every time a hospital’s data would have been used to train a model, they would have got compensated based on the number of patients and data granularity they provided for the study.

Here’s a flowchart of the smallest possible incarnation of our platform with just two hospitals connected to the federated data network.

The rollercoaster life of a founder
The EF program is structured according to a fairly well thought out schedule that gives a nice framework for working on your idea.

In the first few weeks you should get data about the market’s reaction to your idea. This means you’re constantly on the phone (sometimes for 6-8 hours straight), talking to people, who are often not that interested, but you begged your way in or forced them some other way.
You’re doing all of this to basically “Mom test” your idea.
This is a neat little trick to get around the problem of people being too nice. Yes, that’s actually a problem, as they’ll outright lie in your face and say that they like your idea and would even pay for it. Only then to completely disappear after the call.
The reason for this is quite simple: no one likes to be the a-hole who breaks the soul of budding entrepreneurs. Contrary to popular belief, people on average are fairly nice that way, so they’ll naturally try to say something good about your idea, even if it’s objectively terrible and they knew from the second minute, they’ll never ever use it.
In this early phase, it’s not a big deal if people are hanging up on you. You should just have as many calls as possible, be resilient and accept that no one cares about your idea besides you. Keep your head down, collect data and try to find out if there’s anyone out there even remotely interested in buying what you have to offer.
In the next phase of your VC fueled company building, you are trying to produce some form of “traction” to prove to your future investors (the EF Investment Committee (IC) in our case), that in fact, your idea is a viable business.
Traction can be many things, depending on the complexity of your product. Here are a few types of traction in decreasing order of impressiveness:
Signed up users / companies with their card details already taken, ready for doing business with you.
Signed contract with another business for a (hopefully) paid trial. Contract for an unpaid trial is the next best thing here.
Letter of intent from another company or institution. This is usually a document with purposefully vague and legally non-binding language in which your future client (you wish) says that they don’t think your idea is totally crazy and (if the stars align and the director wakes up in the right good mood) they might even consider using it one day. Maybe…
Then you take all this evidence that you’ve gathered through hundreds of interviews and thousands of emails and present it to the EF Investment Committee. If they like your idea, you get £80k for a 10% stake in your company. You get to work on it more till you reach the maturity to pitch your company at demo day to dozens and dozens of great VCs with the intention of raising a seed round (~£1-2M) with one of them.
If you get seed funded (usually 4-6 months after demo day) then hurray, your VC fueled company building journey can finally begin. Unfortunately, the odds are still heavily stacked against you:
There’s only about a 20% chance you’ll make it to the next funding round. Quite annoyingly, you’ll need several of those in the coming years to keep your unicorn alive – they are hungry beasts.
There’s a 97% chance that you’ll fail to exit, i.e. fail to turn your years and years of grueling work into hard earned millions.

Hm… That was depressing to learn, but don’t worry, it’ll get worse.
The up
As anyone who’s ever tried will tell you, building a company is like being on a rollercoaster ride. Sometimes you have days that feel like none of the days in your previous office jobs. You feel amazing, fulfilled and working on something truly meaningful (at least to you).
Even better, sometimes things just work out. Like when we started to ask huge and well-known US research hospitals if they would partner with us (two random unfunded guys from London) to build the world’s first federated machine learning platform for healthcare and they just said “yeah sure”.
Or when the second and third meetings started to occur with these teams, and the term “letter of intent” started to fly around a lot. We felt invincible. Even if it took more than a hundred Zoom calls and thousands of emails sent out, we thought we are clearly making progress with business development here.
The top
Then the rollercoaster continued and took us to this amazing top. Armed with our letters of intent and signed project proposals with these hospitals, EF’s IC said they’d invest in us and just like that, we got the pre-seed funding.
Roughly 30% of the initial EF cohort make it this far so we felt great. Even though we knew the work is just about to get a whole lot more challenging and crazy, there’s a moment when you have your first little success and you start quietly wondering to yourself:
Maybe we’ll be among the 1% of startups that actually make it… I know it’s unlikely, but maybe this will all just work out fine!
I was also super excited that I get to finally build again after months of not coding. Don’t get me wrong, conducting BD calls, writing marketing materials, technical documents, grants, drafting SOWs and LOIs was extremely educational too and they are necessary and unavoidable parts of every company formation. Nonetheless, I was itching to actually get back to the thing I love doing and I’m reasonably good at.
The down
After the pre-seed investment, I was 100% on building and my co-founder was 100% on business development. We only had 2.5 months till demo day to:

Build an MVP of the highly complex product we envisioned.
Get extremely conservative and risk averse pharma companies and hospitals to sign up with our marketplace.

Our plan seemed straightforward. I am going to take care of the first one and my co-founder is doing the second. Even though we knew the second is probably dependent on the first being ready, we agreed to work as hard as we can and try to have our first customers by demo day in late September 2019.
However, the cracks started to show quite early on… The business development process went from painfully hard (pre-IC) to near impossibly hard (post-IC). Many people told us that letters of intent are worth the same as toilet paper, and we should try to convert those into signed contracts for paid or unpaid trials ASAP, so that’s what we tried to do.
Despite my co-founder’s heroic efforts however, after months of negotiations, meetings, project proposals and more meetings with US hospitals, every single lead of ours simply dried up. Emails went unanswered. Crucial final meetings with the key stakeholders did not happen.
When the discussions turned real, and when hospitals realized that for this fancy-sounding research project they’d need to actually provision resources for us so we can integrate our software into their IT systems, they went cold turkey on us.
The small up before…
We realized that we made our own lives impossible by trying to aggressively innovate on two fronts at once:

We wanted to build a federated ML platform for deep learning models in a notoriously conservative industry, leveraging highly sensitive data with tons of regulations around it.
We wanted to create a marketplace, therefore we had to find not just one customer type but two: providers and vendors too.

Even just one of these goals would have been insanely hard for a two-person team to pull off in 6 months, but doing them together was clearly way too much. So we pivoted and said:
Let’s sell our federated ML platform to pharma companies. Let them use it with their existing hospital relationships however they see fit.
This wasn’t the worst idea to be honest. Pharma companies already have longstanding relationships with hospitals and outpatient clinics, as these connections are essential for recruiting patients for new clinical trials.
Healthcare – as we found out to our own detriment – is built on trust and slowly evolving long-term partnerships. There’s very little place for disruptive technologies, especially pushed by small companies. Due to the heavily regulated and risk averse nature of healthcare, you can have the best tech product and it’ll still be extremely hard to sell (this was confirmed to us by numerous companies on the market).
So we thought, let’s sell the technology to the innovation leads and heads of data science of large pharma companies. Then they will take care of getting the tech to the data, i.e. inside the hospitals.
The crash
This hasn’t really changed the MVP I had to build, only the way we’d demo it to users potentially, so I proceeded further with full steam.
My co-founder in the meanwhile was trying to line up as many demo opportunities as he could, so we would have a good chance of converting at least one or two of those into an unpaid trial by demo day. Then we’d have our hard-won “traction” in our hands for our discussions with VCs.
I finished the MVP and we started to demo it to large pharma companies. Quite miraculously, none of them thought it was terrible. In fact, some of them even murmured something positive about it during the call.
But crucially, none of them jumped out of their chair singing Hail Mary, thanking us for finally solving their long standing hair-on-fire problem. Instead, they all said, they’ll get back to us after they had some internal discussions.
Although sales cycles in healthcare are notoriously long, and selling to pharma as a tiny startup is near impossible, we knew we missed the mark. We could simply feel after these calls that we aren’t solving any of these teams’ top 3 problems. What we offered was definitely in the top 10 or 15, but not even close to top 3.
And then, to make things worse (or better?), I learned through a series of honest chats with my co-founder that his heart wasn’t really in federated learning anymore.
Turns out, it’s a pretty big problem when the CEO of a company is not emotionally invested in and hyped up about the very thing the company is selling. It’s especially bad if this happens literally weeks before he’s supposed to stand in front of a hundred VCs and convince them that our business is the one that’s going to change the world and which is worth their £1M investment.
Operation salvage
I totally empathized with the frustration of my co-founder after he struggled for months to sell without much to show for it… However it felt rather bad to give up on the idea at the very last minute.
Granted, our traction was practically non-existent at that point, but I suspected from the beginning that selling this product will be incredible hard and might potentially take years. We also knew for a fact that selling our product isn’t impossible, as we have found companies that managed to get into US hospitals and others that worked successfully on something similar to our idea (although both with incredible funding behind their backs). So personally I wasn’t disappointed, and I wasn’t that surprised with our lack of progress. But clearly my co-founder was and it was him who had to muster the energy day after day to try and sell this thing.
It was pretty clear to me that just like you cannot make someone love another human being, you cannot make someone feel passion for something for which they simply don’t. So reluctantly, I agreed to move on and use the rest of our pre-seed funding to build something else for the next demo day (which was scheduled for 6 months later).
We told our plans to EF (who were really nice and supportive about it), then proceeded to conduct one of the most painful 4 weeks of my life. We brainstormed in the Google Startup Campus, the British Library and countless pubs and cafes of London for days on end. We were desperately trying to come up with an idea which we both felt good about, meaning we would be willing to dedicate a couple years of our lives to it.
Whiteboard sessions came and went, beers and many more coffees were had. We tried for hours each day, but one of the two following scenarios kept happening:

Either founder A hated the idea founder B just pitched or,
we both quickly realized that founder B’s idea was genuinely terrible, so we just laughed (or cried).

The end
After weeks of this, I proposed to leave the company and sell my shares to my co-founder. Again, EF was incredibly nice about this and signed all the necessary contract modifications that allowed me a clean exit. Then, on a rainy October day, six months after joining EF, my co-founder and I said goodbye in a typical London pub and that was the end of my first startup.
As I walked towards the tube, lots of thoughts and feelings were rushing through my head… None of them particularly positive or pleasant, but I knew I made the right decision.
Takeaways
I probably learned more about myself and the world in those six months than in the preceding 2.5 years in my typical 9 to 5 corporate data-science job. I couldn’t possibly summarize all of it here and some (or most) of it might be completely trivial to some readers. So here’s a list of my top learnings.
What did I learn?

Product market fit is (almost) everything. It’s a simple sounding but pretty complex idea. Here’s a good intro to it, and here’s the best step by step guide I’ve found so far about how to achieve it.
Ideas are cheap. Execution is all that matters. It’s been repeated ad-nauseam in startup circles but I think it’s mostly true so worth noting. Although, some successful people challenge this and advocate the exact opposite. The truth (as usual) is probably somewhere in the middle, but definitely closer to the “ideas are cheap” side. (Related tip: never be afraid to talk about your idea. It’s the only way to find funding and co-founders (and most likely you’ll need at least one of those)).
The tale of two ideas: imagine you have two ideas, X and Y. Let’s say, idea X solves a problem, which for a 100 people is so serious, they’d sell their kidneys (both in fact) to get it fixed. Idea Y solves a problem for a 10,000 people and they’d be willing to pay (they say) $20 for it. Which one you should pursue? Before EF, I would have chosen idea Y in a heartbeat. Today, I’d kill to have an idea that is like X. Always choose idea X.
Finding a great co-founder is exceptionally hard, although I definitely lucked out with mine on many fronts. In general, and contrary to popular startup wisdom, I’d prioritize the following qualities above charisma, genius-level IQ, qualifications or anything else: integrity and honesty, intellectual rigor and logical consistency, good (but not crazy) work ethic and resilience and patience, and sense of humor and being able to laugh at oneself.
Creating a great team of first 10 employees is even harder than finding a co-founder (from what I heard) and it’s probably the most important thing any founder will do after securing funding, as it will most likely determine the culture of the entire company for many years to come.
Sales, marketing and UX are super important. Probably more so than your code (especially at the beginning).

Related tip: don’t be the dumb tech guy that builds it, expecting the users to just show up and start using and loving it.


Mom test everything.
Being able to evaluate business ideas critically is a fundamental skill for founders. The good news, that it can be learned. Also, a good checklist helps.
Spending time on finding out what is it that you’d work on even if you didn’t get paid for it, is an amazingly useful way of focusing your life and career.
Some healthcare related takeaways I wish I knew before starting:
Healthcare is conservative, built on trust and slowly evolving but longstanding relationships and partnerships.
As a not surprising consequence of this, the average age of founders of unicorn healthcare startups is significantly higher than of tech unicorns.
Also, healthcare seems to be the only industry where having a PhD and many years of relevant experience is a prerequisite of being successful. In most other industries a BSc and/or an MBA seems to be enough.
If you are planning to build and sell any tech related product in healthcare, be prepared for extremely long sales cycles, business partners who proceed with extreme caution and who care a lot about the optics of your company.
Therefore, all in all, healthcare is not best suited for tiny startups, created by starry eyed 20-30 something founders with tiny professional networks and little work experience in the field.

What do I miss?
Being a founder of your own deep tech company feels amazing on most days. Here are some of the things I miss:

The autonomy, responsibility and fast pace is infectious and invigorating. Especially coming from a traditional healthcare behemoth like IQVIA.
Living in a “Come on, we can do this!” mindset and being surrounded by people who think that way.
Being surrounded by motivated, ambitious, highly educated and driven people who chose to veer off the traditional corporate track is amazing. Again, in my opinion this is definitely the USP of EF.
Being able to determine the work schedule and culture of your team.
Being able to just spend a whole day on learning about something, because that’s what the business calls for.
Talking to other founders and potential customers teaches you that the world is so much more complex, interesting and nuanced than it seems as an employee in a small vertical of a single industry. There are hundreds of industries, all with their own inefficiencies, suboptimal solutions, knowledge gaps, tech hurdles. Learning about these is fascinating and broadens you as a person and as a professional.

Will I do it again?
Absolutely! Although I might take a different funding route.
But that’s a topic for another post…

This article was written by Daniel Homola, a founder and senior data scientist with a PhD in biomedical machine learning. With years of experience in healthcare AI, he has built disease detection models, developed federated learning solutions, and secured funding for his own deep tech startup in this space. You can read the original piece on Homola’s website here.

How to use social media to land your first programming job,.cult,2020/10/28,"
This article was originally published on .cult by Will Johnson. .cult is a Berlin-based community platform for developers. We write about all things career-related, make original documentaries and share heaps of other untold developer stories from around the world.
Landing your first job in tech can be hard. Especially when you have no experience in the field. I’ve worked in factories and call centers most of my adult life. I only learned how to code when I was 33 — this was in my free time outside of my 12-hour shift and while raising six children with my wife. I’m not going to lie, it was hard. I applied to countless jobs and felt the sting of rejection time and time again. “No experience,” they would say, even if I killed in the interview. I was at the bottom of the ladder and dying for a break.
I started using social media to break into tech
The traditional approach wasn’t working, I had to switch it up and think outside the box. No one wanted to take a risk on me, probably because anyone can say they are ‘hard-working’ and ‘passionate’ when it comes to software development — it’s not enough. I decided to show how hard-working and passionate I really was using the power of social media.
Step one was creating a Twitter account where I would begin to document my journey or “learn in public” as Shawn Wang once described it. I had zero followers and didn’t know a single person working in tech. I started by throwing up a picture of whatever I happened to be learning at the time, then pictures of books I was reading, courses I took, meetups, podcasts and side-projects. Twitter was a living archive of my learning journey.
Is it a waste of time to post about everything you learn? If you’ve got no followers, no one will see, right? Wrong. The people who created the courses you take and wrote the books you read are also using Twitter (or some other social media). Tag the instructor, author, creator or website in your post — that’s what I did. I’d tag the author of the book I was reading, I would tag the meetup accounts and the organizers. Those creators love to see people getting value from the things they made, so you’re actually doing them a huge favor.
In February, I started my Twitter account and by October I had landed a job in tech and built some great relationships in the community. I’d jump on calls with my new connections and learn as much as I could. One person would introduce me to another and so on, and like a snowball, my presence in the community grew and grew until eventually, I landed on a podcast (aimed at Junior developers) and was asked to speak at a conference outside of the country.
What I’d inadvertently done was create a solid reputation for myself in the community and for me, it went much further than any resume could. Doing this allowed me to create a story, a unique one where I was controlling the narrative.
I was motivated by others
It wasn’t just me using social media to record my learning journey… Kyle Shook, another developer on Twitter, was always posting these really cool CSS animations. They were highly detailed and you could tell he put a lot of time and effort into making them. Well, his hard work paid off. A company saw what he was doing and contacted him with an offer.
Another tech influencer, Dhanish Gajjar was using Instagram to post the notes he was taking, the courses he was learning from, and the problems he was solving. He also created CSS challenges for other developers to participate in. He would post something he made and would ask others to submit their version. Similar to Kyle, a company reached out to Dhanish with a job opportunity, and he still works there today.
I’m not saying you should quick your job search and become an influencer. I’m trying to show what a powerful and effective tool social media can be in as a developer. Most of us (especially early on) are scrambling to learn and master as much as we can, but no one can see that unless you show them. Build your learning portfolio and see what opportunities come your way.
Helping others was important
One other point: I made sure my ‘learning in public’ wasn’t all about me. If I’d take a course, I’d help the instructor out by answering a couple of questions or directing them to a link that could help them. By helping others solve problems it would reinforce the information I’d learnt, it was win-win.
This also showed potential employers that I was willing to help and communicate — skills that are very important for developers, especially with the rise of remote work. Most of your communication is done via the same medium (slack, email, GitHub). So showing you’re an effective communicator ahead of time gives the employer one less thing to worry about when considering you.
My big break
Leading up to my first full-time job, I leveraged the network I had created as much as possible. People in my network would recommend me to employers and even act as my reference, through this I got a few freelance clients which allowed me to prove my skills. Then as I mentioned earlier, my big break finally came after six years laboring in factories.
I can’t say one thing worked more than the other — it was the compounding effect of everything: the network, the hustle, the friends, the learning. And it doesn’t just end when you get a job, it will help you with your next one and everything else you want to accomplish in your career.
Don’t worry about trying to be or look perfect. I know Instagram is full of developers who have amazing desks and take beautiful pictures. But that’s not important, all you need is your phone a couple of minutes to post, don’t think so much about it, the most important thing is to just start. You never know who is watching but some great things can happen when you put yourself out there, and everyone is rooting for you whether it feels that way or not. We want to see you win and reach your goals and celebrate your progress.
Recap:
If you’re not having any luck with the traditional job search, use social media to showcase your hard work and ingratiate yourself in the community. The relationships you build and potential opportunities are worth the effort. It was a tough long journey for me but I kept showing up every day and that’s how I got my first break: a remote gig that I love. It’s a complete 180° from everything I’ve done in the past, and if it’s possible for me it’s possible for you.

Agile marketing tips to grow your startup even faster,Gilad David Maayan,2020/10/27,"
Marketing is a volatile landscape in which the only certainty is change, especially when it comes to digital marketing. Every day, huge amounts of content are created, collected, consumed, and distributed across an increasing number of media channels. 
Brands compete over increasingly short attention spans of potential and existing customers. Agile marketing helps startups create their own digital presence and reach prospective customers — so you better know how to make it work for you.

What is agile marketing?
Before diving into how to go about adopting it, let’s start by defining what agile marketing means. 
Agile marketing is a strategy that you can use to find, test, and implement focused marketing projects. In general, agile strategies involve breaking projects down into component pieces and working on those pieces in sprints (set time periods). 
[Read: What audience intelligence data tells us about the 2020 US presidential election]
After each sprint, you evaluate your progress and the overall project to ensure it is moving in the right direction and to verify if any changes need to be made. 
When implementing for marketing projects, these strategies can be used to break down larger projects, including ad campaigns, website user testing, or rebranding. The benefits of implementing agile in marketing workflows include:

Clear focus — goals are clearly defined from the start and projects are crafted to fit those goals rather than vice versa. 
Nuanced campaigns — a focus on user experience enables teams to leverage customer behaviors and preferences. This enables businesses to create campaigns that are more cost effective and successful, even with smaller audiences. 
Consistent growth — feedback loops help teams identify effective strategies and eliminate ineffective ones. This promotes growth and predictable marketing results.

4 reasons your startup needs agile marketing
In my experience, overhauling your marketing strategy may seem like a task best to leave for later, but implementing agile early on is often easier in the long run. Agile workflows require a mindset and cooperation that can be difficult to create once teams have established workflows. 
As a startup, you can optimize your marketing with this strategy more easily due to the following advantages — so use them to encourage early adoption.

1. Opportunities for consistent practices and processes
Startups tend to have fluid responsibilities and lots of cross-functionality in their team members which naturally encourages collaboration. Agile can operationalize this collaboration, enabling teams to develop structures for support and joint responsibility. 
Since teams were never siloed in the first place, agile supports staff in naturally sharing ideas and workflows. This structure can then help ensure that timelines are met and processes are refined without interrupting productivity as a startup grows. 
2. Faster knowledge sharing creates shared understanding
Due to the overlapping responsibility and collaboration that comes with agile teams, it is easier for team members to share knowledge and skills sets. 
This can help reduce back and forth cycles of creation and approval and ensure that members better understand each other’s perspectives and capabilities. 
3. Incorporating agile marketing values in leadership early
Since startups do not come with an extensive history of “how things are done” leaders may be less likely to oppose agile strategies. Likewise, early startup hires who begin with agile workflows are more likely to carry that understanding and mindset into leadership roles in the future. 
This early indoctrination of agile enables startups to create a business culture that supports and promotes agile. When implemented well, this can grant teams greater flexibility to do what they know and can drive marketing innovation for the company. 
4. Agile project management tools from the start
Another way the freedom of startups feeds into agile benefits is in tooling. New companies do not have the technical debt or contract limitations that older companies do.
This means they can more easily adopt tooling that supports agile workflows. This reduces the overall IT burden since you can avoid costly integrations or retraining. 
Try to incorporate agile marketing into your startup’s strategy as early as possible.
Agile marketing: 4 tips to do it right
When implementing agile marketing strategies, I’ve found the following tips can help reduce workflow conflicts, encourage collaboration, and ensure continual improvement. 
1. Select team members wisely
When creating your team, you should focus on gathering cross-functional members with diverse and relevant skills. Typical roles and skills to gather include graphic designers, content writers, database specialists, marketing automation specialists, and demand generation specialists. 
When selecting your members, prioritize those who bring the skills you need (or don’t have) and can collaborate well. 
2. Ensure visibility
For agile marketing teams to collaborate successfully, you should maintain visibility of several aspects, including:

Project goals and progress — including the goals of the current sprint, the overall project goals, which tasks are in which sprint, and the timeline for completion. To accomplish this, teams often adopt tools such as kanban boards that enable the creation, assignment, and tracking of tasks. These tools may also include dashboards for metrics or timelines.
Customer base — including who target customers are, their preferences, and how effective various strategies are with that audience. Teams can ensure this information is visible through customer relationship management (CRM) systems, visualizations of demographics, website heatmaps, and results from customer surveys.
Available media assets — including assets from previous campaigns, branding assets, and information about where assets are currently in use. Visibility of media assets is often managed with digital asset management systems (DAMs), which enable teams to create detailed libraries of assets and asset use.

3. Meet frequently
Teams should be in frequent contact with each other to help hold each other accountable, brainstorm solutions to issues that arise, and update each other on progress. 
Meetings don’t have to be long (or in person) but should be orderly, with points to be addressed, and routinely scheduled. Often, teams meet once a day to check in but can meet more frequently as long as meetings don’t interfere with productivity. 
4. Learn from your mistakes
One of the greatest benefits of agile is that it’s iterative but only if you learn from your mistakes. With each sprint you have an opportunity to evaluate your workflows, goals, and progress. If anything isn’t working as well as expected, you should identify improvements before moving on to the next sprint. 
As long as you evaluate progress and implement improvements, you can minimize your risks and maximize the revenue generated by your campaigns. However, if you ignore issues or don’t objectively evaluate strategies, you will have a hard time benefiting from agile. 
Conclusion
Agile marketing strategies break projects down into short and actionable sprints, which are much easier to implement, track, and measure. Setting up clear goals enables you to achieve them faster and with ease. 
A clear workflow can help you to set up nuanced campaigns, which are typically cost-effective and highly successful. You can also leverage agile marketing to create a feedback loop that ensures your team works effectively and collaborates well with all involved parties.

"3 tips on how you, a founder, can become more adaptable",David Kolodny,2021/03/18,"
In entrepreneurship, nothing goes as expected. No amount of research and preparation can ensure that a business goes according to plan. This has never been truer than during the past year, as startups battle the impact of COVID-19 in addition to the ordinary challenges of launching a company.
At Wilbur Labs, my team and I recently surveyed 150 founders on why startups fail and found that 70% faced business failure at some point. Among those who attempted to pivot, 75% succeeded. Bob Dylan got it right when he sang about times of change: “you better start swimmin’ or you’ll sink like a stone.” Founders who are willing to adapt their plans have better odds of preventing business failure.
That’s why I believe that adaptability is the most important quality in a founder. It’s also a skill that anyone can develop and exercise. I’ve seen first-hand how three specific tactics can help any founder adapt effectively.
1. Reframe challenges as opportunities
Companies and their leaders are defined by how they respond to crises. When founders look back on their experience, the “war times” will stand out, not the days when everything went according to plan. 
For me, that helps put it all into perspective. Every challenge is a chance to define the company’s trajectory and often brings unforeseen opportunities — even in a pandemic.
A pandemic might seem like a hard time to start a company, unless we flip the script. Arguably, there have never been more problems that companies can help solve.
My team and I are working on more new companies than ever before and putting them through what we call the “COVID lens.” We map consumer behaviors years out, not just in the short term, and look for the opportunities created by new, growing challenges.
Spaces we looked at before the pandemic, like Medicare insurance, real estate, and education, each have new, unique challenges that are becoming larger opportunities as a result of COVID-19. Adaptable founders are more likely to look past the fog and spot opportunities like these.
2. Focus on what you can control
When plans break down, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by the decision of what to do next. While certain items fall beyond a founder’s control, there are always key areas they can control, including how to prioritize and triage the next steps. 
For that reason, there is nothing more tactically important than narrowing the focus to the most potentially impactful items and strategies.
When COVID-19 arrived last spring, my team went into protection mode of our people and portfolio. On the people side, we could ensure that our teams were as comfortable and productive as possible while working remotely. We gave everyone a $1,000 workstation stipend, and IT worked with them to plan and order the equipment they needed.
On the portfolio side, every company shifted attention to direct impact from COVID-19 or critical growth opportunities. We cleared out calendars and scheduled daily meetings with company leaders. We also threw out all annual OKRs and roadmaps. 
Existing KPIs and year-over-year metrics were no longer relevant, so we built new dashboards to track metrics that we could react to and control more effectively.
For example, the travel industry saw a 50% drop in international trips in January 2020 as COVID-19 spread in Asia and Europe. The US was clearly next. For our portfolio company VacationRenter, a vacation rental metasearch engine, the team began tracking cancelations and booking nuances such as “time to check-in” — the time between booking a trip and checking in for it — to better gauge customer behavior and anticipate cancellation or refund trends. 
By monitoring this new data, the team was able to quickly adjust product and marketing strategies, including rolling out flexible cancelation filters and expanding socially-distant travel options like RVs, all of which led to them driving over $1 billion in 2020 gross bookings.
3. Zoom out
In a few years from now, how likely is it that founders will be focused on the same issues they face today?
Sometimes, founders confronting significant challenges get trapped in short-term catastrophizing. Their problems feel eternal and unsolvable rather than temporary and manageable. 
By taking a broader perspective, we can give ourselves the openness and confidence to adapt. We can gain enough perspective to change one thing at a time rather than change 100 things at once, chased by anxiety and uncertainty.
When I speak to potential founders, one question I always like to ask is if they are committed to working on the company for 5+ years. In truth, that’s not much time, and most great companies take much longer to build. 
When you have a long-term vision instead of a six-month plan, rough situations feel less threatening and more navigable; the pandemic — and whatever disruption arrives next — looks like a bump in the road instead of a collapsed bridge.
My co-founder Phil and I talk about a 50-year vision for Wilbur Labs. By thinking and planning for the long-term, it’s infinitely easier to reframe challenges as opportunities and focus on what you can control. You can make steady progress without reacting disproportionately to the inevitable bumps along the way.
The only guarantee is needing to adapt
Challenges will continue to confront every founder, and adaptability will separate lasting companies from the pack. Founders who frame opportunities as challenges, focus on what they can control, and zoom out will have an edge. 
Whatever challenge your startup faces, adaptability will improve the odds of survival.

"To raise funds, or not to raise funds? That is the question",Vadim Rogovskiy,2021/03/17,"
Stats from Crunchbase show that more than 1,900 seed and series A investment rounds happened in June–August 2020, despite it being the peak of the coronavirus. Even a pandemic couldn’t discourage entrepreneurs from seeking capital to fund their dreams.
I think it’d be fair to say that investors have been more cautious than usual as markets have softened globally as a result of COVID-19. Entrepreneurs should be able to seek the money they need to ensure the success of their business. However, many of them have trouble deciding whether it’d be a good idea in the first place…
Dealing with VCs can sometimes feel like you are embarking on a treacherous journey because you may be at a disadvantage when it comes to negotiating a good deal. However, seasoned serial entrepreneurs will tell you that it is possible to get capital as and when you need it, without sacrificing your future options. You should know precisely what you are in for before you step into the fundraising process. 
Having run several companies, worked as an investor, and raised funds from prominent investors, such as Boost VC and Natalia Vodianova, I’m often asked whether it’s a good idea for budding entrepreneurs to look into VC funding.
As someone who understands the ins and outs of venture capital, I can tell you that each company has its own set of circumstances. So, if you are asking whether your business should or shouldn’t raise capital, I won’t be able to give you a yes or no answer. Instead, I recommend the following simple and practical framework to figure out what’s right for you.  
Your appetite for risk
Are you a low-risk/low-reward entrepreneur who wants to grow one company for 20 years? Or do you consider yourself a high risk/high reward entrepreneur who prefers to develop 4 different companies for 5 years on average in a fast-growth mode?
If you chose the first option, the answer is simple — you probably won’t need venture capital investments. You already have enough time and patience to take the company to your target profit/valuation with available resources. Who knows, you may just be able to make it right around time for your retirement!
But if you choose the second option, how long can you keep your focus on one company before switching your attention to other projects? According to my observations, it usually takes 3-7 years for entrepreneurs to move from one company to the next. If that’s your case, you’ll need funding to propel your business to success.
Your financial targets
Are you aiming to have full financial freedom as quickly as possible, or do you want to focus on short-term investments and gradually make your way up? 
If you want to be financially independent within 5-10 years, you will most likely need venture capital investment. But if you are willing to wait 20 years or more — then keep at it because you can do it without the help of VC. But you should make yourself comfortable because it is going to be a long wait!
It’s interesting to note here that there were 273 mega-rounds, i.e., fundraising of $100 million and more for tech businesses last year. So why not stake your claim in these mega-rounds that are creating more startup unicorns with bigger valuations than ever before? That could’ve been you!
Your market growth rate 
It’s essential to know your market’s YoY (year over year) growth rate. These numbers will come in handy when assessing the company’s performance and estimate the future growth prospects, ultimately helping you to make investment decisions. 
At the same time, you must also figure out how quickly this YoY can be commoditized and if there is a risk of competitors taking a share of your growth. Also, how fast are the multipliers growing, if the EBITDA is growing or declining and how external factors like a pandemic might affect it.
It is essential to know the answers to all of these questions to understand the opportunities available to you. This way, you’ll know when and how much capital you need to raise to make the most of your situation.
Profitability or breaking even
Don’t worry about either of these things just yet. The fact of the matter is that profits can be the enemy of success for a startup. This mentality can cause startups to lose the growth rate momentum and market share. 
Founders often think that getting to the break-even point validates their business model. The reality is that they made thousands of times less than what they could have if they had made it to a liquidity event (exit/IPO) without the focus on profitability.
Aiming for profitability makes you complacent and less willing to take a risk. In fact, I firmly believe that you should reconsider working with investors who put too much emphasis on breaking even.
Why does this happen? Let’s start with the basics. A startup is a team of like-minded people who are after maximum capitalization (CAPITALIZATION, not profit). Consequently, any delay in this path jeopardizes the existence of the startup as a whole. 
Only an inexperienced investor will bug you with the question, “So, when is break-even?”
Of course, the focus on capitalization growth, by all means, implies healthy unit economics, which means that the company will be able to make a profit when it becomes the leader of its market, with ARR from $100 million.
It’s very rare, but there are exceptions to this rule. For example, when a SaaS grows at the specified rate, increases capitalization, and also manages to get a positive EBITDA, all at the same time. But I have hardly seen this happen. 
In conclusion
Venture capital can wait, as made evident by the fact that in 2019, the median age of companies raising funds was 2.9 years. 
Raising funds isn’t easy, but examining and analyzing the above points can help entrepreneurs make sound financial decisions on when to approach investors and how much to ask for. Also, look into alternate ways of raising money, such as debt financing or crowdfunding. 
Finally, encourage your team to set goals that can help minimize risk and evaluate reward potentials. And use this guide for the practical insights it offers about ways to improve your business and financial standing.

My website blunder cost me $1 million — here’s how your startup can avoid it,Sagi Gidali,2021/03/16,"
After months of hard work spearheading a total transformation of my company’s website, and what I hoped would also be a transformation in conversions and sales, it was February 2017 when I sat down in front of my laptop and realized that somewhere, we had made a huge mistake.
The previous company I co-founded with Amit Bareket, SaferVPN, had recently brought together the whole team and invested a significant amount to create our new website. This was intentionally on the heels of App Store approval, but more specifically Apple’s approval of our company’s more unique security features.
In the end, the fact that our product was superior wouldn’t matter much. A transformation in sales did come to pass, just as I hoped for, but not in the way I imagined… 
The steep opportunity cost of $1 million in lost sales and ignored leads were the result of our efforts, and it was also a slow and painful lesson on preparation and organization that we quickly and repeatedly implemented since then. 
While we stumbled initially, after we got back on our feet we were justified with a rise in organic traffic that wouldn’t have been possible before. But for a few fleeting moments, as I stared at that laptop screen nearly four years ago and struggled to understand why progress had slowed to a trickle, it seemed like our hastiness and ambition might have cost us everything. 
The $1 million mistake could have been more expensive, but it also could have been avoided. Here’s how to see it coming, when it comes for you. 
Ramping up for success
After three years of building it, SaferVPN was well-positioned for success by the fall of 2016. When the product – specially designed to protect users against online identity theft and public internet exposure started flying off App Store shelves – we knew we were on the right track for explosive growth. But in order to meet the demand we were generating, a new website was the highest priority. 
The entire strategy of this project revolved around targeting new keywords on Google that were important to our company’s advancement. We hired new employees. We uploaded new resources. And we also made changes to the website’s stack, which was created by pure code. 
At the same time, we were designing and writing 120 new pages for the website, forcing us to delegate extra time for maintenance, development, and updating. 
The race for new customers was moving at a breakneck pace, and we were confident we could convert interested audiences with a fresh new site that was built from the ground up. 
Within a single day, our team replaced all 120 webpages and our shiny site was live and ready to convert. The CTAs were convincing, the funnels were airtight, and the product was ready to deliver. 
We avoided the messy, prolonged transitions that founders hate, and seemed on the path to success. I couldn’t have ever anticipated the situation I’d be in just a couple of months later.
A quick reckoning
There was nothing wrong with the site initially, and everything seemed to be chugging along well, but clues started to pile up. Our conversions were growing more slowly than expected, and problems with the pricing page keyed us into the idea that some potential customers might be flying under our radar. 
Once Amit and I had a chance to assess our position and do a preliminary audit, it became clear the launch of the new site wasn’t orchestrated to the level required, with problems like missing elements in the pricing page, and bugs with certain browsers going untested, resulting in a loss of conversions and revenue. 
Our biggest mistake, simply, was that we didn’t catch that the purchase process wasn’t quality assured from every angle at stage one. 
The technical issue was that the site was not working on all operating systems and browsers equally, and because we had neglected simple checks, only 20% of traffic was getting through the funnel as intended. 
Another miscue we discovered related to our infrastructure. When we were launching SaferVPN we wanted to do it quickly, and a PHP stack was the fastest way with a legacy system. 
We didn’t want to put the website on a CMS or other advanced technology because we would have to surrender some control, which we weren’t ready to do at the time. Now that we look back, that urge to exert total control over the entire spectrum of corporate resources was a huge mistake. 
Even though we pursued proprietary and in-house solutions several years later with great success, in these early stages we were essentially building on an untested foundation that couldn’t support agility, efficiency, or easy maintenance. 
Before the new site launched, we were averaging 80-100 new customers per day. That proved unsustainable after our poor launch, and the recovery and eclipse of our initial conversion benchmarks took longer than we thought we’d be able to remain in business.
 A brutal eight long months of fixing pages, processes, and confidence in order to realize the more than 400% organic growth we can now claim.
A not quite obituary
To regain that traction and climb out from the crater we had created after our massive site hit Google like some digital asteroid, we had to make an extreme effort to implement processes that should have been there months ago, like proper QA, deliberate and careful installation of new website pages, and the implementation of a CMS. And all of this had to be done alongside everything else we had to deal with on normal business days. 
Thankfully, we can say that we survived this period where our sales funnel was literally decimated, repaid our tech debt, and climbed out stronger than ever.
This year we launched our very own internal CMS, which has allowed my current company, Perimeter 81, to accelerate the delivery of pages, reduce the load on the dev team, and give the marketing team impressive new capabilities for directly driving success. 
We also hired a QA team and we don’t launch any pages without the proper QA review. This has allowed us to pivot around our original mistake and has resulted in larger projects succeeding at scale.
By their nature, startups are able to move fast. That, however, doesn’t mean they always should. It can be tempting to move quickly in the race for revenue. We learned that when you want to build something great, you must start with a great blueprint — a blueprint that you continually examine and adjust as it comes to life. 
The lesson learned for founders is something that seems obvious on the surface but can be difficult to avoid in practice. Do things gradually, build from an organized place, and know that every interaction and intention present across your product has the ability to make or break the customer experience, from website to platform, payments to UTMs. 
Advice to be first to the App Store or to beta test your product “live” in the marketplace is true to some extent, but clichés lack practicality, and we learned this the hard way.

When should you kill a product? 4 lessons from GitLab’s subscription change,Tien Tzuo,2021/03/15,"
How do you know when it’s time to kill a product? It’s certainly not a decision to take lightly.
In 2011, Netflix tried to steer customers away from mailed DVDs and dropped a 60% price increase in the midst of a recession. That year, the company lost 800,000 customers, its stock price tanked almost 80%, and their management team got turned into a Saturday Night Live sketch. 

Let’s use Netflix’s move as an example of what not to do. But what should we do then?
A decade after the Netflix debacle comes an excellent example of smart product editing from GitLab, a hugely popular developer platform that is growing like crazy. 
GitLab fascinates me with their extreme transparency, even as they prepare to go public. But what they’re doing on the product side interests me even more — and should serve as a case study for the rest of us. 
Here’s what I think their secret boils down to: less is more.
Research from the Subscribed Institute in collaboration with McKinsey & Company backs this claim up: revenues of higher-growth companies are typically concentrated in a more highly curated set of products. 
Earlier this year, GitLab got rid of a paid starter offering, trimming its product catalog from four subscription tiers to three: Free, Premium, and Ultimate. 
Why? I suspected it was because too many of their subscribers were housed in the starter tier, causing a customer/product mismatch that was costing GitLab money. So I reached out to Xiaohe Li, principal pricing manager at GitLab and she was kind enough to get back to me. 
My suspicions were confirmed. Here’s what Xiaohe told me: 
The Starter/Bronze tier was originally designed for a single team and did not have enterprise readiness features or support. However, we had some larger customers on the tier who weren’t seeing the value that they really needed. One of our more sophisticated customers told me directly that everyone should get on Premium at minimum.
It was a smart move. Sure, the bronze plan only costs subscribers $4 a month, but that’s exactly the point. If you want to run a successful subscription business, you should be putting real resources and investments into all of your offerings, not just some of them. As the old saying goes: feed it or kill it. 
But how GitLab went about making the pricing change is where the masterclass starts. Here are four key lessons that I took away from their decision, and you should too:
1. Be generous in your transition offer to help bridge change
Not only can GitLab customers on the canceled plan choose to remain on the same tier until the end of their subscription period, but they can also renew at the current price for one additional year or upgrade at a significant discount. 
2. Avoid pushing upsells
GitLab actually encouraged users of the canceled plan to investigate their free plan! This is a much better way of converting paid customers because it asks users to actually re-evaluate how they use the product, rather than just making a blind pitch to pay more. 
3. Listen to your customers
As they explained in this excellent video, GitLab solicited lots of feedback (on a confidential basis) from customers and internal team members alike before the launch. GitLab then invited its customers to offer feedback in a special section of their community forum on launch day. 
4. Move towards pricing simplicity, not away from it
GitLab’s new pricing page is simple, intuitive, and does an excellent job of communicating value.
And all of this brings me back to my original argument: less is more.
"
Zoom is crazy successful — but did it forget its brand?,Nick Pringle,2021/03/12,"
“Buy Zoom.” That’s what a good friend of mine told me he’d instructed his investment broker to do last March. I was impressed and irked. 
Why had I lacked the foresight and why had he not tipped me off? 12 months later, his monetary investment is probably equal to the number of hours I’ve spent on the video conference platform. My ROI? A stronger contact lens prescription, his… well, best not think about it.
Zoom is the ultimate overnight success, a victor of circumstance. Imagine Facebook’s 2006-08 growth charts, then concertina them into a single week. Friday, March 20th, 2020: a handful of us had Zoom’d. Friday, March 27th: hands up who hadn’t? 
This accelerated awareness is the stuff of an entrepreneur’s dreams, and it’s hard to imagine it will happen again. The circumstances are chance. 
But with product ubiquity and a billion-dollar valuation around the corner, has Zoom really got anything to worry about? Yes, I would argue. And it comes down to brand.
To control, or not to control?

Here’s a thing, Zoom is now a verb. I’ll wager Miriam-Webster’s will rubber-stamp it in their annual update. Entering the dictionary is a kind of marketing erotica: brand managers breathily utter names like Hoover, Biro, or Google in conference rooms around the world. 
But entering the vernacular is dangerous, particularly if you don’t own the narrative that accompanies it. 
For Zoom, the phrasing is mostly pejorative; zoom fatigue, zoom hell, back-to-back Zooms. The platform is becoming the scapegoat for our dysfunctional home life; for boundaries being crossed and toilet breaks lost. 
Brand building is about controlling the narrative. Unfortunately, when a business explodes onto the scene without one, it can be hard to rewrite the one it’s handed. But why does it matter? 
Simply put, it makes Zoom vulnerable to a new, more empathetic alternative. Most established utility companies know how hard it is to retain consumers now adept at switching with just a few clicks.
Digital startups that undergo rapid growth often overlook brand narrative. I’d go as far as saying some roll their eyes at the importance of it — believing ‘if the product is good enough, it’ll market itself’. 
I’ll concede this might be true, up to a point. Disruptors also get disrupted, and without a solid brand narrative, it can get ugly — just ask Facebook or WeWork. 
If your product is your brand, there’s little defense when a storm rolls in. And as sure as nature, it will. It might be an economic downturn, regulation, a rogue exec, or just a better product. Whichever, you need to control your brand narrative and use it to retain people.
How do you create a powerful brand narrative? 
The first thing is to align on a mission, a reason for being: To democratize information (Google); A computer on every desk, every home (Microsoft); Connect the world’s professionals (Linkedin). 
But don’t stop there. Now load the mission with humanity and manifest it in the product, the company, and the marketing. This involves truly understanding people’s needs and wants. 
This is a human-centric approach and it’s the absolute foundation of a brand narrative. Your product will bring people in, but it’s the humanity of the company that will keep them there; particularly if you’re investing in the newest generation of consumers.
Defining the brand and the narrative can easily be deprioritized — but don’t let it happen!
 If there’s one thing the pandemic taught product owners and marketers, speed of response matters. I can tell you first hand that those businesses who knew their narrative, knew how to respond instantly. Consumers embraced them, flocked to them in some cases. Those who didn’t took months to respond, and it has hurt their business. 
Zoom will be worth billions by the time this article is published and many employees will pocket life-changing cheques. It’s a remarkable story, but it doesn’t end with the IPO. Brands have been known to outlive their original products, but products without brands get unstuck at some point. 
I mean… when did you last Skype?

Never only hire the smartest people,Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten,2021/03/11,"
Boris is the wise ol’ CEO of TNW who writes a weekly column on everything about being an entrepreneur in tech — from managing stress to embracing awkwardness. You can get his musings straight to your inbox by signing up for his newsletter!
It isn’t easy to guess how smart you really are. I certainly know people a lot cleverer than me — and I’m regularly dumbfounded by the simplest things. Yet, occasionally I’ll end up doing something ‘pretty smart.’
And this is totally fine.
The older I get, the more I understand (and experience) that intelligence isn’t everything — it’s just a tool. On its own, a tool can’t do much of anything. It isn’t until it’s wielded correctly and used in tandem with other specialized equipment that the real magic happens.
[Read: The one question every leader should ask themselves]
A high-quality camera in the hands of an amateur will probably not produce a better photo than a cheap one in the hand of an artist. Just like how intelligence in the hands of a person who doesn’t know how to use it in a creative way is pretty useless.
I think I’ve gotten a lot of mileage out of the limited amount of intelligence I possess by being stubborn and persistent — and then combining that with creativity and unrestricted thinking.
That’s my full toolset: some intelligence, combined with a lot of creativity and persistence.
There are people who are smarter than me (a lot, actually) but some are just too rigid in their thinking, too entitled to work hard, or not creative enough to come up with even one original thought. They’re damn smart, but that’s all.
Being extremely intelligent will not get you anywhere unless you have the social skills, intuition, and sense of timing to match.
So, how does this knowledge help us? You can use it to put your own talents to good use and discover skills in others. You can be a complementary tool in your team’s collective toolbox (sorry for calling you a tool).
Pure creativity without a sense of marketing and commerce isn’t going to get you very far. And the smartest person in your class isn’t the one most likely to succeed — but they might know the best way to implement your creative solution.
Companies should never ‘only hire the smartest people,’ because intelligence on its own can be pretty dumb.

An entrepreneur’s last attempt at regaining productivity: Ditching social media in 2021,Alexander Lewis,2021/03/8,"
Do I consume social media or is it slowly consuming me? This blurred line has garnered increased attention due to recent documentaries like The Social Dilemma, which popularized deeply unsettling questions about the impact of social media on our mental health, politics, even free will. 
Yet many of us have our reasons for staying in the game. I’m sure there are some prolific entrepreneurs and writers who have no problem managing their social media usage, but that’s not my experience. I find these platforms consistently distract from my most important work. It’s a huge cost that I just can’t ignore anymore. 
I’ve attempted on several occasions to rise above the addiction, placing heavy restrictions on my daily usage. Good intentions only got me so far. Somehow I’ve always been pulled back into social media’s gravity, using it the way it demands to be used (i.e. obsessively). 
That is, until a few weeks ago. I have finally decided that social media steals too much of my time and attention to warrant continued investment. For 2021, I’ve chosen a more clear-cut approach to handling social media: network-cutting. 
The opportunity cost of social media
On a sunny day in the late 2000s, Mom snapped my photo and uploaded it to her computer. There I was, a freshman, grinning and backlit in front of her blinds. Not candid or stylish — just a grainy placeholder photo to help me complete my Myspace profile. Months later, I adopted Facebook as well, and within a couple of years, I had signed up for Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn. 
Unlike most hobbies and habits I picked up in high school, this one stuck. The longer I was on social media, the more weekly time I invested in each platform. I recorded photos from backpacking trips, learned about important causes, shared my own articles and short stories, and networked to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars for my copywriting business — all thanks to social media. 
But the benefits did not come without their costs. 
The most obvious cost was my time. According to Statista, the average daily social media usage was 144 minutes in 2019. Assuming I’m fairly average — a safe assumption — that means I spent almost 900 hours browsing social media websites in one calendar year. Since high school, that adds up to several months of my life in accumulated scrolling, liking, posting, friend requesting, and meme sharing.

But on its own, sunk time doesn’t directly equate to a lack of value. What I gained for all that time on social media — and whether I could have gotten greater value for my time elsewhere — is harder to quantify. 
I think the most apt analogy I’ve heard is that social media is like cognitive junk food. These sites emphasize headlines and hot takes rather than depth and nuance. 
Like fast food, social media plays on my weaknesses by maintaining a close enough appearance to substance — so much so that sometimes I can ignore the difference. 
The problem is, I don’t want a mere passable substitute for tackling big ideas, understanding the news, and connecting with friends. Just give me the real thing. Give me depth, substance, and real connection.
And what about creators who only use social media to spread and publish ideas? Instant publishing offers many clear benefits — but it also offers a dangerous shortcut for anyone who desires to produce work that lasts.
Author and economist Tim Harford put the opportunity cost of his social media usage in exact numbers: “My Twitter habit is more of a problem. I have 145,000 followers, gently persuaded over 10 years and 40,000 tweets to follow me — that’s about 10 books’ worth, or 20 years of weekly columns. This alone was a reminder of just what an effort Twitter could be.” 
How I got here
I’ve never taken more than a single month off social media since my freshman year of high school. And even those few breaks wouldn’t have happened without first discovering the work of Cal Newport, author and professor of computer science at Georgetown. 
Newport writes at the intersection of professional development and technology. From late 2018 through 2019, I read three of his books in rapid succession, with one idea rising above the rest: deep work. Here’s a definition from his website:
The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to concentrate without distraction on a demanding task (what I call ‘deep work’) is becoming more rare at the same time that it’s becoming more valuable in the knowledge sector. As a result, those individuals and organizations who put in the hard work to cultivate this skill will thrive.
Newport’s Deep Work Hypothesis caused me to reconsider how I organize my day, what I value in work and leisure, and my relationship to social media.
As a copywriter, deep work is how I make my living. Unbroken, focused attention is what pays the bills and moves my business forward. The more time I dedicate to the craft and business of writing, the better I become and the more work I produce. When something gets in the way of writing, it interferes directly with my earning and career potential. 
And nothing pulls me away from writing faster than Twitter, Facebook, or even LinkedIn. What began as an innocent high school hobby now steals so much of my time and attention. I knowingly bleed productivity every week.

The alternative
Maintaining a social media presence — especially for writers and entrepreneurs — often feels non-negotiable. The choice isn’t whether you use social media, but how. 
In the opening page of Invested, Charles Schwab writes, “The world of business, like the rest of life, is full of wonderful temptations, and making a choice about where you are going to devote your energy is often as much about dismissing things as it is about choosing something. A singular sense of purpose gives you focus and clarity.” 
Cutting social networks from my life for the next year is my attempt to achieve a new level of focus — perhaps one that becomes an advantage. What will a return to focus mean for me this year? Maybe I’ll publish more articles in more reputable magazines than any year before — or earn a book contract. Maybe I’ll finish work early every day and have more time to read, exercise, or call up a friend. 
Think about when was the last time you texted someone, “How are you?” Without the crutch of feeling like I know friends from updates from social media, I’ll have to be more proactive. I’ll have to ask. For now, I have many aspirations and I’m optimistic about what a year without social media could mean personally and professionally. 
Of course, there’s a possibility that things go counter to my plan. Maybe a year without social media will change the way I see it. Maybe the benefits will become clearer to me and I’ll re-log on to each platform with enthusiasm at the start of 2022. 
If I’m honest, I doubt that’ll be the case. I believe the internet is a better place to learn, write, and grow a business when I’m not competing for trivial achievements like a fresh new badge about a single retweet or like. 
I have a hunch that I’ll never choose to go back to social media. Or maybe it’s a prayer. Either way, I’m out.

How to generate buzz in a buzzless industry,Andrea Hak,2021/03/5,"
One of the toughest challenges young startups face is getting the buzz they need to generate media attention, user interest, and VC backing. Even if you know your solution is set to change the world in some way, trying to generate a buzz can sometimes feel like shouting in the middle of Times Square during rush hour. 
Now, what if your solution is so niche, that only a small portion of the population will ever use it? Add to that solutions that are so heavy in scientific research that only someone with a PhD understands how they work.
Sound familiar? Not to worry. 
We scoured X-Europe’s startup accelerator program to find the best examples of startups that, despite the challenge of having an extremely niche solution, are finding ways to get the attention they need.
In the end, we spoke with one poultry sex reassignment startup, one data analysis company specialized in crop science and metagenomics, and one smart beehive maker. It can’t get any more niche than that. 
Here’s what they had to say:
Focus on the wider impact your industry has on society 

No matter what industry you’re working in, there will always be something that makes it interesting for a wider audience. Your best bet is to look at the big picture. How do developments within your industry impact people in their daily lives? How do they impact the causes or issues they care about?
With a very specific customer base (farmers, governments, and others working in the agricultural sector), AgriTech hasn’t always been the sexiest industry. The potentially low public interest and readership levels meant that, in the past, journalists weren’t necessarily clamoring to cover new industry developments. 
Computomics, a data analysis company that offers custom services for next-gen sequencing projects from crop science to metagenomics, knows this all too well. 
But as Managing Director, Dr. Sebastian J. Schultheiss, told Growth Quarters, growing public consciousness about the effects of climate change, food security, and the conversation around sustainability have completely changed this perception.
By 2050, our planet will be home to more than ten billion people, resulting in an estimated 50% increase in the amount of food, feed, and biofuel required. Farmers around the world were producing 30 million tons less grain than required to feed everyone in 2019. As the world population grows, the demand for agriculture is increasing. This puts pressure on farmers, growers, agricultural companies, and food producers to supply more, and to supply faster. The pressure is aggravated by the global effects of a changing climate on food production worldwide. 
At the same time, the technological advances are huge! A farmer 10 years ago worked in a completely different way than they do today. Today’s agriculture uses numerous sophisticated technologies such as robots, sensors for temperatures and soils, aerial images from drones and satellites, and GPS technology. Using these advanced devices, in combination with machine learning technologies, allows farmers to be more profitable, efficient, safer, and more environmentally friendly. Having all these challenges in mind, you just have to get excited about innovation in this sector!
Simplify complex solutions by focusing on added value

Now imagine that you’re not only operating in a niche sector but also have a niche solution within that sector. 
For Yael Alter, CEO of egg sex determination startup Soos, this was a big challenge. 
“There are difficulties in growing while associated with the AgriTech sector. Solutions are complex and heavily dependent on science which requires intense research and the industry demands a 100% complete product before going to market,” Alter explains. 
“In addition, these solutions are usually restricted with heavy regulation and require mass amounts of capital to fund. The biggest difficulty is being in the livestock sector, as the number of investors interested in animal husbandry is substantially lower.”
Soos’ groundbreaking technology makes it possible to determine and change the sex of eggs before they hatch. But why should anybody not working in the poultry industry care about such a niche and technically complex solution? 
Alter laid it out in a way that’s straightforward, easy to understand, and easy to remember. 
“We manage to get people excited about our product via the noticeable benefits our solution provides. Here is an example of a term we coined, ‘The 4 P‘s’, showing our added value:”

Poultry – Our solution has an obvious animal welfare benefit which is saving male chicks from culling. Every year, 7.5 billion male chicks are killed just after hatching.
Planet – Today, the industry expends many resources such as electricity, water, feed, etc., that are wasted due to the production of male chicks. With our technology, these resources won’t be used in vain due to the production of more female chicks.
People – With a growing population and nutritional security a rising issue, our solution will be able to increase egg supply, thus providing a valuable source of protein, especially in developing countries. The human population is estimated to reach 10 billion by 2050 and it is our duty to plan ahead for sustainable production and nutritional security for the next generation.
Profit – The egg market is currently marked at $220 billion. The male-chick culling practice is the industry’s largest pain point as they have a 50% capacity loss and additional expenses that are associated with the culling and regulation. Our solution can provide an estimated $1.5-$2 of added value for every male that is altered to a functional female. This means that our solution can add up to $15 billion of value.

Consider how your product advances a particular tech sector
Of course, not every solution will have such a clear and direct social impact. Instead, consider how your product fits within the current tech trends. As Schultheiss explained:
The attention around everything AI has helped us get conversations started. For example, we are currently investigating the use of Earth Observation data to include in our technology. There is so much diverse data available in AgriTech and many people don’t know how to use it in a successful and meaningful way. 
We developed our technology so it integrates diverse datasets, extracts the most useful and discerning features, and fully leverages the information available in these datasets in a meaningful way, to deliver actionable insights.
Alter agreed:
Our startup is at the junction between AgriTech, FoodTech, and Biotechnology. This certainly has allowed us some flexibility on how we frame our solution for specific audiences. Our technology also has many aspects that allow for the use of buzzwords when needed such as IoT, AI/ML, Big Data, SW, HW, etc. 
Each startup should consider how they can use their product to their strengths. Some investors might be able to overlook the non-buzz aspects if you can create buzz through your technology, market, team, etc.
Choose the right outlets
Consider what your goals are. While making it into a top-tier publication may seem glamorous, if your goal is lead generation, reaching a global audience may not be worth the effort. 
“We’ve found that staying true to your niche is very important,” Alter tells Growth Quarters. “You would be surprised by how specific some niche outlets can be. The specificity doesn’t stop just at agriculture or even livestock, but we have various poultry/chicken media outlets and conferences/events. This allows us to reach our consumers without having to go after very general events/outlets.”
“With that being said, we still believe that you need to spread your efforts to reach a more general audience. While looking for poultry farms to adopt your solution, a niche poultry magazine would probably be your best bet, but not so much if you’re looking for investment for example. Our PR and Business Development team try to find the right balance of effort allocation between niche and non-niche outlets,” says Alter.

Soos itself has been able to get coverage in both Poultry World and The Guardian. Alter shared that the key is knowing what types of stories to pitch to different publications. While the readers of Poultry World may want the nitty-gritty details behind their solution, a wider audience will be more interested in the impact it has:
Each startup should map out their focuses and see what works for them. When spreading out to more general audiences, our efforts are accompanied by finding and emphasizing the appealing aspects of our solution, such as the animal welfare issue and the ‘did you know.’ That way we can attract interest from people who aren’t aware of how the industry or science works.
Focus on your community

But is spending time in gaining media attention really worth the effort for niche startups? 
Ru Wikmann, CEO of BeeSage, isn’t so sure. When he met his co-founder, Girts Kagis, (whose father is a beekeeper) and their advisor, Janis Kronbergs (an avid beekeeper himself), at an IoT hackathon, it was fate. Wikmann and Kagis soon created Beesage, a company that’s developed smart beehive scales to better monitor and maximize honey production, was born.
While Wikmann admitted that press can help with things like word of mouth, SEO, and positioning, he explained:
We’re not overly concerned about media attention at this stage. We rather leave the buzzing to bees. Our customers, beekeepers, don’t read tech media. We prefer to focus on them and make our name within the local communities while building our products and taking feedback from our users.
I’ve found the groundwork of building relationships within the beekeeping community and forming partnerships with synergistic companies to be a much more worthwhile effort.
 It’s important to keep our ambitious impact goals at the back of our minds but, at the end of the day, what will help us get there is building a better product that delights our customers. Hence, most marketing efforts should be completely focused on the niche, if only a tiny fraction of the population can be users of our products.
Get networking
While gaining media attention may not be a priority for every niche business, attracting investment is.

“Very few investors understand hardware and they often regard it as being riskier,” Wikmann explains. “What helped us get the initial funds for starting were some accelerators suited for our overlapping micro-niches, namely, EIT Climate-KIC and Buildit. X-Europe has been a great program too in many aspects.”
Both Computomics and Soos have also greatly benefited from joining accelerator programs and startup competitions. In fact, Soos’ first international pilot was mediated through an accelerator and, in 2020, they won a $1 million investment at the Grow-NY competition. 
Computomics has made the most out of the EU’s various funding opportunities by participating in grant proposals and partnering up with research bodies, universities, and other industry players to apply for joint grant applications. 
Another great way of creating visibility is by joining business networks. Computomics, for example, is a member of the University of Hohenheim’s CANNABIS-NET, CyberValley, and the International Seed Federation (ISF). 
The one golden rule for generating buzz
If after this list you’re still having trouble finding the right channels, not to worry. Sometimes the best strategy to generate external attention is simply taking a deeper look internally. As Wikmann explained:
Focus on building a product that solves important problems for your users and surround yourself with the best people for this journey. Everything else is secondary. 
If there is something interesting or unique about your startup, you will naturally attract attention without any need for buzzwords. Keep an open mind and constantly iterate on the feedback you’ve received. If you have a good thing, sooner or later others will want a piece of it.

The one question every leader should ask themselves,Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten,2021/03/4,"

I know a business coach who always starts his sessions by asking his clients a single question: ”Who would you be if you weren’t you?”
What he means is; if you didn’t have your current job and responsibilities, and if you wouldn’t have invested time and energy in your current career, who would you be and what would you do?
It’s an excellent question to ask yourself every now and then, but it can be extremely difficult to answer. It’s because you are the result of a very complicated puzzle, consisting of thousands and thousands of pieces, and you’re only half-assembled.
[Read: Stop listening to your #yesbut brain if you want to grow]
The same thing goes for companies and projects. There are a lot of things you do simply because you’ve been doing them for a while. You might stick with projects that you’ve started only to find yourself now stuck with them.
That’s why you should ask yourself — at least once a year — if you were starting today, would you still continue with this project? The answer could be a firm “yes,” and that’s great. But a hesitant “no” is also interesting because it will allow you to reassess your work.
It doesn’t stop there, though, because you can apply the same thinking to your partners and employees.
If the person you work with applied today, would you hire them? It can be a painful realization when your answer is less than an enthusiastic “yes,” but maybe that discomfort shouldn’t be avoided. In fact, I tell my managers to think about employees not as fixed assets but as living beings who change alongside your company and the world — because they are.
I think it’s healthy and respectful to have a conversation with someone you work with and establish how long you’re going to work together. Back in the day, people might’ve stayed at the same job for 40 years, but I expect most people to work for you for about 5 years. Some a little bit longer, some a lot shorter.
The great thing about setting these expectations from the beginning is that when they leave — instead of feeling betrayed and abandoned — you can thank them for their contribution and accept that they gave it all they had.
You can then also view the opportunities it provides clearly and ask yourself: now that I have the budget for a new employee, who can I hire that’ll be perfect for what I want to achieve now?
So when an employee decides to leave, you can both look back on a fruitful partnership, and you’ll both have something to celebrate. You can now hire the perfect person for your next goal, and the leaving employee can move on to their next challenge. Everybody wins.
Back to the original question and your homework for the week: who would you be if you weren’t you?

"‘Chief Awesome Officer’ is an actual job title — suck it, CEOs",Már Másson Maack,2021/03/4,"
There’s a ton of ridiculous job titles in the startup scene, but usually, they’re somewhat transparent. Surely a Chief Meeting Designer must do something related to meetings and a Senior Clubhouse Executive probably spends all their time yapping on Clubhouse.
So that’s why I was a little stumped when I came across Marian Johnson — a Chief Awesome Officer. Does she just go around… being awesome? Why would you pay someone for that? What the hell does a Chief Awesome Officer do?!
“Well, the first thing about being Chief Awesome Officer is that every time I introduce myself, there’s a round of laughter,” Johnson explains when I call her up to bombard her with questions about her title.
“This might actually be the strength of the title,” Johnson says. She tells me it helps get people’s attention and makes her and the organization more approachable by not taking themselves too seriously.
Despite the name, it’s not actually a ‘ministry’.
Marian Johnson heads the Ministry of Awesome — yup, that’s the name — a starting point for entrepreneurs, startups, and innovators in Christchurch, New Zealand. Basically, it’s an independent not-for-profit startup hub dedicated to growing the ecosystem in the country by providing entrepreneurs with the tools they need to grow their ideas.
“The title is also meant to show we’re zero BS… although I suppose Chief Awesome Officer could sound super BS-y, but I think we’re the opposite,” Johnson adds and laughs. “We’re basically making fun of ourselves with stupid titles.” 
This bullshit/non-bullshit method of breaking the ice with a ridiculous title is actually quite effective and has a surprisingly deep backstory.
Back from the ashes

On February 22, 2011, as the people of Christchurch were just finishing their lunch breaks, a 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck the city. Most of the city center was reduced to rubble in the intense quake, 185 people lost their lives, and thousands of people were made homeless.
Credit: Gabriel GohThe destruction following the 2011 earthquake in Christchurch.
“The inner city was completely flattened. Any building that didn’t fall down on that day was then taken down later. We lived in a donut outside the city center for a solid five years,” says Johnson.
In the aftermath of the earthquake, many were forced to move away from Christchurch and its population dropped considerably for a while. But the people of Christchurch were determined to rebuild their city and revitalize the community.
It was in this atmosphere that the Ministry of Awesome (MoA) was founded. The informalness of the name and its supercharged positivity was meant to jumpstart the startup ecosystem in a city reeling from a natural disaster.
Marian Johnson spreading awesomeness.
Although construction is still ongoing, Christchurch is bustling again. When Johnson took over the MoA in 2017, the organization pivoted from earthquake recovery to building a more robust startup ecosystem across the country. 
Currently, the MoA has 24 high-growth startups in its incubator program and numerous external innovation engines where Johnson and her team connect corporates with startups to solve the problems they face.
Ok, good to have an over-the-top job title after a crisis — how about now?
“I did think for a moment about changing the title,” Johnson admits. “When I saw the job title ‘Chief Awesome Officer’ it just made me think of all those stupid job titles at Google and I didn’t take it seriously at all “
Johnson could’ve played it safe (AKA boring) and changed it to CEO to appear more serious to the conservative organizations she’d have to work with, like banks and governments. But in the end, she decided to keep the title because of its rich history — and its effectiveness. 
She says the title lays a lot of the groundwork for her. Before she enters a room as a Chief Awesome Officer, people already know what to expect from her and what she’s about.
“The title and the name of the organization shows founders that whatever their moonshot idea or crazy dream, here’s one organization who’s ready to get behind you.”

Marian alongside awesome founders.






She doesn’t envy her peers who have to be content with generic and drab titles. And if for nothing else, at least Chief Awesome Officer isn’t a title you’ll forget anytime soon.





The secret to being a Chief Awesome Officer
We’ve established that despite sounding like startup nonsense at first, the title actually brings a lot of value to the organization’s bottom line. But what makes a good Chief Awesome Officer?
Johnson thinks it all comes down to being an incredibly positive and energetic person, mixed with commercial sense and evangelist skills. Oh, and “you have to say ‘awesome’ a lot,” she adds.







So have all three Chief Awesome Officers so far been like this?







“Yes, and weirdly, each of us… oh, I don’t know if this is good or bad, maybe I shouldn’t mention it? But we’ve all been American, which is strange,” Johnson says and laughs.

Why your SaaS success is all about ‘Net Dollar Retention’,Soraya Meirmans,2021/02/12,"
If you’ve ever taken a marketing 101 course, you’ve learned that keeping a customer is much more profitable than acquiring new customers. It’s an old piece of wisdom but still valid today. 
Unfortunately, many SaaS companies forget about it and concentrate their efforts on generating new leads. The costs of acquiring new customers get very high, really quick. And if you’re unable to bind your user to your product, it is completely useless. 
Most people judge the performance of a SaaS-company on its MRR while judging a company on its NDR might give much more valuable insight. 
Why? Well, it’s not uncommon that a company’s MRR increases while their NDR deteriorates. In other words, the company is bleeding money. 
One could argue that NDR is much more than a number; it quantifies how your clients value or love your product and how much of an impact you’re making on their lives… I’d say Customer lifetime value (LTV) is one of the most critical metrics for SaaS companies. 
With that in mind, upgrades or downgrades and churns must be considered while judging a company’s performance. 
What is Net Dollar Retention?
NDR is a metric expressed as a percentage. It illustrates the (change in the) amount of revenue from the current users a company can retain compared to another period with taking downgrades, upgrades, and churn into account.  
NDR, or Net Dollar Retention, is not as well known as MRR, but a very valuable (if not more valuable) metric. Especially for SaaS-entrepreneurs. Why is NDR so important? Well, first and foremost for me is the fact that it’s very much possible to grow your MRR while losing money. 
This scenario occurs when your marketing department is on fire. The acquisition of new users creates a revenue stream that exceeds the net reduction in revenue from your existing user base.  
Let’s say your company starts this month with €100,000 in MRR. It books €50,000 in new subscriptions, zero in expansion revenue, suffers €20,000 in downgrades, and €5,000 in churn.
In this example, your MRR rose by a whopping 50%. And yes, you should bring out the champagne for that. But, your NDR is only at 75%. You lost 25% of MRR from your current userbase. Also, what was your marketing budget? How much did you spend to acquire these new users? Money is leaking from your business…
To understand Net Dollar Retention, you must consider expansion (by marketing), downgrades (of packages), and most of all churn, and their effect on monthly recurring revenue (MRR).
Let’s dig a bit deeper into what this means before we address the essentials of NDR.
Increases in MRR
MRR can increase via two broad mechanisms:

Through newly onboarded customers
Through an increase in usage or upgrades within your existing customer base

Simply put, MRR increases when your existing customers start spending more on your product. By upgrading a standard subscription to a premium subscription, for example. Or when your marketing department does a bang-up job. 
An example of the first would be a user upgrading from a €10 basic subscription to a €50 premium subscription. In this case, the expansion revenue would be €40 or the net increase resulting from the upgrade.
€50-€10 = €40 increase in MRR
Decreases in MRR
Life can be hard, especially when you’re a SaaS-entrepreneur. Sometimes you lose clients, this decreases your MRR. This can happen in two ways: 

Through downgrades in usage within your existing customer base
Through churn, where customers cease to do business you

Downgrades are any decrease in revenue caused by downgrading in use, which is basically the opposite of our previous example. 
A downgrade would be a user moving from a €50 basic premium subscription to a €10 basic subscription. The downgrade in revenue, in this case, would be €40, which is the net decrease resulting from the downgrade. 
€10-€50 = (€40)
Churn
I’d define churn as a disaster. Or, more mildly put, as losing users. 
An example of churn is a user leaving the platform from a €50 subscription. The churn would be €50, the net loss resulting from the user leaving your platform. 
But with that out of the way, let’s get to the meat of this article.
Calculating Net Dollar Retention
NDR accounts for the changes in MRR caused by expansion, upgrades, downgrade, and churn within an existing customer base.
It is expressed as a percentage and calculated using the following equation.
(Starting MRR + expansion — downgrades — churn)/ Starting MRR *100 = NDR
For example, a company starts the month with €10,000 in recurring revenue. Over the month, it added €2,500 in expansion revenue, has €1,000 in downgrades and another €500 in churn.
(€10,000 + €2,500 — €1,000 — €500)/€10,000 *100 = 110% NDR
The company now has €11,000 in MRR and due to an NDR of 110%
Making use of NDR
A Net Dollar Retention below 100% means churn and downgrades were bigger than the growth you realized with your existing customers. You are losing users, or they’re spending less on your product. The role that your product plays in their life is not significant enough. They can do without you. Or, with less of you. Both are a little painful.  
It’s like being dumped. 
If this analogy seems a little far fetched, but I tend to disagree. People don’t leave something that they really love. Or, in this case, a product they really love. Maybe, just maybe, you’re not loveable enough, and it is time to invest in the relationship.
How to improve the NDR?
If your NDR is bad, don’t worry. I’ve worked with many SaaS companies along with my team and we’ve seen it’s more than possible to beat churn and turn your negative NDR into a positive one. 
Of course, there are plenty of ways to turn NDR around, but the one I have the most experience with is through human-centered design. A human connection built straight into your application will make your users fall in love and make sure they’ll stay with you as long as possible. 
Design helps you get your product from liked to loved. What does this mean? Well, your marketing efforts are more fruitful, your clients more positive, and VC’s are banging on your door. Making sure your users never leave you anymore, invest in the upgraded design of your SaaS product. 
So calculate your NDR and find the best way to get it to where you want it to be.

When we think about communicating more, most of us imagine it’s about talking more. But communication is really about exchanging information — that includes receiving it. You can’t listen when you’re talking, or as Larry King once put it: “I never learned anything while I was talking.”
Despite this, most conversations are composed of two people just waiting for their own turn to speak. Now before you start thinking I’m putting myself on a high horse… I’m definitely guilty of talking too much. Sometimes I come home from an amazing meeting, only to realize I was way too excited and eager to tell my stories that I didn’t let the other person speak
But this isn’t inherently a bad thing, it’s just that the real master of that meeting wasn’t me — it was the other person.
[Read: What I learned from skills I no longer need]
If you want to please someone, all you have to do is encourage them to tell their stories. If you walk out of a meeting having said nothing, and the other person did ALL the talking, they will feel great about meeting you and remember it as an amazing conversation.
The best part though is that YOU will actually have had an interesting conversation. Not speaking will force you to listen, and when you listen, you will learn.
But how do you strike up a meaningful conversation with someone you might not know that well? A father of a friend of mine used to be an airline CEO. Whenever he traveled, he’d always chat up the people he sat next to. He had this great line that’s been a favorite of mine ever since I heard it: “I already know all my own stories, so let’s talk about you.”
It’s a rare thing to meet people who are genuinely interested in you and are willing to really listen to what you have to say. Honestly, you might as well wish for a unicorn.
So for your next conversation, I challenge you to conduct a little experiment: be that magical creature. Find an excuse to not talk. Any at all!
Say you are tired of your own stories and want to hear theirs, or tell them your throat is sore from an intense evening of living room karaoke. Do everything in your power to encourage them to speak more, give their stories space, revel in what excites them, sit back and see what happens.
My bet is that you’ll learn something, and you’ll delight someone.

Here’s how to do PR when your product is a SECRET,Clara Herdeanu,2021/02/11,"
The inherent nature of working in public relations is communicating with the public… hence the term “public.” However, in a strange twist of events, we’re sometimes asked not to communicate (but to also communicate). That can be challenging, but it’s not without merit. This paradox comes into being when there are projects that must remain a secret until launch. 
The trick here is creating a public relations plan that maintains the necessary secrets while still creating enough brand awareness that when the secrets are no longer so, they are able to garner the appropriate level of attention. 
While there are companies that must hold initiatives a secret, the most common situation, and one I can detail from personal experience,  is when you are working for a startup that is launching a product in stealth. 
Prior to a public beta, there is plenty of PR to do, but it has to be done in a way that allows your company to complete the project without actually revealing the project to the public. We dealt with this when we recently transitioned our company from an enterprise solution to launching a consumer app. 
While on the surface it would seem that this would create a circumstance in which there would be little to do from a PR perspective, that would be a misnomer and an assumption that doesn’t benefit a single soul.
Constraints require creativity
Brand awareness is the main mission when the project needs to be kept secret until launch. Those handling PR may feel like their hands are tied. 
You can’t talk about the product at all. You can’t pitch it, you can’t write about it, and you can’t even allude to the solution it offers in casual conversation.
The focus then has to shift from the product to the company. The entirety of your PR at this stage is to lift your company up to a level of market respectability, without revealing exactly what it’s working on. Some of that will inevitably be derived just from the resumes of the founders, but no one will know for sure until the beta launch. 
The artful approach here is to rethink how to publicize your company. Instead of focusing on the product, focus on the founders. Focus on backgrounds and knowledge.
This may seem limiting, but your company is just as important as your product — perhaps more so. It’ll make it that much easier to pitch a product or service if your company and its founders are already recognized as experts in their fields. 
Mindful messages in thoughtful pieces
The strongest way to put your founders out there is through thought leadership articles. There is always something happening in the world that could use their expert opinions. It doesn’t always have to be directly related to the thing they are working on; in fact, it helps the secrecy of your project if it isn’t related. 
As the gatekeeper here, your job is to mind the messaging. That is, you must pour over every written word to be sure that the habit of talking about one’s own projects doesn’t slip into the text. 
From metaphors to direct cause correlations, the habit of permeating one’s own writing with one’s own work is a hard one to break. This is where both your creativity and ingenuity come into play. 
Thought leadership articles are nothing new in regards to PR outreach and building brand awareness. There is a general rule not to speak about your own company when writing about pieces. 
What is not usual is not just adhering to that rule, but speaking in a way that doesn’t reveal what you yourself are working on. That takes some massaging of the messaging, so that your founders are still regarded as industry experts, but aren’t giving away the farm. 
This is where we in PR stand, as editors of the secrets we must keep. There is always another way of saying something if the direct way doesn’t work. We just have to find the right words. 
For instance, instead of saying what you are working on as an example to a solution to a problem, move it to a higher level and suggest an alternative solution that still arrives at the same conclusion. Here, it’s about teaching the audience the issues facing a particular industry and offering advice on how to solve them in a way that would better the industry or even society as a whole. 
Speaking out and getting quoted
Since you don’t have a project to promote to the press, but you do have founders and a company to promote, then it’s time to land them some speaking gigs. 
There are plenty of industry events that offer speaking opportunities, even more now that the market has wholly moved to a virtual setting. Considering the virtual aspect, these are generally low-cost events that give your founders the chance to expand on their knowledge base and gain fans. 
Another way we in PR can get our founders and companies into the press — in a way that highlights their background and experience, rather than current projects — is through a more subtle sort of media outreach. 
Offering our subject matter experts to journalists looking for expert input enables them to be quoted in articles relevant to their area of expertise. This is a no-cost, simple way to build founder and brand awareness.
Being in PR doesn’t always mean we’re spending our days filling up journalists’ inboxes with pitches. Often, especially in internal PR, the daily missive is to make sure the messaging reflects the current state of operations. That sounds like some buzzword bingo phrase, but that’s the gist of it. Being able to separate the company from the projects it is working on goes a long way toward building brand awareness. 
That’s the hook. We often define companies by the products they launch, or by the services they provide. When your company is stacked with knowledgeable experts, brilliant engineers, or highly-educated founders, then you do a disservice to them if your focus is solely on the thing they make. Take the time to lean on their knowledge, and promote that knowledge as part of what makes your company great. Your brand will be better for it.

How to stop yourself from using the wrong emoji at work,Justin Pot,2021/02/10,"
My editor Deb loves to ruin things. One time she used her Ph.D. in Italian to ruin an entire emoji.

The emoji in question is a common Italian hand gesture that, roughly translated, means “what the hell?” This isn’t how our team was using it. At some point, we collectively decided to use this emoji to mean “perfection.”

From what I can gather, people thought it represented kissing your fingertips, the way chefs sometimes do.
Dozens of people used the emoji this way until Deb pointed out the (hilarious) discrepancy. And you know what? Some people still use this emoji to mean perfection. They will probably never stop.
This is a harmless example, but it does point to the inherent ambiguity of emoji — and communication in general. Symbols only have meaning because of a shared cultural context, which means you can’t assume everyone is interpreting emoji the same way. That can lead to some awkwardness — especially in a work context.
Maybe don’t wink at your coworkers
Consider the ?. Some people wouldn’t think twice about using this emoji in a work context; others cringe at the very thought. There’s a gulf in meaning here, just like with the Italian hand gesture.
To some, the wink emoji is a harmless way to clarify that a statement is intended as a joke, or at least intended to be friendly. And there’s a lot of precedents here. The winking emoticon — ;) — was used this way for decades on Usenet and IRC. It’s natural that internet veterans want to use ? the same way today.
[Read: How much does it cost to buy, own, and run an EV? It’s not as much as you think]
The problem: that’s not how everyone understands this emoji. According to numerous sources from around the internet, the wink emoji implies you’re being flirty and/or suggestive. Some people will reflexively interpret any and all ? usage in this manner, which is going to radically change the context of any statement you make using it. The best case is that you’ll come across as oblivious. Worst case… well, I don’t think I have to explain why this is problematic in a work context.
You might disagree with the second interpretation of ?, and that’s understandable. It’s also kind of my point: we’re all interpreting emoji differently, and that can lead to confusion. But it’s not everyone else’s job to figure out what you mean.
Take it from a writer: you can’t control how other people are going to interpret your message. You can only control what message you send in the first place. To quote the philosopher Jeff Probst: “Perception is reality.”
My advice: avoid using ? at work entirely. Maybe also avoid ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, and especially ?, while you’re at it.
Other potentially confusing emoji
The wink is far from the only confusing emoji. Here are a few other examples, off the top of my head:


? is a gesture that means “ok” in most English-speaking countries, but it means… not that in many other countries. So maybe keep that in mind. There are a bunch of emoji, like ?, that have this same problem.


? is officially named “punch,” but some people use it as a fist bump. I’m sure many people are wondering why their coworkers want to punch them in the face (I am not — I know the reason).


? might look like excited jazz hands, but it’s officially named “hugging face.” So maybe don’t send it to anyone you wouldn’t hug. In the face.


? is sometimes used to express that two people are in sync. But the emoji itself is, inexplicably, two women dressed as Playboy bunnies, which in some contexts is going to distract from the whole “twins” thing.


Some people use ? to mean a high five or a thank you; others use it to mean prayer.


? might just look like a bagel, but I recently learned that it’s offensive to New Yorkers.



I could go on. The point is that emoji, like any symbols, have different meanings in different contexts. Effective communication depends on understanding that—especially when you’re working remotely.
There are three sides to every statement
Communication, in theory, is simple: you say something, and the person you’re talking to understands it. But that’s not how it actually works. In reality, every time you communicate, you immediately create three distinct statements:


What you meant to say.


What you actually said.


What your audience thinks you said.


Communication is the art of aligning these three things as closely as you can. This is true when you’re writing a book, it’s true when you’re giving a speech, and it’s true when you’re DMing a coworker.
If this sounds complicated, that’s because it is. There’s a reason robots are so bad at convincingly talking like a human person — conversation is staggeringly complex. There is so much nuance to every word choice — and to every emoji choice. Most of the time, humans manage this without any problem, which is pretty amazing when you think about it.
But every once in a while, confusion creeps in, which is only natural. We’re all making this up as we go along, after all, and communication is also a skill that you have to practice. Part of doing that online means understanding what emoji mean in various contexts.
If you’re ever uncertain about something:


Ask your coworkers what they think emoji mean. The more context you have the better.


If something is confusing to you, point it out! You’re probably not the only one who is wondering.


There is no shame in Googling an emoji to learn more about its meaning in the broader culture.


Remember: we’re all making this up as we go along. There’s no shame in not knowing. Just try to keep learning.

You need to rethink your customer experience for 2021 — here’s how I did it,Andrei Petrik,2021/02/9,"
As the CEO of an SME business, 2020 wasn’t exactly smooth sailing. The pandemic left us feeling like we’d had the light switched off and were spun around until we were dizzy. It wasn’t easy, but it looks like we survived. We weren’t the only ones, and most of our peers obviously felt the same trauma. 
As a B2B business, everybody found themselves in the same boat rocking back and forth. This meant that the way we communicated with, sold to, and dealt with our customers changed. The year 2020 was one that changed B2B business forever. It required the adoption of new approaches and techniques to get by.
I want to share the same customer experience approaches and techniques that I’ll be taking into 2021 with my community.
The success of customers came first

In 2020, it became clear that customer retention had to take priority over customer acquisition. We realized that businesses would minimize their costs, meaning they might want to stop using our software. 
There’s no point in acquiring new customers slower than you’re losing them, so we consolidated and leveled up our Customer Success (CS) program and relied on that as we plunged into the unknown. 
It’s a strategy that involves being proactive to customer problems, instead of reactive. It’s all about getting to know your customers and their product so profoundly, that you can reliably give them the very best of your product for their exact niche and need. 
I could go on about CS strategies until the cows come home. But in the interest of your interest, I’ll break it down into some smaller points.
1. Onboard and activate customers on an individual basis
Before any one-to-one conversation with a new customer, our CS Team does their research. They find out which industry the customer is in, which problems our product should solve, and which processes and workflows they employ that our product can fit in. 
With this information, they can have an educated first meeting, skip the unnecessary questions, and get into the meat of what our product can do for them. 
2. A perpetual education and re-education of customers
CS revolves around shared education. After educating yourself, educate your customers… and never stop. Apart from the newsletter and in-product notifications alongside significant updates and releases, we run live webinars, walk through the features we have added or improved during the assessment calls.  
Furthermore, we continuously produce educational and pre-boarding content on our blog such as guides, ebooks, cheat sheets, and checklists.
3. Stay in touch
We’re proactive. We don’t wait for a customer to contact us with a problem, we set regularly scheduled calls to check in on them and their experience of our product. We’re always adding features and tweaking our system. If that’s relevant to a specific customer, we always let them know so they can get the most out of it.
Above all, a successful CS strategy requires complete internal cooperation of the business that is practicing it. It needs sales and marketing singing off the same hymn sheet, using the same data, and putting out the same message. We do not doubt that our Customer Success strategy was one of the main reasons we survived this year. 
Personalization needed to go further
Let’s bust the myth that calling somebody by their name in the subject line increases their engagement with an email. 
It might be valid to some extent, but in 2020 literally every brand that you could name is doing it. It’s no longer impressive. If anything, it’s the bare minimum. In 2021, we need to go further in our personalization efforts. This all starts with immediate lead enrichment upon a user’s registration with a brand.
Personalisation is easy. Put some effort into it.
In my opinion, the definition of personalization got lost when Mail Merge was invented. In business, personalization should mean giving your brand a personality; humanizing it. 
It means implementing a conversational customer experience and aggregating all communication channels so a customer feels a seamless, personalized brand experience, with no disconnect between the different arms of it. As the pandemic adds to even more uncertainty about buying power of leads, this only becomes more important.
1. Conversational Customer Experience (CCE)
A brand providing CCE is one that provides continuous support and guidance and support for customers on an individual basis. It opens up a two-way channel of communication between a brand and a customer, ensuring a smoother path to customer success. 
We provide timely, relevant, and helpful information on request, and our relationships with our customers consolidate and grow. 
2. Omni-channel, personalized communication
We try to meet our customers where they are, and I appreciate that this sounds somewhat vague at first. Simply put, our different buyers have different preferences. 
This means we can’t expect the same approach to work for everybody. Ideally, we should be able to provide different, preferred channels without losing any information; a seamless buying experience. In 2021, we plan to experiment with even more promotional, distribution, and purchase channels.
Continuity is the cornerstone of customer relationships, and our end goal should always be for a customer to become a brand advocate.
We all needed each other
One of our biggest successes of 2020 was our user community, which was set up as a direct response to the coronavirus pandemic. It was initially set up as a simple Facebook page, titled ‘Crisis-Proof Community’, but the success of it meant we coded a section into our product as a new home. Eventually, it just became a general user community, rather than being focussed on pandemic response.
Our community empowered us in so many different ways, giving us benefits that we never planned for.
It lifted the weight off our Customer Success Team’s shoulders, simply because they had to deal with fewer queries and calls for the more simple, more common questions they receive. 

It gave us more visibility on Facebook because we would pop up on the timeline of our users’ friends. Now the Facebook group redirects users to the native group.
We found a new source of product development leads, meaning we could hone our SaaS product. We could gauge how much a particular feature was wanted simply by the number of people who engage with the request for it. 
It added more personality to our brand because we could reply from our individual Facebook accounts on different user posts. It gave us another, specific channel upon which to share content.

The pandemic drove both brands and consumers into deeper relationships with technology. We’ve been able to take advantage of that by bringing our whole customer base; people who share the same values, interests, and challenges together under one URL. 
A little bit of humanity goes a long way

The last point I’ll make is a little bit more common sense. Above everything else in 2020, we understood just how nice it is to be nice. Our users, the exact ones that gave me this platform to share my advice, needed us. 
They required us to show compassion and empathy to their situation because not everybody was able to weather the storm to the same end. A chatbot is suitable for solving minor problems, directing a customer to the right department… but it’s no shoulder to cry on. 
Now, it’s more important than ever to close feedback loops promptly and satisfactorily to our customers. In 2020, our customers needed us more than ever, they needed our product — not only to drive them to success, but to help them keep their heads above water. 
Regardless of whether we were able to implement a request or not, we listened and considered each individual one. If the request was related to their subscription payment, we’d trust our front-line employees to offer the correct discount, payment holiday, or additional service.
In return, we were able to ask our customers for something in return.

A review on dedicated platforms like G2 or Capterra.
A recommendation for our product to partners and friends.
To host a partner webinar if you have an audience overlap.
A success story to share on our social media or a blog. 

Going forward in 2021, we will continue to be flexible for our customers in the hope that our customers can be flexible for us. A business can get bogged down in bad times at any time, not just during the pandemic. Sometimes it’s easy to get lost in the suit-and-tie of it all; to lose faces behind company logos.
Overall, we’re grateful that we were fortunate as a SaaS business. We’re blessed to be online, with the coronavirus’s impact kept to a minimum. We’re blessed to have been able to learn from it, rather than to be beaten by it. I’m blessed to be able to share the lessons I’ve learned from this year with my fellow business community. After all, as I said in the article… we need each other.
I hereby proclaim 2021 to be normal.

Here’s what all successful AI startups have in common,Ben Dickson,2021/02/8,"
With tech giants pouring billions of dollars into artificial intelligence projects, it’s hard to see how startups can find their place and create successful business models that leverage AI. However, while fiercely competitive, the AI space is also constantly causing fundamental shifts in many sectors. And this creates the perfect environment for fast-thinking and -moving startups to carve a niche for themselves before the big players move in.
Last week, technology analysis firm CB Insights published an update on the status of its list of top 100 AI startups of 2020 (in case you don’t know, CB Insight publishes a list of 100 most promising AI startups every year). Out of the hundred startups, four have made exits, with three going public and one being acquired by Facebook.
A closer look at these startups provides some good hints at what it takes to create a successful business that makes use of AI. And (un)surprisingly, artificial intelligence is a small part — albeit an important one — of a successful product management strategy. Here are some of the key takeaways from AI startups that have managed to reach a stable status.
Lemonade: AI complements a successful product strategy


Lemonade Inc. CEO Daniel Schrieber at TC Disrupt 2018

Lemonade, an insurtech startup founded in 2015, made its initial public offering in July with a $1.7 billion valuation. Lemonade is an online platform that aims to address some of the key problems of the traditional home insurance industry. The company has been able to develop its business through smart design and a good marketing strategy. The AI component was built on top of that.
The company’s website and mobile app are very easy to use. The process of buying insurance and filing claims with the app and website goes through digital assistants and is much faster than traditional insurance companies. As one of the first movers in the insurtech space, Lemonade had the edge over other similar companies that have cropped up in recent years, and it was able to quickly snatch a lot of users who were looking for a shift from traditional insurance model to one that was more tech-focused.
[Read: How much does it cost to buy, own, and run an EV? It’s not as much as you think]
Lemonade’s business model and messaging are also interesting. The company takes a flat fee from premiums, which means the company doesn’t make a profit from denying claims. The unclaimed money goes to charities of users’ choice. The company also says that it will not invest premiums into heavily polluting industries and companies that cause harm. So, basically, Lemonade is marketing itself as the good guy in a historically reviled industry, on a mission, per the company’s words, to “transform insurance from a necessary evil to a social good.”





Insurance depends a lot on data, and established agencies have more than a century of data they can use to develop risk models and create insurance policies. Lemonade didn’t have the data of traditional agencies, but it also didn’t have their baggage of customers and old policies. It was able to create its entire technology stack from the ground up to cater to the needs of an AI factory.
With the entire experience being digitized, the company can collect a lot more data from each customer interaction, including data points that other agencies do not capture. This enables the company to create machine learning models that not only predict insurance risk with growing accuracy over time but can also create automation and personalization opportunities that were impossible before. The company has two AI chatbots: Maya helps you create your insurance plan in a few minutes, and Jim handles the claims process. According to the company, AI handles a third of the cases and pays claims in a matter of minutes. The rest of the claims are transferred to human agents. The chatbot continues to improve as it gathers more data.
The company believes that with time, the AI will give it the edge over traditional agencies and allow it to provide much more affordable plans to customers. And its $480 million pre-IPO funding and its post-IPO growth show that investors believe its plan can work.





Lemonade’s head start is its biggest protection. Other startups that would want to copy its business model don’t have its data and can’t create equally efficient AI models. And it has also created a protective moat against traditional insurance agencies, which are much slower to move into new areas. By the time they do create their own AI factories, Lemonade will have carved a comfortable niche for itself.
Butterfly Network: Specialized hardware with AI enhancements


Butterfly Network iQ ultrasound probe

Butterfly Network will be listed on the New York Stock exchange after a $1.5 billion special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger with Longview Capital later this year.
The company’s product is Butterfly iQ, a medically approved single-probe, whole-body ultrasound device that connects to a smartphone and works with an accompanying mobile app. The device costs $2,000, which is much more affordable than the five- and six-digit-priced ultrasound sets usually found at hospitals. The company aims to make high-quality ultrasound imaging available to communities that can’t afford high-end devices and bring portable scanning to places where the bulky ultrasound sets can’t go.
iQ also uses artificial intelligence to create use cases that are not available on other ultrasound devices. For instance, one of the AI features of iQ is a slider in the app that shows the quality of the image to the user. As the user moves the probe on the patient’s body, the slider shifts to show whether the device is getting a good capture or not. The feature uses an artificial neural network that has been trained on tens of thousands of images to discriminate between good and bad images. For instance, frontline responders or clinics whose staff don’t have the expertise with ultrasound can use the device to get proper images and send them to experts for further analysis.





The device and app come bundled with a bunch of cloud storage and sharing features that facilitate the use of data in a broader health care context.
The company is also working to add new machine learning-powered features to help with measurement and analysis.
So here too, I think that AI is a small but important part of the overall business. The biggest value comes from the hardware. The small, portable ultrasound device allows Butterfly to differentiate itself from other manufacturers and create value for untapped segments of the market. AI is the added value that helps it improve the software stack that builds on top of the hardware. Given that the device uses consumer smartphones, it also has the potential to add new AI features and continually improve its product’s performance as mobile device hardware becomes better.
The one risk I see in Butterfly’s AI business is the possibility of similar moves from household names such as Philips and Siemens. Should health tech giants decide to enter the handheld ultrasound business, Butterfly Network will need to find something that can protect its products against copycats. One possible solution would be for Butterfly to work out a privacy-friendly plan to collect ultrasound data from iQ devices to improve the performance of its AI models. But it will not be very easy, given the sensitive nature of health data.
C3.ai: Enterprise AI can work if you have the reputation


C3.ai website

C3.ai, another one of the successful AI startups mentioned by CB Insights, is a provider of enterprise AI software. C3.ai’s pre-IPO valuation was $4 billion, but on the first day of trading, its market cap skyrocketed above $13 billion.
C3.ai software helps companies build AI models on top of their data for predictive maintenance, improved inventory management, fraud detection, energy management, and other operational enhancements that can reduce costs and increase productivity. C3.ai is not a provider of cloud services but its software is compatible with most top cloud providers such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and IBM Cloud.
Under normal circumstances, C3.ai’s product strategy would be considered risky. From a technical standpoint, it has no key differentiator. It is providing services that can easily be replicated by another company that has the right resources, including the very cloud services its software integrates with. And since its founding in 2009, the company has changed its name twice from C3 Energy to C3 IoT and then to C3.ai, which sounds a bit opportunistic.
What makes C3.ai different, however, is its founder Thomas Siebel, a billionaire and a well-known and respected entrepreneur. C3.ai’s success hinges not on a lot of small customers but on creating ripple effects in different sectors by acquiring big customers. In this respect, having a person on board who has the reputation and experience of Siebel can make a big difference. Currently, C3.ai’s customers include machinery manufacturer Caterpillar, oil and gas services company Baker Hughes, and energy company Engie, all big names in their respective industries. Interestingly, 36 percent of its revenue in 2020 came from Baker Hughes and Engie.
Therefore, although C3.ai provides very good AI development tools, the company’s success can be largely attributed not to its unique AI capabilities but its customer acquisition and retention strategy. I’m not sure if that would have been possible without having someone at the helm of the company who has strong connections in different markets and a reputation for delivering great products.
Mapillary: The value of data


Mapillary CEO Jan Erik Solem at RAAIS 2017

The final company that’s worth examining in the CB Insights list is Mapillary, acquired by Facebook in June for an undisclosed amount. Mapillary launched in 2013 to create a massive dataset of street-level images, rivaling Google’s Street View service.
Since its founding, Mapillary has collected more than one billion high-resolution images from cities around the world. Before being acquired by Facebook, Mapillary had partnered with Amazon’s AI platform to extract information from images through computer vision.
Mapillary didn’t have a super-advanced AI application or a very promising roadmap to making a profit over its data. But its data and services could prove to be a great addition to a larger ecosystem of AI software, such as that of Facebook. There are many ways Facebook, which is in the business of knowing more and more about its users, can turn a profit from Mapillary’s data. For now, we know that it will be integrating Mapillary’s data and applications into Facebook’s augmented reality and Marketplace platforms. And there are many other uses Facebook’s AI research unit can have for exclusive access to this large data set of labeled street images.
Therefore, I don’t quite see Mapillary as an AI success story, but its acquisition highlights the value of data in the AI industry. Large tech companies are often in search of ways to obtain exclusive data to hone their AI models and gain an edge over competitors. And they’re more than willing to take a shortcut by purchasing another company’s data—and perhaps the whole company with it.
The “AI startup” misnomer
I think “AI startup” is a misnomer when applied to many of the companies included in the CB Insights list because it puts too much focus on the AI side and too little on the other crucial aspects of the company.
Successful companies start by addressing an overlooked or poorly solved problem with a sound product strategy. This gives them the minimum market penetration needed to establish their business model and gather data to gain insights, steer their product in the right direction, and train machine learning models. Finally, they use AI as a differentiating factor to solidify their position and maintain the edge over competitors.
No matter how advanced, AI algorithms alone don’t make a successful startup nor a business strategy.
This article was originally published by Ben Dickson on TechTalks, a publication that examines trends in technology, how they affect the way we live and do business, and the problems they solve. But we also discuss the evil side of technology, the darker implications of new tech and what we need to look out for. You can read the original article here.

Growth hacking isn’t just a buzzword — let these 20K+ new users be your inspiration,Alan Brande,2021/02/5,"
‘Growth hacking’ has come to take on a not so positive meaning. Many see it as a hyped-up buzzword that indicates a cheap temporary solution — but I couldn’t disagree more. What it’s really about is finding small and effective actions you can execute with the resources you’ve already got.
So to drive you to start looking for the opportunities that are already present at your own startup, I’d like to give you a full rundown of a recent growth hacking process my team did.
Now let’s start by setting the scene the almost all of us are familiar with:
Back in the days where traditional software engineering models were popular — before agile became the ruling and dominant mindset that almost every company shares — the relationship between a developer and a client was one where the client would give the developer a bunch of requirements (negotiated at the start), and the developer dutifully carried them out one by one.
 This led to a ton of problems that you’ve probably heard of before (unable to respond to changing requirements, less user involvement in the process, large time gap between writing requirements and delivery, etc.). 
Collaboration between developers and clients
In modern software engineering, we software development firms try to work alongside the clients from the bottom up, and in every phase of the project. The immediately apparent consequence of this is that the now continuous process of requirement specification becomes collaborative, and better decisions tend to be made because the client and the technical team are aligned.
Less obvious is the fact that when the developer is so intimately involved in all aspects of a project, the situation becomes a fertile land for the growth of innovative ideas. 
If the development firm is encouraged to give insight pertaining to domains that are not exclusively related to the development cycle — such as Marketing, R&D, Human Resources, Production, etc. — they might come up with strategies or solutions that arise from a very different, more tech-oriented perspective. They might end up having an enormous impact, or even be the key to the project’s ultimate success.
The startup
Here at Light-it, we’ve recently had one of these wonderful moments where our marketing team had an idea that ended up delivering tremendous value to one of our clients.
The client in question was job-search startup MjobO. The MjobO platform works in the following manner:

Talented individuals in search of a job upload their resumé to the platform.
Businesses upload job offers to the platform, with a focus on transparency; they need to specify the starting salary, the working hours, and job responsibilities.
Based on a position’s required qualifications, each job offer gets matched with the potential applicants.

We built their platform here at Light-it. In keeping with the philosophy I wrote about in the first section, as we worked on the project, we sought to learn as much as possible about the entire MjobO enterprise. 
The reasoning behind this was that valuable insights only arise when a team fully grasps a project in its complete length and breadth. It needs to understand every area of a project; hyper-focusing on development would make it hard to come up with insights that involve other areas of the project. 
The eureka moment
The eureka moment came as the development team was working on the functionality to upload resumés. When a job searcher fills out the form with all of their qualifications, MjobO automatically generates a consistent, clean looking resumé. Businesses use these to determine the best applicant for the job.
While this functionality was being implemented, the marketing team pitched another use for these generated resumés. The thinking was that applicants might — after filling out and generating a clean looking resumé — want to share it elsewhere other than on MjobO. If it were possible to harness this impulse, an opportunity for viral marketing could arise.
So here’s what we did. In the screen shown after an applicant’s resumé is generated, the developers added a big, eye-catching button that reads “Share on LinkedIn.”
Most applicants are very eager to share their newfangled, updated resumé on their LinkedIn feed. So they do. It looks like this.
Great example of a growth hack in action.
The shared post starts off by mentioning that the resumé comes from MjobO. As you can see, the LinkedIn feed only shows a small snippet of the resumé, and you need to click to see the full version. If you do click, you get redirected to the MjobO website.
This simple idea was massively successful. People who are browsing their LinkedIn feed are almost invariably either people who are looking for a new job, or people that are looking to hire new employees. 
In either case, these people are instantly interested when they find out about MjobO, a job-search platform. That’s why, upon seeing the shared resumé on their feed, LinkedIn users usually click on the snippet and do end up learning more about MjobO.
Growth hacking
So what were the results in terms of new users? That’s our metric of success. And fortunately, in this case, they were staggering. 
Out of 22,000 applicants, 2,500 shared their resumé on LinkedIn. We were able to see in real-time how all the shared posts in LinkedIn were driving traffic towards the MjobO website, and how that new traffic reliably converted into new applicants. This was a viral cycle, because new applicants would then create their own resumés and would share them themselves, which allowed the platform to grow exponentially.
After all was said and done, in just one week after launch, MjobO gained over 20 THOUSAND NEW USERS. This was massive for a new company in a niche market.
The whole affair was an example of the technique referred to as ‘growth hacking.’ This term is an umbrella term for strategies focused solely on growth. These are usually used by startups such as MjobO, which during their early stages don’t have giant marketing budgets. The basic gist of growth hacking is figuring out creative, low-cost strategies to generate as much growth as possible, without spending a lot of money.
That’s precisely what we achieved with MjobO. Without spending a dime, we were able to take advantage of LinkedIn’s scale in order to reach people that fit exactly with MjobO’s target demographic (i.e people looking for jobs or people looking for employees). And we managed to do that by being creative and thinking in terms of what drives MjobO’s growth, and how we could optimize it.

AirBnb took advantage of CraigList’s scale. They started to automatically post their listings on CraigList, allowing them to reach a lot more users than they initially had, and redirecting them to their website.
Hotmail appended a line at the end of each e-mail encouraging people to sign-up.
DropBox used to offer more storage space to people who referred other users to the website.

Get started
The purpose of this post is to inspire you to get started with growth hacking yourself. Start thinking exclusively in terms of growth: what creative way can you think of to grow your product or service in an unexpected way?
I advise you to write down any strategies you can come up with, and start trying them out; you never know which one could actually stick. The key part is to always focus on strategies that allow you to have a measurable understanding of how much growth they are actually driving. Metrics are our bread and butter, use them wisely.
It might also be useful to read more about the subject, and about past examples of successful strategies. I recommend The Definitive Guide to Growth Hacking as a very comprehensive resource.
Now go make it happen!

4 salary negotiating scenarios in tech interviews — and how to navigate them,.cult,2021/02/2,"
This article was originally published by Michiel Mulders on .cult by Honeypot, a Berlin-based community platform for developers. For the latest updates, follow .cult by Honeypot on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin, and YouTube.
You’ve just landed a job interview for a technical role. Congratulations!
As a next step, you’ll likely want to learn more about the salary bands for the role, or a recruiter asks you about your salary expectations. Therefore, different situations can occur when negotiating your salary during a tech interview.  This article presents you with different situations you can expect during a tech interview and how to handle them correctly.
But first, what do you negotiate during a salary negotiation?
What is a salary negotiation?
Let’s make the following clear before we dive into different salary negotiation scenarios. Many developers don’t understand the full meaning of salary negotiations. The first thing that comes up in their mind is agreeing on their future salary. Yet, that’s not all!
Imagine a situation where you get an exciting salary offer that is higher than your target salary. However, the salary offer comes with few vacation days and no budget for personal development. Would you accept this offer even though it meets your salary expectations? Better not.
To make my point clear, avoid focusing on the final salary number. A salary negotiation encompasses many perks besides the final salary number, such as:

Health insurance
Number of days off
Learning budget or days allocated to personal development
Company holiday
Possibility to work from home
Flexible working hours
Company phone or laptop
Subscriptions for popular services, such as Netflix or Spotify
Budget to install a home office

In short, a salary negotiation involves all perks associated with a job offer. Next, let’s handle different situations during a tech interview in regard to your salary.
Situation #1: What’s your current salary?
Many tech recruiters try to figure out your current salary. This information is valuable for tech recruiters. It allows them to optimize their offer based on your previous salary.
[Read: How this company leveraged AI to become the Netflix of Finland]
Remember that tech recruiters work for a company to save them money during the recruiting process. Imagine your current salary amounts to €45,000. A tech recruiter can ask for this number and offer you a 10% increase, which amounts to €49,500. That’s a great offer! However, you might not know that the tech recruiter has a much larger margin for hiring new employees. The tech recruiter has likely received an upper constraint, for instance, €60,000.
Therefore, it’s beneficial for you not to disclose your current salary. Here are possible answers to this question.

Sorry, I don’t feel comfortable disclosing my current salary.
I can’t disclose my current salary as it’s private information that I can disclose only with my hiring manager. I hope you understand this.

Situation #2: What salary do you expect?
Again, try to avoid answering questions regarding your salary expectations. As mentioned before, recruiters receive salary bands for particular skill levels.
Therefore, try to point this question in the opposite direction. It’s best to receive a salary offer from your recruiter, so you can start the negotiation from this point.
The following replies would work well in this situation.

“Thank you for this question. We’ve already had an extensive interview process in which I’ve shown my skills and cultural fit. I trust you to provide me with a salary offer based on this information that fits the company’s needs. We can start the salary negotiation from this point. How does that sound?”
“I’m sure you are familiar with my skill level and what would be an appropriate salary offer. I trust you to provide me with a fair salary offer. I hope you understand this.”

If a recruiter doesn’t want to provide a salary offer before knowing your salary expectations, ask them for the salary bands. This information allows you to confirm that your salary expectations fall within or outside these bands. It should give tech recruiters a good insight into your expectations.
In short, tech recruiters have interviewed plenty of candidates to provide you with a reasonably accurate estimate of your worth. Make sure to first receive a salary offer before disclosing your salary expectations. If that’s not possible, ask for salary bands.
Situation #3: Sorry, we can’t offer the salary you expect
What if a tech recruiter or company rejects your requested salary?
Most often, that’s not a good sign. Perhaps, the company doesn’t have the means to offer you the requested salary.
When negotiating a salary, you should ask for 5 to 10% more than your target salary. This strategy leaves room for negotiation. On top of that, you can opt to negotiate better job perks as a compromise to a lower salary, such as more vacation days or a larger learning budget.
Therefore, not everything is lost when a company rejects your salary request. Send them a counter-offer that is 5 to 10% lower or change some of the job perks in your favor. You show your willingness to negotiate your salary and interest in the company.
Here’s an example reply to handle this situation.

“Hey, I appreciate your honest reply regarding my salary expectations. As I would like to join the team, let’s try to negotiate a job offer that works for both of us. Perhaps you can change the offer by including more job perks, such as vacation days or an increased learning budget. How about that? I’m looking forward to your reply.”

Situation #4: What do you think of a salary worth $X?
Lastly, a company offers you a salary of $X, how do you react? Several scenarios are possible depending on your target salary or current salary.

Your current salary or target salary is higher than the offered salary?

In this situation, it’s important to express your willingness to join the team while asking for their best offer. It’s your final chance to receive a better offer.
“Thank you for this offer. Although I would like to join the team, this offer is lower than my current salary. Is this the highest salary you would like to offer me?”

Your current salary or target salary is equal to the offered salary?

In this situation, you can either ask for a better salary or negotiate job perks such as extra vacation days or more days allocated to personal development. Sometimes it’s worth accepting a job with a similar salary that provides you with more benefits.
“This is a good offer. As it sounds very encouraging, I would say we are close. Is it possible to discuss other benefits, such as receiving 40 vacation days instead of 30 vacation days?”

Your current salary or target salary is lower than the offered salary?

Excellent! Most people would accept this offer. But remember there’s always a margin for salary offers. In this situation, it’s best to negotiate better perks and agree on the salary.
“Thank you for the offer! I think we are on the same page about the salary. Yet, I would like to discuss the number of vacation days. Is it possible to increase the number of vacation days to 40 days? That would be appreciated!”
Should you ask for a higher salary than your target salary?
Many software engineers feel uncomfortable negotiating their salary. It’s a natural response as you aren’t a sales manager, business developer, or tech recruiter trained to negotiate offers.
This section answers your question if you should ask for a higher salary than your target salary. The answer is simple – yes!
To provide yourself with more margin for negotiation, ask for a salary that’s 5-10% higher than your target salary.
Some of you are afraid of applying this strategy as you might miss out on interesting opportunities. Most companies know about the salary negotiation game and won’t abort an interview process based on your salary request. On top of that, they’ve already invested time in you and shown their interest in hiring you.
In the end, if a company aborts the salary negotiation process, perceive it as a good filter. Don’t feel bad about missing out on opportunities that are not worth your attention. Most likely, the company can’t offer you the target salary.
In conclusion, don’t go blindly in an interview. You should know your ideal outcome, what you compromise on, and what’s your lowest outcome you are willing to accept. Also, make sure to research the company. A recently funded company will have higher salary bands than a self-supporting startup.

How to make small talk remotely — without sounding like a weirdo,Justin Pot,2021/02/1,"
Saying good morning, in person, to a coworker you don’t know is perfectly normal. Sending a private message to a coworker you don’t know to say good morning is…weird. If not downright creepy.
Look, that’s just how it is. I don’t make the rules.
Seriously, though: the difference between these two interactions is real, which is part of why remote work is lonely. There’s also not really any context for serendipitous small talk — you won’t run into anyone in the hallway, for example. All of this makes it hard to connect with coworkers, let alone make friends with them.
But that’s not to say it’s impossible. I’ve been working from home for over a decade. Learning to reach out to the people I work with is a key part of how I’ve made it work. The conversations keep me sane when things get hard. The connections give me more reasons to care about what I’m doing. And the friendships I’ve made along the way have lasted much longer than the jobs themselves. But all that only happens if you reach out — without being weird about it.

Need help with small talk? Your friendly neighborhood robot can lend a hand. Zapier connects your favorite apps, so you can automatically send a DM whenever certain trigger events happen. Check out Zapier’s integrations for Slack and Microsoft Teams to get started.
[Read: How this company leveraged AI to become the Netflix of Finland]

Why reaching out can feel weird
Let’s get back to saying “Good morning.” Why is it so different to say that in a direct message, as opposed to saying it out loud in an office? The weirdness, I think, comes down to choice. Saying “Good morning” out loud is reflexive because we’re conditioned to do it. You saw a person, it was morning, so you said good morning like a normal human person.

Typing “Good morning” and sending it as a direct message, meanwhile, isn’t reflexive at all; on the contrary, it’s an active decision you made. You looked for that coworker, clicked their profile, then used your fingers to type a message. That effort, small as it is, changes the context and meaning of the statement. Even if the literal words are only “Good morning,” the context creates the expectation that you want…something. That can feel weird. The good news: we now understand why this is weird, which means we can make it less weird.
The solution: explain why you’re reaching out. It’s really not any more complicated than that.
Don’t say hello without context, and don’t ask someone if they “have time to talk.” Always give a reason why you want to talk to someone.
Reach out to team members and offer to help
Whenever a new person joins my team, I like to reach out and tell them I’m around if they have any questions.

I do this to be helpful, first and foremost, but it’s also a great opening for a conversation. I’ll ask how people are finding the job so far, then maybe ask some questions about where they live. Remember: you’re not going to run into new employees in the break room, so you’ve got to create these sorts of conversations yourself. It can feel a little weird, but it’s the only way these chats will happen.
Respond privately to comments made in public channels
Another way to start a conversation is to respond privately to something someone said in a public channel. My Zapier coworker Katie told me a few ways she’s done this over the years, and I think it’s a great list.

Katie actually reached out to me a year ago with one of these strategies.

It turns out I really like being told I’m funny, because now we talk regularly. I’m not sure what that says about me.
Be vulnerable
Another idea is to share something about yourself. My coworker JC calls this offensive vulnerability, and it works.

It’s also okay if you can’t think of a reason to talk: Just explain that all you want to do is say hello. I find this is enough to remove the weirdness of just saying “hi,” especially if you frame it using a little humor. That’s my general strategy.

Don’t take delays personally
Did you reach out to someone? Good. Now go do something else.
It can be tempting to leave the window open and wait for a response, and sometimes people will respond immediately. But sometimes they won’t, and that’s okay. Everyone at your company has things to do, and that means not responding to every message right away. This can be a bit of an adjustment if you’re accustomed to in-person conversation, but it’s important that you get used to it. It’s nothing personal—just the nature of online communication.
You, presumably, also have things you should be doing. Do them! You’ll hear back eventually.



Respect the back-and-forth
The best in-person conversations are not one-sided—they have a natural give and take. Online conversation also works best this way, even if it doesn’t happen in real time. If you want your conversations to feel natural, you need to respect this back-and-forth. This means asking a question, waiting for people to respond, and only following up after that happens.
Do not, under any circumstances, send a trickle of messages to someone you only kind of know. That is going to be weird for everyone involved.

Don’t make it weird. Send one message, then wait for a response. Assume that your coworker saw the message and will respond, or not, on their own time. Don’t follow up on the same day (unless you actually need a response, for work reasons).
There’s always the chance that someone legitimately didn’t see your message, or saw it and forgot to respond. If you think that’s the case, it’s probably okay to send another message, ideally the following day. But if someone continually doesn’t respond when you reach out, please: take the hint. Some people won’t want to talk to you outside a work context, and that’s okay. Sure, it would be nice of them to be transparent about it and let you know they’re not interested in chatting, but regardless, don’t press the issue.
Respect people’s status and set your own
Apps like Slack let you set a status, which is a great way to let people know that you’re doing focused work or that you’re otherwise unable to respond. Pay attention to these and don’t reach out to chat when someone is busy.
For example, I try not to use Slack while I’m writing, so I set my status in Slack to “Writing,” complete with a typewriter emoji.

My coworkers know that I won’t respond quickly when they see this status.
You should also set up a status for yourself. You can do this manually, or you make it so your Slack status changes automatically based on your calendar, time tracking app, or to-do list. Either way, it helps your coworkers know when you’re available to chat and when you’re not.
Small interactions matter
Working from home can be lonely, but it doesn’t have to be. It’s just a matter of learning how to communicate in a different environment. And you should take the time to learn this skill because small interactions throughout the day matter—and they can lead to lasting relationships.
We’re all human. We want to be seen by others, and to see others clearly. We need connection. There’s nothing weird about that. Just take the time to learn how to best do this online, in ways that make everyone comfortable.
Speaking of weird: the above screenshots where I was being all creepy were staged.

Just wanted to clear that up.

How UK startups are keeping their EU connections alive after Brexit,Andrea Hak,2021/01/29,"
For many startups across the UK, Brexit has been like trying to put together new IKEA furniture with random pieces missing and blank pages in the instruction booklet. 
With freshly published trade negotiations being test-driven for the first time and the UK’s own new national regulations in several key areas still yet to be decided, there’s a lot of uncertainty in the air. But perhaps the biggest question facing founders right now is how they’re going to hold on to their EU customers and partners in a post-Brexit world. 
We reached out to five UK-based startups that recently took part in the EU-backed Data Market Services Accelerator to find out how they’re maintaining their connections on the continent.
Establish an EU-based subsidiary
For founders with established EU customers, keeping a foot in the EU has been key. 
One such founder is Romain Eude, CEO of Utelly, a content discovery technology that solves (these days) the potentially relationship destroying question: “What should we watch tonight?” 
Using metadata aggregation, intelligent cross-linking between assets, AI/ML data enrichments, and more they’ve helped media companies streamline cross-service discovery for their viewers. 
Founded in 2013, when the Brexit referendum hit in 2016, Utelly already had customers across the UK, Belgium, Finland, and France. After the news came out, some of their customers soon began asking what would happen if the UK eventually did leave the Union. Eude and his team knew they needed to take action early:
“We decided to work out a way to structure the company to protect ourselves from Brexit and ensure we could continue business as normal as possible.” 
As a limited company established in the UK, with both private and public investors, they consulted with an accountant as to the best course of action. Ultimately, they decided to establish a subsidiary in Amsterdam with a one-to-one relationship. 
Their subsidiary now takes care of all business in Europe and the limited company continues taking on all customers from outside the EU. Their staff is now split between these two offices.
“Bottomline, I’ve now doubled my work on the admin side. We have two offices, two accounting firms, two payrolls, we have two consolidated accounts so there’s overhead there. But, on the upside, commercially — and that’s what we wanted to optimize for — there was no question. The price we paid was some money and obviously some headache to set it up, but we were able to keep things business as usual for both our EU and UK based customers.”
For other UK startups thinking about opening an EU based entity, Eude shared:
“I would consider what you’re trying to optimize for. If it’s just an administrative problem you’re trying to solve, any part of Europe will work. But if you want to set up an operation there, you have to consider more questions such as: what is it like to do business there? Is there access to talent? Is there a language barrier? Are tax incentives important for you?” Eude says.
“It’s hard enough to get new customers, but when you have unknowns, you’ll have the risk-takers who won’t stress about it and you’ll have the others who will say ‘let me wait and see.’ For small companies that can be the worst news because wait and see doesn’t pay the bills.”
Join an EU-based accelerator or incubator
Mohammed Rahman, COO of Digipharm
Digipharm is at the forefront of the shift towards value-based healthcare, working to automate and execute value-based reimbursement agreements and ultimately help patients get the best possible care. As a business looking to help disrupt an entire industry, it was essential for them to be able to access and work with different stakeholders across borders.
“It was a massive shock when the UK voted to leave the EU. Everyone actually thought that the UK would eventually reverse that decision. But it didn’t happen,”  says Digipharm’s Chief Operations Officer, Mohammed Rahman.
After Brexit, Rahman and his team noticed that “a lot of companies in Europe, when we would speak to them, had a small fear factor of dealing with companies that were based in the UK. Similarly, when we tried to reach out to investors two or three years ago, one of the key criteria was that you had to be based in the EU.” 
Especially from an investment perspective, there are a number of grants that EU-based companies can benefit from. While, as of January 2021, the UK is still participating in the Horizon program (of which Digipharm was a recipient in 2020), a number of others have now been canceled or are now inaccessible to UK startups. And perhaps it’s only a matter of time until the Horizon program is also closed to the UK.
“As a result, we just wanted to be ahead of the game and be available in both Europe and the UK so we opened an entity in Switzerland. It wasn’t primarily because of Brexit, it was just that certain countries demanded that you have a foothold inside of Europe and, from a trade agreement perspective, Switzerland is still part of the EU.”
For startups considering taking this step but uncertain where to start, Rahman says:
“I would definitely recommend other startups to do their research as to which country offers the best benefits for startups. Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland for instance all have startup incubator and accelerator programs. You can really benefit from having these remote offices out there and it’s a very low cost, in some instances completely subsidized.” 
Digipharm themselves have been part of the DMS incubator in the Netherlands, Hatch CoLab in Switzerland, BlockRocket in Germany, and now SimDH in the UK. 
“Getting help from other startups in that environment is also really valuable because you’re all on a journey at the same time so you can learn from each other. This is massively beneficial for getting advice on how to operate your business, target your audience, and raise funding for your startup.”
Reach out to experts and be prepared to educate EU-based partners
Jessica Mendoza, founder of Monadd
Brexit was already in the works when Jessica Mendoza founded Monadd in 2018. If you’ve ever faced the digital hassle of updating all your different accounts when you move, Monadd has you covered. Its platform allows you to easily update your address or cancel services across multiple accounts.
While they had mainly been working with users moving within the UK and from the EU to the UK, they’re quickly adding more functionality to move beyond that point. However, Monadd has hit a few roadblocks.
“Brexit has made it more challenging to work with local governments in the EU. It’s a discovery process for the startup but also for the other end,” Mendoza says.
Many of these local governments are still unfamiliar with the implications of Brexit. But this comes as no surprise as many UK leaders seem to be just as clueless.
Being armed with information to educate, not only your business, but also your EU-based customers and partners is key. She offered four great tips to get started.
1. Understand the basics — “To prepare for the transition, I first found a really helpful checklist on gov.uk of things that you need to do in the countdown to Brexit, so I used that as my baseline.”
2. Reach out to experts — “Contact the Department of International Trade (DIT), they do a lot of work with startups and help them with this process.”
3. Get professional legal advice — DIT also connected Mendoza with some lawyers who could help her iron out the legal details. “We’re lucky to have had great legal advice, especially in terms of developing data transfer agreements. Having great lawyers is key.”
4. Connect with other startups — “Also know what’s going on in the startup community. Often the learning process isn’t just discovery, it’s also peer-to-peer and understanding what other startups have been doing and what’s been working for them.”
However, the future of data transfers still presents much uncertainty for Monadd. As Mendoza shared, at the moment the company is keeping data transfers within the UK and hosting all of their data in AWS servers, allowing them to operate in the EU for the time being. They’re now starting to contact different providers within the EU and familiarize themselves with the different options available. 
“In terms of data transfers, there was a framework in place that was established across the EU, but now the UK won’t be able to use it anymore. The country is going to have to figure out its own way to trade with the EU. Investors coming from the EU will also need to decide what it will mean for them to have their money in the UK. I’m lucky that I haven’t accepted EU funding yet, but there is interest in that realm.”
Consider your options
Graeham Douglas, CEO of Arete Medical Technologies
For many pre-revenue and research phase startups, Brexit has had less impact on their current operations but has factored more heavily into their plans for the future. 
Graeham Douglas, CEO of Arete Medical Technologies, is developing a respiratory preventative health product for asthma, COPD, and other long-term lung conditions. By having patients breathe into their sensor-driven device, medical professionals can identify disease subtypes, better target drugs, and improve medical prevention.
Luckily for Douglas, operating in the MedTech industry, there haven’t been too many changes in terms of data regulations or access to funding after Brexit. However, it has pushed the company to tweak its strategy.
“It did force us to take a more serious look earlier at the US as a market. In medical technology, even US companies often look to the EU first. In part, it’s because the regulations in the EU were easier to comply with for new products. But after the Harmonized European Medical Device Regulations come through in May, this will no longer be the case as the systems will be quite similar,” Douglas explains. 
“But the general uncertainty of market access in Europe did force us to look more at the US and there are some positive aspects of the US as a good initial market for a product like ours. It doesn’t mean that we’ll only look at one or the other, we’ll go to both regions, we’re just considering which one might be the best option for our first launch.”
The major changes that the pandemic has brought to our working conditions have also facilitated this shift.
“In the past, in the US they wouldn’t take you seriously if you didn’t have an office there or if you didn’t have someone on the ground but, now that everyone is video conferencing, this has completely changed.” 
Factor your customers’ demands into your post-Brexit strategy
Christopher Jackson, CEO of Advanced Infrastructure, and Lily Cairns Haylor, the company’s Chief Customer Officer
Like Arete Medical Technologies, being in the pre-revenue stage, Advanced Infrastructure also hasn’t felt a huge impact on their business yet. Instead, Brexit has brought a lot of uncertainties and question marks for the way moving forward. 
The startup is tackling the problem of greenwashing by developing data and analytics tools that make carbon emissions accounting and certification more transparent and traceable.
For Lily Cairns Haylor, Chief Customer Officer, one of her biggest concerns for the future is aligning legislation.

“We’re a startup in the energy sector so it’s very relevant to us what approaches countries take to things like emissions reporting and emissions reduction strategies. The UK has just dropped out of the EU emissions trading scheme and it’s creating its own. But this needs cross country collaboration to be effective.”
CEO, Christopher Jackson, agreed, “The UK’s left a lot of EU institutions so, for example, there’s a grid operating association which the UK isn’t a part of now. So any lobbying we can do is reduced. The way I see it, the UK has two options. The legislation can diverge, and then you end up being excluded from the EU market, or the legislation can just mirror the EU legislation in which case you have no control over it and you can’t influence it. In both cases you stand to lose either market or influence and that’s strategically naive.”
Along with the lack of clarity around legislation, access to EU grant funding has also been up in the air.
“Although Horizon2020 grants have continued, not all of the grant programs have. For example, the EIC accelerator is no longer offering funding to UK-based companies after Brexit,” Cairns Haylor says. 
With all of these factors to consider, the team at Advanced Infrastructure has decided to delay any final decisions until they have further information.

“The strategic choice we have to make is: do we learn a whole new set of rules or do we simply incorporate a subsidiary in the EU. There is a strong case for the second because our customers are more comfortable with it and it could be a similar administrative workload than trying to figure out the regulation changes,” Jackson explains.

“We’re testing the market now. We’re going to see what traction we get with customers, what their demands are, and the impact on the investment environment before we make a decision.” 
Moving forward
Brexit has left us with a lot of unknowns. But, if anyone is equipped to navigate them, it’s the country’s innovative startup community. While there was an air of underlying nostalgia in each interview we conducted, the ambition to grow, disrupt, and experiment with new solutions hasn’t faded. 
While Britain may have left the EU, its startups aren’t giving up on the relationship. 
TNW is a partner in the DMS Accelerator. Applications for year 3 of the program open February 15th, 2021 and are open to startups both in the UK and across Europe. Check it out here!

Week-by-week breakdown of my $15M virtual fundraising journey in 2020,Thierry Schellenbach,2021/01/15,"
My company was positioned to grow rapidly in 2020 — but that meant raising growth capital remotely in a shifting VC landscape. We ended up closing a $15 million Series A without ever meeting an investor in person. Here’s what that process looked like, along with a week-by-week breakdown of how it progressed. 
Let’s start by setting the scene. When I co-founded Stream in 2014, I could never have guessed how 2020 would transform our business. As makers of enterprise-grade APIs that engineering teams use to build in-app chat and social activity feeds, we saw explosive growth last year with our technology in fields like healthcare, edtech, and virtual event live streaming. Suddenly, we found ourselves seeking Series A funding to help us make the most out of that opportunity and deliver more value faster to our growing customer base. 
That fundraising push came much sooner than we’d expected — and it came amidst the chaos of the global pandemic. I knew our team couldn’t afford to lose focus on ambitious product goals, and I wondered what challenges our newly remote reality would present in the world of venture capital. 
As it turned out, many core principles of the fundraising process had not changed — but certain parts of the landscape look very different now, and they require an updated set of skills, tools, and expectations to navigate successfully. 
With the odds for startup success already so low and with many other factors in flux right now, I hope to give fellow founders a leg up by sharing what I learned over the 12-week period that led us to close a $15 million Series A without ever meeting an investor in person. 
Building a strong foundation  
When I say it took us 12 weeks to close our Series A, I’m not counting the fundamental projects that I’ve been working on constantly with my co-founder, our board, and our leadership team ever since we completed the Techstars accelerator program five years ago. 
At its core, fundraising is still about convincing investors that they’ll earn a strong return by investing in your company. It’s what you do when you’re not actively fundraising that sets you apart: talking to customers, solving their problems, shipping your product, and building a strong brand. I owe a debt of gratitude to the VCs and fellow founders who spent hours workshopping my pitch deck and introduced me to people who would understand the value of Stream’s products. 
The best advice I can give at this stage is this: only talk to potential investors when you’re ready to actively raise money. 
Others will tell you to keep in touch constantly, attempting to build and maintain investor relationships over time — but is that really the best use of your time when you have a product to build and customers to talk to? 
Venture capital firms looking to beat their competition will still reach out to you before you’re ready. I’ve found that talking to them too early can distract you from following through on the goals that make your company attractive to investors in the first place. 
Now is also a good time to mention that this article will be most helpful to established startups that have already received seed funding and are now moving into a new growth stage. There are many more variables at play in the seed stage, and I recommend starting with Brad Feld’s book Venture Deals and Alex Iskold’s blog Startup Hacks, along with educational resources from Techstars and Y Combinator.
Now let’s dive into the 12 pivotal weeks of my fundraising journey.
Weeks 1-2: Outreach & connections 
By May 2020, we knew we were ready to talk seriously to investors. I reached out to VCs I knew from my time at Techstars NYC and in the startup world, and I asked our existing investors and community mentors to make as many introductions as they could. 
I can’t overemphasize this step: it’s nearly impossible to connect with a new investor without a warm introduction from a trusted contact. If there ever was a time to leverage your network, this is it. 
During these first couple of weeks, your hours of practice with the pitch deck will pay off. On initial calls, you’ll make the case for your value prop, mission, and vision as succinctly as possible. You’ll talk finance at a high level. I recommend rating VCs in terms of desirability and starting with your second tier for some practice before pitching the top firms. 
At this point in the process, the biggest difference between traditional fundraising and remote fundraising is the sheer number of investors with whom you can meet. In the past, when I’d visit VC firms’ offices in person, travel and logistics limited me to two meetings per day — maybe three if their locations and schedules lined up perfectly. In the spring of 2020, I set a personal record of eight VC meetings in one day.  
Meeting with more VCs in a compressed time period isn’t just efficient — it can also work in your favor by creating competition between firms. When the time comes for negotiations, one term sheet isn’t enough. You’ll need at least two in front of you in order to have a competitive edge.
The increased VC exposure is great, but remember that the converse is also true: investors are talking to many more founders than they could in the past, so the bar for your company to stand out is higher. In this sense, the extensive review and revision of your pitch deck and the warm introduction from a trusted contact are even more consequential than before. 
Not every conversation will get results. From a founder’s perspective, it’s not always clear which niches within tech a VC focuses on or how yours may or may not fit into their portfolio strategy. Don’t get discouraged — I see a lot of first-time founders bogged down by VC opinions. 
Remember that practically every unicorn out there was once rejected by dozens of VCs during early rounds and that it’s difficult for anyone to predict which startups will succeed. 
Weeks 3-4: Deeper conversations
After that first round of intro calls, we started working more closely with investors who expressed interest. This process doesn’t have to be linear, though, and without the need for in-person meetings, it’s even more flexible. We continued to have new intro calls all the way up to the signing of our term sheet. 
As we got deeper into talks with interested VCs, we created a virtual data room and worked on aggregating and sharing more granular financial data. I have to admit that we hit some roadblocks here — it was harder than we expected to get accurate financial reporting out of our billing system.
Billing systems and finance present a dilemma for many tech-first startups: in your earliest stages, you’re likely putting all your resources into product development and not into building out these types of systems. But if you grow as planned, you’ll eventually need them, both for scaling internal operations and for growth stage fundraising rounds.
 Somewhere along the way, you’ll need to prioritize financial reporting systems. I’d suggest doing it sooner than we did so you’re prepared to answer investors’ questions with less manual digging. 
One more note on talking to investors in this exploratory phase: it doesn’t have to be uptight and overly stressful. 
You’ll find guides that recommend obsessing about formalities like attire, your Zoom background, and more. The idea is that a degree of old-school polish will set you apart from so many others pitching their companies from behind the same device’s screen. It’s not a bad idea, but it wasn’t my experience. 
If anything, virtual meetings gave me a chance to be more myself and listen more carefully, so I could answer investors’ questions openly and honestly instead of trying to recite prepared responses. Do what feels right to you, but I think a natural balance of professionalism and approachability works well here. 
Weeks 5-6: Customer testimonials 
At this point, we were having multiple followup calls with several very interested VCs, and it came time for them to talk to our customers. Some of our largest customers were extremely gracious about finding time to talk to our potential investors, and I’m grateful for that.
 If you’ve gotten this far in the startup ecosystem, chances are you’ve figured out how to make sure customers’ priorities are reflected in your roadmap. 
Now, the relationships you’ve built with those customers become even more important. As with in-person fundraising, your ability to connect investors with satisfied customers will be critical to your success. 
Weeks 7-8: Choosing the right fit & signing the term sheet 
By the end of month two, we had received four offers. We found that GGV Capital’s areas of focus and expertise were a remarkable match for our vision, so we ultimately signed their term sheet. 
GGV is deeply involved in the new wave of developer-driven software, recognizing the power of modern developer tools to streamline and democratize software engineering processes. A number of top-tier companies in their portfolio — Agora, HashiCorp, Kong, Slack, and Zendesk, to name a few — provide similar services to ours at the intersection of developer tools and chat/messaging. 
And as an added bonus, we found that many of GGV’s other portfolio companies had a need for a chat API product like ours. If we can help solve problems for those companies, we’ll be well-positioned to hit our growth metrics for future fundraising rounds.  
Remember that as things start to get exciting, it’s easy to feel pressured by the fast pace of new developments and offers. Now, more than ever, is the time to slow down and make sure you get everything right. 
Just as your VC firm has been doing their due diligence to research your company, you’ll want to talk to other founders in their portfolio and get a better feel for the firm’s reputation beyond what you see on paper. 
We checked in with many of GGV’s portfolio companies — even some that had failed — and everyone was extremely positive about their collaboration with GGV. We were impressed by this, as most larger VC firms have several founders who are upset with them.
Weeks 9-12: Final steps 
The signed term sheet creates a framework for the deal to go through, but there’s still more work to finalize a longer-form legal contract and receive your cash deposit. This process took us about four weeks. 
With the bulk of the fundraising work complete for now, a (virtual) champagne toast was in order. Of course, the work of following through on our mission and vision and delivering promised growth has still only just begun. 
The future of tech fundraising 
Startups and the venture capital ecosystem will continue to face uncertainty as global events progress and new technology evolves to meet our changing needs. I hope what I learned while fundraising in 2020 will help teams working to build that technology secure the resources they need to grow and succeed. 
Contrary to some dire predictions, funding for creative technology solutions hasn’t dried up — but a few thoughtful tweaks to your virtual fundraising process can greatly increase your chances of closing a deal.
"
Why no-code tools in startups should remain niche,Anton Vasin,2021/01/12,"
No-code is a broad term. It describes a vast set of products that help end-users assemble web pages and applications without hiring developers.
In recent years, it has also become an ideology of sorts (praised, for example, in this Forbes column): a promise to get rid of all complications that are intertwined with IT development — its proverbial high costs, unpredictability, and difficulty to scale the teams fast enough.
However, I’d argue the promise is often exaggerated, as the proposed approaches are oversold and/or not particularly new. Still, niche solutions from the no-code toolbox might get your tasks in certain pipeline parts done surprisingly well.
So let’s pick apart the ideology and get into what startups and businesses should consider when thinking about no-code solutions.
No-code is not particularly new
Speaking of no-code, we usually think of it as a recent development, a step made in the late 2010s to emancipate the world from expensive engineers. Be it Notion, Mailchimp, Voiceflow, or Bubble, companies associated with no-code approaches are usually recently found startups. But is the approach actually that recent?
In fact, no-code-like tools were there from the very beginning of the computer era. Take Microsoft Excel: it’s basically a way to embark on visual point-and-click methods to create a simple database instead of using SQL. Or any graphical operating system like Windows, Mac OS, or Ubuntu: they give users a command line functionality combined with visual means, without the need to learn code-like commands. 
This point also perfectly illustrates the limitations of no-code. It is no coincidence that most operating systems still have a command line-based core and give their power users access to it: some things are just intrinsically difficult to visualize. 
Yes, a lot of people don’t touch the Mac OS X Terminal and never will, but in most cases, somebody terminal-savvy needs to be around to perform any actions above a certain level of complexity.
No-code limits patterns of thought
The visualization and simplification, these pillars of no-code, come at a price: no-code tools usually nudge a client to a limited number of patterns — in fact, that’s exactly what allows them to get rid of the code. 
Say, only a certain number of product management techniques go hand in hand with no-code task management tools such as, say, Trello. As a result, the idea itself might become stale. 
The problem with patterns is that they deny you the possibility of learning. A salesperson can’t become an expert in business only by using landing page presets. The code usually gives you almost infinite possibilities of configuring the system (open-source culture and the competition of approaches, programming languages and libraries usually guarantee it in any given field). 
It might not be that important for the first project, but crucial for the growth and future of any professional. There are some domains such as computations or high-load systems performance where you can not simply ‘no-code’ your way out of complexity.

That’s why I and my team at Readymag try to avoid staleness at all costs in our solutions, never limiting our users to presets, always giving them access to a clean canvas. We also give our users tools for coding.
Good tools have precise scope
However, I firmly believe that no-code approaches are great when it comes to a narrow-scope task. Take Zapier, a tool for API integration, that we actually use in Readymag; or Airtable, a tool to automate the creation of CMS. 
The idea here is not to waste your time on something that can be easily automated and configured, still use the power of engineering for the necessary parts. 
Another example is specialized e-commerce tools such as Stripe or Ecwid. Instead of creating our own e-commerce sub-tool, we at Readymag have integrated them. We try to leave each part of the pipeline to the specialized tool, be it code or no-code. 
And we think of Readymag as another such tool — a web editor, great for interactive graphics and interactive UX, but possibly powered up with additional APIs or custom code for larger and more complex projects. A full-fledged no-code approach is limiting, but a specific no-code tool might significantly increase your development process. 
Summing it up — never buy into no-code as a mantra, but always keep an eye out for its niche practical uses.

"
3 telltale signs your startup has the potential to be disruptive,Razvan Romanescu,2021/01/11,"
There isn’t a term or phrase that’s more buzzworthy than “disruptive” in the startup world. Every startup claims that they are disruptive and that their product or service is going to disrupt the industry.
The truth is that most startups aren’t disrupting anything. What does it mean to “disrupt” and how do you know whether or not a startup is truly disruptive?
While it’s a term that might seem to be fairly new — it’s thrown around nonstop now throughout startup culture — disruption has been happening throughout time. The automobile replaced the horse and buggy, becoming the more convenient mode of transportation. The laptop made bulky home PCs less convenient, and then the smartphone completely changed how we access the internet.
These are all examples of disruption, and they all became the industry standard. A great example is the mobile phone industry. How many people do you see walking around with flip phones? Essentially nobody.
The majority of the population has an iPhone or an Android device — even grandparents. Why? Because they are the industry standard. Those devices disrupted the cell phone industry and continue to dominate.
Would you trade in your iPhone or Android and go back to a flip phone? Of course not. They have completely changed how we access information, perform day-to-day tasks, connect, and communicate with people, etc.
My latest business venture, Gamelancer, has received a fair of press lately and has even been labeled as a disruptor in the gaming industry. This made me ponder what actually makes a startup “disruptive” and I’ve managed to narrow it down to the three telltale signs below — if you demonstrate these, your startup has the potential to be disruptive.
1. Your product or service is very simple
A lot of the misconceptions regarding disruption centers around the thought that a product or service has to be wildly new or advanced. This simply isn’t the case. Some of the most disruptive startups created something extremely simple.
The key is being able to clearly explain what it is that your product or service does, and why it’s a better option for the consumer. You don’t have to try to impress with fancy industry jargon, either. Keep your message simple and explain it using common language — like you are explaining it to a friend or family member.
Look at Uber. It’s fair to say that they disrupted the public transportation industry. “Call a cab” has universally been replaced with “call an Uber.” They also have a very simple product. They made transportation more convenient.
Uber as a service was so easy for its users to grasp and understand, and the company intelligently rolled out its launch. Early users needed to understand the value of Uber, so they strategically launched in New York City.
When you think of taxi cabs New York immediately comes to mind. Its residents, visitors, and tourists hail cabs around the clock. This allowed them to introduce their offering to potential consumers that would instantly understand the value.
The simplicity of Uber was one of the main reasons it was able to explode in terms of user growth at such a rapid rate. It wasn’t complicated at all. It was easy and convenient, which made users instantly adapt.
Why would anyone use a traditional taxi service these days instead of calling an Uber? It’s more convenient and affordable. Being so simple and easy to understand is what led to Uber being disruptive.

2. You change users’ behaviors
You cannot come to the market with a product or service and just claim it’s better than the competition. If your only selling point is stating that “it’s better than” the other options out there you’re not disrupting anything.
You might have a great product or service and you might generate a lot of revenue — but that alone doesn’t equate disruption. We can use Uber again as an example. Their service completely changed the way consumers commute.
They changed how people get to work, meet up with friends, etc. Some consumers made radical changes in their lives, even selling their cars because Uber was so convenient. That is what it means to disrupt an industry.
Some companies disrupt several times over, and an example that most can relate to is Netflix. Remember when it first launched and you would receive that red envelope in the mail with the DVD you selected online? You no longer had to leave the house and visit the movie rental store.
Then, they pivoted to streaming, again disrupting the industry. Now you didn’t even have to leave the couch to visit the mailbox. Disruption doesn’t have to be a one-and-done play — and Netflix is a prime example of that.
3. You serve a neglected market with a large number of users
Some of the biggest opportunities for disruption exist in industries that have remained unchanged for a while. This could be for a variety of reasons — typically the industry leaders are on cruise control when things are running so smoothly and they don’t feel the need to introduce anything new.
This opens the door for innovation and creativity to thrive, especially if the industry is craving something new and exciting. This is how my new startup Gamelancer was conceived — we felt the community was craving something new and exciting.
The gaming industry was already booming, and the recent worldwide pandemic has introduced even more people to gaming. Our platform allows gamers to play their favorite games with their fans, followers, and other members of the community.
Again, it’s simple while changing users’ behavior in an industry that while thriving, has been somewhat neglected — because it’s been doing so well
Final thoughts
A startup doesn’t have to be labeled as being disruptive to succeed. There are plenty of successful startups that do very well. They deliver an outstanding service or product, have happy customers, and enjoy continued growth.
But, for a startup to potentially make waves and truly disrupt, the three points above must be checked off. Those that do could potentially be the next Uber or Netflix, completely changing the behavior of millions of users.

"How startups are using XR to disrupt how we work, learn, and play",Andrea Hak,2021/01/8,"
Emerging tech like AI, robotics, IoT, blockchain, and machine learning are kicking our organizations into high gear by catapulting our ability to process data, build products, and automate repetitive tasks.
Andy Lurling, Founding Partner of impact-driven VC firm, LUMO Labs believes this shift will pave the way for us to find new and better solutions to some of society’s biggest problems.
“If you want to create social impact fast, technology is the way. For example, with AI and data, you can find patterns so much faster and come up with a thousand alternatives that would take people years to work on.”
But in our ‘data-driven’ era, there is one fledgling technology that could (ironically) help us humanize the future of tech.
XR technology is based on enhancing the human experience by bringing our senses into the mix. This helps, not only to make the experience more realistic, but also makes it more personalized and emotional. 
“Take for instance, a digital twin of a city, where you can immediately see all the possibilities instead of simply looking at a spreadsheet. You could ask yourself ‘what would be the effect of having 10,000 fewer ambulances in the city?’ If you instead simulate the experience of being there, it would trigger another part of your brain where emotion is also involved.”
“In a spreadsheet, that’s just a number but if you’re in a VR, where you can see the actual effect, you might have another outcome,” he said.
Speaking with Lurling at ISE’s Rise Spotlight event on XR in Today’s Reality, he shared five examples across industries of startups that are harnessing the power of XR to solve some of society’s biggest challenges.
Andy Lurling speaking at ISE’s Rise Spotlight event on XR in Today’s Reality
Learning 4.0
Education, whether in the classroom or in the workplace has been in need of disruption for a long time coming now. 
“We’re still in an educational system that was developed for the industrial revolution but we’re now in 4.0 and we’re still mainly taught by reading textbooks. But the world changes so fast now (especially the world of tech) that, after publishing a book, it quickly becomes outdated,” Lurling said.
This year, the experience of having to study and work from home really pushed a lot of companies and schools to begin using this tech for the first time and, after getting a taste of the potential benefits it can bring, it’s unlikely to slow down. A study by PwC found that VR learners are:

4x faster to train than in the classroom
275% more confident to apply skills learned after training
4x more focused than their e-learning peers

The study also found that, because of the more immersive learning experience, VR learners are 3.75x more emotionally connected to content than classroom learners. And this emotional connection can make a huge difference when it comes to really understanding and retaining knowledge. 
In the high-pressure, fast-paced environment healthcare workers face every day, staying on top of workplace training is extremely difficult. But this can lead to deadly consequences. According to VR startup, Virti, one of the leading causes of death globally is actually medical error. 
The company is using on-demand VR based training, to help improve accessibility, scalability, and knowledge retention of workplace trainings for medical professionals. 
Rather than learning in a classroom or from a text, simulating a patient care experience helps increase a learner’s emotional connection to the content and empathy, thereby greatly reducing the risk of medical error and improving patient safety. 

And it’s not just the medical industry that could benefit from XR tech. 
With such wide-ranging clients as KLM, the BBC, and Gazprom, Warp VR is helping train engineers in workplace safety, simulate sales trainings, and prepare staff for emergency situations. 
Imagine how nerve-wracking it would be to walk into a meeting with a board of directors and pitch your company’s product for the first time? Instead of throwing sales newbies into the deep end, VR training can help provide a more lifelike training experience that prepares them for the real thing. 

Using sensory reality to treat mental health 
There are billions of people across the globe living with mental health issues, from depression and anxiety to dementia. And leading experts from the WHO, the Red Cross, and academic institutions like Harvard University have warned that Covid-19 will only exacerbate this problem, potentially leading to a mental health crisis. 
But XR technology is providing new opportunities and solutions. While we may not be able to fully understand what patients are going through, by combining sight, sound, smell, and touch, psychologists and researchers have been able to simulate emotional experiences, helping them treat patients with different psychological conditions.
One company making particularly interesting progress in this field is the Netherlands-based Sensiks. They teamed up with a clinical psychologist from the University of Amsterdam to help find new ways to treat phobias and the effects of emotional trauma, with a special focus on patients with PTSD. 
With their sensory reality pods that go beyond visuals to include heat, wind, airflow, tremble, light, and sound effects, they’ve been able to recreate the sense of being in wartime or other traumatizing situation. 

This has helped patients to draw out their emotions during therapy sessions, and psychologists to study the effects of different treatments. 
This year they announced a new partnership to provide a short-term treatment strategy for traumatized healthcare workers during COVID-19.
As the company’s philosophy states: “What computer programming did for the digitization of society and economy in the last two decades is what Sensory Reality will do for understanding and optimizing the mental state of human beings.”
Taking consumer personalization to the next level 
This year, with consumers sheltering in their homes, we saw more and more marketing teams begin to experiment with AR and VR tech. From “try before you buy” to virtual expanded product views that allow customers to see the fine details of a product before they drop it into their online shopping cart. 
But Lurling believes this is only the beginning. With looming budget cuts, advertisers will need to focus spending on more targeted bets that will reach higher ROI thresholds. Emerging tech, with a major boost from XR, will be the key to the future of hyper-personalized advertising in our homes and on the streets. 
One great example he shared was Tropos AR, an advertisement solution that allows consumers to choose which types of products they’re most interested in. The solution then uses a combination of AR and blockchain to share personalized ads, discounts, and coupons.

“Tropos AR uses a perfect convergence of technology. What they do really well is that they make a connection with the customer. When you go to a shopping street, you get all the advertisements. But Tropos makes it so that you only see the advertisements that you’re interested in.”
Studies show that 43% of consumers are willing to adopt store tech if it alleviates time and ease. In fact, Shopify found that products with AR content have a 94% higher conversion rate. 
This means, rather than investing in a billboard that only a small section of your target audience may see on the high street, you can instead reach them directly with personalized ads. In this way, putting consumers in control provides better, more personalized deals for them and much better ROI for companies. 
Gamifying our physical health
For most of us, exercise is that annoying chore that no amount of athleisure wear or peppy gym instructors can make even remotely enticing. But what if we could somehow actually make working out fun?
While the world of tech has brought us forward in many ways, it also has its drawbacks. The more screen time we spend, the less time we spend on the move. 
“In 2019, the WHO published a report showing that 80% of young people are developing conditions you normally see in elderly people. And, to a large extent, that group includes gamers,” Lurling said.
In fact, the health organization recently added ‘gaming disorder’ to its list of diseases. But he also believes that XR can provide some solutions that are way more fun than simply hitting the track more often. 
“If you bring a physical element to gaming, you can create an environment which is like Ready Player One,” Lurling said. 
XR is helping us expand our gameplay by combining visuals with interactive touch-based games that follow your body’s movement. And studies show that virtual-reality ‘exergaming’ can actually increase enjoyment and performance.
Eindhoven based Active Sports Arena is one example. Their wire and controller-free VR games are being used by companies to make team building activities and even brainstorming sessions more interactive.

Improving the XR experience 
While XR is helping us in so many ways, in some cases, after prolonged periods of time, VR and AR tech can cause eye strain, headaches, fatigue, and nausea. 
Because the flat plane 3D images we see in XR headsets don’t actually contain real depth, our eyes aren’t able to naturally focus in and out of them as they would with real-life images. But advances in what’s called light-field technology are helping to make XR images more life-like and, of course, easier on the eyes. 
In a market dominated by tech giants, like Facebook’s Oculus, Swiss startup CREAL is bringing some serious competition. Their light-field technology improves depth resolution of virtual objects, allowing them to blend in more easily with the real world. This doesn’t just provide a more immersive virtual experience, it also eliminates the harsh side effects and eye strain.

As we can see, XR is on the rise and it’s only expected to pick up steam moving forward. While the market for AR and VR solutions was less than $12 million in 2019, ABI Research has forecasted the market to exceed $400 million by 2025. 
“I believe in the convergence of technology and that, in the future, our solutions will combine things like AI, machine learning, and blockchain, with XR being how it’s displayed,” Lurling said.
But, while this tech really stepped in during this year to help alleviate the transition to at-home work, learning, patient care, and more, he believes it won’t replace our need for in-person social interaction.
“For learning, shopping, and experiencing, it will grow further. But, my belief is that the social element will shrink after social distancing ends because you can’t replace human connection.”

Need a 2021 work resolution? Procrastinate more,Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten,2021/01/7,"

Last year I bought a rubber buoy to mark the spot where I anchor my boat. What I hadn’t considered though — until I received the deflated buoy — was that I’d have to fill it myself. It made sense, of course, I just hadn’t given it the slightest thought.
This didn’t phase me though, I had a bicycle pump with an adapter, so I’d get it done in no time… but within a minute I was already sweating profusely beginning to doubt if I’d ever inflate it.
The buoy’s air valve was a sturdy one, and it took quite an effort to just get a small amount of air into it. After a few minutes of profuse pumping, I started to think the buoy must have a puncture. No matter how much work I put in, it hardly seemed to move.
[Read: Meet the 4 scale-ups using data to save the planet]
A whole eternity later (or at least that’s what it felt like) my unexpected workout session paid off. The buoy began to inflate a little bit, I kept pumping like crazy, and then suddenly it seemed to fill up completely in one go. My buoy was finally ready to be deployed.
Sounds like a metaphor? Well, I guess it is.
See, I’m a procrastinator. I need time, a deadline, and a reminder — and then a stern warning — to finally get me to make some extra time for the work I need to do. Since we’re entering a new year, I’ve decided it’s the perfect moment to make a change. Am I going to stop procrastinating? Hell no. Instead, I’ve decided to feel better about procrastinating — and here’s where the buoy story comes in.
The thing is, procrastination isn’t ‘doing nothing.’ Just like pumping air into a lifeless buoy, you don’t see any results right away, but you’re laying a foundation for success.
Procrastinating doesn’t just mean you haven’t started the work, it actually signals you’ve begun thinking about the outcome. You’re mentally preparing, turning over ideas in your head, considering them from all angles and how best to implement them.
You should think of work procrastination like marinating your food. It might seem like you’re not doing anything, but it’s actually an essential part of making a great meal.
So I hope you’ll find the time and comfort to procrastinate a little this year. And when you do, please try not to feel guilty about it.
You’re not doing nothing — you’re marinating.

4 founders explain the biggest hurdles to flattening the climate curve in 2021,Andrea Hak,2021/01/6,"
While a lot of our career, personal, and travel plans have been put on hold this year, there’s one thing we as a society cannot afford to put on hold: the fight against climate change. 
Rather than scaling back the progress we’ve made, many are seeing this moment as an opportunity to create a new normal in which sustainability and circularity are integrated into our businesses and daily lives.
With this in mind, Techleap.nl recruited some of the brightest minds in Dutch sustainability tech to join the Rise Programme for up and coming scaleups. The theme for batch two this year was: flattening the climate curve. 
We caught up with four of the Programme’s cohorts to find out what they see as the biggest hurdles to tackling climate change within their industry.
Making sustainable transportation an option for the masses
Transportation is responsible for 30% of the EU’s total CO2 emissions. And cars are the biggest polluters, accounting for 60.7% of CO2 coming from road transportation. 
With the explosion of new electric cars on the market, consumers are being courted with new transportation alternatives and government-backed incentives. But electric car registrations have still only increased incrementally across the EU from just 2% in 2018 to 3.5% in 2019. So what’s holding people back?
While there is a large and growing consumer base who are ready to make the switch, as Lex Hoefsloot, CEO of Lightyear, explained, “If you look at the research into why more people aren’t buying electric cars they come down to: cost, charging, and range. And that’s been the same for the last ten or fifteen years.” 
So-called ‘range anxiety’— or the fear that an electric car could simply run out of electricity at the most inopportune time (like on a dark, creepy horror movie type road at night) — has been one of the biggest concerns voiced by consumers. 
Connected with this are questions about charging infrastructure. There are gas stations set up everywhere, but how many charging points are actually out there for electric cars? What if I want to go on a road trip? Will I have to hitchhike halfway through?
Lightyear is looking to solve both range and charging for consumers who are still on the fence about making the switch to electric. 
“Rather than targeting people already interested in buying an electric car, we want to focus on other people. People who live in apartments and can’t charge at home. Or people who want to drive long distances every day,” Hoefsloot said.
And just how do they plan to do this? 
While studying engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology, Hoefsloot and a team of students were tasked with building and racing a solar car in one year at an annual competition in Australia. After winning the competition with their solar-powered four-seater, Hoefsloot realized that the next step was to bring the concept to the masses. Thus Lightyear was born in 2016.
“We felt, if it’s possible to go from zero to a car built from scratch within a year, and win as well, then the sky’s the limit.”
Set to go into production in 2021, Lightyear One will be one of the first long-range solar electric cars. It has a battery with up to 700km of range plus five square meters of solar panels that add on 12km of range for every hour the car is in the sun. 
They also made the Lightyear One more energy efficient. A normal electric car uses about 200-watt hours per kilometer, while their model uses about 100-watt hours per kilometer. So, for every bit of energy you have, you can go twice the distance. 
As Hoefsloot explained, “Even in The Netherlands – a horribly rainy country – it can charge about 7,000 km per year, which is more than half of what people drive on average in the Netherlands. So in practice, you would only need to charge once every few weeks, rather than every few days.”
The third problem they want to solve for consumers in the future is cost. The Lightyear One will be the company’s first low volume car, but the plan is to later go on to build a high volume model that will be more affordable for a larger audience. 
“A lot of people still don’t have the money to buy an electric car. We shouldn’t judge people for not making the switch because there are simply not enough options on the market yet. That’s why the push coming from the EU with its new incentives for alternative energy vehicles is so important.”
But, for now, Lightyear’s biggest challenge is assembling a winning team that can make their ambitions a reality. They now have a number of vacancies they want to fill on their website. Hoefsloot encouraged anyone who believes they can help the team achieve their ambitions to reach out.
“Frans Timmermans, Vice President of the EU, once said, ‘the biggest misconception is that if you do nothing, everything will stay the same.’ Sometimes, in the Netherlands, I have the feeling that we hold ourselves back. We’re a small country. We’re not the US. And sometimes we start to think: ‘Can we do this? Maybe we should start with a smaller mission?’ But I would encourage anyone who has an idea to just start with it and make it happen,” Hoefsloot said.
Shaping an emission-free energy system
It’s not just our wheels that could use a green energy boost. Moving from the current, fossil fuel-based electricity system, to an all-renewable energy system, is crucial to stopping climate change but also more complex than just installing a lot more solar panels and wind turbines. 
Simon Bushell, CEO of Sympower, believes that “One of the key things we need to do is empower traditional industries to actively contribute to the energy transition. A fully sustainable and interconnected energy system would bring us a big step forward in powering the net-zero future.”  
But, as Bushell explains, it’s not that easy. 
If you look specifically at the electricity system, supply and demand always need to be in balance. In the current model, the large coal and gas-fired power plants that provide electricity constantly look at how much electricity is being used. When they see more is being used, they burn more coal and gas. Similarly, when they see less electricity is being consumed, they reduce output.
What hinders the widespread adoption of renewable energy is that it’s harder to control than fossil fuels.
The challenge with wind and solar energy is that they are variable and not controllable – you can’t just ask a solar plant to produce more electricity, you need the sun to be shining. As increasing numbers of countries are looking to move away from carbon-intensive energy sources, this problem will only become more complex.
Bushell and his team at Sympower realized that the energy transition would require new demand response technology and solutions. That’s why the company focuses on providing flexibility by regulating demand instead of supply. 
Processes such as heating, cooling, ventilation, and water pumping use lots of electricity, however, it’s not necessarily crucial when that electricity is used. Take a fridge, for example – if you turn it off for ten minutes everything inside it will remain cold, but crucially it will use less electricity. On the other hand, you can also make a fridge colder by using more electricity initially, before turning it off for longer. Basically, assets such as fridges can control when electricity is consumed. This is exactly what we do. We make any asset flexible, balancing electricity supply and demand in real-time the same way a coal or gas-fired power plant would.
Sympower has grown rapidly due to a very enthusiastic client base which has helped it spread the word organically. The company is now operating in Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Israel, with plans to expand to three new countries in 2021.
“What we do is something people don’t often know about, so it’s been really cool to see how enthusiastic our clients are to really help enable a fully-renewable energy grid in their country,” said Bushell. 
However, there are still hurdles that Sympower has to overcome to reach a wider audience. Bushell told TNW:
One of the biggest challenges we face is regulation. Before we can start operating in new countries, we need certain regulations to change that will allow us to operate as an independent demand aggregator. Slow regulatory changes are probably our biggest blocker at the moment.
When asked about what the world needs to do now to flatten the climate curve, Bushell told TNW: “I think there’s no silver bullet in the energy transition. If anyone tells you what they do is the one key thing, I would be very skeptical. A combination of solutions is what is actually needed. I do believe that we provide an essential service – the energy transition can’t succeed without flexibility.”
Giving waste a second life
Until recently, a lot of the focus on tackling the climate curve has been centered on improving energy efficiency. It’s only in recent years that waste and the end life of a product or materials have come under closer scrutiny. 
In a TED Talk, Excess Materials Exchange founder, Maayke Aimee Damen, highlighted that, while improving energy efficiency is important, this only accounts for 55% of greenhouse gas emissions. Guess where the other 45% come from: the actual materials/product we produce (including waste).
According to a report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, if we just focused on designing out waste, keeping materials in use, and regenerating farmland in five key areas (steel, plastic, aluminum, cement, and food) we could eliminate 9.3 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions. To put this into perspective, this would be the equivalent of cutting the emissions of every vehicle down to zero.
While this sounds like an amazing opportunity to cut emissions, the truth is, many companies don’t really know where to start. As Damen explained, 
Companies aren’t always aware of what they have because it’s all in different databases and it’s unstructured. Right now they don’t really have an idea of what’s going through their organization. And if they have that, it’s always spread out over different departments, in different formats and databases, some on paper, some online. So if the information is already there, it’s not comparable and it’s dispersed. And that’s where we come in handy.
In 2017, Damen and her co-founder, Christian van Maaren, created Excess Materials Exchange (EME), a self-described ‘dating site’ for excess materials. The team starts out by helping companies to structure the materials and products they have available by providing each one with a ‘Resource Passport’ containing insights into the composition, origin, toxicity, or deconstructability of the item. 
This then allows EME to track and trace these materials throughout the supply chain and match them with other reuse opportunities, either inside or outside of the organization. 
For example, they were able to help one of their customers, Dutch railway company ProRail, match excess rail tracks in one city to other worksites in need of materials across the country. 
This also leads to some unlikely matches. For example, the Netherlands is famous for its tulips, but what happens with leftover flowers after the growing season ends? While in some cases growers have even paid to have someone get rid of the excess flower waste, EME instead has helped connect growers to pigment makers who can reuse them. Clearly, opposites do attract.
And Damen has seen that having a system in place is helping make the business case for recycling much easier:
I think having standardized bookkeeping for resources is going to be a tremendous help in making data-driven decisions. Because that’s what we need if we want to tackle this. We can’t just go on our gut feeling. We see that a lot with circularity ending up as a gimmick. That’s why gathering data is so important.
With a lot of enthusiasm and support coming from their current clients, Damen told TNW that the company’s main goal for 2021 is to attract the investment needed to scale up their operations. 
One piece of advice she would give to companies who really want to begin making a difference is to have clear KPIs in place. 
“The biggest hurdle we see is that the urgency is quite low. People find it hard to relate to something that’s not tangible. It’s on companies right now to reduce their emissions or to start exchanging materials, but they don’t necessarily have a strategy or KPIs to steer them in the right direction. This makes it very hard for individuals within companies who want change to succeed because, if they succeed, there’s no KPI they’re going to be rewarded on and, if they fail, they have a problem. So the incentive scheme isn’t tailored towards taking action in the majority of organizations,” Damen told TNW.
Making international travel faster and greener
Perhaps one of the more difficult sacrifices we’ll have to make to lower our carbon footprint will be our wanderlust. While there are more and more options to cut emissions from our daily commute, for international travel we’re still reliant on flights to get us where we need to go. 
While commercial aviation is only responsible for 3.5% of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions, it’s also growing faster than any other transport sector has increased by 130% over the past two decades. Although electric trains are becoming more popular, a train journey from Amsterdam to Paris or Frankfurt still takes around three to four hours. 
But Hardt Hyperloop is making some exciting new advancements that could cut a three-hour intercity trip down to just 30 minutes. The company’s vision is to replace short-haul air travel across Europe with a 10,000km network of tubes that can zip people and cargo across borders. Not only is the hyperloop system expected to take less time, it’s also powered by renewable energy. 
The energy-efficient tech behind the system is perhaps the most interesting part. Each hyperloop vehicle is pushed through the tube system using a combination of electromagnetic suspension and electric propulsion. This technology, along with the low-pressure environment created within the tubes, helps to propel the vehicles forward at high speeds. 
While it may be a while before we can all jet-set across Europe by tube, Hardt plans to open the first European Hyperloop Center in 2022 where engineers, researchers, and governments can collaborate together to make this futuristic-sounding vision a reality. 
From innovative technology to collecting the right data to government-backed regulations and incentives, there’s still a lot to be done. But one thing we did hear from all of this year’s cohorts was that the most important ingredient is there: the will and motivation to change. As Bushell of Sympower said:
I think it’s definitely starting. I don’t think we’re there yet. But you definitely see that more and more companies are saving energy and reducing CO2 and it’s becoming more important for them. But there’s still a lot of awareness that we could bring.

‘Tangential’ content is the link building tactic your brand is missing out on,Amanda Milligan,2021/01/6,"
Branded content is crucial for many reasons: communicating the value of your product/service, helping people make buying decisions, providing pertinent information to your primary audience, and more.
But if your marketing goals include earning high-quality backlinks, building your brand awareness, and increasing your organic traffic, tangential content needs to be in your content strategy.
So what exactly is it, and how can you incorporate it into your own content calendar?
Defining tangential content
Tangential content is content that is related to a brand’s industry but is not related to its core branding. It doesn’t refer to a product or service offering, nor is it a bottom-of-the-funnel effort to convert.
In the spirit of showing and not telling, here is the difference between content that’s more tangential vs. content that is more topical.
On the top, you see a tangential piece of content by Hershey that provides tips to families on how to be safe when trick-or-treating in 2020. Does this have to do specifically with buying candy? No. But does it provide value to their target audience, candy fans? Yes.
Below that, you’ll see something a little more topical: a recipe that includes a Hershey’s product. Even this piece has a touch of tangential in that it isn’t directly about purchasing the candy, but the candy is necessary for the activity, putting it more on the tangential, product-related side.
Who’s using tangential content
My team and I were wondering the same thing, as we’re huge advocates of the strategy and have been using it for our clients for years. 
So we decided to look into it. We examined the content of all the brands nominated for the 2020 Content Marketing Awards and found a majority of those companies use tangential content on their blog.
That’s a large number of quality content marketing programs using tangential content on their blogs! 
But it’s not just blog content. 31.3% of the brands we analyzed also had tangential off-site content, meaning content they used to acquire earned media. This is what we do at Fractl, and I’ll be showing an example later in the post.
This is why I’m so surprised tangential content isn’t talked about more, and frankly, I think nearly all brands should be giving it a shot because of the advantages it brings.
How you can benefit
Tangential content is powerful for a few reasons.
First, it unlocks a new, broader audience, who becomes aware of your brand and enters the top of your funnel.
Second, since it’s not as salesy, it can help you build backlinks to your site, which builds the authority of your brand and improves the standing of your site in Google’s eyes.
And third, though a bit more nebulously, having to come up with tangential content ideas prompts you to zoom out a bit and explore other issues and interests your audience has, leading to more robust audience personas.
Let’s look at some real examples of how these benefits come into play.
A great example of on-site content is Canva’s Color wheel, which helps you determine which colors go well together.
I’m assuming Canva wanted to broadly target people interested in design elements, as they offer a design tool. 
This makes this strategy really smart, because they created a useful calculator people probably bookmark, share, and link to. (In fact, this page earned more than 4,000 engagements on Facebook, according to BuzzSumo.) And even though it doesn’t relate directly to signing up for Canva, it still appeals to the broader audience they’re interested in connecting with.
Another example is a project we did for Hire A Helper, a company that assists users in finding movers. We didn’t do a project about moving; instead, we surveyed 1,000 people on how they interact with their housemates to unearth new insights about quality time.
Here’s one of the graphics we created based on our analysis of the results.
Because this content is not only relevant to people moving but anyone who’s lived with someone else, it’s much more widely appealing, which is something publishers look for, too. Oftentimes they want what they write about to be significant for a majority of their readers.
We pitched this content to writers and earned coverage on Better Homes & Gardens, which syndicated to Allrecipes and Yahoo!
Without this new, tangential data, it would have been much more difficult for Hire A Helper to reach these large publication audiences and get the SEO benefit of earning high-authority backlinks.
Creating/improving your own tangential content
For tangential content to be worth the effort, it needs to appeal to a larger audience than you normally target, or at least a new audience that’s still somewhat related to your industry. 
This requires a new perspective throughout your entire content process.
Here’s how I recommend tackling tangential content:

Expand your keyword research — Use a tool like Keyword Surfer and get lost in related searches. Explore what related topics people are interested in that you might have stayed away from since they don’t tie to your core branding.
Get inspiration from other industries — Competitive research is crucial, but our team has found that if you get stuck only looking at other brands in your own industry, you won’t find the creative inspiration you need to think outside the box, which is required to come up with great tangential content ideas.
Think laterally — When you have a list of subtopics related to your core brand, ask yourself: what else is relevant to this topic? For example, if you’re a car insurance brand, what else is related to driving? Work commutes, singing in the car, safety, family vacations… the list goes on and on.

Conclusion
My suggestion isn’t to throw away your topical content and make everything more general. But I do think all content marketers should take time to see if tangential content will help them achieve goals they haven’t been able to reach through topical content alone.
As long as you’re still providing value to your audiences and creating engaging, accurate, and new tangential content experiences, there’s a good chance it’ll boost your brand awareness and traffic.

3 efficient tips startups should steal from old-school corporates to grow,Albina Zhdanova,2021/01/5,"
I became a COO at Tools for Brokers when I was 22 years old. Back then, the team consisted of 12 people sharing one office in St-Petersburg, Russia. Fast forward to eight years later, and we have more than 80 people spread across four offices. Our turnover, income, and product range have grown exponentially. Today I have vast experience, and I am confident in my decisions, but it wasn’t always like that. 
At the beginning of my journey, I sought advice and guidance from those I’ve perceived as the ultimate knowledge base — top managers of the big companies. Through multiple conversations with C-level employees of massive industrial companies, corporate giants, and businesses established in the previous century, I have realized that many of the things I talk about are either alien or nonsense to them. 
Despite some obvious differences in our views on the world, future, and management, I have had three major takeaways from our discussions. I believe these takeaways can help many startups evolve and bring their A-game. 
1. Information must flow out of the heads and straight into the text
Sounds poetic, but this one is actually quite straightforward.
In the beginning, startups typically have from one to 10 people in the team. Often, the culture reminds you more of a family, with its unwritten rules, inside jokes, and common understanding of how things are done. It’s all fun and games until you wake up a couple of years later, and you see that some people left, some people joined, and nobody fully understands what the agreements and procedures are. 
Now it may sound boring, but everything must be written down: the processes, the workflow, the decisions made. 
Don’t underestimate the value of a handbook with its basic rules and requirements for work. Not only does it help avoid unnecessary confusion, but it also helps smoothen the adoption process of new employees. People learn better and faster when they don’t need to play the guessing game. 
There isn’t much point in writing things down though if nobody reads it. That’s why you need to make all information readily available to all team members. Keeping a folder with PDFs on your laptop won’t work here, so think through a system where everyone can easily access the data. 
2. Build a clear career path for your employees 
Another common situation in a startup is having a ‘jack of all trades’ attitude: responsibilities vary day by day, multiple positions are combined into one, everyone is doing more than they are supposed to do according to their job description. Again, it is fun and exciting for some time, but it’s not sustainable in the long run. 
If a company truly wants its employees to grow, it needs to let them do the work they are hired to do — and they should excel at it. With everything documented, it becomes apparent when the team is understaffed, and a new person is needed to cover some of the specific tasks. 
Documentation also helps uncover areas for improvement. KPI, or key performance indicator, is a fantastic tool that can and should be used for bonus calculations and potential promotions. 
It feels like KPIs are a bit underestimated in the IT crowd, and there is really no reason for it. Show your employees the roadmap and clearly explain what is required to get a pay raise or a higher position. 
It’s a win-win for both managers and employees when there is a clear path that needs to be followed to succeed. It also gives the team a sense of responsibility and autonomy — they know what is required of them, and they are in control of their future with the company. 
3. Build a forecast to reach your goals
I often hear people complain that it’s impossible to know what happens in the future. Although this feels quite accurate for the past 12 months, generally, you can estimate and plan for what is coming. 
There is a stage in each successful startups’ life when the product is simply selling itself. Whether you came up with a new niche or presented a unique feature to an existing solution, it looks like customers can’t get enough of your product. You might think that it will last forever, but it never does. 
Don’t wait for your sales to sink. Act now: invest in promotion, calculate the time and the size of your estimated returns. You can ‘go with the flow’ and save yourself from data gathering, analysis, and multiple conversations with the teams. However, the result might not be satisfactory in that case. It’s hard to know where you’re going and what will wait for you at your destination if you don’t plan. 
That’s why I urge you to stick to your startup’s vision — but plan ahead for a month, a quarter, and a year like a bigger company. Have your positive and negative expectations of market reaction and be ready to re-evaluate the strategy and final goals. Anyone can start a business. It’s keeping it alive and healthy long-tem that is the problem. 
There is plenty of information online on how to do all of this in more detail, but the biggest obstacle is usually finding the time. My advice is to break the process into smaller steps: start reading a few articles, then choose one area of improvement per week and start analyzing it. You will be amazed at what can be done within one year.

We need to make remote meetings more boring in 2021,Már Másson Maack,2020/12/29,"
It’s been a tough year of pivoting, remote work, and conceptualizing the ‘new normal.’ But as we enter a new year, it’s time to take stock of how we’ve operated professionally and what we’ll take with us into 2021.
So when exactly was the last time life was good? Was it when you were huddled up with your coworkers by the watercooler or spending time with your loved ones? No, it was when you were watching The Office — and therein lies our solution for next year.
With new vaccines on the horizon, things are looking brighter and we’ll probably be able to return to many of our pre-corona traditions. But despite that, the entrepreneurial and business communities seem obsessed with the idea that the ‘new normal’ is here to stay.
But my problem with the ‘new normal’ is that it sounds too perfect. Companies and startups are meant to open up to remote work completely, perfecting asynchronous work, and guaranteeing increased productivity with the flexibility to work during your personal ‘peak performance’ hours.
All of this is missing an essential part of what makes a baseline, a sustainable ‘normal’: boredom.
We’re far from being perfect beings, so I believe we’ll always need to work in some imperfections into our operations. Now how do we achieve that? By taking a page out of The Office playbook.

So here’s my *fuego* take on how to make the ‘new normal’ work: make remote meetings even more boring.
Divisive and brave, I know. Not sure ‘hero’ is the right word to describe me, but I understand it comes to mind when you read this.
Before I drop some knowledge on you, just let me be clear: I’m not saying that endless Zoom calls aren’t frustrating and awful, it’s just that they don’t reach peak boringness, where its beauty is released. They’re just half-assed boringness.
It’s all too easy to just turn off your camera, surf the web, check messages and tweets, and pretty much carry on with the mindless internet habits that you use to fill every other void in your life.
What’s wrong with that? Well, I’ll tell you, we can veer off into deep existential dread because we’re overly-stimulated, instead of embracing the meeting’s banality. This isn’t just me saying it, it’s science (probably).
The Office taught us that in-person meetings, however, prevent you from diverting straight into existential dread, because you’re too occupied having the life sucked out of you in a stuffy meeting room. The camaraderie between you and your coworkers when you see the light in each other’s eyes slowly extinguish in unison is the principle the modern world was built on…
And here’s how you can capture that feeling: BEHOLD, THE BOUNCING DVD LOGO SITE!

Just like when The Office gang obsessed over whether a DVD icon could hit the corner of the screen, you can do the same in your next Zoom call with this neat little site.
As nerdy mathematicians have shown, the logo can actually hit a corner on DVD players. But what’s tricky about the site is that you can adjust the size of the window yourself and the logo will change its bouncing accordingly — adding a whole new exciting layer to your boredom.
Credit: Bill GreenNerd speak for bouncy logo stuff.
Now while most business leaders have tried to find new ways to make remote meetings more engaging — like always starting off with a collaborative video game — I’d like to argue my call for boringness also addresses engagement. You can’t be bored if you’re not fully engaged with how tedious something is, as any distraction would alleviate your boredom. Checkmate.
Having the hypnotizing DVD logo on next to the slides in a monotonous Zoom meeting hits the sweet spot of engagement and utter boredom. It gives you a certain sense of progression, while not taking away too much of your attention.
I already tried the DVD logo out with a couple of my colleagues, and they claimed it had actually gone into the corner TWICE! Not saying they’re liars, but I somehow missed it both times.
So if you’ll excuse me, I need to get back to monitoring my beautiful bouncing DVD logo. Let me know how your boring meetings go in 2021.

I went from software development to HR and back — here’s what I learned,Lena Jaschke,2020/12/23,"
When was the last time you stepped completely out of your comfort zone and joined a department and position that are not in line with your CV? It might feel intimidating for some, a waste of time for others.
Now, let me ask this way: When was the last time you decided to explore something new and ended up gaining a lot of new insights and learnings? I suspect many will recall multiple instances of such situations.
For me, the journey started around one-and-half years ago. Well, to be honest, it actually started earlier, when I decided to join a rotational program within Philips: three different positions in three years. It sounded like a great learning opportunity.
After working on CT detector technology in our Research lab in Hamburg, I joined the advanced development department of Mother and Childcare in the Netherlands, working as both a functional and firmware developer.
I guess by now we see a pattern – yes, I have a background in engineering and I love working on digital solutions that improve people’s lives. Digital signal processing, computer vision, algorithms, and software in general – those are the things that make me tick. So I decided to join the Human Resources (HR) department for Innovation and Strategy to continue my journey within Philips. Wait a second…



An engineer in HR?
“Lena, WHERE are you going to work?” was one of the standard questions I had to answer many times. My friends know me as a true TechWoman: enthusiastic about medical technology, a bit nerdy, and a software enthusiast as software provides me with the short feedback loops which fit well with my actionist character.
Aside diverse reasons, most importantly, I was sure that I would be able to learn a lot in that position. This was proven true for sure. It also turned out that, on the one hand, my engineering and software background helped me to add value and bring about change in the HR department, while on the other, I was able to bring back a diverse set of skills from HR to engineering.
Bringing the engineering view to HR
There is a lot of negative discussion around stereotypes. However, I like stereotypes because they help to explain an archetype (variations for sure possible). So please don’t take my descriptions as universal givens.
Below I would like to focus on four more-or-less concrete examples where the software engineering background helped to bring about change to the HR group I was working in:
Agile WoW
Most properly, HR is not the first term that comes to mind when thinking about agility. So let’s see if that proves true and how to address some of the growth opportunities towards a more agile WoW.
Excel is for sure one of the preferred tools not only in HR, but in many other fields as well: it is used for high-level project planning, data analysis, and a lot more. However, using Excel to track progress on action items related to a specific project is not very practical.
Being a true believer in visualizing current work items, their progress as well as backlog items in the form of a team Kanban, I felt strongly about taking action on that front.
We introduced a team board using Planner and as we were now anyhow in the flow of change, we also tried the approach of stand-ups to replace the weekly one-hour project team meetings. Overall responses in the team were positive about these changes, but I also must admit that sticking to a 15-minutes duration for the stand-ups seldom worked out.



Waste patterns
Waste plays a big role not exclusively but also in product development. The majority of the software engineers I worked with so far enjoy detecting waste patterns in their own work as well as in their team or the value stream they are contributing to. Once waste is detected, solutions will be found or created and as much as possible, e.g., automating recurring tasks.
I was lucky enough to start in the HR department when Microsoft Teams was introduced as the main collaboration tool throughout the company. This gave me a great discussion base for an alternative to sharing a lot of the information via email. So just to be clear, I for sure don’t see emails as waste per se.
However, labeling and archiving each email in my inbox at the end of the day based on the project it relates to and downloading a document that was attached to an email to then, in a next step, upload it to an internal document management system, such as SharePoint, are two of many examples where a different collaboration tool and culture can help to reduce some of the non-value adding activities.
The Agile Manifesto principle “Simplicity – the art of maximizing the amount of work not done – is essential” adds another interesting dimension to this discussion. Maximizing the amount of unnecessary work not done fits in perfectly with Lean principles and the idea of reducing process waste.
In order to be able to deliver the highest value with the fewest ‘lines of code’, I started asking myself and my colleagues every time a decision needs to be taken the question: “Are we really adding value by doing this?”.



Dead ‘code’
There exist multiple definitions of dead code. The term can refer to code that is never executed at run-time or a section in the source code of a program that is executed but whose result is never used in any other computation.
Consequently, the execution of dead code wastes computation time and memory. In software craftsmanship, dead code needs to be carefully taken care of as there are clear risks in leaving dead code in the code base such as that it can be an obstacle to programmer understanding and action as well as the risk that the code is awakened and consequently cause problems. Kelvin Henney once said: “Deleting dead code is not a technical problem; it is a problem of mindset and culture”.
Following this line of thought, we can find equivalents to dead code in diverse working environments and the ability to detect and change it can have a significant impact. Do you take the time to clean-up file repositories from information that is not of use anymore? Do you leave Teams that are inactive and don’t add value to your work, or do you just hide them? Do you know the costs of a culture of duplication?
Sometimes it helps to have a fresh pair of eyes to have a look at your project. Will a new colleague be able to navigate in this environment from Day 1? Will he or she be able to bring the work to the next level by adding the next ‘lines of code’? If the answer to one of the questions above is no, it is time to react upon and start detecting and eliminating the dead ‘code’.
CI/CD pipeline
Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment practices form the backbone of DevOps operations. In software engineering, our goal is to work in a way that allows us to release value to the customer on a continuous base. As opposed to phase-gated development, every milestone involves a portion of each step: requirement, design, development, testing, which together produce an increment of value.
Approaching the end goal by an iterative development and release approach and the integration of customer feedback from earlier releases to optimize the solution over time seems to be a bit far-fetched for some projects executed within the HR domain. However, it turned out to be very well possible. Deep dives with the target audience and ‘product demos’ helped us to continuously improve on the final solution in order to best serve the needs of the customers (in our case our employees).
Key take-aways and learnings
Most roads are not one-way. So, I gained a lot of experience during and after my assignment in HR. Therefore, let’s put a focus now on the learnings and skills I brought back from HR to the engineering world:

People focus: I was amazed of the honest interest my colleagues showed in what others do and what they specialize in, and their willingness to learn more about it and gather insights.
Diversity: Hereby I am not referring to gender diversity, as this looks a bit similar to engineering, however upside down ;). I enjoyed the diversity of backgrounds, personalities, and skillsets I found in the HR departments.
Curiosity in change: As described in the previous paragraph, I tried many new ways of working within the team and I was blown away by the low resistance and change management it required. Everyone was really open to change and happy to try out new approaches and react to feedback.
Collaboration: Not necessarily contributing to one specific business, I experienced a high-level of collaboration and exchange throughout the organization. Looking at Philips as part of a larger ecosystem helped me a lot to make decisions and drive projects with the bigger picture in mind.




Conclusions
One year, two worlds, and 1000s of learnings. That’s how I would summarize my experience going from software to HR and back. I hope this short blog post sheds light on how different disciplines can learn from each other, even if they seem far apart at first glance. On second thought, it might be these differences in the first place that create the opportunity to learn from each other. What do you think?

How to choose a startup accelerator — no matter what’s happening in the world,Yessi Bello Perez,2020/12/8,"
Accelerators form an integral part of many entrepreneurs’ journeys. By definition, an accelerator is a fixed-term program that usually lasts anything from three to 12 months. These programs offer a series of benefits, including education, mentoring, and networking. Some may offer investment to startups and on occasion, accelerators will take equity in the companies they accelerate.
With more than 7,000 of these programs spread out across the globe, entrepreneurs truly are spoilt for choice. But faced with this insane amount of possibilities, how are you supposed to choose the right one? It’s easy, focus on yourself. Hear what other startups have gained, how they’ve made the most of accelerators, and then choose the right program based on your current needs.

There are plenty of success stories that prove the extent to which accelerator programs can benefit a business. For example, the sharing economy giant Airbnb is arguably one of the most high-profile companies to have gone through a startup accelerator.
If you’re now at the stage of your business journey when you’re thinking about possibly joining an accelerator, it’s important to research the market and find a program that suits your business needs — just because a program has had success stories doesn’t automatically mean it’s the right fit for you.
No entrepreneur should enter into an accelerator program lightly; you need to really think about what will be expected of you as a participant and be clear on what you will personally get out of the program.
You also need to — given the current circumstances and business upheaval brought about by COVID-19 — consider whether it’s worth entering into a commitment of this magnitude during a global pandemic.

Before digging in
Now, it doesn’t take a genius to figure out that the best way to know what startups need and could get from accelerators is to speak to actual founders whose startups have gone through an accelerator. Luckily for me, TNW is a founding partner of the DMS accelerator program, and this meant I had easy access to a host of alumni who were able to share their experiences and insights.
Before we move on to this, though, it’s probably a good idea to share some context about the program and to help you get a better understanding of the journeys of the startups I spoke to.
Basically, Data Market Services is an equity-free program that aims to overcome growth obstacles facing startups operating within a fragmented European data market — helping founders with pain-points such as privacy law, intellectual property, and investment opportunities. It’s also worth pointing out that it’s funded by the European Commission. 
As part of the program, 50 startups receive free entrepreneurial training, acceleration, and mentoring for six months. Before the pandemic, 60% of the program took place online, with the remaining 40% spent attending startup events across Europe. Now it’s 100% online, meaning founders receive mentoring and the opportunity to promote their business and network with potential partners from the comfort of their own homes.
Then finally, the top 10 startups are invited to an exclusive DMS Bootcamp composed of workshops and mentoring sessions. All of this is recorded and businesses will walk away with a promotional video — which can be a cost-effective way to bolster marketing efforts.
But now let’s move on to the good stuff.
Signing on the dotted line: What you need to know
All in all, DMS seems to have struck a good balance for its cohort companies but founders still need to consider why they want to join the specific program before applying.
The thing to note here is that much of what you had to think about as a founder in the pre-COVID-19 era still applies:

Take time to ask yourself why you want to join a specific program. For example, are you just after brand-building opportunities or do you merely see it as an opportunity to show off in the industry? If it’s the latter, you should probably reconsider.
Don’t make the mistake of underestimating the commitment required from you and your team and once you’re clear on this make sure it fits around your other responsibilities. No one likes a distracted founder — and especially during times of uncertainty.
 If the program you’re interested in offers funding, it’s likely that the accelerator will like to see some type of return. Figure out who the investors are, what kind of portfolio they have, and why they’re interested in backing a business like yours.
Last, but by no means least, make sure you and the organizers are on the same page when it comes to success metrics. There’s absolutely no point in working together if you’re not working towards a common goal or objective. Your company is your baby so don’t jeopardize your growth.

First up, the classics: Networking and learning
Jörg Schädlich, co-founder of Memoresa, a Berlin-based platform seeking to make it easier for people to manage their digital estate, went into the DMS program with a clear objective in mind.
He says his company joined to make new contacts with investors, companies, partners, and other startups.
“We also wanted the possibility of having so many experts in the program to learn new skills in the coaching sessions and to get new input and ideas to help us achieve our goals,” he adds.
Things paid off for Memoresa. “Thanks to the helpful coaching sessions we got the chance to learn more about specific subject areas like fundraising, marketing strategies, or getting input about our business models,” noted Schädlich.
I’d say Schädlich and Memoresa is the classic approach, enter a program to get new connections to help you with challenges outside your strengths. But just having a goal isn’t enough, it also matters how you approach reaching it.
Whatever you do, don’t half-ass it
Mark Ferencvari, a co-founder of Inventori Solutions, a Hungary-based blockchain-powered smart logistics and supply chain platform, says the activities proved useful for his company.
In his case, the program helped him get a better understanding of his business operations and to make smarter strategic decisions with his team.
Good mentorship can spell the difference between success and failure. Being able to leverage the expertise of experts on the program proved incredibly valuable for Ferencvari.
“The more a founder interacts with the mentors, the more they can get out of this program,” said Ferencvari. Ultimately, it’s entirely down to you, the founder, to make the most out of the opportunity at hand.
Basically, you reap what you sow. It’s not enough just to show up, make sure you push for the results you’d like to see.
Stage what now?
Early-stage businesses often grapple with the same issues: finding product-market fit, getting access to paying customers, and finding investors willing to take a chance on a product with little, or no, traction. 
The challenges founders face during the early days are vastly different from those seen by entrepreneurs seeking to raise a Series B or scoping potential expansion markets.  
Mindful of this, Antonio Irusta, co-founder of SDX Network, a Madrid-based startup that leverages blockchain technology to analyze third-party data, joined the DMS accelerator because he wanted to get a vision of the different stages and actions required to scale a startup effectively. 
The mentorship he received during the program was priceless: “Having access to experts for one-on-one advice on how to achieve your business goals and execute in specific domains was essential in helping us grow.” 
So sit down and think about where your company is at and what are the most important challenges for you to solve now and what help do you need from the accelerator at this point.
[Read: Biggest challenges and opportunities of expanding a tech business across Europe]
For many, staying in business has been the main priority and while it may seem far-fetched to join an accelerator during such uncertain times, some would argue otherwise. 
Gonçalo Ribeiro, co-founder and CEO of YData, a Lisbon-based startup helping AI adopters improve and generate their data, believes the decision to join an accelerator during COVID-19 should take into consideration where the business is at. In a way, it seems the same pre-pandemic selection criteria still apply.
“It depends a lot on the accelerator,” he notes, adding “the founders should be aware of their company stage and what they are looking for in an accelerator.” 
For example, continues the founder, many accelerators focus heavily on business development, which might be suffering as a result of the pandemic. With this in mind, it’s important that founders refine their approach in order to choose the best program that meets their business needs at this particular moment in time.
Going online… a waste of time?
Like Ribeiro mentioned, you need to be aware if this is the right time for your startup to join an accelerator — and how it’s affected by the pandemic.
While going down the route of a traditional offline accelerator may provide more face-to-face interaction with stakeholders, there are also benefits to joining an online alternative.
Dr. Martin Dinov, the CEO and co-founder of Maaind, a London-based AI and neurotechnology startup seeking to improve mental wellbeing and cognitive performance, is quick to refute the idea that online programs are ineffective. 
“Online accelerators work too. The trick, more so than physical in-person programs, is to actively make an effort to reach out to the organizers and fellow attendees,” adds Dr. Dinov.
Credit: Daniel ReicheLike everything else, accelerators have had to move online. They’re still worth it though, you just need to be more proactive about following up and getting what you need.
It’s important to try and recreate the offline experience in a way that seems natural and organic.
Indeed, having some initial reservations about joining an online program is understandable but Javad Hatami — the CEO and co-founder of Builtrix, a Lisbon-based startup that helps companies understand and reduce energy consumption by analyzing their energy data — said it shouldn’t be a deterrent: “I believe the virtual format has enormous benefits for founders to learn at their own pace.”
Additionally, Hatami says that the program helped him understand the challenges that come with building and scaling a data-based startup and how to avoid these critical mistakes. 
On another note, and something that will surely prove helpful in the future, he says the accelerator helped him fine-tune his investor pitching skills.
So if you’re in an online program, don’t be afraid to initiate follow-ups and be proactive about getting more out of the mentors you come in contact with. Don’t think about whether anything might come across as awkward or too pushy — everybody has entered into this to help each other improve, so get the most out of it.
Time to take stock and act
To say that 2020 has been a challenging year for businesses across the globe would be a massive understatement and while the future remains uncertain there’s no denying that data will remain king across every industry. 
With this in mind, there’s never been a better time to take stock of your current business situation — and who knows — you might realize this is the perfect time for you and your company to join an accelerator to move forward.

"
The dos and don’ts of creating your product roadmap,Rajesh Nerlikar and Ben Foster,2020/12/7,"
You wouldn’t start a cross-country drive without a roadmap (or GPS), and neither should you attempt product development without one. 
A product roadmap is what connects the near-term product changes to the mid-term strategic milestones and the long-term vision. It communicates the sequencing of priorities and helps you plan all your product-based initiatives.
But many leaders are confused about what goes into a product roadmap. Ultimately, there is no right answer: different types of roadmaps suit different companies. 
They can show lots of detail or very little; they can be intentionally scrappy or highly organized with color-coding, iconography, team associations, and more. We’ve seen them printed on ten-foot-wide poster paper and contained on a simple Google Sheet. 
While there is no “best way of making a roadmap,” there are a few dos and don’ts that can guide you in crafting your roadmap document.
The dos of building a roadmap
Let’s start with the dos.
Do clearly categorize specific roadmap initiatives. Based on our experience, we’ve realized that all product development activities can be placed into one of three categories:

Innovation (making progress towards the vision)
Iteration (getting better results from what you’ve already built)
Operation (maintaining your product and running your business)

If possible, on top of categorizing each initiative, communicate the allocation target for each category to remind the audience the level of investment that was agreed upon.
Do paint a picture far enough in the future that it helps other teams to plan accordingly. For example, marketing may need to start working on communication plans for a large product release well in advance.
Do clarify the rationale behind the work you’re planning on doing. The problems you are solving, the value you are attempting to create, and the key outcomes you are trying to deliver are often more important than the features you currently intend to build.
Do leave room for plans to shift. Development timelines are notoriously difficult to predict in advance. As you experiment and validate assumptions through customer discovery, you will want to be able to react to what you learn, and the roadmap should allow for that.
The don’ts of building a roadmap
And now the don’ts, which are just as important as the dos.
Don’t try to predict development plans so far ahead that you’ll almost certainly change them before you get there. Offering this false precision is a common way to erode trust between product and the rest of the company.
Don’t worry about providing the same level of fidelity for every team. It’s okay for the roadmap to have a “ragged edge” in which some items are better understood than others, or some teams’ plans extend farther into the future than others.
Don’t make commitments that are unnecessary or that are unlikely to actually be met. Generally speaking, it’s better to avoid feature-date pairs unless there’s a specific business reason the date is as important as what actually ships.
Don’t get in the habit of playing roadmap Tetris to force as much in as possible. It’s far better to under-commit and over-deliver than vice versa, and you’ll need some buffer to accommodate the ripple effects when development doesn’t go according to plan or critical feedback comes in.
The dos and don’ts of communicating the roadmap
Building the roadmap is only the first step. After that, you need to share it with all the stakeholders. Here are some dos and don’ts for how to most effectively communicate your roadmap.
Do share it with your executives first, because if you get buy-in from leaders in the organization, they can help build agreement and excitement about its contents with the rest of the employees.
Don’t present it to the whole company at once. Each major group within the company will have different needs and concerns.
By presenting to each group separately, you can best address these needs and concerns and help everyone get what they need out of the presentation. We recommend having separate meetings for each of the following groups:

Engineering, QA, Architecture
Sales and marketing
Account management, customer success, and customer support
Everyone else not in those groups (HR, finance, etc.)

Don’t be boring. Your presentation quality matters tremendously, and it’s your job to make your presentation engaging. Use charts and other visuals.
Do create a system for answering questions and getting feedback. Some of this can be done in the presentation meetings. However, some people don’t feel comfortable asking questions or offering feedback in front of others, so also consider conducting anonymous surveys after the presentations.
One more do and don’t
We’ll leave you with one final do and one don’t.
Do dedicate the time and resources to creating a roadmap. It’s one of the most important documents guiding your company’s actions and initiatives.
But don’t stress about making a “perfect” roadmap. The best roadmaps evolve and develop with the company and serve to spark the right conversations about priorities.
Whether you opt to build a highly detailed, organized roadmap with color-coding and more, or a broader, intentionally rough one, following these dos and don’ts will help ensure that you craft and share your roadmap in an effective way.

These 3 companies are making the products you use everyday sustainable,Andrea Hak,2020/12/3,"
You may be a recycling freak, have an array of solar panels decorating your roof, and only buy green label clothing — but is there more you could be doing to tackle climate change?
Techleap.nl’s latest batch of Rise Programme participants are on a mission to help us speed up our transition to a truly sustainable society with cutting edge technology and new eco-friendly solutions.
We caught up with three of this year’s cohorts to find out how they’re bringing sustainability to the next level.
DyeCoo: Disrupting the way our clothes are made
Trending terms like fast fashion and conscious consumerism are clear indicators of the growing awareness of the negative impact the fashion industry has on our environment. But did you know that one of the biggest culprits is the process that gives us those vibrant shades of electric blue and ruby red?
The textile dyeing industry uses up enough fresh water every year to fill two million Olympic-sized swimming pools. It’s also the second-largest polluter of water (after agriculture), resulting in 20% of industrial water pollution across the globe. 
Micke Magnusson, CCO of Dutch scale-up DyeCoo, told TNW: “There is a sincere wish, not only from consumers, but also from institutions and producers to clean up and do what they can.”
The challenge is: How can we make it possible for people to change processes that have been in place for decades?
Dyecoo invented a new 100% water-free dyeing process that’s set to revolutionize the fashion industry. 
Born out of ground research conducted into the properties of CO2 at TU Delft University, the team made up of engineers, physicists, and material specialists developed machines that can pressurize reclaimed CO2, dissolving dyes deeply into fibers. The water-free process means:

No chemicals are required
Processing times are faster
Less energy is consumed
Best of all: No harmful water runoff 

For Magnusson, it’s way past time for an upgrade. “The machines that are running this industry are 25 plus years old. If we compare that to the cars we drive, in many countries diesel cars older than 2012 are not even allowed in cities anymore.” 
At the same time, this transition won’t be easy. Despite the long-term financial benefits that faster processing times and less energy consumption can bring to potential customers, the machines require a large initial investment which will take some time and convincing.
“We’re a super small Dutch company trying to change a global industry. So we need every support, visibility, push, and pull we can get,” Magnusson said. 
But he sees the current moving in the right direction. Having started his career in the midst of the IT bubble, he feels the same energy coursing through the ESG (Environmental Social and Corporate Governance) movement. 
“This is the next change in our industry. If you compare the sustainability movement with the IT movement, this is just as powerful. I see the same attraction to capital, talent, and business models all moving towards ESG. Now the current is there and it’s going to be very hard to fight against it.” 
Consumers are also playing a very important role in this transition. “If you compare the fashion industry with the food or pharmaceutical industry, today it’s normal to have nutritional information on food packaging. If you don’t disclose this information on a product, it won’t sell. I think the same will happen in the fashion industry,” Magnusson told TNW.
Solarge: Does green always equal good?
Solar panels have long been considered the epitome of sustainable living. Produce your own energy, lower your carbon footprint, and save money! Nothing could sound more like a win-win than that. 
But did you know that solar panels have a carbon footprint of their own?
Your typical solar panels are made from aluminum and glass, two materials that need to be heated at extremely high temperatures. It, therefore, takes roughly two years to offset the CO2 emitted during the production process. 
The second thing to consider is, what happens at the end of your solar panel’s lifecycle?
Traditional glass panels are very difficult to recycle, requiring a considerable amount of energy. And when they’re not disposed of properly, studies show that harmful chemicals can be soaked back into the ground.
This is a huge problem policymakers are only just beginning to grapple with. According to a study by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) there were already between  43,500-250,000 metric tons of solar panel waste in 2016. By 2050 this number is projected to grow to 78 million metric tons. 
Dutch startup Solarge was developed to address this relatively unknown dark side of the solar industry. 
Instead of using glass and aluminum, they’ve developed solar panels made of polymers which emit lower amounts of CO2 when manufactured. On top of that, they’re 50% lighter than their glass counterparts, meaning less energy is needed to transport them. In total, this equals 25% lower CO2 emissions than traditional solar panels.
And they’re 100% recyclable.
But, as CEO Jan Vesseur explained, “There’s very limited awareness of this problem. When you think of solar, you think green and you automatically think good. But what you see today is that the carbon footprint behind solar panels is only just starting to become of interest.”
Unfortunately, the market is now flooded with cheaper but less environmentally friendly solar panels coming from countries where there are fewer environmental regulations. As one study by Northwestern University found, solar panels made in China typically have a higher carbon footprint than those made in Europe. 
“In the solar industry, most people just want the cheapest option,” Vasseur said.
Government incentives targeted specifically at solar panels made with low carbon footprints could really help to change the game. “Unfortunately, in the Netherlands this still isn’t the case so we’re trying to lobby for that now,” Vesseur said.
And this change better happen soon. “Just to give you some perspective, the Dutch Government’s target for 2050 is to reach more than 600 square kilometers of solar panels. Now, imagine that every year 10 percent of those panels need to be replaced. That’s 60 million square meters of solar panels that will have to be recycled every year.”
But Vesseur is positive about Solarge’s potential. Along with the environmental benefits that their panels will provide, the fact that they’re so lightweight makes them much easier to mount on roofs, providing even more opportunities to maximize space. For example, farmers could easily mount solar panels on the roofs of sheds or other existing structures, creating extremely profitable second revenue streams.
And the future possibilities are endless. 
“In the future we will see a lot more prefabricated housing elements and our goal is, wherever possible, to try to include a solar skin to it. And this doesn’t necessarily have to be on roofs, it could be on facades, sheds, carports, etc. There are so many upcoming opportunities to use solar on a grand scale, but we should do so in the most environmentally responsible way,” Vesseur said.
Felyx: Changing the way we move
If you live in the Netherlands, there’s no doubt you’ve seen or even hopped on the back of one of Felyx’s dark green electric mopeds. 
Felyx was originally created to solve a very common consumer problem: how to easily get from A to B in a city. But the founders soon realized their idea would help to solve a wider issue being faced by municipalities: How can we keep cities mobile as populations grow?
As co-founder Quinten Selhorst told TNW:
There’s so much pollution due to the current transportation methods. And, if we look towards the future, this problem is only going to get bigger because more people are moving to cities. This means pressure on public spaces is also increasing because more people will live in a smaller area. Initiatives like the Paris Climate Agreement are putting even more pressure on municipalities to find new solutions to combat air pollution fast.
But Felyx is helping to raise the bar on sustainable transportation in three very important ways: 

It’s a fully electric company. Not only are their mopeds electric, the service vans they use to swap out batteries also run on electricity. 
They’re providing an alternative for people who use taxis, cars, and gas-powered mopeds, particularly for cross-city commuters who would normally have to sit in traffic and then spend time trying to find a parking space. “Now over 20% of all our rides start and end at the train station. This means that more people are using Felyx combined with the train because it’s cheaper and faster than going by car,” Selhorst told TNW.
They’re helping to change habits and behaviors. 

“Instead of people owning their own vehicles, we’re helping people to move towards ride-sharing. This way we have fewer resources that are needed to accommodate more people. Compare one shared e-moped that rides 10 times a day to one person who rides maybe two times a day.”
And with major cities across Europe having introduced plans to ban all diesel vehicles from city centers by 2030, Felyx certainly has room to keep growing. 
Selhorst shared that the company’s future sights are set on expansion, both within Benelux (where they’re already a market leader) and internationally. In fact, for any micro-mobility fans out there the Felyx team is now looking to fill some key senior positions which will aid in their expansion to Germany and France. Check out more on their website. 
It’s time for change
Greenwashing and lip service aren’t going to get us anywhere. It’s time to take a deeper look at how our industries operate, how our products are made, and the impact our daily activities have on the environment. 
As Magnusson said, “If you want to make a change you need to be bold. The word change tends to have a positive connotation but it means that you actually need to sacrifice something. So what are you willing to sacrifice? That’s the question we need to ask ourselves when we want to drive change forward. Change is up to you. If you want change, prove it!” 
And Dutch innovation could just be the impetus we need to drive change. As Veasseur explained:
I think the Techleap.nl concept is a very important initiative for getting attention for what we’re doing in a small country like the Netherlands. We have one of the best R&D in the world, we have great companies and institutions that come up with fantastic new ideas but we’re not so great at marketing and selling them.
If you think about it, a lot of things like Wifi and Bluetooth were actually invented here but they were then picked up by US companies. So I think it’s very important that the Netherlands gets the right buzz around our technology.
"
Is now the worst time to launch a new brand? These companies are doing it anyway,Rebecca Bellan,2020/12/2,"
Well, that depends on the brand. If you’re launching an intimate wine bar or an international travel app, then you may want to rethink your business model. 
But even in the midst of a global pandemic and a recession, some brands have decided to launch. The ones that have been successful with their launches have recognized the shift in supply and demand, focusing on providing essential goods or structuring their businesses in a digital-first model. 
“What COVID has done has been to accelerate trends that were already starting throughout the globe,” said Jonathan Goodman, COO of Polestar, a luxury electric vehicle, during his TNW2020 keynote (which you can watch at the bottom of the article!). “Three months of lockdown at home showed that working from home was feasible and practical, and at the same time raised a question over the need to go back to being in the office.”
Goodman pointed out the crisis has triggered a tremendous acceleration in the digital transformation of the global economy, from healthcare to food deliveries and more. In fact, IBM’s U.S. Consumer Retail Index, published in August, found the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift to e-commerce by up to five years. 
How some brands are winning in this space
Brands launching during the crisis are likely doing so with an eye to what a pandemic economy values, and what a post-pandemic economy will value. 
1. Essential goods and intelligent marketing FTW
According to a recent McKinsey & Company report, the most successful brands fall within the homebody or essentials category, and there’s been a 20-40% decrease in discretionary spending. At the same time, digital spending has jumped during the pandemic up to 50%, and consumers intend to spend online even after the pandemic.
Wellness brands are also seeing a boost during the pandemic, particularly those that have to do with mental health. WSL Strategic Retail, a marketing consultant, finds that Millennials and Gen Z are more likely to turn to apps to help with anxiety and stress or for affordable wellness options. 
“What this pandemic has revealed is that taking care and control of your own health — individual, family, home, etc. — is even more critical than before,” WSL CEO Wendy Liebmann said in an interview with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
In addition, when consumers do choose to use their money for discretionary spending, they often want to shop sustainably. Many consumers see this as a time to reset our values and to help our fellow human by buying off locally produced or greener products.  
“While purchases are currently centered on the most basic needs, people are shopping more consciously, buying local and are embracing digital commerce,” according to a COVID-19 Consumer Goods and Services report from Accenture, professional services agency. 
So if your company fits both the current needs of the market and the desires of it, then go for it and launch! But if you can’t find the right angle, it might be best to postpone until things settle down a bit. 
2. Rethinking the business model 
New businesses have the chance to set the tone in the post-pandemic world. Everything will be done differently, so a brand that launches during the pandemic will have an edge over legacy companies that now have to shift their business models entirely.
“[The pandemic] has forced companies to change, and even abandon their legacy mindsets,” Goodman said during his keynote. “So is this the worst possible year to launch the car and the brand? Absolutely not.”
Polestar is a standalone electric performance car brand that’s got a digital-first model and a direct consumer approach. 
“We are a brand that’s not weighed down by the legacy that affects the car industry,” said Goodman. “What that means is that we’ve been free to imagine our route to market, enabling us to be hugely adaptable to the changing circumstances.”
The shift to e-commerce has benefited Polestar as one of the only car companies on the market that offers customers the ability to interact with the brand completely online if they want — from learning more about the electric vehicle to choosing a style to having it delivered to your home. 
3. Cashing in on timing
Not only has Polestar been able to leverage its digital strategy to achieve success in launching this year, but it’s launching its star car, the Polestar 2, right at the moment when the whole car industry is starting to move into electric vehicles. 
“Governments are accelerating the move to a zero-emission environment, paving the way of the continued growth of an already dynamic electric vehicle segment,” said Goodman. Additionally, more people are planning national road trips and are wary of public transit, but they still want to be green and travel responsibly. 
Another example of a brand that got the timing right is Neverland, an accessible e-commerce plant and gardening marketplace that found its inception during the pandemic. 
In an attempt to brighten up their small apartments (and now offices) during the shelter-in-place orders, Neverland’s founders discovered that buying indoor plants is no easy feat. One either had to purchase from a conventional superstore or an over-priced boutique. 
When Neverland launches officially in September, it’ll be offering organic seed kits for easy-to-grow indoor herbs and veggies with a mobile app for iOS and Android, cashing in on the fact that more people will continue to be working from home and, coming into winter, will want a life-affirming project to get their hands dirty with. Having an app to guide you through the green-thumb process is also a major perk.
4. The freedom to pioneer and build from the ground up
During a pandemic-recession, there’s less money going around to invest in companies and competitors. But that can be a good thing for brands launching this year. 
According to Tim Chen, CEO of NerdWallet, a company that started up during the Great Recession in 2008, “…you’re actually better off slowing down and building a good foundation and thinking about efficiency and scaling efficiently rather than just optimizing for speed and then scaling as quickly as possible.”
New brands that are operating in emerging industries not only don’t have to worry about as many competitors, but they also are able to focus more completely on developing their offerings. 
“Unlike the rest of the industry, we don’t have any legacy models to maintain over the next few years,” said Polestar’s Goodman. “One of the biggest challenges that’s going to face the traditional OEMs is how do they move into electrification without alienating the buyers of their petrol and diesel cars? We don’t have this problem. We’re 100% electric, and able to focus on this entirely and with all our passion.”
5. Giving the people what they want in this economy
Essential goods, sustainable sourcing, affordable health-focused products, e-commerce. These are all ways that brands are altering their products for a new mindset. But with a little creativity, there are other ways brands can meet the demands of a modern consumer. 
To take the Polestar example again, we’ve already mentioned that the entire experience of buying a Polestar 2 can be completely contactless if the customer so wishes. But there are other neat features to this car that make it a truly premium offering. 
For example, the Polestar 2 is integrated with Google’s apps and services that links customers to their Google accounts, Google maps, Spotify and any other app. With a voice recognition system that actually works, there’s a functionality in this car that’s unique and much sought-after. Other perks include a more intimate and easily accessible showroom experience, as well as same-day maintenance that doesn’t require you to leave your home or office.  
Customers in today’s economy are also more willing to try out new brands, according to the McKinsey report. “With continued pressure on household income, customers are trying new brands and channels, seeking both better value and convenience. For the upcoming holiday seasons, more than half of consumers plan to shop at different retailers than last year, with concern for safety being the most important reason driving this change.”
If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere
It’s a bold move to launch a brand during the pandemic, but the risk is what can make it so exciting. Think of it this way: A company born successfully during a pandemic or a recession will not only have excellent street cred, but it will also have the longest time to go until the next global crisis!

7 surprising ways startups can take advantage of a city’s resources,Rebecca Bellan,2020/12/2,"
Any city that calls itself a “startup city” should provide a range of resources for startups to utilize. In metropolises around the world, local ecosystems are dedicating their resources to helping new businesses thrive, from small businesses to scale ups. 
Figuring out how your local government can help you — as well as where to start — can be daunting. We spoke with Bas Beekman, the Director of StartupAmsterdam, on how companies can tap into their city’s resources, from government grants and funds to networks and workspaces. 
1. Seek out entrepreneurship organizations 
A startup city will undoubtedly have organizations that are dedicated to helping startups meet the right people, gain new skills, scale, and grow. Be on the lookout for accelerators or incubators that can provide you with a community, connections to potential investors, and experienced mentors.
While you’re at it, have a look at what coworking spaces exist in your city. Often, local governments want to encourage entrepreneurs to innovate in their city, so they’ll carve out neighborhoods or buildings to provide a hub for startups to work side by side. Coworking spaces provide businesses with a built-in network, people to chat with at the nitro cold brew tap about ideas, strategies, advice, potential collabs, and more. 
You’ll usually be able to find your niche depending on the market you’re looking to enter, whether that’s FinTech or cybersecurity, SaaS or agriculture. And the great thing about these spaces is that they often host startup and tech events or meetup groups. Which brings us to our next point…
2. Get out there and network
The whole point of an ecosystem is that the many parts of a whole work together to create a functional system, so attending events and expanding your circle is one of the best ways to engage. Some cities make it easier than others. 
Amsterdam, for example, ranks very high in Connectedness on StartupGenome’s Global Startup Ecosystem Report due to the Netherlands’ logistical and social connectedness to the world. But within the city itself, Amsterdam has a reputation for being a city with the most meetups, events, and workshops in Europe, right up there with larger cities like Berlin and London. 
“I think that’s one of the strengths of Amsterdam,” said Bas Beekman, Director of StartupAmsterdam. “Everyone is always helping each other by organizing events and sharing knowledge. It’s a very small, dense city. I always say everyone is just a coffee away.”
If you’re lucky enough to be situated in a city that’s walkable and has excellent mobility, like Amsterdam, take advantage of it. Beekman also says the Dutch capital is a true cosmopolitan city, in that no matter where you’re from, it’s easy to really take part in the city and become an accepted citizen, especially since the Dutch speak English almost as a first language. 
“The city itself is an extra resource,” said Beekman. 
Of course, social gatherings are not as feasible during a pandemic, but it still pays to be in a city that continues to find a way to connect with the local ecosystem, even virtually. For example, the City of Amsterdam and Startupbootcamp recently co-launched a fully digital learning and community platform called Amsterdam Squared, which is allowing the startup ecosystem to live on. 
3. Don’t forget to check out government resources
In Silicon Valley, the government largely stays out of the private sector, especially in the tech space. Laissez-faire capitalism is the American way. Not so much in Europe, where the public and private sectors often work together for the good of the industry. In Europe this collaboration isn’t framed as intervention, but rather as a crucial part of the ecosystem. 
Again, Amsterdam is a great example of such collaborations. StartupAmsterdam is a City of Amsterdam initiative to bring the public and private sectors together in order to support the startup ecosystem in a sustainable way, helping the city to become a major global player. 
Beekman recommends that startups just opening up shop in Amsterdam or looking to move to the city get in contact with his team or with the Amsterdam Business Department from the get go. The government wants to welcome startups into the city by helping them find a location and connecting them to peers. StartupAmsterdam even offers a rough guide to connecting to the startup ecosystem in the city.
Checking in with government departments like Startup Amsterdam is a great first step.
4. Connect with universities, researchers, and other educational institutions operating in your area
Any startup city worth its salt has a good talent pipeline, funneling some of the best and brightest in tech from educational institutions directly to startups and larger tech companies. Universities and research organizations alone are great not just for talent, but also for resources that may help move your startup along. 
Amsterdam is a small city with under a million residents, yet it has a reputation for excellence and innovation, which is why a lot of big tech companies from the United States, like Netflix, Tesla, and Booking.com, have offices or headquarters there. 
“One of the reasons these bigger tech companies are coming to Amsterdam is because of the abundance of talent,” said Beekman. “We are really focused on educating more talent with many programs, but we also try to make sure that the connection between the tech companies and the knowledge institutes is strong and collaborative.”
According to the StartupGenome report, Amsterdam ranked very high in Life Sciences Talent, which means it has excellent access to high-quality STEM students and graduates. The Dutch capital offers a range of programs and academies for everything startup-related, from coding and data science to entrepreneurship. 
For example, the founder of the Dutch navigation technology company TomTom created CODAM College, a tuition-free school where anyone can learn how to code, in order to help boost the next generation of developers.
5. Find the right resources for women or minority-led founders
Many startup ecosystems are actively working on creating a more diverse startup landscape, and that includes encouraging women and minority-led founders to succeed. Look out for collaborations of VC firms to achieve this aim. 
Currently, only 2% of all Dutch VC capital is invested in female-founded or female co-founded companies. VC collaborations #FundRight is hoping to change this, and is aiming for a funding ecosystem that includes 35% women by 2023. 
And in light of the pandemic, which threatens much of the progress women have made in the professional realm, a new global program has recently been introduced to support female startup founders. The Female Founder Program, a collaboration between the Founder Institute’s Amsterdam —Silicon Valley Virtual 2021 Program and WomenTech Network, aims in part to establish Amsterdam as a center for women-led innovation.  
Aside from local networks and initiatives, keep an eye out for international networks like Women in AI, which has a strong presence in Amsterdam, or Black Young Professionals Network, which is based in the United Kingdom but advances its cause across Europe. 
6. Identify the VC funds and angel investors 
Typically by engaging in your local ecosystem, you’re already likely to meet potential investors. Rich cities with a diversity of industries are great places to find customers, as well, for the service or product your startup is offering.
But try to pay attention to where there’s already plenty of funding, and what industries are on the rise. Is FinTech big in your city? Maybe Digital Health is the next big thing that VCs are looking to invest in. Does your city boast a big creative scene? Perhaps you might try to connect with VCs that work in SaaS. 
Look out for a tool that will help you find the right investors for you, like Startup Amsterdam’s “Find your next investor” matching tool.
7. Public data is an untapped resource
One thing technology companies always need is data. Rather than paying for it or trying to collect it all yourself, why not see what is publicly available? Cities constantly collect data on everything from transport and maps to IoT and demographics. They visualize it in a way that’s comprehensive, and they’ll often provide you with the csv file to download and utilize as you see fit. 
While offering up better and more comprehensive datasets, cities are also aiming to become more transparent about how they use data and AI. Both Amsterdam and the City of Helsinki launched an open AI register, which allows anyone to see how the cities use data and AI, and also to contribute to the datasets.

3 ways leaders should pursue breakthrough innovation during a crisis,Tim Scott,2020/12/2,"
The COVID-19 pandemic has become an innovation accelerator, igniting a wave of creative problem-solving within organizations in every industry. Resilient companies have quickly adapted to changing market needs and trends and have engaged in continuous learning to survive. But to truly succeed and rise above competitors, companies must embrace “breakthrough innovation.”
What is breakthrough innovation? It’s a new way of attacking an old problem that leads to products or services that can fundamentally change the outlook of a business, industry, or market. Typically, it’s not a single solution but rather the cumulative result of sustained, incremental attempts. 
Some examples of companies that drive breakthrough innovation include SpaceX, the leader in commercial space; Airbnb, which expanded the hospitality industry’s capabilities; and Salesforce, an organization that changed management and client relation software through emerging trends in technology.
In the modern business environment, breakthrough innovation is no longer solely the mandate of research and development departments. Rather, it’s something that technology businesses must weave into the fabric of their organizations or risk becoming obsolete. 
It may be tempting to slow down innovation efforts during the pandemic, but this is the best time to double down. There’s no risk of rocking the proverbial boat if the storm has already hit.
Time for a change
In the midst of heightened uncertainty, technology business leaders are often inclined to place their primary focus on operations as they look to cut costs and maximize profit margins. However, it’s exactly these circumstances in which innovation should become a strategic priority.
The constraints and pressures that accompany uncertain times can reveal new opportunities and challenges that force teams to think differently. The most successful companies — the ones that emerge stronger after crises — reject the status quo and adopt an antifragile mindset. They see opportunity in the face of failure and defeat.
For example, leading up to the Great Recession, Ford was plagued by toxic internal politics that hampered its core automaking function. In 2007, the company’s executive chairman, Bill Ford Jr., was forced to pledge the iconic Ford oval as collateral for a financing package that would help the company survive. 
This risk inspired a renewed focus on innovation that helped the company regain its position as an industry leader. Without the threat presented by the financial crash, Ford likely would’ve continued to stagnate.
Times of uncertainty call for more risk-taking. I once had a client who was on the edge of rolling out a solution that could save their clients time and money and greatly contribute to an improved operating environment. As they began to roll it out, an unexpected event shut down operations for everyone in the industry for a significant length of time. 
Rather than closing down shop, the client took this period to redouble their efforts and make the next level of improvement to the innovation. When their operations resumed, they had advanced far beyond any competitors.
To see a similar success story, you must emphasize transformation over restriction. You can do this by following the three-step journey for breakthrough innovation:
Step #1: Strengthen your core business
Like Bill Ford Jr., you should navigate the current crisis by focusing on what your company does best. As you evaluate your core competencies, try to identify inefficiencies you could eliminate with technology. These are the types of resource sinkholes discoverable in every organization — within supply chains, production processes, project workflows, etc. — if you just look hard enough.
Most leaders probably don’t have to look that hard to find aspects of their technology businesses that could be improved. They know exactly where the problems are, but actually addressing these problems isn’t risk-free. Technology solutions don’t always yield immediate ROI, and some never pan out, making them far less palatable when resources are already tight.
But if you’re already in the midst of a storm, there may be little left to lose. If there’s a chance you can come out on top and shape the future of your industry, why wouldn’t you rock the boat? 
Evaluate which three to five changes would improve your technology business offerings or workflows the most. Once you’ve narrowed down some possibilities, rank them by risk. Select two — one with high risk and one with low risk — to explore further.
Step #2: Uncover new opportunities and potential solutions
Every enduring crisis creates new problems, forcing changes to our daily routines. Some of these changes are temporary, but others are profound and permanent. They might seem alarming at first, but it all depends on your perspective. Do you consider the changes crises or opportunities?
If you’re searching for areas to apply new ways of thinking, start with new problems. Tackle challenges associated with the abrupt shift to remote work or the response to COVID-19, for instance, to practice creative problem-solving. Some of the solutions you devise during these exercises might actually be viable (or even profitable).
Additionally, emerging technologies such as blockchain, AI, machine learning, cloud computing, quantum computing, 5G, virtual and augmented reality, nanorobotics, and many other fields are ripe for breakthrough innovation. If you brainstorm a way to incorporate these technologies into your solutions, you might discover and create new products, services, or business models.
Step #3: Make innovation an organization-wide objective
Everyone on your team would understand if you decided to cut back on investments in research and development, new technology, and new personnel during the pandemic. There’s a chance you already have. After all, you need to survive this crisis.
But a survival mindset won’t drive breakthrough innovation. Fearing failure and disruption during tumultuous times will set you back further because it’ll prevent you from pivoting accordingly. Instead, take up an antifragile mindset and promote innovation companywide. Challenge every team member to think differently about strategies and processes. Now is not the time to say, “We’ve always done it this way.”
I worked with a group that had a strong technical solution for their customers’ problems that was well-regarded in their industry. However, the industry was soon disrupted by new challenges and a demand for more flexibility. 
The group retracted into the apparent safety of its existing solutions instead of embracing the risk and demanding territory for successful innovation. As a result, they saw customer engagement plateau as their customers looked elsewhere for more innovative solutions.
Make sure your entire team knows what your goal is and how to work toward it. This is especially important now, when most of your workforce is likely remote. Clearly communicate your objectives and invest in the training, personnel, and collaboration tools your team needs to actualize them. Don’t try to control or centralize their efforts. It won’t be perfect, but action is what matters most.
Eventually, the pandemic will dissipate. Don’t let the fear of rocking the boat be an excuse to ignore the pursuit of innovation. If you do, you might find that once the storm passes, the “next normal” won’t be as easy to navigate.

3 cliché pieces of startup advice I never want to hear again,Jason VandeBoom,2020/12/1,"
There’s certainly no shortage of advice on how to build and grow a startup. From keeping an insanely packed, no-sleep schedule like Jack Dorsey’s to putting your entire social life on hold, it seems that there’s “wisdom” around every corner.
But I’ve learned through my own experience that, despite the volume of advice out there, much of it isn’t all that useful in most cases. No single nugget of insight will make or break your business. Instead, the secret to success is learning how to follow your gut about what feels right for you, your customers, and your team.
Despite what some advisors might say, there is no “proven” path to success. And over the last 17 years, I’ve encountered lots of bad advice along the way. Here’s some of the worst:
1. Choose VC funding or bootstrap; there is no in-between
Many experts push entrepreneurs to take funding as early as possible. It is sadly seen as some sort of validation. But, this can quickly backfire, forcing you to focus exclusively on growth, expand too fast, and lose sight of delivering what is truly needed and differentiated in your market. 
On the flip side, others will say to bootstrap all the way, that the gritty, buck-the-system approach keeps you true to your roots.
The right answer for many can be somewhere in the middle, and timing is everything. That’s why my company waited 13 years (not a typo) to pursue our first round of funding and another four for a $100 million Series B. 
After years of bootstrapping, I was confident in our vision, our culture, and our product offering. I had a proven formula, a solid market footprint, and we were ready to grow. 
Had we pushed for funding early on, I fear we may have not let enough time pass for our direction to truly be identified. Instead, we kept our bootstrap mentality but took on some funding to grow when the timing was right. 
The better advice is to embrace the best elements of funding and bootstrapping in a way that works for you — it doesn’t have to be one or the other (despite the industry obsession with funding as a signifier of growth and validation — which it is not).
2. Don’t invest in customer support early on 
I get it: customer support is expensive, and some incorrectly think that product-led growth means the product solving things versus people solving things. In fact, many treat customer support as a cost center and even place it inside their finance department, which tells you a lot about their priorities. 
Aiming for quick wins and faster time to revenue, they instead prioritize customer acquisition, but as we all know, it’s so much more costly to add new customers than it is to keep the ones you already have.
In fact, many advisors say that building a customer success program is only appropriate once you’ve secured enterprise-level clients, but customer support has always been our top priority from day one, and it’s worked out very well to our advantage. 
When I first launched ActiveCampaign in college, I handled every customer inquiry myself. I didn’t care if it was a $30 order, I’d spend hours making sure that customer got what they needed. And I saw early on what a huge difference it made in retention. 
So, when I expanded from my solo operation, I made it a priority to invest in wowing our customers and keeping them extraordinarily happy, which has become an essential strategy as we defied conventional wisdom. We listen to what our customers need and have subsequently identified many of the pain points people experience historically in our market. 
We solved a number of those pain points by offering free onboarding, implementation, and training for our platform and free strategy sessions. Most of our competitors charge for those things, and it’s become a huge differentiator for us that’s really paid off in customer loyalty.
3. Pick one thing and do it really well
You’ll hear a lot of startup advice that’s basically some version of “focus on one thing.” This may work out for some companies that offer a single consumer product, but if I had followed this advice, I never would’ve made the pivot from on-premise software to SaaS. 
That switch was one of the driving factors behind my company’s growth and came from throwing the old plan away and starting a new one.
The problem with a hyper-focused approach is that, like it or not, change happens — sometimes unbelievably fast. If the last nine months have taught us anything, it’s that agility is essential, and if your strategy is to “stay the course,” when the inevitable chaos happens, you can’t adapt. 
The idea of staying focused is well-intended to help smooth out some of the chaos of rapid growth. But when my team followed this advice, it stifled our innovation and took us several quarters to get back on track and make progress again. We have found peak innovation by pursuing multiple paths with a mindset of proving the validity of each.
Change forces us to be innovative, nimble, and creative, so you’re better off embracing it. Our team enjoys their work much more when they have the freedom and confidence to tackle new challenges, and it’s a powerful motivator that keeps us pushing forward. 
Entrepreneurs, by nature, are driven by disruption — they want to challenge the status quo. When you ignore those instincts to adhere to some cookie-cutter model of what a startup should do, your business will quickly become stale, stagnant, and stuck.
The best advice
Ultimately, one of the best pieces of advice I ever received is to learn to be OK with not being like everyone else, with not following the typical script and doing things in your own time with your own approach. 
When so many startups come and go, and only a relative few survive, it’s easy to believe that there’s some kind of secret playbook — a singular right way to do it that guarantees success because it worked for all the others that made it.
In reality, the best advice is to ignore all the advice. Stop watching your competitors and other “successful” companies thinking they have some secret answer. Listen to your instincts and your customers. They’ll tell you the right thing to do.

The long-term impacts COVID-19 will have on startups seeking capital,Built In,2020/11/30,"
This article was written by Salvatore Minetti and originally published on Built In.
The world of venture capital has certainly not been immune to the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
But despite the scale and breadth of the disruption, many startups and fledgling companies have discovered new and inventive ways to adapt. Indeed, many have found themselves having to pivot their offering, or shifting their business strategy to ensure that they still secure capital to fund their projects.
Others have been even luckier. For some companies, the pandemic has actually prompted a renewed interest in their business and opened up a field of promising new opportunities. Whether it is digitized customer channels and workflows, or real-time tracking and traceability tools, the crisis has created the need for pioneering solutions, and venture capitalists (VCs) have been paying attention.
[Read: How to build a search engine for criminal data]
No doubt, COVID-19 has presented many challenges to investors. But although there were concerns earlier this year about fundraising and market disruption, the crisis has not shaken underlying confidence. On the contrary, new data shows that funds raised in 2020 have already surpassed the total in 2019. According to a report from PitchBook and the National Venture Capital Association, U.S. venture capital funds raised $56.6 billion as of September 30, compared to the $54.9 raised in all of 2019.
With the promise of new solutions on the horizon and the consolidation of capital continuing to grow larger, emerging companies and the VC ecosystem have shown great resilience throughout such unsettling times.
Globally, we are likely to face further disruption yet in the coming months. As such, business leaders and investors alike will be wondering: What will the long-term impact of the virus be for companies in search of capital?
Sector focus
Understandably, the shift of focus toward pandemic-proof business models and solutions that can help us live alongside the virus might be troubling for some businesses in the long run. Some sectors, like those involving travel or hospitality technology, are likely to face further roadblocks.
Given the current situation, businesses that can sell and offer support virtually will have an obvious and immediate appeal for VCs. But these businesses were always an attractive prospect for investors, and the virus seems only to have accelerated the trend.
Founders should therefore expect to see further VC investment directed toward deep tech startups and organizations that promise profitability in the new normal. They will be on the lookout for long-term survivors that they can steer to sustained success; namely, companies that present clear solutions to modern challenges in the COVID era. Sectors such as biotech, fintech, e-commerce, and cybersecurity software have all been cast into the spotlight.
Investor appetite
While investment activity did slow in the initial period of paralysis at the beginning of the pandemic, it is important to keep in mind that the pace and size of equity investments has remained strong. Indeed, demand for technologies that look to have a big impact by building new infrastructures is exploding, in part driven by the increasing availability of capital and reducing tech barriers to entry.
So, while early-stage funding rounds will still happen, significant emphasis will be placed on cost control and capital efficiency, as well as a plan to conserve cash, as downturns last longer than expected. As such, burgeoning startups in particular would do well to look to venture builders to secure funding, as well as the tools, advice, and network necessary to launch and grow their business.
Will investors become more aggressive on their terms?
Over the last decade, I have noticed that cleaner and simpler terms have increasingly become a norm in the venture investment process. This has been advantageous for all involved and has created more alignment between entrepreneurs and VCs. Using COVID as a backdrop, however, it would be fair to assume that some VCs will now be looking to impose fewer founder-friendly terms in an attempt to de-risk the investment process.
While startups should expect some readjustments as a result of the crisis, it is unlikely that there will be a full-scale return to complicated venture capital term sheets, as bad behavior will likely damage the reputation of investors in the long run.
From my recent experience, founders know their value, and if terms appear to be inequitable, then startups will simply walk away and look for an alternative partner — ideally, one that is able to help them de-risk their offering, rather than merely point out those risks.
The impact of remote working
The pandemic has also seen workforces all around the world trade in their office desks for their kitchen tables — and this has been no different for investors.
While there may have been initial concerns about the potential for mentorship, or the impact on closing deals without the possibility of meeting in person, from a purely mechanical perspective, most VCs have adapted neatly to the changing environment. Whether that is communicating with founders, or completing valuations, remote working has enabled investors largely to continue their business as usual.
Ultimately, even though working from home practices are set to remain the standard procedure for quite some time, VC trends are likely to continue going forward, with an overall increase in the remote mentoring of portfolio companies. Founders should become accustomed to this new process, if they’re not already, and find ways, like streamlining communication, to continue to successfully readjust.
While the VC landscape has endured some substantial change to cope with the pandemic, it is clear that activity is still strong. After all, crises often drive the need for innovation.

What the hell is the Pomodoro Technique and why is it good for productivity?,Yessi Bello Perez,2020/11/27,"
I’ve been covering tech and business for years and I can confirm most people in these spaces, myself included, are obsessed with productivity… particularly new shiny ways to magically become more productive.
Just like in fashion, you can see long-forgotten productivity fads return every few years, and even though it’s been around for a while, you’ve probably recently come across the hot new contender: the Pomodoro Technique.
There’s just one problem with this latest productivity hack — my editor doesn’t quite get it, and appears to be too stubborn to read up on it to understand it.
So let me answer a few of his ‘poignant’ questions and give you a low-down of this great productivity method. It’s no silver bullet but I saw quite a few people talk about it online recently, so I thought I’d give it a go.
[Read: How to build a search engine for criminal data]
“What the hell does it have to do with tomatoes?!”
When I first brought this to my editor, he seemed very confused.
As we are both working from home, he from Amsterdam and me from London, I had to make do with staring at his slightly bemused expression during one of our video calls.
Understandably, he thought I’d gone off on a tangent and had decided to pitch him a story about eating spaghetti infused with tomato sauce in order to boost my productivity.
I get the feeling neither of us is averse to pasta but I had to recover relatively quickly and explain that I was in fact talking about a well-established productivity method that just happened to be named after an edible berry.
[Read: Why this security engineer loves working in infosec]
‘Pomodoro’ does mean tomato in Italian, but it refers to the tomato-shaped kitchen timer the technique’s creator, Francesco Cirillo, used.
The timer is an essential part of the Pomodoro Technique, which Cirillo created in the late ‘80s during his university years. 
It’s a time management method based on 25-minute work intervals, that are then separated by a small break. Each interval is then called a ‘pomodoro’, referring to the tomato timer Cirillo had back in uni — cute, right?
Credit: iStaunchAll hail the magical solution to productivity!!!
“Hmm, fine — but what’s so good about it then?”
The beauty of the technique is in its simplicity. To stick to this time management technique, you only have to follow six basic steps:

Choose the task you want to tackle: This can be something big or simply something you’ve been wanting to do for a while. The only thing you need to bear in mind is that this task should get your full, undivided attention.
Set the timer to 25 minutes and promise yourself that you’ll spend this time fully committed to this specific task.
Work on the task until the timer rings. If for whatever reason you realize you need to do something else, write it down on a sheet of paper but avoid getting distracted.
When the timer rings, cross your task off your list and pat yourself on the back for you’ve just completed your first ever pomodoro.
Take a break. Once you’ve completed your task, take a short break. Don’t spend it at your desk, though, get up, walk around, grab yourself a drink. You get the idea.
Once you’ve completed four pomodoros, you can take a longer break. Aim for either 20 or 30 minutes. Your brain will use this time to assimilate new information and rest before the next round of Pomodoros.

I have to be honest with you: I haven’t actually bothered to get myself a tomato timer. Shameful, I know. Instead, I’ve just given this a go using the stopwatch on my iPhone and by setting alarms every 25 minutes. But if that’s not doing it for you, there are also loads of online timers you can use.
In my opinion, this method is appealing for several reasons. Firstly, it allows me to plan ahead, giving myself clear visibility on all the tasks I need to complete on a given day.
Secondly, it means that I schedule regular breaks — and isn’t this what productivity experts always say one must do?
Thirdly, I really like the idea of spending short bursts on a particular task or project. It makes the working day far less monotonous and actually helps me concentrate more effectively.
More importantly, it’s given me yet another chance to get away from odious to-do lists, which in my opinion, are an unimaginative way to help one remember what needs to be done but do little in the way of prioritizing or incentivizing.
“Why is it trending now though? All my feeds are filled with tomato nonsense!”
I explained all of this to my editor and he finally seemed to get what I was going on about. He did, however, insist on knowing why this productivity method was now back in fashion.
Indeed, it is strange that an old-time management technique is suddenly making a splash in our digitally-driven work lives — but in a way, I think it’s more needed now than ever before.
Think about it: in many ways, technology has allowed us to work more effectively but it’s also increased the number of distractions we’re faced with every day.
Whether it’s Slack, email, or social media, the truth is that we’re constantly having to fight to stay focused. I for one can’t tell you how many times an innocent tap on an Instagram notification has turned into hours of mindless scrolling.
Our attention spans are getting shorter. This is why some people are so intent on doing digital detoxes or making a conscious effort to put down their smartphones during leisure time.
So, what could be more effective, and poetic, than returning to good old fashioned analog methods in order to boost productivity? All hail the tomato.

6 things I wish I knew before I bootstrapped my first SaaS startup,Pierre de Wulf,2020/11/24,"
Three years ago, Kevin, a life-long friend of mine, and I left our jobs and decided to start our own bootstrapped SaaS at the tender age of 25. It was a dream we’d be nursing for a long time as bootstrappers like Rob Walling or Pieter Levels, and communities such as IndieHackers by the Courtland Allen had been a source of inspiration for us ever since 2010. 
So we decided it was finally time to see what we could make of it on our own… but it failed miserably. Here’s what I learned. 
Let’s start off with a bit of background. Before this, Kevin and I launched a small Chrome extension that had around 3000 users. This extension allowed people to save products they wanted to buy online and receive emails once the price dropped. Basically, it was similar to  ShopTagr, just uglier. 
It was a fun project and the first real thing we had released to the world. We quickly realized though it would be tough to grow it into something we could make money from. But we did learn that several of our users were e-commerce owners — rather than regular consumers — who used our extension to spy on their competitor’s product’s prices.
[Read: Neural’s market outlook for artificial intelligence in 2021 and beyond]
From this observation came the idea to build a price-monitoring tool for small and medium-sized e-commerce owners. Both Kevin and I were tired of our 9-to-5 jobs, and we thought this was the perfect timing to try and develop something that belonged to us: PricingBot. 
We thought we had finally found the idea that would make us truly independent. Boy, were we wrong.
Fast forward one year, we were barely making any money and only had three customers. We just barely managed to reach $600 MRR. It was a complete failure. 
After nine months, we abandoned the project (we actually sold it for a small amount of money because the traffic was nice) and moved on to a new idea, ScrapingBee, a web scraping API. We had more success with this one, and we managed to reach $180K ARR in less than 18 months.
So what was the difference between the failure of PricingBot and the success of ScrapingBee? Simply put, experience. Here’s everything I wish I knew when I began my first bootstrapped SaaS — I hope it’ll help you on your own journey.
This thing takes time
One thing you have to realize from the start is that bootstrapping a SaaS is a slow process, very slow. Of course, you’ll hear about fast growth, but real overnight successes are sporadic and not really something you should aim for.
Most of the time, when you look behind a fast-growing bootstrapped business, you’ll find:

Years of building an audience
Several failed attempts 
Consistency

If you take Convertkit, for example, one of the most successful open-startup projects of all-time. Their monthly revenue stalled between $1,000 and $3,000 during the first 18 months, but now they are at $2.1 million MRR!

We can also look at LemList, an email marketing tool that was wholly bootstrapped and is now experiencing incredible growth. They launched less than two years ago and have already reached 3 million ARR! 
That success was far from being an overnight occurrence though. Before its rapid growth, the team had already spent a few years building an audience while launching other tools. You can read more about their story here.
Had my partner and I known how much time it actually takes to make money with a SaaS, we would have probably done A LOT more research before launching PricingBot.
If you need 30 emails to sell a $30/month product, the problem isn’t your emails
With PricingBot, we often had months-long email exchanges to secure a $50-100 subscription. 
It clearly was never going to work.
People don’t like to tell others that they don’t want their product and don’t plan to use it. This is human nature: we tend to avoid conflict and we don’t want to harm. 
So if a lead hasn’t had time to use your product for three months, they probably never will. As a founder, you need to keep that in mind while talking with a potential customer. And if all your discussions tend to span weeks or months before someone even signs-up you probably need to do one of these three things:

You should increase your price, by a lot
You should change your audience
You should change your product

Do not expect to be able to make data-driven decisions from day one

In the early days, data, usage, and user count should be low. That will make your decision process much harder though, as it’ll make it impossible to do things like reliable A/B tests or draw real insights from usage.
Knowing this, it’s useful to look out for clues instead of undeniable proof that something is working or isn’t.
Here are the ones that I find quite relevant.
Clues that you are doing something right:

People are angry when your product does not work
People say that your product is too expensive but pay anyway
People ask you a ton of things, even if your onboarding is awesome

Clues that you are doing something wrong: 

You had a three days down-time and no one bat an eye
You have < 1% conversion rate on your landing page
People love to talk to you but never pay you

Your best source of information won’t be data, but rather a good conversation with your users. Convincing someone to have a quick chat with you can be hard, but Kevin had a great idea when we launched ScrapingBee that allowed us to have around 60 conversations with our users in less than three months.
We offered 10 times what our free plan offered to people willing to spend 15 minutes on the phone with us. And we made sure people knew about the offer by displaying it directly on their dashboard.
Another corollary to that whole “low data” thing, is that even if something is bothering all of your users, you can’t expect all of them to tell you about it. Some people just don’t care enough to tell you.
This is why we have decided to assume that for every customer giving us feedback, ten others felt the same way, but were just not voicing their concern.
Using that, we made a new rule: we’d start talking about implementing a new feature every time three users asked for the same thing. Pareto and all that.
And finally, I want to urge you not to experiment with small changes when your problems are big! If no one is signing up or if no one is using your product, a 10% price decrease or a copy change won’t make the difference. Only optimize once you have something to optimize.
I know it’s hard because most of us would rather try out a lot of small changes instead of rethinking the whole product, but every time you do that, you are lying to yourself.
That’s what Kevin and I did with PricingBot. We thought changing the copy or the pricing would move the needle. The truth was, we had much bigger issues.
When starting, focus on what matters, don’t waste your time on futile things
When bootstrapping, time is both your friend and your enemy. It is your friend because you are owning your time and you can do whatever you want with it. It is also your enemy because this sense of ownership will often make you focus on futile things, and next thing you know, it’s been one year and you haven’t shipped a damn thing.
Here is a list of futile things we used to focus on, and in the end, it does not make any difference:

Product name
Domain
The color of that button (see my previous point)
Logo
Tech stack
Scalability

On the other hand, here are some points that are often overlooked:

Clean landing page. Your landing page must create trust!
Copywriting: no typos and clear sentences
Talking to your users.

Do not expect the acquisition channel to be “plug and play”
Before launching PricingBot I knew that acquisition was hard, but I had no idea it would be that hard. For ads, I thought you only needed to set up a Facebook campaign, add some USD and wait for the money to trickle in. For content, I thought you just needed to write good content and wait for it to rank on Google.
I was wrong. 
Marketing is really hard. And all acquisition channels are very different and complex. It’s ok to try several things in the early days to see what sticks, but once you have found something that works, even a little bit, you should definitely focus on it 200%. If you are new to this and you managed to get something to work, you can get 10 times better at this just by spending time learning about the subject.
It’s not fun because it often means doing the same thing and repeating the same process, but I can guarantee you that this is not a waste of time.
With ScrapingBee, we quickly saw that content marketing was something we were good at. It wasn’t ideal, but it was definitely working for us. 
So we spent the whole year learning a lot about SEO and content marketing — and now we have around 30,000 visitors per month on our website, with (almost) zero ads. Kevin has worked a lot on creating an efficient process to create, publish, and promote our articles, and even it if feels a bit tedious to do the same thing every-time, it’s worth it.

Offer top-notch support
In the early days, your product will probably offer fewer features than your competitors, and it’s nothing to worry about. But that doesn’t mean you can’t outplay them in more than one key area.
One easy way to do it is to offer top-notch support. Install a live-chat on your website and try to be as reactive as possible. Sure, I’ll admit it doesn’t scale and you will lose focus, but honestly, that isn’t important at this point.
By offering top-notch support and talking a lot with your customers, you give yourself a chance to:

Better understand your users
Convince some people to leave a testimonial on your landing page
Prove users that even though you are the new kid in town, you are serious and dedicated to your customers
Find an evangelist who will promote your product for you.

Other key areas to focus on are documentation and onboarding.
Conclusion
All in all those last two years have been crazy and exhausting but I don’t regret choosing freedom over comfort. In retrospect, I think that it would have been hard to not fail with PricingBot considering all the things we didn’t know about how to launch and run a profitable SaaS. I guess the best decision we ever made was to just move over and try something new.
We are now 18 months in with ScrapingBee, a web-scraping API, and things are looking better now. We are building this thing in the open and I regularly share our adventure on Twitter, come and say hi!

3 lessons for every newbie founder competing with industry veterans,Erik Gatenholm,2020/11/10,"
It’s hard to believe it’s been almost five years since I began my entrepreneurial journey within an industry I had heard was nearly impossible to break into, let alone as a young entrepreneur in my 20s. 
The 3D bioprinting industry has been dominated by professors with decades of experience and pharma giants, but I knew with enough passion, grit, and determination, I could break through. I had always been fascinated with 3D bioprinting technology and the life changing opportunities that could emerge if this industry was democratized. 
In 2016 my co-founder and I went full speed ahead to pursue our dream of turning our vision of a world where 3D bioprinting technology was readily available and affordable to the masses into reality. 
While outsiders may see CELLINK as an overnight success story with our recent $1 billion valuation and exponential growth, from an insider’s perspective  the notion of an overnight success is far from reality.
My team and I are extremely thankful for the success we have had but achieving this has meant a lot of sacrifices and we have had to overcome multiple hurdles to get to where we are today.  Below are three things I believe every entrepreneur should consider when breaking into an industry dominated by industry veterans.
1. Do your due diligence
No matter what you want to be successful in, you need to do your due diligence to get a full comprehensive picture of how you can disrupt and contribute to the industry and/or  problem you are trying to tackle. If you’re going after an industry run by a few key players with decades of experience, this is even more imperative. 
Instead of seeing the experience others possessed as a challenge, I saw this as an opportunity to learn. I was maniacally focused on grasping the full picture of the industry I wanted to break into. 
What did they do well? What could they have improved upon? You need to study the history of your industry and take note of the various milestones achieved. Ask yourself, what did it take to get here and why have they not reached the next milestone? What’s holding them back? 
Take small yet impactful steps towards breaking into your industry if you want to truly innovate it in the long haul. Our first step into tackling the 3D bioprinting market was to create a universal bioink for bioprinting of human tissues and organs. We knew that aside from the exorbitant costs of most 3D bioprinting systems, the other challenge scientists faced was having to develop their own bioinks. 
My co-founder and I saw this was a heavily asked question online and decided to take action. Before we even fully launched CELLINK, we set up a webshop to evaluate the demand from our target customers, within 24 hours of launching our universal bionk, we were sold out. At that moment, we knew we were onto something. 
In a matter of months, we decided to take the next leap to developing cost-effective 3D bioprinting technology to accompany our inks and become a full 3D bioprinting solutions provider. It was time to enter the big leagues!
2. Stand your ground
When I started CELLINK, I was 25 years old. I was hungry, motivated, and felt a burning drive to truly disrupt this industry. As my co-founder and I went to raise money, we were quickly met with scrutiny and an onslaught of questions relating to our ability to make a real impact in this field. 
Did we have the experience needed? Did we really have a game changing business model on our hands? Regardless of the numerous negative responses we received, this only made us stronger and more determined to show the world what we were capable of. Giving up simply wasn’t an option. 
We decided to take what many see as an unconventional route of raising money and went public. We took CELLINK public on Nasdaq First North only 10 months after we launched. This to date is one of the earliest IPOs in history.  
We may have been met with a lot of skepticism but found leading industry experts who believed in our technology and us as a team. We began to grow at a rapid pace and started securing partnerships and customers with world renowned research institutions and pharmaceutical companies around the globe. For every shred of doubt we received along the way, we took it with grace and used it to further push us towards our goal.
Even after a $1 billion valuation, acquiring four companies and building a team of nearly 400, we must still be persistent and stand our ground. We continue to have to prove ourselves on a daily basis. It’s part of the job. 
3. Collaborate
Who knows better than your customers? Taking a collaborative approach to work alongside our customers has been instrumental to our success. 
Within the first few months of launching, we developed a Collaborative Partnership Program where in exchange for a discount on our technology, our customers provided us with in-depth feedback on a regular basis and together we explored what it would take to have them reach their goals. 
We knew we had to approach our business through a collaborative lens in order to build products that were not only coveted, but needed. We took a deep dive into the challenges our customers were facing and have continually worked closely to give them what they need to succeed and move the industry forward. 
You can’t play guessing games if you want to succeed, never assume. Taking the time to really get to know your customers and those who you wish to work with can be the differentiating factor that will make or break you. 
Creating our Collaborative Partnership Program has led us to a customer base of over 1,800 labs in 60+ countries.  We now have partnerships with almost every major pharmaceutical company and are working with world leading researchers on groundbreaking drug development, disease model analysis, cosmetic development, and more. 
Collaboration is essential to effectively building relationships, learning, and making an impact. Never underestimate it. 
As I enter my fifth year as the CEO of CELLINK, I look forward to the challenges and victories that lie ahead. As our team and portfolio of products continue to expand, we are taking this next phase to become a bio-convergence company and further provide technologies, products, and services in order to create, understand, and master biology to change the future of medicine. 
Always remember to listen, absorb, and reflect in order to make the right choices to propel your business forward, especially in an industry where you’re seen as the underdog.  Never stop hustling!

Sofia’s startup ecosystem is one to watch — just give it time,Yessi Bello Perez,2020/11/9,"
Bulgaria is yet to produce a tech unicorn, but that doesn’t mean its startup ecosystem should be overlooked.
Over the past decade, Sofia’s startup scene has flourished — even if it’s noticeably absent from the top positions in most tech rankings.
“Sofia is not London, Paris, or Berlin — but it has an excellent shot of coming right after them,” says Svilen Rangelov, the co-founder and CEO of Dronamics, a Sofia-based startup seeking to democratize airfreight.
“Just thinking about how much has been achieved with so little in just one decade, I really believe that in another 10 years, Sofia will be competing for the top three in Europe — and will certainly be in the top five with Tel Aviv,” Mr Rangelov adds.
From communism to capitalism
According to Invest Sofia, which helps foreign companies and entrepreneurs start up in the city, Bulgaria birthed around 2000 startups between 2013 and 2018.
The rise of entrepreneurship in Sofia is particularly significant given Bulgaria’s long-winded transition from communism to capitalism, Mr Rangelov explains: “Ten to 15 years ago, if you were young, talented and ambitious in Sofia, it was most probably the exception. Because the post-communist transition had taken too long, the economy was decimated and the brain drain was brutal.”
[Read: Micromanaging sucks — especially when it’s about your ‘Zoom shoes’]
The demise of communism in Eastern Europe in 1989 paved the way for much needed economic and political change, but it took time for countries such as Bulgaria to catch up with their contemporaries.
Luckily, additional progress was made in 2007 when Bulgaria joined the EU. As a result, multinational businesses opened offices in the country and created jobs that would help attract and retain the nation’s talent. Bulgaria’s famously low flat tax rate may have also played a part in attracting businesses and individuals.
“Tech companies, including home-grown businesses, started competing heavily — some even built their own training academies,” says Mr Rangelov.
“So now, if you’re young, talented, and ambitious in Sofia, you’re either founding or working for a startup.”
Brain drain now seems to be a thing of the past. “There are quite a few founders that have lived abroad and have come back, and quite a few foreign founders are moving here as well, confirming Sofia’s advantages over some of the bigger hubs and contributing to the brain regain that has helped the whole ecosystem grow quicker than any other place in the region,” Mr Rangelov adds.
Struggling beyond Series A
Although the shift towards entrepreneurship is a sign of the times, it’s worth noting that Bulgaria’s startup fabric is far from homogeneous. The vast majority of businesses, according to Mr Rangelov, operate in the software space — and there’s a clear dominance of business-to-business software-as-a-service products.
Sofia is also making waves in financial technology. Cash Credit, which works with mobile network operators to offer microfinancial services to mobile subscribers; and Phyre, a mobile app which transforms a user’s phone into a wallet, are both based in Sofia. In fact, such is the city’s prowess in fintech that fDi ranked the country’s capital as the most cost effective fintech city worldwide for 2019/20 — beating the likes of Vilnius (Lithuania) and nearby Bucharest (Romania).
Sofia’s ecosystem is promising, but it still needs help. Stephane Gantchev, a partner at Launchub Ventures — one of the city’s most prominent venture capital firms — says there are gaps that need to be filled if Sofia is to compete on an equal footing. The arrival of a reputable accelerator, for example, could do wonders for the ecosystem.
As ever, fundraising activity is a great indicator of maturity. According to PitchBook, Sofia’s startups have raised $10.6 million so far this year. Data going back to 2009, shows significant disparities in the deal value year-on-year. The highest figure, $20.4 million, was seen in 2019, and the lowest was raised in 2010.
To put this into perspective — and unfair as it may be to compare Sofia to other more established hubs — UK startups raised a record $12.9 billion in 2019, VCs in France poured a more modest $4.8 billion into companies, and Berlin’s startups received $6.9 billion last year.
If we look at fundraising across other Central and Eastern European countries, we can see Sofia is trailing behind. Poland’s startups — with Warsaw being the main hub in the country — raised $343 million in 2019. Over in Estonia, startups managed to raise $310 million from investors during the same year.
Sofia’s early-stage companies are well-served by local VC funds focused on pre-seed to Series A rounds and an active angel community. Later-stage companies, though, are forced to seek opportunities further afield.
“For bigger funding rounds, it is logical for companies to look for funding outside of Sofia, as at this stage they need a more experienced investor with a larger network and deeper pockets,” adds Mr Gantchev.
This is not an uncommon problem, but much of Sofia’s long-term success hinges on a solution — especially as it affects businesses in several ways. Talent, for example, is readily available, and even though it’s convenient by western European standards, this is both a blessing and a curse.
The capital city is home to 23 universities, more than 100,000 students — 42,000 of whom are in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics — 63 research centers and several independent software schools, including the well-known SoftUni and Telerik academies.
The average software engineer salary in Sofia stands at around $23,000 and senior engineers can expect to earn $38,000 or more, according to local website Obecto. By comparison, the same positions in the UK start at about $44,000, with senior software engineers taking home a minimum of $73,000.
Essentially, this means early-stage startups in Sofia can make investor checks go further, but once a business starts to grow, so do the costs. Eventually, entrepreneurs will look to expand and build teams abroad — and when this happens they usually price themselves out of the local ecosystem, which is no longer able to offer adequate monetary support. In other words, the ticket sizes need to get bigger.
“There are plenty of great funds for pre-seed and seed, but no one is capable of leading a $10 million Series A yet. The money exists, but the type of institutions and family offices that could afford it still prefer other asset classes, and are looking at the sidelines,” Mr Rangelov notes.
Building the future
The availability of early-stage capital has been facilitated further by Bulgaria’s government, which has used EU funds to create a ‘Fund of Funds’, which manages slightly more than $700 million.
The ecosystem is also supported by Besco (Bulgarian Entrepreneur and Startup Community), a non-governmental organization bridging the gap between startups, private and institutional investors, and other key stakeholders in the industry. The hope is that the ecosystem will become more cohesive and that public and private partnerships will spring a new wave of products and services.
Bulgaria will soon see the introduction of a startup visa to make it easier for foreign founders and employers to do business and grow their teams — it is likely to come into effect before the parliamentary election scheduled to take place in March 2021. There’s also upcoming legislation for vesting, option pools and convertible notes, Mr Rangelov says.
There’s no denying that Sofia’s ecosystem needs further support to fulfill its potential — it’s missing much of the infrastructure found in other developed hubs — but perhaps what it really needs is time. For now, the quality of life, cheap rent and nearby ski slopes may be enough to convince founders to set up base there. However, going forward, stakeholders need to figure out how to support the ecosystem’s ambitions of scale and success.

How to make AI work for your business,Ben Dickson,2020/11/7,"
The news about artificial intelligence is mostly dominated by sensational stories such as the ominous threat of deepfakes, deep learning algorithms that create fake blogs, AI bots that create their own language, and generative adversarial networks that create realistic portraits of non-existent people.
But the practical use of AI algorithms is much farther behind than the hype caused by the media. From peer-reviewed breakthrough research presented at mainstream AI conferences to PR-style videos created by large tech companies and well-funded research labs, only a trickle of the innovation we see in the field makes it into real business processes and applications.
And the organizations that are putting AI to good use are those who understand the powers and limits of today’s technology and master the challenges of integrating it into their processes and solutions.
“AI does offer a lot of business value, but much of that value isn’t terribly sexy or visible. Products and processes will be made somewhat better and easier to use. Decisions will be better informed. We’ll continue — and perhaps even accelerate a bit — the amazing progress that we’ve seen over the last couple of decades in data and analytics. But as all of the early adopters have discovered, it’s still difficult to create systems that think and communicate like humans — even in narrow domains,” academic and business author Thomas H. Davenport writes in his book The AI Advantage: How to Put the Artificial Intelligence Revolution to Work.
The book explores the mundane-but-practical side of artificial intelligence that is making a real difference at startups and large organizations. In it, Davenport discusses which organizations and sectors are making the best use of AI, what are the challenges business leaders and decision-makers face in adopting AI technologies, and how to develop a successful AI adoption strategy.
Following are some key insights from The AI Advantage, complemented by some exclusive comments and observations Davenport shared with TechTalks in October.
Hesitation in the adoption of AI technologies
While there’s an impression that AI is seeping into every aspect of life and business (and it eventually will), for the moment, a lot of organizations are on the fence. Albeit interested, many business leaders are loath to invest in a technology that entails a lot of risk.
“Almost every survey suggests that a high degree of enthusiasm about AI exists, but that it’s still early days in terms of broad corporate application,” Davenport writes in The AI Advantage, which is largely based on interviews and examination of AI adoption strategies and outcomes at different firms.
The AI Advantage was written in 2018. Since then and a lot of innovation has happened in the field since then, Davenport stresses that we are still in the early days in terms of production applications.
“A lot of companies did small experiments or pilots, but didn’t fully implement them. I think that companies are realizing that AI will be transformative over the long haul, but only moderately beneficial over the short run,” Davenport said in written comments to TechTalks.
The covid-19 pandemic has also highlighted some of the challenges of AI technologies and has forced companies to reconsider their AI adoption strategies.
“I think the COVID economy has meant that companies are re-prioritizing their applications and emphasizing those that have relatively short payback,” Davenport says, adding that some surveys he has worked on suggest an increased preference in buying AI solutions instead of building them in-house, which may be “a factor of COVID-related conservativism.”
AI adoption limited to tech startups and large companies
Given the barriers and risks involved in the integration of AI technologies, their adoption is currently limited to tech startups and large companies.
“Startups build their businesses around new technologies. Large enterprises are typically next in line; they have the technological sophistication to make informed investments in new technologies, and can hire the people to build and implement new solutions,” Davenport writes in The AI Advantage.
Startups are not bound by established business processes and customers they need to keep satisfied. They don’t have liabilities and commitments that slow them down. They build for the future and raise funding for their ideas and innovations. The founding team already has the required AI talent to build the intended solution. AI is a core component of their business proposition and is integrated into their products from the get-go, therefore they don’t need to worry about making possibly breaking changes to an already working system. Although creating an AI product has many other challenges, startups at least have the fuel and gear to start the journey.
Large tech companies, on the other hand, have the financial resources and the flexibility to launch and manage AI pilot project on the side of their main business. They can create divisions that operate independently and manage their own business models, tailored for the dynamics of new markets created by artificial intelligence innovations. They can hire expensive AI talent and acquire startups that are developing promising technology. And as their proof-of-concept projects meet success, they integrate them into their main products.
More importantly, large companies have a lot customer data, a vital requirement for machine learning algorithms.

Small and medium businesses find themselves in an uncomfortable position. They don’t have the flexibility of startups or the extensive resources of big companies. They are bound to the demands of their current customers and dynamics of the markets they are competing in. They don’t have large data stores and the financial means to acquire AI talent and launch in-house moonshot projects.
And perhaps a key factor that is lacking in small to medium firms from an AI standpoint, Davenport points out in The AI Advantage, is awareness and understanding of what is possible. “Big firms have people whose job it is to look out for promising new technologies and inject them into the organization; small firms usually don’t,” he writes.
“I still see that divide being present. I’m not sure it will change much until traditional software vendors incorporate more AI capabilities into their offerings for SMBs. Then it will be an easy adoption,” Davenport said in his comments to TechTalks. “Before that, I don’t think that most SMBs have the spare time and energy to experiment that large firms do, and they don’t have the pressure to innovate that startups do.”
This does not mean SMBs are entirely deprived of AI innovation. There are established platforms that allow businesses to integrated AI technologies into their processes without much technical effort. One interesting example is natural language processing, which is still one of the most challenging subfields of AI and an active area of research. But while AI researchers continue to advance NLP with new deep learning models, the field has also seen the development of tools such as DialogFlow, which can help you create chatbots for your business and integrate them in your website and social media accounts without in an intuitive way. While DialogFlow is not at the cutting edge of NLP, it is accessible to anyone who can break down interactions with customers into distinct steps.
“Overall, it’s important for anyone implementing cognitive technologies to be aware that they are still somewhat immature. Progress is being made quickly in the current environment, but if your application is on the frontier of that progress you may encounter substantial technical challenges. Before you start with a particular project you may want to assess just how close to the frontier you are likely to come,” Davenport warns in The AI Advantage.
How to integrate AI into your organization’s process

Even when you’re a large company in the right market position, AI adoption is still fraught with perils. “It’s easy to make mistakes if you don’t understand the tradeoffs behind each technology,” Davenport writes. “Understanding these technologies and tradeoffs will inform decisions about which might best address specific needs, which vendors to work with, and how quickly a system of a given type can be implemented.”
The AI Advantage provides some key guidelines that can help companies develop a smooth integration strategy. Here are some of my favorite takeaways:

If your AI integration plan involves machine learning, you’ll need the help of talented data scientists to analytics teams to steer the project in the right direction.
Don’t expect leaps: “In time, cognitive technologies will transform how companies do business. Today, however, it’s wiser to take incremental steps with the currently available technology while planning for transformational change in the not-too-distant future,” Davenport writes.
Plan for redesigning your business processes based on cooperation between AI systems and human operators. “Organizations should think through how work will be done with a given new application, focusing specifically on the division of labor between humans and the AI… Systematic design activity is necessary to determine how humans and machines will augment each other’s strengths and compensate for their weaknesses,” Davenport writes.
No matter how exciting a technology is, if it doesn’t provide business value, avoid it. “Cognitive technology may not result in savings from large layoffs anytime soon, but it does need to provide some business value,” Davenport writes.

The AI Advantage is filled with case studies and examples of successful and failed attempts to integrate artificial intelligence in businesses. The book paints a comprehensive picture of what is working and what isn’t, and how companies can find their way through the treacherous path of achieving AI success.
Per Davenport: “There is no reason virtually every large company shouldn’t be exploring cognitive technologies. Those who explore them earlier and more successfully, those who integrate AI with their business processes, and those who identify and nurture effective collaborations between humans and machines — those companies will dominate the future. They’ll have more appealing products and services, more productive and effective processes, and people who have the time and freedom to be creative and resourceful on behalf of customers.”

But we also discuss the evil side of technology, the darker implications of new tech and what we need to look out for. You can read the original article here.

Micromanaging sucks — especially when it’s about your ‘Zoom shoes’,Yessi Bello Perez,2020/11/2,"
Approximately seven months ago the world of work — as most of us knew it — was turned upside down. 
As offices shut down and people were sent home to work, the lines between personal and professional became increasingly blurry. Employees had to get used to this new normal but… so did employers.

Some managers have embraced the opportunity to take stock of their leadership style, making an effort to ensure their employees feel trusted and appreciated. Others are showing symptoms of micro-managing and paranoia. 
And if you don’t believe me, take a look at this tweet:

This person’s employer makes them show that they’re wearing shoes before Zoom meetings to make sure they’re complying 100% with the dress code while they’re at home. SHOES. Employers, some of you have lost your way.https://t.co/TnQLyn2SSY pic.twitter.com/gPi1WeoIWi

Can you think of anything more awful, or pointless?
Aside from the obvious fact that no one on Zoom can see your feet — if they can, you might be doing video conferencing wrong — this is absolute lunacy.
[Read: What audience intelligence data tells us about the 2020 US presidential election]
Several months ago (although it feels like years), I wrote a piece that looked at four things managers should avoid while their staff is working remotely.
One of the things I spoke about was how there was nothing like a crisis — such as a global pandemic — to highlight a managers’ trust issues.
Here’s the thing: we’re all adults. We don’t need to be told what to wear during a Zoom call in order to seem professional and we certainly don’t need advice on finding a quiet place to work from at home.
What we do need, though, is empathetic, trusting, and transparent leaders who will let us and encourage us to do our best work.
Why it feels like an attack
Olivia James, a London-based performance and confidence coach, says micromanagement is linked to hypervigilance and anxiety.
It can be easy to lose sight of the bigger picture when you’re faced with a crisis.
Yes, having to suddenly send your entire workforce to work from home can be unsettling, I get that. But just because your employees are out of sight, it doesn’t mean they’re not working.
Why would you stop trusting someone to do their job just because you can’t see them?
“Micromanaging is linked to anxiety and hyper vigilance. It is caused by anxiety and it can cause anxiety and frustration,” Olivia James, a London-based performance and confidence coach, tells me.
It’s an attempt by an employer to have control and avoid serious problems with productivity or quality of work, she adds.
The reason why it feels like an attack is because we, the employees, perceive it as a questioning of our professional integrity and competence.
“Our confidence, identity, and self-worth are linked to our pride in our work,” James explains. “This can re-activate the dynamic we may have had with a hypercritical parent, teacher, or partner — making us even more anxious.”
Why managers micromanage
As I’m an empathetic person (read control freak)I can sort of understand why some managers tend to micromanage — especially now.
COVID-19 has caused a lot of stress and uncertainty. Our health — both physical and mental — is under threat and in some instances, job security is hanging in the balance. This is exactly the type of situation where people might subconsciously drift towards micromanaging as it creates a comforting illusion for them. 
“Micromanaging can be an attempt to re-establish a level of control,” James says, adding “It’s also motivated by self-preservation.”
What James means is that employers may think that by keeping a close eye on their newly remote staff they can secure their own survival within a business.
So it wouldn’t be far-fetched to say that if you’re being micromanaged, it’s likely due to your manager feeling anxious too. And if you’re a manager, make sure not to let your own insecurities affect your employees and management style.
Overall, micromanaging can have devastating effects on employee morale, staff turnover, and productivity. It sends a signal of distrust — and let me tell you, in 2020 trust is the cornerstone of survival.

5 tips for global software sales my team learned the hard way,Mikhail Vink,2020/11/2,"
As tech companies expand their reach across the globe, it’s inevitable that some assumptions about various markets will turn out to be wrong, if you don’t rely on the knowledge and expertise of those working on this particular market. 
At JetBrains, which grew from a small startup in Prague to an established company whose tools are used across 213 countries and territories, my colleagues and I had the early assumption that most developers speak English, for instance. It’s a requirement for developers at JetBrains to have good English skills, and most developers in our inner circle are fluent, so we thought it was a safe assumption to make. It isn’t. 
And it’s getting even more demanding when we talk about non-technical decision-makers, which might be the ones deciding on the purchase for their technical team. 
Thus, JetBrains had to learn how to localize its product, marketing, and sales strategy as it expanded. Here are the five top lessons my team and I learned from that experience — read it so you don’t waste time repeating our mistakes.
1. Start small
At JetBrains, we had organic growth across the entire globe, which means our tools were being used around the world before we started local market-specific activities. In Mainland China, which has been one of the most challenging markets to expand on, our software was used and sold prior to our local activities launch back in 2015. 
[Read: What audience intelligence data tells us about the 2020 US presidential election]
That year, as a joint initiative of our Sales and Marketing departments, we launched a pilot program in the country, which is a great way to get your toes in a new market. Mainland China is a huge market, but the culture and purchasing patterns are very different from what we got used to, so we had to adapt our business approaches a lot. 
Moreover,  the company was expected to communicate in Chinese rather than in English, and international credit cards are not widely available in favor of local payment methods, such as WeChat, AliPay, UnionPay, along with many other specifics. 
That all meant we had to localize not just purchasing methods, sales support, and product info, but even the product itself. Only once we saw positive results from our pilot program did we scale that approach to more markets all around the globe, where we have local teams building local operations with an understanding of local business specifics.
2. Do the math
Starting small through the pilot program is important because localizing your business processes, web site, or a product is expensive and cumbersome — especially when it comes to localizing the product itself. 
Our product IntelliJ IDEA is now localized to Chinese, Korean, and Japanese, which requires a lot of investment on our side. And it’s not just the upfront investment, as you can’t localize the product once and then live with it. It requires continuous updates in perpetuity. 
Thus, companies need to do the math and make sure the market in question helps you enough to be worth this lift. In our case, we ran macroeconomics research internally and with third-party agencies. Through that research, we curated countries into different clusters to understand where to go.
The first goal for us was to identify low-hanging fruit where the least effort and expenses can grow revenue the most and then start from there, scaling our local marketing and sales operations country by country, while maintaining a global approach to all other markets.
3. Hire locally
Once you decide it’s worthwhile to expand into a certain market, it’s important to not assume anything. Even if you think you know the market, you probably don’t. Thus, you must hire local professionals who understand the local business. 
I personally had a lot of assumptions about the Russian market, for instance, because I was born there, although I live in Germany now. But it came apparent I didn’t know how sales and marketing worked there, as I had worked internationally for many years. 
Your local team should consist of a regional marketing manager and a regional sales manager to start, and then you can grow the team as required. In Greater China, we also have a developer advocate and support engineers — and we always prefer to expand the team in that order (and it generally corresponds to the market needs as we grow local operations). 
In some countries, like South Korea, we also have a distributor who runs sales, marketing, and support themselves. We quite like this approach, as our partners can help us scale the business a lot, but it’s hard to find reliable partners who would be able to cover all the products and a range of activities required, not acting solely as a billing agent. 
We have resellers and distributors in many countries, and while JetBrains keeps selling directly on these markets and hiring local teams, too, we rely on our partners to provide a truly local experience.
4. Be prepared for unexpected challenges
In general, the Asian market is the most complicated and the European/USA market is the easiest for us since we focused our operations there from the beginning. But despite that, we still haven’t been able to crack the code in France. 
While we expected the market to be similar to Germany (due to macroeconomics similarities and comparable IT industry size), the adoption of our products is roughly four times lower there. Clearly, there are differences in the market structure itself and the way stakeholders learn about products, choose them, and promote them inside their organizations. 
Obviously, we’ve made localization mistakes in other markets as well. For instance, some translations don’t make sense in a particular context (that’s why you always need to localize the experience rather than translate, and why you need to have a local team to verify the artifacts). 
We had a booth at an event in South Korea with an unfortunate banner saying “PyCharm is the best IDE for pythons!” The local contractor did their best but didn’t understand the software development context well enough to localize the slogan. The lesson here is to always be prepared for challenges to pop up — there will be so many!
5. Create a blueprint
Still, we’ve managed quite some successes too, as most of the target markets we chose for local marketing and sales development are outperforming the average worldwide growth of our company revenue. 
As we expanded to new markets, we’ve been able to standardize much of the localization tools, terminology, and workflows. We’ve built out these protocols internally to ensure a high level of quality. 
For instance, we noticed paid events (well, at least when we had events before the pandemics) increase conversions to real participants even if tickets are cheap (we normally set a price tag of a couple of cups of coffee, which is quickly returned by the swag we gave out), while free events tend to lead to a high number of sign-ups but low turnout. 
The former approach also enables predictable attendance forecasts. This has different effects in different markets, but it tends to apply more or less across the board. Some markets and strategies will be useful no matter where in the world your company is.
The bottom line is that expanding across the globe is not easy — but it can be worth it. The key is to identify the markets where the investment in localization is worth your time and effort. Then, hire local people who understand the nuance of that country. 
Doing thorough research and running pilot programs are two strategies that have served us well in numerous countries, but the defining feature of global expansion is not assuming anything and learning as you go. 
Still, there is no silver bullet, and you will need to find your own approaches depending on your industry, product, and business strategy. I hope that some of the JetBrains experiences I’ve shared will come in handy.

Yet another issue professional women need to deal with: LinkedIncels,Anouk Vleugels,2020/10/30,"
This article originally featured in Byte Me, our monthly feminist newsletter that makes everyone mad. In each edition, we choose a “word of the month” that we’ve either made up or found on the internet. Subscribe here to get it straight to your inbox!

Remember when incels would mostly reside in the dark, stinky corners of Reddit and 4chan? They’ve now conquered your father’s favorite social network, LinkedIn — giving birth to an awful new thing:

To quickly refresh your memory, incels are ‘involuntary celibates,’ people (let’s face it, mainly men) who believe they can’t get laid because they’re not attractive enough. Most of them hate women. Some of them shoot up shopping malls.
An incel with a LinkedIn profile might not take it that far — they’re focused on their careers, after all — but that doesn’t mean they can’t hit on random women via Linkedin messages.
If you’re struggling with the word, here’s how LinkedIncel can be used in a sentence: “Welcome to LinkedIncels Anonymous,” said Tom. “A networking club where business professionals can rub elbows and share stories about sexual rejection.”
In a recent piece for Fast Company, author Katie Fiore signals a disturbing new trend on the social platform: women users are increasingly dealing with harassment and misogyny.
Fiore researched the reactions to articles posted by The Female Lead, an online platform that focuses on female leadership. She noted that:

 …many of the comments were filled with derision, marginalization, and even outright hate directed at the female subject of the post. Comments from professional men whose pictures, names, and places of work were visible for everyone to see. Men who felt so comfortable with their misogyny that they were empowered to share it on a platform for professionals designed to help us advance our networks and careers.

And the misogyny on LinkedIn isn’t just hiding in comments and DMs — it’s also in the content itself. Last week, this post landed on my feed:
In addition to being regressive and demeaning — which, for the record, is pointed out by many readers in the comments — why is this post even on LinkedIn?
It’s pretty ironic to suggest that all women should devote their lives to homemaking; the one job you won’t find on LinkedIn. Also, what the hell are safety pads, and why would women need men to buy them?
So what’s LinkedIn doing about all this? According to a recent blog post, the platform will be rolling out some ‘anti-harassment’ features this fall.
Before publishing new posts, users will be reminded to respect the guidelines and keep it professional. Direct messages that are deemed inappropriate by LinkedIn’s algorithm will show up with a warning:

While such a feature lowers the barrier for users to report unwanted advances, LinkedIn is unclear about what will happen after reporting; just that it will take “appropriate actions.”
And, as Fiore states in her Fast Company article, these tools don’t seem to acknowledge the underlying issue: that it’s mainly women who need to deal with this crap. They’re on LinkedIn to further their professional careers, and now they have to become full-time unpaid moderators, too?
So, a closing note to the men: stop using LinkedIn to hit on women. If you come across a pretty profile picture, no need to tell her about it. And please, please don’t send unsolicited dick pics via inMail. Nobody endorsed you for being a pathetic little pervert.

Being a paradoxical manager is a good thing — here’s why,Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten,2020/10/29,"
Boris is the wise ol’ CEO of TNW who writes a weekly column on everything about being an entrepreneur in tech — from managing stress to embracing awkwardness. You can get his musings straight to your inbox by signing up for his newsletter!
The paradox of tolerance states that if a society is tolerant without limit, its ability to be tolerant is eventually seized or destroyed by the intolerant.
I think about this a quote lot these days when I observe politics, but also in terms of social interactions, and even in how I manage my company — which I realize can be quite paradoxical at times.
For me and the people I surround myself with, tolerance comes easy, but applying those values to a whole organization can be tricky. The reason is that for a company or organization to be truly tolerant, you’ll have to be a little intolerant.
As the person that defines a company’s culture and values, you need to set clear boundaries from the beginning and determine what type of intolerance you won’t tolerate — if you don’t, you risk your hard work being undermined.
Tolerance doesn’t work without intolerance, but this paradoxical thinking applies to so many other aspects of growing a company.
I firmly believe you’re most creative when you have clear boundaries or you face seemingly narrow restrictions. NOT being allowed to do something, pushes you to find innovative solutions — something you might never have thought of if you hadn’t been forced to.
I’ve found that if you want your employees to feel free, you’ll have to be very clear on rules and expectations, otherwise everybody will be anxious about misinterpreting how free they can really be.
The same goes if you want to be seen as a kind and compassionate person. Making it clear where the line is gives meaning to your compassion as it makes people understand it’s based on actual values rather than just a blanket response.
And if you’re seeking perfection, you’ll also have to start by accepting some things won’t be perfect. Striving to perfect something means focusing on it, while acknowledging that imperfections will arise in areas you aren’t investing time in. For a process to have perfect results, you’ll have to accept a lot of imperfect actions to get there.
So the next time you feel like you’re contradicting yourself, don’t worry — being a paradox is a good thing.

My failed startup: Lessons I learned by not becoming a millionaire,Daniel Homola,2020/10/29,"
Let’s start with the one minute version: I was part of the EF12 London cohort in 2019, where I met my co-founder. Together, we pursued an idea that I had for a while:
A privacy-preserving medical-data marketplace and AI platform built around federated deep learning.
The purpose of the platform would have been to allow data scientists to train deep learning models on highly sensitive healthcare data without that data ever leaving the hospitals. At the same time, thanks to a novel data monetization strategy and marketplace component, hospitals would have been empowered to make money from the data they are generating.
We received pre-seed funding, valued at $1 million. Then the race for demo day began with frantic product building and non-stop business development. Unfortunately, my co-founder fell out of love with the idea after enduring months of business development hardship. Then we failed to pivot to something we both liked, so we split up and I went on my own way.
The whole ordeal was an amazing mixture of fun, challenging learning opportunities, and uninhibited misery (but mostly fun). Make sure to check out the demo of the MVP I built.
I’ll go into the details for those curious about what you can expect from an entrepreneur journey. But if you’re in a rush, feel free to skip ahead to bullet points of what I learned (just CTRL+F ‘Takeaways’). 
How do you find a co-founder?
Back in early 2019, I left my job at IQVIA to join the London cohort of Entrepreneur First. EF is an amazing incubator / accelerator program that has given the world the likes of Magic Pony and hundreds of other exciting companies.
‘Entrepreneur’ what?
The main thing that sets EF apart from the dozens of similar programs is they focus on the earliest possible stage of companies: sole founders. They take in a hundred talented and ambitious individuals in each cohort (actually almost 200 when you count the other European EF sites: Berlin and Paris).
Then the good people of EF will make everyone go through a weird, speed-dating meets Love Island type of co-founder finding process.
In this phase, for weeks on end, you are simultaneously reading the CVs of super interesting cohort members and having ludicrously blue-sky chats with them, about potentially world changing companies the two of you could build. By the end of this process, you should end up with a co-founder.
EF also gives you a stipend, a place to work and a ton of high quality material on the basics of entrepreneurship and startup building. But I think the real USP of EF, is the access to this pool of pre-screened, highly talented and motivated people, who all left their (sometimes lucrative) day jobs to become members of the cohort and build companies.
From beers to business
As a naturally skeptical person, I wasn’t sure what to think about this process. I did what was expected of me: read CVs, talked to people, came up with outlandish ideas. But I didn’t really click with anyone.
Finally however, after many beers and chats, I found my co-founder, with whom we just had enough in common (interest in healthcare and machine learning) to make our discussions fruitful, but with whom our skills were complimentary enough that we could take advantage of having two people on the team.
This latter point is in fact quite crucial: too often, we’re naturally attracted to people with similar interests, skills and thinking to our own. This is great for friendships, but can be devastating in a startup where you want the co-founders to cover each other’s blind spots.
Both my co-founder and I are “techies” in broad terms. But it was quite clear from the beginning that I am more of a CTO type who loves to build, whereas he liked the process of selling and pitching, which is quite important because that’s pretty much all you do as an early stage startup CEO.
Fortunately (as this is quite rare AFAIK), we both had a good share of the skills of the other’s role too. This really helped with both the technical and business discussions between the two of us.
Do you have a $1 billion idea?
Something we all learned fairly quickly in EF was the economics of venture capital. It’s really quite simple and goes something like this:
Venture capitalism 101:

There’s a huge amount of excess money slushing around in the global financial system.
Most investors stratify their investment portfolios according to some risk profile. This usually means that they are happy to put 1-to-2% of their capital in high-risk ventures. Funding highly risky tech startups is one of these high-risk venture types. Another would be to buy crypto for instance.
VC firms utilize this and go out every x years to raise a round, i.e. pool together capital from wealthy individuals and investment funds.
Whatever they raise is the fund that can be allocated by the partners of the VC firm, as they see fit.
Most VCs work on a 2/20 rule: they will take 2% management fee each year, plus 20% of any profit they make. (It’s worth noting here, that 2% of a billion-dollar fund is still a few million for each partner each year, even if none of their funded companies exit or do particularly well. Yeah, being a VC is quite lucrative.)
VCs promise extraordinary returns to the investors. Certainly well above anything that’s attainable with reasonable risk profile on the market. How can they deliver?

To achieve this they can either fund companies where they expect that most of them will grow 100%.
Or fund companies where none of them will grow a 100%, because most will grow 0%, and potentially one or two will grow 1,000% or 10,000%.



Companies from the first group are called successful medium sized business. The latter ones are called unicorns: startups in hyper-growth mode, overtaking and disrupting a whole industry like AirBnB or Uber did for example.
Not all ideas are created equally
Even though probably both investment models could be equally successful, VCs want to invest in high impact firms that will change the world. Think Google, Facebook, and Twitter.
I’ll leave it to your judgement whether this is a healthy and sustainable business model. I will certainly write more about this in the future, but I will say this: VCs serve a super important function in the global innovation market and without them, the world would be different in countless ways.
The corollary of all the above is that if you go down the VC backed startup building path, you need an idea that can become a 1 billion-dollar company. Yes, that’s a billion with a capital ‘B.’
Start me up!
We spent weeks ideating with my co-founder, but after dozens of discussions we came back to the idea I arrived to EF with. It was the only one that seemed simultaneously ambitious and high impact enough that a VC might take a liking to it, while also having the potential to grow into a multi billion-dollar company. Also, neither of us hated it, which is quite important, I heard.
The idea
I had this idea for a company for months before applying to EF:
The world’s first, privacy-centered medical-data marketplace and machine learning platform, powered by federated deep learning.
I couldn’t wait to tell all the people at the cohort about it, so I did. And they all made the exact same face you just did when you read the sentence above.
The problem with deep tech ideas (besides not fitting on a napkin) is that for the most of us not well-versed in the particular field, they are often indistinguishable from vaporware and snake-oil.
You really have to know a lot about healthcare informatics, medical machine learning, federated deep learning and also the financial incentive structure of the US healthcare industry to properly evaluate that one sentence above.
If you do that, it will not only make a lot of sense but you’ll find that it’s offering one of the very few viable long-term solutions to the impossible trade-off healthcare faces in the 21st century:
The patients’ natural right to data privacy is in direct conflict with data pooling and with how much we can learn from this data with current AI algorithms.
This is bad news, because without the deployment and proliferation of AI, healthcare is doomed. Another indication that the above idea might not be the worst ever is that Google Ventures already backed an amazing team to do exactly this. Yeah, finding that out wasn’t fun…
The idea explained
Probably it’s easiest to explain the idea for our startup by enumerating some of the relevant problems that plague healthcare currently:

Hospitals and outpatient clinics generate vast amounts of incredibly rich and detailed data about patients. We’ll call these institutions providers.
This generated patient data is extremely sensitive, and people are rightly concerned about who gets to use or analyze it.
Pharmaceutical companies, biotech and med-tech AI startups are all hungry for this data and could develop amazing new drugs, therapies, diagnostic tools, algorithms by leveraging it. We’ll call these companies vendors.
Providers are often cash-stripped and as a consequence struggling to provide the highest quality of care for their patients.
Vendors have ample resources (money) and a clear need to access this data. Furthermore, by providing this data to them securely, the world could undoubtedly become a better and healthier place through their innovation.
Even if vendors had access to this data, deploying AI models at scale, in a live hospital setting is still one of the biggest unsolved challenges of digital healthcare.

Once you write down these six simple facts about today’s healthcare systems, it really doesn’t take long for the light bulb to start flashing.
We need to build a marketplace where providers can sell access to their data without compromising patient privacy and where vendors can get access to this data to learn from it and train models on it. Furthermore, once vendors have a model trained, they need to be able to easily deploy it to network of hospitals, where those models could start to generate useful (and potentially life-saving) predictions.
But how could anyone use sensitive data without actually having a look at it, thereby immediately compromising patient privacy?
The answer is quite remarkably simple, and it’s been powering all sorts of technologies (like predictive texting on your phone) for years. It’s called federated learning and it’s first real-world, large scale application came from Google (as far as I know) following this paper. Then, many – more – followed and amazing open source libraries were released like PySyft by OpenMined, or FATE by WeBank.
Federated learning’s simplest explanation can be boiled down to a single sentence:
Instead of moving the data to the model, let’s move the model to data.
Suffice to say that this idea has found applications in several security and privacy conscious industries, but its impact on healthcare will truly be transformational. Have a look at these two recently published Nature articles to see what federated learning holds for the future of multi-institutional medical studies and digital health applications.
If you’re curious about the technical details and implementation of our idea, make sure to check out this page about the MVP I built, or watch my demo of it below.

To recap:

We wanted to build a platform to enable researchers and data scientists of pharma and biotech companies to access highly granular and information rich patient data from US hospitals to train models on it,
without the data ever leaving the four walls of those hospitals and without the researchers ever being able to actually look at the data.
We wanted to leverage federated deep learning and a federated data query engine to achieve this.
The best part? The hospitals would have made money out of the mountains of data they are sitting on, without ever compromising patient privacy, while simultaneously enabling vendors to innovate, research and develop therapies.
Furthermore the learned algorithms could have been deployed back to the federated hospital network and put to good use.
We wanted to charge vendors according to the well-known SaaS business model and share a sizable fraction of our revenue with the hospitals so they become financially incentivized to partner with us.
How? Every time a hospital’s data would have been used to train a model, they would have got compensated based on the number of patients and data granularity they provided for the study.

Here’s a flowchart of the smallest possible incarnation of our platform with just two hospitals connected to the federated data network.

The rollercoaster life of a founder
The EF program is structured according to a fairly well thought out schedule that gives a nice framework for working on your idea.

In the first few weeks you should get data about the market’s reaction to your idea. This means you’re constantly on the phone (sometimes for 6-8 hours straight), talking to people, who are often not that interested, but you begged your way in or forced them some other way.
You’re doing all of this to basically “Mom test” your idea.
This is a neat little trick to get around the problem of people being too nice. Yes, that’s actually a problem, as they’ll outright lie in your face and say that they like your idea and would even pay for it. Only then to completely disappear after the call.
The reason for this is quite simple: no one likes to be the a-hole who breaks the soul of budding entrepreneurs. Contrary to popular belief, people on average are fairly nice that way, so they’ll naturally try to say something good about your idea, even if it’s objectively terrible and they knew from the second minute, they’ll never ever use it.
In this early phase, it’s not a big deal if people are hanging up on you. You should just have as many calls as possible, be resilient and accept that no one cares about your idea besides you. Keep your head down, collect data and try to find out if there’s anyone out there even remotely interested in buying what you have to offer.
In the next phase of your VC fueled company building, you are trying to produce some form of “traction” to prove to your future investors (the EF Investment Committee (IC) in our case), that in fact, your idea is a viable business.
Traction can be many things, depending on the complexity of your product. Here are a few types of traction in decreasing order of impressiveness:
Signed up users / companies with their card details already taken, ready for doing business with you.
Signed contract with another business for a (hopefully) paid trial. Contract for an unpaid trial is the next best thing here.
Letter of intent from another company or institution. This is usually a document with purposefully vague and legally non-binding language in which your future client (you wish) says that they don’t think your idea is totally crazy and (if the stars align and the director wakes up in the right good mood) they might even consider using it one day. Maybe…
Then you take all this evidence that you’ve gathered through hundreds of interviews and thousands of emails and present it to the EF Investment Committee. If they like your idea, you get £80k for a 10% stake in your company. You get to work on it more till you reach the maturity to pitch your company at demo day to dozens and dozens of great VCs with the intention of raising a seed round (~£1-2M) with one of them.
If you get seed funded (usually 4-6 months after demo day) then hurray, your VC fueled company building journey can finally begin. Unfortunately, the odds are still heavily stacked against you:
There’s only about a 20% chance you’ll make it to the next funding round. Quite annoyingly, you’ll need several of those in the coming years to keep your unicorn alive – they are hungry beasts.
There’s a 97% chance that you’ll fail to exit, i.e. fail to turn your years and years of grueling work into hard earned millions.

Hm… That was depressing to learn, but don’t worry, it’ll get worse.
The up
As anyone who’s ever tried will tell you, building a company is like being on a rollercoaster ride. Sometimes you have days that feel like none of the days in your previous office jobs. You feel amazing, fulfilled and working on something truly meaningful (at least to you).
Even better, sometimes things just work out. Like when we started to ask huge and well-known US research hospitals if they would partner with us (two random unfunded guys from London) to build the world’s first federated machine learning platform for healthcare and they just said “yeah sure”.
Or when the second and third meetings started to occur with these teams, and the term “letter of intent” started to fly around a lot. We felt invincible. Even if it took more than a hundred Zoom calls and thousands of emails sent out, we thought we are clearly making progress with business development here.
The top
Then the rollercoaster continued and took us to this amazing top. Armed with our letters of intent and signed project proposals with these hospitals, EF’s IC said they’d invest in us and just like that, we got the pre-seed funding.
Roughly 30% of the initial EF cohort make it this far so we felt great. Even though we knew the work is just about to get a whole lot more challenging and crazy, there’s a moment when you have your first little success and you start quietly wondering to yourself:
Maybe we’ll be among the 1% of startups that actually make it… I know it’s unlikely, but maybe this will all just work out fine!
I was also super excited that I get to finally build again after months of not coding. Don’t get me wrong, conducting BD calls, writing marketing materials, technical documents, grants, drafting SOWs and LOIs was extremely educational too and they are necessary and unavoidable parts of every company formation. Nonetheless, I was itching to actually get back to the thing I love doing and I’m reasonably good at.
The down
After the pre-seed investment, I was 100% on building and my co-founder was 100% on business development. We only had 2.5 months till demo day to:

Build an MVP of the highly complex product we envisioned.
Get extremely conservative and risk averse pharma companies and hospitals to sign up with our marketplace.

Our plan seemed straightforward. I am going to take care of the first one and my co-founder is doing the second. Even though we knew the second is probably dependent on the first being ready, we agreed to work as hard as we can and try to have our first customers by demo day in late September 2019.
However, the cracks started to show quite early on… The business development process went from painfully hard (pre-IC) to near impossibly hard (post-IC). Many people told us that letters of intent are worth the same as toilet paper, and we should try to convert those into signed contracts for paid or unpaid trials ASAP, so that’s what we tried to do.
Despite my co-founder’s heroic efforts however, after months of negotiations, meetings, project proposals and more meetings with US hospitals, every single lead of ours simply dried up. Emails went unanswered. Crucial final meetings with the key stakeholders did not happen.
When the discussions turned real, and when hospitals realized that for this fancy-sounding research project they’d need to actually provision resources for us so we can integrate our software into their IT systems, they went cold turkey on us.
The small up before…
We realized that we made our own lives impossible by trying to aggressively innovate on two fronts at once:

We wanted to build a federated ML platform for deep learning models in a notoriously conservative industry, leveraging highly sensitive data with tons of regulations around it.
We wanted to create a marketplace, therefore we had to find not just one customer type but two: providers and vendors too.

Even just one of these goals would have been insanely hard for a two-person team to pull off in 6 months, but doing them together was clearly way too much. So we pivoted and said:
Let’s sell our federated ML platform to pharma companies. Let them use it with their existing hospital relationships however they see fit.
This wasn’t the worst idea to be honest. Pharma companies already have longstanding relationships with hospitals and outpatient clinics, as these connections are essential for recruiting patients for new clinical trials.
Healthcare – as we found out to our own detriment – is built on trust and slowly evolving long-term partnerships. There’s very little place for disruptive technologies, especially pushed by small companies. Due to the heavily regulated and risk averse nature of healthcare, you can have the best tech product and it’ll still be extremely hard to sell (this was confirmed to us by numerous companies on the market).
So we thought, let’s sell the technology to the innovation leads and heads of data science of large pharma companies. Then they will take care of getting the tech to the data, i.e. inside the hospitals.
The crash
This hasn’t really changed the MVP I had to build, only the way we’d demo it to users potentially, so I proceeded further with full steam.
My co-founder in the meanwhile was trying to line up as many demo opportunities as he could, so we would have a good chance of converting at least one or two of those into an unpaid trial by demo day. Then we’d have our hard-won “traction” in our hands for our discussions with VCs.
I finished the MVP and we started to demo it to large pharma companies. Quite miraculously, none of them thought it was terrible. In fact, some of them even murmured something positive about it during the call.
But crucially, none of them jumped out of their chair singing Hail Mary, thanking us for finally solving their long standing hair-on-fire problem. Instead, they all said, they’ll get back to us after they had some internal discussions.
Although sales cycles in healthcare are notoriously long, and selling to pharma as a tiny startup is near impossible, we knew we missed the mark. We could simply feel after these calls that we aren’t solving any of these teams’ top 3 problems. What we offered was definitely in the top 10 or 15, but not even close to top 3.
And then, to make things worse (or better?), I learned through a series of honest chats with my co-founder that his heart wasn’t really in federated learning anymore.
Turns out, it’s a pretty big problem when the CEO of a company is not emotionally invested in and hyped up about the very thing the company is selling. It’s especially bad if this happens literally weeks before he’s supposed to stand in front of a hundred VCs and convince them that our business is the one that’s going to change the world and which is worth their £1M investment.
Operation salvage
I totally empathized with the frustration of my co-founder after he struggled for months to sell without much to show for it… However it felt rather bad to give up on the idea at the very last minute.
Granted, our traction was practically non-existent at that point, but I suspected from the beginning that selling this product will be incredible hard and might potentially take years. We also knew for a fact that selling our product isn’t impossible, as we have found companies that managed to get into US hospitals and others that worked successfully on something similar to our idea (although both with incredible funding behind their backs). So personally I wasn’t disappointed, and I wasn’t that surprised with our lack of progress. But clearly my co-founder was and it was him who had to muster the energy day after day to try and sell this thing.
It was pretty clear to me that just like you cannot make someone love another human being, you cannot make someone feel passion for something for which they simply don’t. So reluctantly, I agreed to move on and use the rest of our pre-seed funding to build something else for the next demo day (which was scheduled for 6 months later).
We told our plans to EF (who were really nice and supportive about it), then proceeded to conduct one of the most painful 4 weeks of my life. We brainstormed in the Google Startup Campus, the British Library and countless pubs and cafes of London for days on end. We were desperately trying to come up with an idea which we both felt good about, meaning we would be willing to dedicate a couple years of our lives to it.
Whiteboard sessions came and went, beers and many more coffees were had. We tried for hours each day, but one of the two following scenarios kept happening:

Either founder A hated the idea founder B just pitched or,
we both quickly realized that founder B’s idea was genuinely terrible, so we just laughed (or cried).

The end
After weeks of this, I proposed to leave the company and sell my shares to my co-founder. Again, EF was incredibly nice about this and signed all the necessary contract modifications that allowed me a clean exit. Then, on a rainy October day, six months after joining EF, my co-founder and I said goodbye in a typical London pub and that was the end of my first startup.
As I walked towards the tube, lots of thoughts and feelings were rushing through my head… None of them particularly positive or pleasant, but I knew I made the right decision.
Takeaways
I probably learned more about myself and the world in those six months than in the preceding 2.5 years in my typical 9 to 5 corporate data-science job. I couldn’t possibly summarize all of it here and some (or most) of it might be completely trivial to some readers. So here’s a list of my top learnings.
What did I learn?

Product market fit is (almost) everything. It’s a simple sounding but pretty complex idea. Here’s a good intro to it, and here’s the best step by step guide I’ve found so far about how to achieve it.
Ideas are cheap. Execution is all that matters. It’s been repeated ad-nauseam in startup circles but I think it’s mostly true so worth noting. Although, some successful people challenge this and advocate the exact opposite. The truth (as usual) is probably somewhere in the middle, but definitely closer to the “ideas are cheap” side. (Related tip: never be afraid to talk about your idea. It’s the only way to find funding and co-founders (and most likely you’ll need at least one of those)).
The tale of two ideas: imagine you have two ideas, X and Y. Let’s say, idea X solves a problem, which for a 100 people is so serious, they’d sell their kidneys (both in fact) to get it fixed. Idea Y solves a problem for a 10,000 people and they’d be willing to pay (they say) $20 for it. Which one you should pursue? Before EF, I would have chosen idea Y in a heartbeat. Today, I’d kill to have an idea that is like X. Always choose idea X.
Finding a great co-founder is exceptionally hard, although I definitely lucked out with mine on many fronts. In general, and contrary to popular startup wisdom, I’d prioritize the following qualities above charisma, genius-level IQ, qualifications or anything else: integrity and honesty, intellectual rigor and logical consistency, good (but not crazy) work ethic and resilience and patience, and sense of humor and being able to laugh at oneself.
Creating a great team of first 10 employees is even harder than finding a co-founder (from what I heard) and it’s probably the most important thing any founder will do after securing funding, as it will most likely determine the culture of the entire company for many years to come.
Sales, marketing and UX are super important. Probably more so than your code (especially at the beginning).

Related tip: don’t be the dumb tech guy that builds it, expecting the users to just show up and start using and loving it.


Mom test everything.
Being able to evaluate business ideas critically is a fundamental skill for founders. The good news, that it can be learned. Also, a good checklist helps.
Spending time on finding out what is it that you’d work on even if you didn’t get paid for it, is an amazingly useful way of focusing your life and career.
Some healthcare related takeaways I wish I knew before starting:
Healthcare is conservative, built on trust and slowly evolving but longstanding relationships and partnerships.
As a not surprising consequence of this, the average age of founders of unicorn healthcare startups is significantly higher than of tech unicorns.
Also, healthcare seems to be the only industry where having a PhD and many years of relevant experience is a prerequisite of being successful. In most other industries a BSc and/or an MBA seems to be enough.
If you are planning to build and sell any tech related product in healthcare, be prepared for extremely long sales cycles, business partners who proceed with extreme caution and who care a lot about the optics of your company.
Therefore, all in all, healthcare is not best suited for tiny startups, created by starry eyed 20-30 something founders with tiny professional networks and little work experience in the field.

What do I miss?
Being a founder of your own deep tech company feels amazing on most days. Here are some of the things I miss:

The autonomy, responsibility and fast pace is infectious and invigorating. Especially coming from a traditional healthcare behemoth like IQVIA.
Living in a “Come on, we can do this!” mindset and being surrounded by people who think that way.
Being surrounded by motivated, ambitious, highly educated and driven people who chose to veer off the traditional corporate track is amazing. Again, in my opinion this is definitely the USP of EF.
Being able to determine the work schedule and culture of your team.
Being able to just spend a whole day on learning about something, because that’s what the business calls for.
Talking to other founders and potential customers teaches you that the world is so much more complex, interesting and nuanced than it seems as an employee in a small vertical of a single industry. There are hundreds of industries, all with their own inefficiencies, suboptimal solutions, knowledge gaps, tech hurdles. Learning about these is fascinating and broadens you as a person and as a professional.

Will I do it again?
Absolutely! Although I might take a different funding route.
But that’s a topic for another post…

With years of experience in healthcare AI, he has built disease detection models, developed federated learning solutions, and secured funding for his own deep tech startup in this space. You can read the original piece on Homola’s website here.

How to use social media to land your first programming job,.cult,2020/10/28,"
This article was originally published on .cult by Will Johnson. .cult is a Berlin-based community platform for developers. We write about all things career-related, make original documentaries and share heaps of other untold developer stories from around the world.
Landing your first job in tech can be hard. Especially when you have no experience in the field. I’ve worked in factories and call centers most of my adult life. I only learned how to code when I was 33 — this was in my free time outside of my 12-hour shift and while raising six children with my wife. I’m not going to lie, it was hard. I applied to countless jobs and felt the sting of rejection time and time again. “No experience,” they would say, even if I killed in the interview. I was at the bottom of the ladder and dying for a break.
I started using social media to break into tech
The traditional approach wasn’t working, I had to switch it up and think outside the box. No one wanted to take a risk on me, probably because anyone can say they are ‘hard-working’ and ‘passionate’ when it comes to software development — it’s not enough. I decided to show how hard-working and passionate I really was using the power of social media.
Step one was creating a Twitter account where I would begin to document my journey or “learn in public” as Shawn Wang once described it. I had zero followers and didn’t know a single person working in tech. I started by throwing up a picture of whatever I happened to be learning at the time, then pictures of books I was reading, courses I took, meetups, podcasts and side-projects. Twitter was a living archive of my learning journey.
Is it a waste of time to post about everything you learn? If you’ve got no followers, no one will see, right? Wrong. The people who created the courses you take and wrote the books you read are also using Twitter (or some other social media). Tag the instructor, author, creator or website in your post — that’s what I did. I’d tag the author of the book I was reading, I would tag the meetup accounts and the organizers. Those creators love to see people getting value from the things they made, so you’re actually doing them a huge favor.
In February, I started my Twitter account and by October I had landed a job in tech and built some great relationships in the community. I’d jump on calls with my new connections and learn as much as I could. One person would introduce me to another and so on, and like a snowball, my presence in the community grew and grew until eventually, I landed on a podcast (aimed at Junior developers) and was asked to speak at a conference outside of the country.
What I’d inadvertently done was create a solid reputation for myself in the community and for me, it went much further than any resume could. Doing this allowed me to create a story, a unique one where I was controlling the narrative.
I was motivated by others
It wasn’t just me using social media to record my learning journey… Kyle Shook, another developer on Twitter, was always posting these really cool CSS animations. They were highly detailed and you could tell he put a lot of time and effort into making them. Well, his hard work paid off. A company saw what he was doing and contacted him with an offer.
Another tech influencer, Dhanish Gajjar was using Instagram to post the notes he was taking, the courses he was learning from, and the problems he was solving. He also created CSS challenges for other developers to participate in. He would post something he made and would ask others to submit their version. Similar to Kyle, a company reached out to Dhanish with a job opportunity, and he still works there today.
I’m not saying you should quick your job search and become an influencer. I’m trying to show what a powerful and effective tool social media can be in as a developer. Most of us (especially early on) are scrambling to learn and master as much as we can, but no one can see that unless you show them. Build your learning portfolio and see what opportunities come your way.
Helping others was important
One other point: I made sure my ‘learning in public’ wasn’t all about me. If I’d take a course, I’d help the instructor out by answering a couple of questions or directing them to a link that could help them. By helping others solve problems it would reinforce the information I’d learnt, it was win-win.
This also showed potential employers that I was willing to help and communicate — skills that are very important for developers, especially with the rise of remote work. Most of your communication is done via the same medium (slack, email, GitHub). So showing you’re an effective communicator ahead of time gives the employer one less thing to worry about when considering you.
My big break
Leading up to my first full-time job, I leveraged the network I had created as much as possible. People in my network would recommend me to employers and even act as my reference, through this I got a few freelance clients which allowed me to prove my skills. Then as I mentioned earlier, my big break finally came after six years laboring in factories.
I can’t say one thing worked more than the other — it was the compounding effect of everything: the network, the hustle, the friends, the learning. And it doesn’t just end when you get a job, it will help you with your next one and everything else you want to accomplish in your career.
Don’t worry about trying to be or look perfect. I know Instagram is full of developers who have amazing desks and take beautiful pictures. But that’s not important, all you need is your phone a couple of minutes to post, don’t think so much about it, the most important thing is to just start. You never know who is watching but some great things can happen when you put yourself out there, and everyone is rooting for you whether it feels that way or not. We want to see you win and reach your goals and celebrate your progress.
Recap:
If you’re not having any luck with the traditional job search, use social media to showcase your hard work and ingratiate yourself in the community. The relationships you build and potential opportunities are worth the effort. It was a tough long journey for me but I kept showing up every day and that’s how I got my first break: a remote gig that I love. It’s a complete 180° from everything I’ve done in the past, and if it’s possible for me it’s possible for you.

Agile marketing tips to grow your startup even faster,Gilad David Maayan,2020/10/27,"
Marketing is a volatile landscape in which the only certainty is change, especially when it comes to digital marketing. Every day, huge amounts of content are created, collected, consumed, and distributed across an increasing number of media channels. 
Brands compete over increasingly short attention spans of potential and existing customers. Agile marketing helps startups create their own digital presence and reach prospective customers — so you better know how to make it work for you.

What is agile marketing?
Before diving into how to go about adopting it, let’s start by defining what agile marketing means. 
Agile marketing is a strategy that you can use to find, test, and implement focused marketing projects. In general, agile strategies involve breaking projects down into component pieces and working on those pieces in sprints (set time periods). 
[Read: What audience intelligence data tells us about the 2020 US presidential election]
After each sprint, you evaluate your progress and the overall project to ensure it is moving in the right direction and to verify if any changes need to be made. 
When implementing for marketing projects, these strategies can be used to break down larger projects, including ad campaigns, website user testing, or rebranding. The benefits of implementing agile in marketing workflows include:

Clear focus — goals are clearly defined from the start and projects are crafted to fit those goals rather than vice versa. 
Nuanced campaigns — a focus on user experience enables teams to leverage customer behaviors and preferences. This enables businesses to create campaigns that are more cost effective and successful, even with smaller audiences. 
Consistent growth — feedback loops help teams identify effective strategies and eliminate ineffective ones. This promotes growth and predictable marketing results.

4 reasons your startup needs agile marketing
In my experience, overhauling your marketing strategy may seem like a task best to leave for later, but implementing agile early on is often easier in the long run. Agile workflows require a mindset and cooperation that can be difficult to create once teams have established workflows. 
As a startup, you can optimize your marketing with this strategy more easily due to the following advantages — so use them to encourage early adoption.

1. Opportunities for consistent practices and processes
Startups tend to have fluid responsibilities and lots of cross-functionality in their team members which naturally encourages collaboration. Agile can operationalize this collaboration, enabling teams to develop structures for support and joint responsibility. 
Since teams were never siloed in the first place, agile supports staff in naturally sharing ideas and workflows. This structure can then help ensure that timelines are met and processes are refined without interrupting productivity as a startup grows. 
2. Faster knowledge sharing creates shared understanding
Due to the overlapping responsibility and collaboration that comes with agile teams, it is easier for team members to share knowledge and skills sets. 
This can help reduce back and forth cycles of creation and approval and ensure that members better understand each other’s perspectives and capabilities. 
3. Incorporating agile marketing values in leadership early
Since startups do not come with an extensive history of “how things are done” leaders may be less likely to oppose agile strategies. Likewise, early startup hires who begin with agile workflows are more likely to carry that understanding and mindset into leadership roles in the future. 
This early indoctrination of agile enables startups to create a business culture that supports and promotes agile. When implemented well, this can grant teams greater flexibility to do what they know and can drive marketing innovation for the company. 
4. Agile project management tools from the start
Another way the freedom of startups feeds into agile benefits is in tooling. New companies do not have the technical debt or contract limitations that older companies do.
This means they can more easily adopt tooling that supports agile workflows. This reduces the overall IT burden since you can avoid costly integrations or retraining. 
Try to incorporate agile marketing into your startup’s strategy as early as possible.
Agile marketing: 4 tips to do it right
When implementing agile marketing strategies, I’ve found the following tips can help reduce workflow conflicts, encourage collaboration, and ensure continual improvement. 
1. Select team members wisely
When creating your team, you should focus on gathering cross-functional members with diverse and relevant skills. Typical roles and skills to gather include graphic designers, content writers, database specialists, marketing automation specialists, and demand generation specialists. 
When selecting your members, prioritize those who bring the skills you need (or don’t have) and can collaborate well. 
2. Ensure visibility
For agile marketing teams to collaborate successfully, you should maintain visibility of several aspects, including:

Project goals and progress — including the goals of the current sprint, the overall project goals, which tasks are in which sprint, and the timeline for completion. To accomplish this, teams often adopt tools such as kanban boards that enable the creation, assignment, and tracking of tasks. These tools may also include dashboards for metrics or timelines.
Customer base — including who target customers are, their preferences, and how effective various strategies are with that audience. Teams can ensure this information is visible through customer relationship management (CRM) systems, visualizations of demographics, website heatmaps, and results from customer surveys.
Available media assets — including assets from previous campaigns, branding assets, and information about where assets are currently in use. Visibility of media assets is often managed with digital asset management systems (DAMs), which enable teams to create detailed libraries of assets and asset use.

3. Meet frequently
Teams should be in frequent contact with each other to help hold each other accountable, brainstorm solutions to issues that arise, and update each other on progress. 
Meetings don’t have to be long (or in person) but should be orderly, with points to be addressed, and routinely scheduled. Often, teams meet once a day to check in but can meet more frequently as long as meetings don’t interfere with productivity. 
4. Learn from your mistakes
One of the greatest benefits of agile is that it’s iterative but only if you learn from your mistakes. With each sprint you have an opportunity to evaluate your workflows, goals, and progress. If anything isn’t working as well as expected, you should identify improvements before moving on to the next sprint. 
As long as you evaluate progress and implement improvements, you can minimize your risks and maximize the revenue generated by your campaigns. However, if you ignore issues or don’t objectively evaluate strategies, you will have a hard time benefiting from agile. 
Conclusion
Agile marketing strategies break projects down into short and actionable sprints, which are much easier to implement, track, and measure. Setting up clear goals enables you to achieve them faster and with ease. 
A clear workflow can help you to set up nuanced campaigns, which are typically cost-effective and highly successful. You can also leverage agile marketing to create a feedback loop that ensures your team works effectively and collaborates well with all involved parties.
