"Europe makes unicorns at almost twice the rate of the US, report finds",Siôn Geschwindt,2023/07/6,"
Europe finally has all the pieces in place to challenge the US as the world’s leading tech hub, according to an analysis from venture capital firm Creandum and Dealroom, released today. 
Europe’s total number of unicorns has grown 88% compared to the US’ 56% since 2014. Moreover, its share of global VC funding has quadrupled in the last 20 years — the continent now takes more than a third of global investments at early-stage.
According to the report, Europe has the highest density of tech unicorn cities globally — with 514 companies valued at $1bn or more spread across 65 cities in 25 countries. These include fintechs like Adyen, Revolut, Klarna, Pleo and iZettle; digital health startups like Kry and Doctolib; and enterprise software startups like Factorial, Personio, and UiPath.
“In just 20 years, Europe has gone from being an outsider to a global challenger,” said Staffan Helgesson, general partner at Creandum — the first VC to invest in European success story Spotify. 
While Europe is clearly doing a good job at producing world-leading companies, its biggest strength lies in emerging sectors like fintech, quantum computing, and climate tech, says the report. It already accounts for around a third of global funding in these key emerging industries, while the continent is home to half of the world’s top science clusters focused on these sectors. 
Climate tech especially has remained a key growth area despite the venture downturn, with 22% of total European funding going into climate tech in 2023 versus 7% for the US. Given that the climate transition is poised to transform industries, Europe’s strength in this sector alone presents a “huge opportunity” in the years to come, says the report. 
“We’re confident that in the next 20 years, Europe can take the lead in emerging tech sectors, including digital health, climate tech, fintech, and AI, that are critical to our economies and lives,” said Helgesson.

Spotify CEO’s startup for AI-powered preventive healthcare raises €60M,Linnea Ahlgren,2023/07/5,"
Spotify founder and CEO Daniel Ek’s preventive healthcare startup just received a very strong vote of confidence from venture capitalists. Earlier today, Neko Health announced it had raised €60mn in a round led by Lakestar and backed by Atomico and General Catalyst. 
The funds will be put towards expanding the concept outside of the company’s native Sweden, where it currently operates a private body-scan clinic. 
Neko Health, named after the Japanese word for cat, was founded in 2018 by Ek and Hjalmar Nilsonne. After much secrecy, its first clinic opened in February this year in Stockholm. Within two hours, it was fully booked out and 5,000 people were placed on a waiting list. 
“I’ve spent more than 10 years exploring the untapped potential of healthcare innovation,” Ek said in a statement. “We are dedicated to building a healthcare system that focuses on prevention and patient care, aiming to serve not just our generation, but those that follow.”
3D body scans
At the clinic, people go through a 3D full-body scan in a minimalist booth that would not look out of place in an episode of Star Trek, fitted with dozens of sensors and powered by, you guessed it, artificial intelligence. In particular, algorithms can immediately detect potential skin conditions and risk of cardiovascular disease. 
Patients (are they still called that in preventative care?) also go through laser scans and an ECG, which, altogether, takes between 10 and 20 minutes. They may not be met by Bones himself after the examinations, but their results are looked over and explained by an actual, human, doctor. 
“We have our own nurses, doctors and specialists,” Nilsonne told Bloomberg. “We have dermatologists employed just to review the skin images. There is a doctor on site who can make qualified medical judgments for anything that comes up.”
The price for a Neko Health assessment is €250, and the company has performed over 1,000 scans since launch. Close to 80% of customers have reportedly prepaid for follow-up scans after a year. 
AI does indeed hold great potential for disease prevention and early detection — but only if the results are interpretable. It is unclear how much insight Neko Health physicians have into how the algorithm makes its predictions (as in, which factor contributes to the risk of cardiovascular disease so the patient/client can be better informed about what measures to take).
Purpose and ambition
One of the company’s backers is Skype co-founder and founder of Atomico, Niklas Zennström, who will also be taking a seat on the board. He sees enormous potential in the new venture from the man who essentially changed how we consume music. 
“Neko Health is exactly the type of mission that gets us excited at Atomico. It’s that rare combination of a firm with a purpose and outsized ambition, and founders with a world class track record,” Zennström said. “They’re solving a problem we can all relate to, with the potential to fundamentally transform global healthcare forever.”

The startups on a mission to upgrade Ireland’s meagre EV charging network,Chris Baraniuk,2023/07/5,"
Next month, 50 homeowners in Ireland will start renting out their home electric car charging points to their neighbours with the help of a new app. It’s “the Airbnb of electric vehicle (EV) home chargers,” says GoPlugable co-founder Maebh Reynolds.
The app’s trial launch will be limited to that first group of 50 people who have their own charging point at home, and around 50 people with electric cars who would like to park up and pay to use them. If all goes well, a wider public launch could follow in September or October. 
“We are drastically falling behind in terms of public charger availability,” says Reynolds of the charging network in Northern Ireland, as she explains why she and her co-founder decided to develop the app. “For a lot of people, it’s the main reason why they won’t switch to electric vehicles.”
Such is the dearth of charging points that Reynolds says she has heard from individuals in Ireland who are already handing over cash to neighbours with chargers on an ad hoc basis, just so they can juice up their EV. In the GoPlugable app, such neighbours are defined as “hosts,” and the platform is designed to help them manage payments and advertise their charging point to more EV owners in their area. 
To date, Belfast-based GoPlugable has raised £50,000 via competitions and grants, and the company has a headcount of two co-founders and two interns.
Worst in Europe?
It’s just one of many private businesses aiming to improve the EV charging network across Ireland. In Northern Ireland, there are 20 public charging points per 100,000 people — far below the UK average of 60 per 100,000. And last year, price comparison service Uswitch named the Republic of Ireland the worst place to own an EV out of a list of 34 European countries.
In the Republic, 80% of charging occurs at home, which suggests a severe lack of public charging infrastructure. The Irish Electric Vehicle Association estimates that there are around 2,000 public chargers in the country – but not many of them are rapid chargers. 
These devices can fully power up some EV batteries in less than an hour. But in the Republic, a country of five million people, there are only a few hundred such chargers available to the public, though this number is set to more than double under government plans.
GoPlugable’s approach is based on opening up access to domestic chargers in communities in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Hosts will be able to set whatever price they like for, say, a 60-minute charge, says Reynolds, and EV owners will have to go through identity verification and submit their vehicle registration to the app before being able to book a slot.
This might be convenient if you live near someone with a charger who’s willing to rent it out – but what if you just need some power, quickly, while out and about? 
“There needs to be some good on-street solutions, possibly some good local hubs,” says Jade Edwards, head of insights at Zapmap, which has charted the location of thousands of public chargers around the island of Ireland.
If hubs are the answer, someone is going to have to build them. Weev, a Belfast-based startup recently received £50 million in funding from UK energy firm Octopus to greatly scale up the EV charging network in public areas in Northern Ireland. The firm will focus on establishing hub-style sites with multiple chargers, including at locations along major arterial routes.
The need is growing. EV ownership is rising in Northern Ireland at a noticeably high rate – with a 72% increase in battery electric vehicle registrations there in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021.
“We have about 30 sites at the moment with 70 public chargers,” says Weev chief executive Philip Rainey. “Moving from that position to having over 3,000 chargers around the province is the challenge.”

Don’t make me wait
Weev wants to achieve this in just three years and the vast majority of chargers will be rapid chargers, he emphasises. The devices are popular with users because they let them power up their vehicles even while making a quick visit to a shop or while attending a work event at a hotel, for example. The company currently has a headcount of just over 20 people but is planning to increase this to 50 during the next 12 months.
One huge hurdle in Northern Ireland, according to the Electric Vehicle Association Northern Ireland (EVANI), a non-profit, is the sheer cost of setting up new connection infrastructure whenever someone decides to build an EV charging hub. 
Unlike the rest of the UK or Ireland, in Northern Ireland, installers must sometimes stump up 100% of the funds required for upgrading the electricity network in the area in order to connect the new chargers to it. Elsewhere, such costs are often “socialised” or spread across multiple users of the network.
It is a kind of “first mover disadvantage”, argues Mark McCall, EVANI co-founding director and chairman: “Not only does that affect EVs, it affects connection of wind turbines and heat pumps, solar — all these low-carbon technologies.”
Depending on the scale and location of the hub, it could mean that the price tag for installing it runs into the millions whereas, in Great Britain, the same hub might only cost a few hundred thousand pounds to set up, EVANI suggests.
TNW asked NIE Networks, which owns the electricity network in Northern Ireland, for comment on this situation but did not receive a response. 
Charging ahead
Rainey says that Weev intends to be “strategic” about where it sites new hubs, and will piggyback on under-used electricity network infrastructure at certain locations, to avoid excessive charges for new connections.
Meanwhile, in the Republic of Ireland, there is also a huge push to improve the public EV charging network, says Ricky Hill, Ireland Country Manager at Monta, a Danish startup that has developed software to help charging point operators manage their devices.
“We know we need to put more in because the rate that EVs are being bought now is really increasing,” he says, adding that Monta covers just under 3,000 charging points across the island of Ireland. Within 18 months, that number should rise to between 17,000 and 20,000 chargers, estimates Hill. Monta employs 170 people and has raised €50 million to date.
The company’s software gives operators a live view of available charging points on their own network, including whether a specific charger is currently in use, and any indications of downtime. 
In the near future, the platform will introduce new features such as smart charging based on variable energy prices, says Hill. In total, Monta helps to manage 90,000 chargers, most of which are in Europe, where growth of EV charging infrastructure has, in general, been “phenomenal” lately, says Hill. 
Ireland might have been slow off the mark — but it now seems ready to join the EV party in earnest.

Cycles Peugeot unveils new e-bike range amid growing demand for green transport,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/07/4,"
Cycles Peugeot has unveiled a new range of “digital” e-bikes designed to meet the increasing demand for cleaner, greener, healthier (and sometimes quicker) modes of urban mobility.
In 2022, the European market for electrically-assisted bicycles reached a record 5.5 million units sold, representing an annual growth of 8.6%. One in every four bikes sold in Europe last year was electric. 
Cycles Peugeot, which branched out from the popular French car brand over 100 years ago, will launch “several new innovative models” in late 2023 and early 2024 to cater to this growing market.  
Of the new range, details and renders of three have been disclosed: a city commuter e-bike, a long-tail cargo e-bike, and a front-loader cargo e-bike.

The commuter looks very futuristic but is, for all intents and purposes, a normal e-bike — albeit with a belt instead of a chain, for added robustness. The other two are more heavy-duty. 
The long-tail cargo e-bike still looks and handles much like a regular bike but is especially helpful for commuters looking for extra carrying capacity.

The front-loader on the other hand has a big box slung out in front which can swallow a tonne of stuff. While it might look a bit ungainly, due to the low centre of gravity of the cargo hold, these front-loaders are surprisingly nimble. In fact, they are increasingly popular throughout Europe as “car replacement” bikes.  
According to Amsterdam-based automotive giant Stellantis, which owns the Peugeot brand, both cargo bikes can comfortably carry your weekly shopping or haul two or three kids to and from daycare.

All of Peugeot’s new e-bikes feature smartphone integration. Via a proprietary app, users can configure a myriad of settings, as well as view the bike’s real-time location, access navigation, toggle weather forecast data, and view ride stats.
The e-bike trio will be designed and manufactured by connected e-bike and app startup Beweelsociety but bear the Cycles Peugeot brand. 
The French startup has developed connected e-bikes as well as an app that provides financing, insurance, maintenance, and anti-theft services for cyclists. This year it was one of ten startups to receive funding under Stellantis’ €300m mobility innovation fund.   
Cycles Peugeot hasn’t announced prices for the new e-bikes yet, but the company is showing off the new designs this week at the PRO-DAYS show in Paris.

Dutch students smash world record for most efficient hydrogen car,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/07/4,"
A student team from the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands has set a new Guinness world record for the longest distance driven by a hydrogen car without refuelling.
The student team, called Eco-Runner, succeeded in driving their ultra-efficient city car no less than 2,488.4 km in three days using just one kilogram of hydrogen fuel — equivalent to driving from Berlin to Istanbul. The marathon feat, which took place from 23-25 June, smashed the previous record of 2,055.7 km.

The team headed to a race track in southern Germany for the world record attempt, as part of Shell’s annual Eco-Marathon, a competition that challenges students to design, build, and race fuel-efficient cars. Eleven drivers took turns navigating the same 5 km lap in two-hour shifts, totalling 71.5 hours of day and night driving. 
Eco-Runner spent the last year designing, constructing, testing, and racing the hydrogen-powered vehicle in a bid to bring home the trophy. It is one of several hydrogen cars developed by the student team in recent years.  
The latest vehicle — dubbed the ECXIII — is an ultra-lightweight, compact microcar that tips the scales at just 72 kg thanks to its carbon fibre hull. The vehicle converts hydrogen into electric energy, producing only water vapour and heat as byproducts.

Eco-Runner sees its tiny hydrogen car as a vision of a future where “all cars are smaller, lighter, and aerodynamic,” with the focus being  on “shared mobility” as “people deal with transport more sustainability and efficiently.” 
While most of the emphasis in the passenger car segment has been on EVs, the team at Eco-Runner believes that hydrogen-powered city cars also have a place on the tarmac. 
“Electric cars are also part of the solution for sustainable mobility, but the electricity grid is already filling up,” said operations manager Eliane van Boxtel. “Electrifying the whole world is not an option. Hydrogen and electric cars go hand in hand. There is no one big winner.” 
Representatives for the Guinness World Records supervised the record attempt and officially recognised the achievement.

This startup’s nanotech is creating new materials for the energy transition,Linnea Ahlgren,2023/07/4,"
Humanity has always relied on a revolution in materials to advance to the next stage of civilisation. Dutch nanoparticle technology startup VSParticle says it is on the verge of opening up a century’s worth of material innovation in the next 10 years, helping, well, to save the planet. 
Co-founder and CEO Aaike van Vugt is convinced that in order to reach our targets of keeping global warming well below 2°C, we need to speed up the process of material development significantly. 
“The amount of material innovation that we need to unlock in the next decades to make the whole energy transition a reality is equal to what would normally be unlocked in 100 years,” van Vugt tells TNW.  “What is very important is that we fundamentally change the process in which we are producing new materials.”
A TU Delft spinout founded in 2014, the company just secured €14.5 million in a funding round led by Plural. The money will be used to scale VSP’s nanoparticle technology that allows it to print new materials consisting of any combination of 64 different elements. The company says it is looking to first help solve crucial issues related to sustainability and energy transition. 
Speeding up the green hydrogen economy
Specifically, VSParticle is looking at the development of catalyst coated membranes (CCMs). These are a crucial component in proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis, a technology used for green hydrogen production. Furthermore, the company says its technology will accelerate the production of new gas sensors that could detect air pollution, but also early signs of illness from human breath. 
In the case of CCM technology, it relies on using scarce and expensive metals such as platinum and iridium. However, VSP’s technology, which enables materials to be broken down to nanoparticles and then re-composed in different configurations, will help develop new material combinations incredibly quickly. This, the company says, will make it more affordable to scale production. 
In turn, this will support the EU mission of producing 10 million tonnes of green hydrogen per year by 2030. In addition, this type of innovation could make the bloc less reliant on access to rare minerals from outside for things such as semiconductors, and avoid potential future conflicts related to raw materials. 
A nanoparticle “big bang”
The basis for all of VSParticle’s products is the VSP-G1, a “table-top, user-friendly nanoparticle generator.” This features a plug-and-play electrode system that enables the user to quickly and easily change the material, and it is compatible with 62 different elements, including gold, zinc, copper, and palladium. Solid rods of the material to be processed are inserted into the system. Then, there is what van Vugt calls a “Big Bang.” 
“An electrical spark creates a very localised, very intense hot plasma going up to 20,000 degrees Celsius. And this is basically breaking up the basic structure of the metal to the most preliminary form — the atoms,” van Vugt says. “So you get an evaporated cloud of this material and out of this evaporated cloud, we control the formation of these nanoparticles, which are our universal building blocks.”   
Aaike van Vugt co-founded the company in 2014. Credit: VSParticle
These building blocks are then used by the VSP-P1 NanoPrinter. The machine, which ships to customers this year, functions similarly to a regular office inkjet printer. Except, it doesn’t use four basic colours to come up with an array of hues. 
In a fully-automated process, it takes nanoparticles from any of the 64 different elements and combines them into entirely different materials. Essentially, you could put a million machines to work on developing new combinations, and they would just keep going. 
Uncovering vast inorganic potential
VSParticle has already proven that it can reduce the material production and discovery cycle from months to only an hour. The technology bridges trial and error in the lab, production process optimisation and scaling towards mass production and its potential, according to van Vugt, is nothing short of monumental. 
“With all the work we have done as human beings, we have only unlocked less than 1% of what is possible in the inorganic space. And what we are trying to do is to develop the best process — we call it our automated or self-driving lab — that is able to screen let’s say the other 99% of possibilities that haven’t been discovered so far.” 
VSParticle has participated in MIT’s student venture accelerator DELTA V and is part of the Netherlands’ Techleap Pole Position cohort for deep tech startups. The latest funding round includes a €3.5 million grant from NXTGEN HIGHTECH, and brings the total amount raised by the company to €17 million.

"Grocery delivery app Getir exits Spain, after bidding adieu to France",Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/07/3,"
Following its upcoming exit from France, quick commerce startup Getir is losing yet another European market: Spain.
According to Spanish trade union CCOO, Getir failed to raise sufficient capital in a recent funding round. As a result, it will cease operations in the country and lay off its entire workforce of 1,560 employees.
“We condemn the disastrous business management of Getir, which has not known how to grow or have a market strategy in Spain. Now its staff will suffer the biggest harm,” the union said in a statement.
The Turkish-owned Getir Group emerged as the greatest rapid grocery delivery company in Europe, expanding across seven countries and gradually absorbing rival Gorillas and Frichti. It even reached decacorn status, after achieving a $12bn (€11bn) in March 2022. But in the post-pandemic world it has struggled to reach profitability.
The soaring inflation, stricter regulations on “dark stores” (where the products are stored before delivery), and consumer return to in-person grocery shopping have left quick commerce companies hanging in the balance.
With its user base and revenue in decline, the Getir group has moved to layoffs and mass store closures over the past few months. In France alone, the company counts €17.6mn in debt and was placed in receivership by the court of trade in Paris.
At the moment of writing, the startup has declined to comment on its upcoming exit from Spain. But according to the CCOO, it will comply with the national legal requirements for laid-off employees. These include an outplacement plan, 20 days’ severance pay per year with a maximum of 12 monthly payments, and a special agreement for individuals aged over 55.
Getir’s example proves an overarching trend in Europe: the appetite for rapid grocery delivery is fading away. Alongside Flink, Zapp, and Gopuff, Getir is among the last remaining companies in the region — where it seems that the quick commerce bubble is bursting.

Digital euro framework seeks to quell privacy concerns,Thomas Macaulay,2023/06/29,"
The digital euro is edging closer to reality, despite concerns over the project’s privacy risks and functionality.
The European Commission on Wednesday proposed a legal framework for the electronic currency. Under the draft legislation, digital euros would be accepted for transactions anywhere in the eurozone, but cash would remain safeguarded as a form of payment. It would then be up to the European Central Bank (ECB) to decide if, and when, to issue the digital currency.
“In the euro area, the digital euro would offer a digital payment solution that is available to everyone, everywhere, for free,” said Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Commission’s executive vice president.
According to Dombrovskis, the project will modernise payments, enhance financial inclusion, and support innovation. He also emphasised the need to protect the eurozone from rival digital payment systems.
“If other central bank digital currencies were allowed to be used more widely for cross-border payments, we would risk diminishing the attractiveness of the euro… and the euro could become more exposed to competition from alternatives such as global stablecoins,” he said.
Unlike cryptocurrencies, the digital euro would be backed by a central bank. That could reduce volatility, but it’s triggered anxieties about government control.
These concerns are prevalent across the bloc. In a consultation last year, 43% of respondents said privacy was what they wanted most from the digital euro. The next most desired features were security (18%), usability across the euro area (11%), absence of additional costs (9%), and offline use (8%).
The share of citizens per country who ranked privacy as the most important feature of a digital euro.
Privacy advocates have raised fears about monitoring transactions and government control of personal finances. Other critics question whether the bloc needs its own digital currency. They argue that existing digital payments already provide sufficient functionality. 
In response, the EU has added various safeguards and features.
To allay the privacy concerns, lawmakers have promised that ECB would not see users’ personal details or their payment patterns.
Users will also be able to pay offline. Officials say this will provide greater privacy than any current digital payment methods. They also argue that the digital euro will reduce payment-related fees for consumers by spurring competition for the likes of Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal.
Mairead McGuinness, the EU’s financial regulation chief, describes the digital euro as “a project of choice” rather than “a project of control. “
“By complementing cash, I have no doubt that a digital euro will bring advantages to citizens and businesses across the EU,” she said. “But I am aware that it requires peoples’ trust and confidence.”
That process remains a long way from completion. The proposal will now go to the European Parliament and EU member states for amendments, which provides another opportunity to address concerns.

Opinion: European startups should welcome global tech layoffs with open arms,Janis Kreilis,2023/06/29,"
Like a runaway train, the tech sector’s layoff spree shows no sign of hitting the brakes in 2023. Layoffs.fyi found that between January and May this year, more than 200,000 people around the world found themselves on the wrong end of the pink slip.
Echoing through the industry like a gong are the layoffs from big tech. Silicon Valley giants collectively slashed over 104,000 roles last year, and these cutbacks are far from over. Meta, for instance, began a round of layoffs last month targeting up to 6,000 people, as part of plans to eliminate 21,000 total roles across a so-called year of efficiency. 
To some degree, this was expected — publicly-listed tech titans sway to the tune of the stock market, and it’s been a bear market since January 2022. And it’s not just the giants in the forest facing this storm. The saplings are bending, too. 
Startups in Europe collectively cut over 40,000 jobs between March 2022 and March 2023. For example, the Netherlands-based MessageBird laid off 31% of its staff (approximately 250 people) in November 2022, while Spain’s Glovo cut loose 250 people in January this year.
It’s high time for Europeans to sound the alarm — just not the kind you might think.
The European layoff landscape – not quite the apocalypse
First off, most job cuts are happening outside of Europe. 
According to Atomico’s State of European Tech report for 2022, only 7% of the global workforce cutbacks have been in Europe. Similarly, Layoffs.fyi data for the past two years show that only roughly 12% of all laid-off workers were based in Europe.
Even global tech giants with offices in Europe are letting go of fewer employees here than anywhere else — and there are two main reasons for that.
First of all, companies like Amazon and Google are finding it hard to copy and paste their mass layoff tactics in Europe, thanks to the continent’s labour protections. 
For example, Google’s branches in France and Germany haven’t had any staff reductions in 2023, and the company has announced that no layoffs are planned in Romania, Greece, or Austria. In the UK, on the other hand, the labour protection regulations aren’t as robust since Brexit, thus Google plans to bid adieu to around 500 of its 8,000 employees there.
Secondly, in Europe, tech talents such as sales reps, software engineers, and systems analysts are still in very high demand. In Q4 last year when the global mass layoffs took up the speed, there were still close to a million open vacancies in tech across 11 EU countries analysed by trade association CompTIA. 
In addition, a DESI report showed that European companies had a hard time filling these roles. Around 55% of enterprises that recruited or tried to recruit ICT specialists said they found it difficult. 
In other words, the EU’s tech layoffs are a drop in the ocean compared to the tech talent shortage in the bloc, which is predicted to reach 3.9 million people by 2027. This explains why, amid the talent crunch in Europe, tech companies, both big and small, are cautious when it comes to workforce reductions. If hiring is already painful, firing is even more so. 
The global talent bazaar: Can Europe fill its talent gap?
American companies are letting people go, while Europe desperately lacks talent. Doesn’t that sound like a perfect match? This is Europe’s chance to attract the talent American companies have hired, trained for the tech industry, and then dropped like a hot potato.
And it gets better. Global tech talents are showing interest in joining European companies, either by relocating or working remotely. According to the Landing.jobs report, 34.1% of respondents listed Europe as their preferred continent to work, while North America ranked second with 24.9%.
Europe’s allure is a rich tapestry of factors, from its employee-friendly labour laws to its emphasis on work-life balance. And in these tough economic times, European startups have become attractive to the global talent pool for another reason — higher job security.
For decades, European startups have had comparatively limited access to later-stage capital. While American founders developed and adopted the hyper-growth mindset, European companies learned to survive by prioritising profit. Compared to their American counterparts, European founders are more cautious. While this often holds them back, this time it has paid off – we’re seeing fewer layoffs and employees, as a result, can be more confident about holding onto their jobs.
With global talent eyeing Europe, and European companies growing increasingly open to hiring remotely to fill the talent gap, it looks like a win-win. Besides, the fact that mass layoffs have affected even major tech companies has shattered people’s illusions of “job security” in big tech. This, ironically, makes the prospect of joining a smaller startup seem less of a gamble. Thus, it’s the chance of a lifetime for early-stage startups to hire talent they otherwise might not be able to attract.

"Flying car startup eyes 2025 takeoff following US, EU certification",Siôn Geschwindt,2023/06/28,"
Flying cars have captured the public imagination for decades, but have yet to enter the mainstream. However, with investors pouring cash into the sector, could the 2020s be the decade when sci-fi vision becomes reality? German startup Lilium certainly hopes so. 
The startup announced this week that the design of its all-electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) jet has been approved by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Lilium’s primary airworthiness authority, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), issued its approval — known as a ‘certification basis’ — for the jet in 2020.   
Lilium, which has raised a whopping $1bn to date since its founding in 2015, has developed an eVTOL jet — which differs from the helicopter-style craft developed by most eVTOL startups —  that it hopes will take passengers faster and further than the competition. It aims to begin commercial flights from late 2025.

But the startup has little control over this timeline, regulators do. Regulators oversee every component of these machines, from the engines to software, and make the final call of whether an aircraft meets all the stringent requirements for commercial flight.  
Achieving certification basis is the first step on this complicated, and expensive, journey. Essentially it means that both the FAA and the EASA have approved Lilium’s jet design as commercially viable. However, there are still three more steps to go before the authorities issue a type certificate — the golden ticket to the skies. The certification process can cost hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Despite the hurdles ahead, Lilium CEO Klaus Roewe is confident. “Receiving the FAA G-1 demonstrates the Lilium Jet’s path to global acceptance by aerospace regulators and the expected start of global operations in late 2025 for the revolutionary Lilium Jet,” he said. 
Whether the startup can secure enough of a runway to pay for certification, while growing its team and developing its product, is anyone’s guess. But if the track record of other eVTOL ventures is anything to go by, I would take Lilium’s 2025 target with a pinch of salt.

The next trip you book online could be planned with ChatGPT,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/06/28,"
AI’s use in travel apps is nothing new — just think about the destination or hotel recommendations you get when booking a trip. But recent advances in generative AI are further shaking the sector.
Booking.com is the latest major travel agent to test the potential of the tech. Starting on June 28, the company is offering a beta AI trip planner, built upon its existing machine learning models and partially powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT.
In essence, the planner is a conversational chatbot that’s designed to help consumers across the entire scope of the trip planning process.
“We’re able to start having scalable, one-to-one conversations with our customers on their terms, much like how you would begin to talk about planning a trip with your partner or friends,” said Rob Francis, Booking’s CTO.
Travellers can converse with the planner, which can in turn provide travel inspiration and suggest destinations, accommodation, and trip itineraries in real-time based on their needs and desires. Users can also refine their search options, see property prices, and book their stay directly.

The pilot AI trip planner will become available to a growing number of US-based members of the Genius loyalty programme over the coming weeks, while it’s still unknown if the company’s planning to expand its rollout to other regions. The feature will be accessible on Booking’s app, initially offered in English.
Other competing online travel agents like Expedia, Kayak, and Trip.com have already integrated ChatGPT plug-ins with offerings ranging from flight and accommodation information to reservations and itineraries.
Booking said its new tool “is just the beginning,” and it’s by no means far-fetched to envision AI emerging as the ultimate travel assistant — even though some of us would still prefer the joy of planning a trip the old fashioned way.
For now, however, ChatGPT’s ability to access data only until September 2021 presents a significant limitation for the ever-changing travel sector, where information needs to be up to date to be fully useful.

Meet the robots attending the UN’s ‘AI for Good Global’ summit,Thomas Macaulay,2023/06/27,"
Some of the world’s leading human and robot minds are heading to the United Nations.
At a UN summit in Geneva next week, tech luminaries ranging from futurist Ray Kurzweil to DeepMind COO Lila Ibrahim will discuss AI for good. It’s a stellar lineup of speakers, but the real stars in our eyes are the robots.
Over 50 of the beasts — the majority from Europe — will be in attendance. All of them merit places in your dreams and nightmares, but we’ve narrowed the roster down to a list of our 10 favourites.
1. Sophia

Sophia is arguably the planet’s most famous real-world robot — but it’s attracted controversy. Saudia Arabia notoriously granted citizenship to the android in 2017, giving it more rights than millions of humans in the country.
Meta’s chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, has described Sophia as “complete bullshit” and slated the media for promoting the “Potemkin AI.” Nonetheless, the humanoid’s influence and fame earn it a place on our list. Sorry, Yann.
2. Ameca

Ameca’s eerily realistic facial expressions went viral back in 2021. Built in the UK by Engineered Arts, the bot was designed as a platform for developing robotics.
The system integrates both AI and AB (artificial body) within a human form and robotic visage. Ameca’s creators claim it’s the world’s most advanced human-shaped robot.
3. Spot

Unless you’ve been hiding from the AI apocalypse under a rock, you’ll recognise Spot. The star attraction of the esteemed Boston Dynamics brand, the quadruped is primarily used for dangerous inspection jobs.
Despite the cute name and resemblance to a dog, Spot’s a menacing creature. Campaigners have warned that the bot could be weaponised — particularly after it was tested by the French Army.
4. Geminoid

Perhaps the creepiest member of our list, Geminoid is a robotic copy of its creator, Hiroshi Ishiguro.
Geminoid reproduces the voice and head movements of Ishiguro, who added hair from his own scalp to his android twin. According to Ishiguro, the robot was designed to study what it means to be human.
5. Nao

A legend in its field, Nao has been wowing observers for almost 20 years. The bipedal has attracted headlines for its synchronised dances, stand-up comedy, and soccer skills,  but  biggest impact is in education and research.
The device was developed by Aldebaran Robotics in France, which was acquired by SoftBank in 2015 and rebranded as SoftBank Robotics.
6. Ai-Da

Touted as the “world’s first robot artist,” Ai-Da draws and paints using robotic arms, cameras in its eyes, and algorithms guiding its movements.
The android is something of a celebrity in its home country of the UK, becoming the first robot to speak in the House of Lords. Unfortunately, the publicity stunt feat lost some lustre when Ai-Da appeared to fall asleep and had to be rebooted.
7. Furhat

A social robot, Furhat communicates with us humans as we do with each other: by speaking, listening, showing emotions, and maintaining eye contact.
We’re particularly impressed by the system’s adaptability. Furhat’s ethnicity, gender, and language can all be modified to create lifelike, expressive characters for numerous purposes. In the image above, for instance, the droid appears to be a resurrected Silvio Berlusconi.
8. Roboclette

Everyone loves a world-first, especially when it’s vital to humanity. That’s why we’re bewitched by Roboclette — the first machine capable of scraping melted cheese.
The system blends the expertise of cheesemaker Eddy Baillifard with robotic wizardry from the Idiap Research Institute to carve Swiss raclettes.
9. Pepper

Another graduate of Aldebaran, Pepper is a semi-humanoid that’s designed to read emotions.
The droid’s remarkable life spanned work in a grocery store, a stint as a Buddhist priest, and a speech in the British Parliament. Sadly, the good times couldn’t last forever. In 2021, production of Pepper was halted due to weak demand.
10. Paro Seal

The brainchild of engineer Takanori Shibata, Paro is a therapeutic robot seal. The device has proven popular with patients, but raised concerns about using machines for emotional support.
Paro won a spot in our top 10 after pipping the Therabot puppy to the title of cutest automaton at the UN.

German startup raises €430M to create ‘virtual power plant’ for your home,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/06/26,"
Hamburg-based 1KOMMA5° is the latest startup to join the expanding club of climate tech unicorns, after bagging €430m in fresh funding.  
Founded just 23 months ago, the startup’s main product is Heartbeat, an IoT device that acts as the air traffic control of your home’s energy system. The device connects your solar panels with other energy infrastructure such as energy storage, car chargers, and heat pumps, and optimises the whole system.
By intelligently linking all the energy devices in the home, 1KOMMA5° aims to not just decarbonise the energy grid (and keep global warming within 1.5 °C — as the company name suggests), but save you money in the process. 
It does this through what the company calls “energy system optimisation” — in other words, boosting the overall efficiency of the electric devices in your home. 
Heartbeat deploys several techniques to ease your electricity bill, including automatically purchasing power when it is cheap (on a windy day for instance) and selling excess power back to the grid when the price is favourable. The device is claimed to save homeowners €1,550 on their energy bill each year. Heartbeat comes with an app which gives real-time access to energy flows and historical data.

Through its interconnected energy system, 1KOMMA5° is creating what is known as a “virtual power plant” — a system that brings together multiple independent energy sources and helps balance supply and demand more efficiently.  
Founder and CEO Philipp Schröder —  a former Tesla country director — has been working hard to secure capital for the new venture, and seems to be doing a good job.  
Last year, the startup raised €200m in a funding round featuring the likes of Porsche and Norrsken Foundation. The latest round was led by California-based fund G2VP, and comprises €215m in equity, and a further €215m in buyback options.  
“The 1.5° climate target needs speed in execution and with this round we are delivering our contribution to make as many buildings CO2 neutral as quickly as possible,” said Schröder.
With the new funding, 1KOMMA5° intends to make Heartbeat compatible with existing energy devices, thus expanding its reach and impact. Furthermore, its investing an undisclosed amount into a new R&D site in Berlin.

"Apple’s Vision Pro can boost Europe’s XR kingpin — in the short-term, at least",Thomas Macaulay,2023/06/26,"
The Vision Pro arrived with great fanfare. At the launch event in California on June 5, Apple CEO Tim Cook described the new headset as a “revolutionary” device that heralds a “new era of spatial computing”. Bold claims indeed, but Apple’s track record lends them credibility. 
The tech giant has already redefined music players, tablets, laptops, desktops, smartwatches, and headphones. Analysts are now proclaiming an “iPhone moment” for extended reality (XR). 
Across the Atlantic, the launch was being watched closely by Europe’s XR kingpin: Varjo. The Helsinki-based startup claims to produce the world’s most advanced VR and XR. But it now faces competition from the biggest company on the planet.

When Apple revealed the Vision Pro’s cost, the announcement drew an audible gasp from the audience. At a whopping $3,499 (€3,238) the headset is strictly for big spenders. But the impressive specs, the mix of VR and AR, and the focus beyond gaming have triggered comparisons with an even pricier device: Varjo’s €6,495 XR-3.
Nonetheless, Varjo (pronounced “var-yo”) remains bullish. Rather than view the Vision Pro entry as a threat, the company hopes Apple’s arrival will turbocharge the sector.
“Apple’s entrance into XR with Vision Pro is an important moment for our whole industry,” said Urho Konttori, Varjo’s CTO and co-founder. 
“Mixed reality is already a fixture in the enterprise sector… We hope today is the turning point for consumers when it starts being part of their everyday lives too, with promising applications for entertainment, personal productivity, and communication.”
Such public positivity was expected from Varjo. But it’s been echoed in the thoughts of external experts.
Varjo says the XR-3 delivers “the most immersive mixed reality experience ever constructed.” Credit: Varjo
“I expect that, in the short term at least, Vision Pro will largely create opportunities for other businesses by raising the profile of XR generally,” Sam Dale, a technology analyst at market research firm IDTechE, told TNW. “This includes Varjo, which I believe targets a substantially different customer type to the Vision Pro.”
Indeed, Varjo has been laser-focused on high-demanding enterprises. The company says over a quarter of the Fortune 100 is using Varjo today, as well as various government departments. The Vision Pro, meanwhile, has been promoted as a more general computing system, suitable for use cases ranging from a workstation to an entertainment device.


“We’re shaving off huge amounts of time and costs.


Varjo has eschewed these consumer applications. All the company’s customers have sky-high requirements — sometimes literally. In aviation, the tech is used to train pilots without the need for lengthy travel and expensive simulators. In 2021, the system was certified for civil aviation training in the EU — an endorsement that rival products won’t gain overnight.
Varjo also had to overcome large entry barriers in other sectors, such as the defence and automotive industries. According to the company, 15 of the 20 largest carmakers in the world now use the tech to build and sell their vehicles. Again, the savings can be immense — but only if the XR accurately reflects reality.
“You see every contour of the car, you see every flake of paint,” Timo Toikkanen, Varjo’s CEO, told TNW. “We’re obviously shaving off huge amounts of time and costs from that process.”
Toikkanen was an executive at Finnish phone giant Nokia before joining Varjo. Credit: Varjo
The effects were certainly impressive in our demo of the tech. On a sunny day in London, England, TNW tested out the XR-3 at the offices of VC firm Atomico, which led a $31 million (€28 million) investment round in Varjo in 2018. 
After strapping on and calibrating the headset, a  photorealistic sports car appeared on the meeting room floor. Using hand gestures, we unlocked the doors to admire the vehicle’s interior. 
Seconds later, we were transported to the iconic Silverstone motor racing circuit. The same car was parked in front of our eyes, but now reflecting its virtual surroundings.
Aside from a flicker of sunlight shining onto the display, the experience was remarkably lifelike. The image resolution, field of view, depth perception, and eye and hand tracking were all superior to any other XR device we’ve tried. But then again, we’re yet to have a go on the Vision Pro.
Varjo headsets include the mixed reality XR-3 (centre), and two virtual reality devices: the VR-3 (left), and the Aero (right). Credit: Varjo
Apple’s XR device has impressed both early users and analysts. But the tech differs significantly from Varjo’s.
Dale notes that Varjo headsets connect to external gaming PCs via cables to receive computing power. The Vision Pro, however, does this internally. That makes it more portable and the power is substantial. But even Apple’s high-end silicon is unlikely to match the performance of elite PCs.


“I think it’s primarily a developer device.


Another difference is that the Vision Pro is more of a personal system. People with bad eyesight will require prescription inserts, and further individual customisations may be needed. In contrast, Varjo’s headsets can be worn over glasses and shared between multiple users.
“Varjo’s headsets will likely beat the Vision Pro in top-end image quality, but at the cost of a lot of hardware complexity, extra weight, and a price in at least the same range,” said Dale.
The companies have also trod divergent paths to their ecosystems. Varjo’s hardware relies on a broader, more open network of partners, including Steam for base stations. The systems interface with external hardware for user tracking
Apple’s headset, meanwhile, keeps everything self-contained within Apple’s own ecosystem. That will appeal to many existing Apple users and developers, but it could erect new barriers for enterprise customers. These companies often have complex needs and established systems outside Apple’s empire.
Founded in 2016, Varjo has a commercial headstart on Apple. Credit: Varjo
In time, Apple may shift focus to cheaper devices, mass consumption, and new segments. There are already reports that the company aims to release a more affordable headset by the end of 2025. Experts expect that the Vision Pro is merely a first step into extended reality.
That’s the prediction of Tom Furness, one of the sector’s leading luminaries. Known as the “grandfather” of VR and AR, Furness build the first helmet-mounted displays used by US Air Force pilots. He expects Apple to use the Vision Pro to refine the XR plans.
“I think it’s primarily a developer device,” Furness said at TNW Conference. 
Varjo will be keeping a close eye on the progress. As an established player with a strong customer base in highly-specialised industries, the company has found a niche that Apple is yet to target. 
While Apple’s unparalleled resources make it a threat to any XR incumbent, Varjo remains hopeful that the Vision Pro invigorates the entire sector — at least, for now.

Defying gravity: This UK-based startup is unlocking the potential of the space economy,Martin SFP Bryant,2023/06/22,"
This story is syndicated from the premium edition of PreSeed Now, a newsletter that digs into the product, market, and founder story of UK-founded startups so you can understand how they fit into what’s happening in the wider world and startup ecosystem.
The space race is back on, with a growing number of commercial operators keen to follow in SpaceX’s exhaust trail.
This means there’s real demand to accelerate the timelines for testing a wide range of devices and materials for use up in space. After our recent coverage of Space DOTS, let’s take a look at another company doing work in this field.
Gravitilab is opening up new opportunities for testing in microgravity — the weightlessness experienced in space, which can make anything we take up there work differently to how it does on Earth.
“All of the grand challenges facing humanity: climate change, feeding the world, healthcare challenges, and in our sector, space debris – they all require access to microgravity for research and testing,” says CEO Rob Adlard.
“And that market is really choked. In fact, it’s not a true market right now. And so we’re blowing this wide open with some new hardware and a new approach to it.”
Practically speaking, what Norfolk-based Gravitilab does is take a research experiment or a piece of industrial hardware from a customer, putting it in microgravity and then returning it with data about what happened.
To this end, the startup is developing two products. The first is a UAV called LOUIS that can generate a few seconds of microgravity without going into space (you might have seen this in the news a couple of months ago). 
The second is a suborbital launch vehicle called ISAAC that will take payloads into space for a few minutes before returning them.









Gravitilab’s ISAAC rocket, currently in development

Gravity distortion
“It’s funny, in a way. You think that everything that happens on Earth is perfectly natural, and it’s the way it’s meant to be. But actually gravity is a pollutant. And it stops us being able to see what the physics actually is,” explains Adlard.
“Microgravity is an absence of things that exist on Earth; buoyancy, hydrostatic pressure, and sedimentation. The absence of those three things make everything function differently… and it’s really quite surprising what happens. You couldn’t really guess what’s going to happen.”
Even chemical reactions can occur differently in space.
“You’re only doing chemistry until you’re doing it in microgravity, and then you’re doing physics,” Adlard jokes.
The opportunities here include supporting academic research and the burgeoning satellite industry.
On the academic side for example, Adlard says Gravitlab is working with Manchester University to replicate a lab experiment in space.
“It involves heating up some material. That’s quite a complicated thing to do on a spacecraft. So we’ve got to spend quite a long time developing a payload making that into something which is flyable.”
As for satellites, Adlard says the high failure rate of nanosatellites can be up to 50%. So, being able to test how they’ll handle the space environment before they’re deployed can save major headaches and yet more space debris later.
“There are 1,000 startups building new, innovative hardware that’s never been flown before. So there’s a great need to get all that done. We’re in the supply chain for the space economy.”









Rob Adlard

Rethinking suborbital rockets
Adlard co-founded Gravitilab in 2018 with the specific aim of tackling the queue of companies trying to get their products into the space economy, in the wake of the way SpaceX had rethought the sector.
With a background in aeronautics and space engineering, he began to consider new applications for an existing technology.
“I became very interested in what smaller rockets and suborbital rockets can do. In the past, suborbital rockets used to be just technology demonstrators – a stepping stone to something else. I think it’s only recently they’ve taken on this sort of different significance.
“If you said to anybody in the industry ‘would it be valuable to be able to put something into space for a few minutes and get it back in your hand the same day?’, everybody would say ‘yeah, oh my goodness, that’s incredible, what have you invented?’
“Well, it’s a suborbital rocket, which is something that people are familiar with, but nobody had thought about it in that way.”
Adlard met co-founder James Kilpatrick (now the company’s chair and CFO), and they established Gravitilab, initially under the name Raptor Aerospace. Once they’d figured out a clear path forward for the company, they rebranded to a name that better reflected their mission.









The Gravitilab team

Next steps
Adlard says Gravilab’s UAV, LOUIS, is being readied for an official launch into the market this summer.
“It took a lot longer to develop than expected,” he says. “It took about 18 months for us to get permission to do a first flight with it. And we needed to do the first flight in order to then develop all the rest of it.”
He says he’s looking forward to showing it off more, as many in the industry don’t understand clearly what it is yet.
While he prefers not to share too many details of exactly how it works, Adlard says this much: “essentially it overcomes the acceleration due to gravity, by accelerating at the appropriate rate so that the payload inside experiences the inverse of the acceleration of the vehicle.”
The startup is also developing a variant of LOUIS called JACQUES, which can provide ‘partial’ gravity, for customers who want to simulate gravity on the Moon or Mars.
The startup’s suborbital rocket, ISAAC, is a longer-term project. A new version of its engine is currently in development, with plans for a test flight in January next year.
Investment
As an early-stage startup in spacetech, Gravitilab has raised more than most startups we feature in PreSeed Now.
They’ve previously raised £2.2 million in investment. They’ve also won a recent grant of £400,000 from the UK Space Agency on top of previous business support grants from local authorities.
Gravitilab is now raising a £5 million round to accelerate its R&D phase and allow it to begin commercialisation. Adlard says there is a pipeline of customers lined up.
Vision
Adlard wants Gravitilab to penetrate deeper into the microgravity market over time. This will involve developing a larger vehicle to support larger payloads and longer periods of weightlessness.
But he also wants the company to tackle the environmental impact of the space industry.
“We are developing a new fuel for our engine, which will mean that we have a carbon neutral fuel source, which is really quite unusual. We’ve got a particular set of propellants that fuels our hybrid rocket engine, so it’s quite different to liquid engines.
“There are a number of things that we could do with that propulsion technology. We could do things with in-space propulsion. We’ve got some exciting plans for things that might happen in about five years’ time. But it’s all to do with sustainability, reducing space debris, cleaner propulsion and just providing great space services.”
Competition
In a busy market of startups targeting the space economy, Gravitilab appears to largely stand alone.
“Nobody’s doing anything that is targeted at opening up this choked market,” Adlard says.
“You can access microgravity right now through the NASA and ESA programmes, but only a couple of organisations can, and it has to be very specific, if they win a competition to do it. And you can’t really access that commercially. Certainly in Europe, if you’re one of these 1,000 startups trying to develop hardware, you can’t access that, in order to test your hardware. You just can’t do it.”
Another alternative would be a ‘drop tower’–such as the one belonging to the European Space Agency in Germany–which allows for short microgravity experiments on Earth. 
Gravitilab promises to be a more affordable and more flexible option though, and allow for multiple drops each day. The LOUIS UAV can be delivered to the customer, rather than the customer having to travel.
Meanwhile, a US-based company called bluShift Aerospace is offering to facilitate experiments in space in a rocket. But again, Adlard says flexibility is Gravitilab’s advantage here. A smaller payload means they won’t need as many customers to fill the space and justify a launch of their ISAAC rocket
And Adlard says Gravitilab, across its products, will offer a wider variety of microgravity time to suit different customers’ needs.
Challenges
Aside from the obvious difficulties around making sure the company has the right funding at the right time, another challenge Gravitilab could face relates to the UK’s relatively recent entry into the space industry.
“The UK lags behind a bit with national programmes and national ambition,” Adlard says.
“There isn’t really a space market in the world that hasn’t been supported to some extent by its government, because it needed that help because it’s so new and it’s so different… SpaceX would have folded if they hadn’t got a NASA contract at just the right time for them, to be blunt about it.
“The US has got significant funding for researchers to use microgravity. Germany has its own programme, and the UK’s got nothing. We can’t access the EU programmes… It would be great if in the push to be a ‘science superpower’, they would put some funding into that kind of research.”
The article you just read is from the premium edition of PreSeed Now. This is a newsletter that digs into the product, market, and story of startups that were founded in the UK. The goal is to help you understand how these businesses fit into what’s happening in the wider world and startup ecosystem.

"Rapid delivery giant Getir quits France, citing regulation hurdles",Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/06/22,"
Quick commerce platform Getir is bidding adieu to the French market — less than two years since starting its operations in the country.
In a press release sent to AFP, the company said that it will soon exit France and seek a buyer for “all of parts of the group.” The Turkish-owned Getir Group encompasses Getir, Gorillas, and Frichti.
“The complex legal environment and the regulations imposed by local administrations have made the success of the company very difficult,” said the platform. Specifically, in March, the French government decreed that “dark stores” — where the products are stored before delivery — are considered warehouses and not businesses. This means that local town halls have the power to decide whether or not they allow such warehouses in the city centre.
For the past months the group has been struggling to reach profitability in France. At the end of March, the total debt of the three entities amounted to €17.6mn and they were placed in receivership by the court of trade in Paris. Already at that point, the group was considering cutting approximately 900 jobs. Now, an estimated 1,800 employees are at risk of unemployment.
Meanwhile, Getir’s competitor Flink faces the same fate. The company, which absorbed French-based Cajoo, was also placed in receivership and has filed for bankruptcy. It recently announced it’s leaving France as well, while rival Gopuff already exited the market in January.
With the number of instant grocery delivery platforms continuously decreasing in the region, it seems that the quick commerce bubble has burst in France. It remains to be seen whether this will have a ripple effect in the overall European market.

Mobility giant Bolt adopts self-driving Starship robots for food delivery,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/06/22,"
European ride-hailing firm Bolt will start using self-driving robots to deliver customers’ food as part of a new partnership with fellow Estonian company Starship Technologies, announced yesterday.  
Bolt, one of Europe’s most highly valued tech companies, plans to roll out thousands of the robots across multiple countries, starting in its home city of Tallinn later this year.
A competitor of Uber, Bolt has more than 100 million customers in Europe, Africa, West Asia, and Latin America. Starship, meanwhile, has completed 5 million commercial deliveries around the world, the first autonomous delivery company to do so.
“It is natural that two companies — one doing deliveries and the other building a more efficient way to do deliveries — should cooperate,” said Starship co-founder Ahti Heinla, who previously worked as chief architect at Skype.    
Founded in 2013 and formerly known as Taxify, Bolt has raised almost €2bn in funding to date, with a valuation of €7.6bn. It made its name as a ride-hailing service but has since expanded into several other lines of business, including food and grocery delivery and e-scooters.
Starship, headquartered in Silicon Valley and founded by former Skype execs, has raised over €180m to date and already operates a fleet of delivery vehicles in the US and the UK. In the US the service is primarily used by college students in partnership with food delivery service Grubhub, while in the UK Starship has a similar deal with British supermarket chains Co-op and Tesco.   
“Both Bolt and Starship have created innovative products which have revolutionised the way people move around and buy and receive goods in cities,” says Jevgeni Kabanov, Bolt’s President. 
Starship’s robots will deliver food to Bolt customers directly in the Bolt app, much like normal deliveries. Once the robot arrives at your door, you’ll be able to press a button that opens it up and receive your meals or groceries.
A big appeal of the robots, which are about the size of a suitcase, is that they are emissions-free and require about the same amount of energy for one delivery as a kettle uses to boil a cup of tea.   
Since launching its autonomous delivery service in Milton Keynes, UK, in April 2018, an independent study estimates that 280,000 car journeys have been avoided, saving 137 tons of CO2 and 22kg of NOx emissions. 
“Bolt and Starship share very similar goals of promoting sustainability in local transport. In our case, we offer a convenient and on-demand autonomous delivery service, perfectly aligning with the mission of making cities more eco-friendly,” said Alastair Westgarth, CEO of Starship Technologies.

This startup gives your speech a new ‘human-realistic’ AI voice — for free,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/06/21,"
From virtual assistants to voiceovers for audiobooks, AI voice generation has emerged as a rapidly growing field — and it’s no wonder that companies are rushing to tap into the technology’s potential.
Among them is Valencia-based Voicemod. The startup has developed an AI voice changer and soundboard software that enables instant speech-to-speech conversion. Unlike most of its competitors, the company claims that it transforms voices in real time and with low latency, enabling users to converse as they would in real life.
According to Jaime Bosch, Voicemod’s CEO and co-founder, the company trains its AI model using publicly available data sets and professional voice actors, which results in a broad pool of vocal expressions, pitches, tones, and emotions. Through machine learning techniques, the model learns to understand, analyse, and predict the a person’s speech patterns and intricacies.
“When a user speaks into our software or application, their voice input is processed in real time,” Bosch told TNW. “Our AI model then applies the learned patterns and transformations to the input, allowing for instant voice conversion.”
Voicemod mainly targets the entertainment industry, including gamers, streamers, content creators, and vtubers in platforms ranging from Discord and Twitch, to Zoom and WhatsApp.
To further address the increasing user demand for self-expression, pseudonymity, and creativity online, next to the 100 voice options in its portfolio, the startup is now launching the so-called “AI Humans” collection. Although Voicemod already offers human voice filters, the new collection is slated to be the company’s most human-realistic to date.
Credit: Voicemod
Trained on recordings from voice actors, AI Humans consists of 20 sonic avatars which range in personality, gender, and age. The personas include Joe, an 80-year-old male voice with a “raspy, sardonic tone” and Jennifer, a 25-year-old female voice, featuring an “energetic and friendly” character. Users can also customize the pitch of each persona, changing the perception of the voice’s gender and age.
The video below can give you an idea of how these characters sound:

“AI voices offer exciting opportunities for industries looking to cultivate creative exploration and self-expression, enhance personalization, and foster inclusivity in digital spaces,” Bosch said.
But despite the positive impact AI voice generation can make, the technology is associated with numerous risks as well. Some of them include misuse, fraud, impersonation, and even voice theft, which especially affects professional voice actors.
As per Bosch, Voicemod is actively working to mitigate these risks. For example, it’s developing a watermarking technology to help platforms identify and track AI-generated voices, while it has implemented measures to protect the intellectual property of the voice actors it’s working with.
Bosch believes that AI will become “a tool” for these professionals. “Something that is perhaps missed in these discussions is that behind every use of real-time voice AI, the use-case that Voicemod is targeting, is a human who is effectively driving the AI,” he told TNW.
Voicemod already counts over 40 million desktop downloads. In the future, it plans to launch on mobile, while it’s also working on B2B partnerships with gaming companies and VR headset platforms.
The software is available for free, with the option for a paid PRO version which unlocks additional features and content.

A new metaverse network plots an escape from Meta’s ‘walled gardens’,Thomas Macaulay,2023/06/21,"
Two years after Mark Zuckerberg launched it into orbit, the metaverse is crashing back to Earth. As the hype sparked by Facebook’s rebrand fades amid jaw-dropping losses, risible selfies, and the generative AI boom, reality is setting in — which is when things start getting interesting.
Metaverse stalwarts are now fighting for competing visions.
On one side are the centralised platforms owned by the likes of Meta and Roblox. Under the control of all-powerful tech giants, these virtual worlds exist in siloes.
On the other side stand advocates for open, interconnected, and decentralised metaverses. In these utopian realms, users can freely traverse spaces and take ownership of their experiences.
Improbable has firmly planted its flag in the latter camp. The company spent a decade building immersive virtual worlds, from military simulations to K-pop parties, before pivoting to building metaverse infrastructure. While the unicorn’s focus (and fortunes) have fluctuated, Improbable’s faith in open spaces has persisted.
“We have seen how walled gardens and closed networks exploit the people that spend time on the services for the benefit of few,” Herman Narula, the company’s co-founder and CEO, said last year.

More recently, Narula has been pitching an alternative.
“We want to contribute to ensuring the metaverse holds its promise of being a network of meaning that unlocks creativity, social interaction, and economic opportunities, free from gatekeepers,” he said last month.
To bring this vision to (virtual) life, Improbable has launched a new venture: MSquared, a network of metaverses.
The lay of the land
Today’s virtual worlds are ringfenced. In Roblox, for instance, you can use build games, buy weapons, and spend the Robux currency. But you can’t take any of that into Fortnite.
MSquared hopes to dismantle these barriers. Using a suite of technologies, services, and standards — as well as $150m (€138m) in funding — the project promises to power a nexus of interlinked worlds. 
If all goes to plan, the virtual experiences will extend across multiple platforms and an interoperable economy.
“I’m going to get shouted at for calling it this, but one way to describe it is a ‘meta-metaverse’,” Rob Whitehead, Improbable’s co-founder and chief product officer, told TNW.
Whitehead compares the concept to international travel. In this analogy, virtual worlds are akin to individual nations with open borders. If you want to visit a new country, you just bring your wallet and possessions with you. 
Upon arrival, your digital assets could be accessed through blockchain-enabled decentralised identities and cryptocurrencies, or traditional Web2 log-ins and digital goods, like Fortnite outfits and tools.
“We’re the layer that connects those different worlds together,” said Whitehead. “And it’s agnostic as to whether that metaverse is using crypto or non-crypto stuff.”

Improbable divides MSquared participants into four groups: metaverse owners running the virtual spaces, creators producing the experiences, service providers powering the network, and users consuming the content. 
Naturally, they won’t be doing this out of the goodness of their hearts. Metaverse owners can charge fees to access their spaces, but they also have to pay service providers for supplying the infrastructure. Creators, meanwhile, can monetise their content. 
Users could, for instance, buy tickets to concerts, digital clothes to wear, furniture for virtual houses, or upgrades to make their avatars fly. It may sound ridiculous for those of us struggling to make ends meet IRL, but people already spend billions in basic virtual worlds. As the experiences improve, the digital economy could rapidly expand.
In time, Improbable wants to add over 10,000 people to the MSquared network. But before they come, someone has to build it.
Weaving a metaverse fabric
Users have not yet been invited to the MSquared virtual party. Improbable has built the ecosystem’s foundations, but it wants to expand the network before the public release.
The current centrepiece of MSquared is Improbable’s Morpheus platform, which is comprised of tools and services for creating, operating, and monetising metaverse experiences.
The system has already powered mass-scale experiences. In demos shared online, Morpheus has powered virtual spaces for 10,000 real users, all interacting in the same place at the same time.
According to Improbable, Morpheus can now enable immersive, shared, and high-concurrency experiences for over 20,000 people across all devices.

Another key component is the Metaverse Markup Language (MML), which allows developers to build virtual objects that can live in any world on the network.  Also on offer is the M² Cross Construct, a sandbox environment, and the M² Cross Metaversal Services, which enable interoperability. 
A circle of partners have added further capabilities. NVIDIA is providing the backbone for high-fidelity graphics, Google Cloud is supplying cloud infrastructure, Dolby is delivering video content, and Ubitus is supporting worldwide streaming.
Improbable is now expanding access to the builder community. If you’re interested in participating, you can read the Litepaper or join the Discord server.
The virtual future
Improbable hopes the initial crop of metaverse launches will arrive soon. The next step will be creating and incentivising a cross-metaverse economy through shared commercial structures and free movement. 
Ultimately, Narula envisions the system becoming far bigger than any one company or individual metaverse.
“MSquared initiates a radically different and novel business model, where ownership and interoperability work together, and creates an environment where creativity flourishes alongside the growth of economically viable businesses within a shared space,” he said.
It’s a grand ambition that still needs to be turned into reality. But MSquared at least offers hope of an escape from platform monopolies and walled gardens. Our tech overlords will be closely following the progress. Hi, Mark!

3D-printed rocket engine revs up for orbital launch in Scotland,Linnea Ahlgren,2023/06/20,"
Edinburgh-based aerospace startup Skyrora announced yesterday it had commenced a series of full-duration tests of its updated 3D-printed 70kN engine. 
The new design features an improved engine cooling chamber and can be built approximately 66% faster at a 20% cost reduction. It is meant to take the company closer to commercial orbital launch later this year from the SaxaVord Spaceport that is being developed on Lamba Ness in Unst, Shetland. 
Skyrora says the tests will evaluate various parameters, such as life cycle and full operational envelope testing, while the engine runs for 250 seconds — the same time it will need to run to reach orbit. 
The engine was printed on Skyrora’s Skyprint 2 — the largest hybrid printer of its kind in Europe — and fully developed through the company’s in-house capabilities. Skyrora, which has thus far raised £32.5mn (€38mn), also hopes to offer its Skyprint 2 to third parties, increasing its commercial offerings within the emerging private space market. 
Skyrora XL preparing for launch
Once qualified through a collaboration with the National Manufacturing Institute of Scotland (NMIS), the new engine will act as a critical component on Skyrora’s XL 23-metre orbital vehicle. 
The Skyrora XL is a three-stage light-class rocket intended to launch payloads into Sun-Synchronous Orbit (SSO) between a range of 500km and 1,000km in altitude. The 70kN engine currently undergoing testing is intended for the first, or the “boost” stage. 
First-stage engines operate for a specified duration and then shut down once they have consumed their propellant. They are then typically jettisoned to reduce the weight and drag on the rocket, although some, like the SpaceX Falcon 9, have first stages that can perform controlled descent and landing for refurbishment and reuse in subsequent launches. 
According to the company, it will be the first commercially qualified engine to use a closed-cycle staged combustion system running on a combination of hydrogen peroxide and kerosene. 
Localising value chain
The tests are being performed at Skyrora’s facilities in Midlothian in the Scottish east-central Lowlands, bordering the City of Edinburgh, East Lothian, and the Scottish Borders. 
“With our purpose-built rocket manufacturing and testing facilities in Scotland, we are proud to be localising as much of the launch value chain as possible,” said Volodymyr Levykin, CEO and founder of Skyrora. 

We've officially commenced tests to qualify the updated design of our 70 kN engine for commercial use on #SkyroraXL! 🚀
Produced via our #Skyprint2 printer, the new model can be now be manufactured 50% faster at a cost reduction.

Skyrora has received support from the European Space Agency (ESA) and its Boost! Programme, and the agency states it will continue to assist the company’s efforts for “the benefit of a competitive space sector in Europe.” 
Turning the trend on rocket launches from UK soil?
It’s been a turbulent past year for UK private space launches. Skyrora’s first attempt to launch a rocket in October last year ended with its 11-metre long single-stage suborbital Skylark L vehicle crashing into the sea, 500 metres from its launch pad on the Langanes peninsula in Iceland. 
However, the unsuccessful launch has not proved as detrimental to the company as the failure of Virgin Orbit’s horizontal launch of the LauncherOne, strapped under the wing of a converted Boeing 747 called Cosmic Girl. The disappointing end to the mission that took off from Cornwall in January this year led to the Virgin Galactic spin-off filing for bankruptcy and beginning selling off its assets a few months later. 
Overall, the number of rocket launches is picking up globally. In 2022, there were 40 more launches than the year before, and double the number from five years prior. While there were some failures, a record 180 rockets lifted off the earth successfully. The statistics were dominated by rockets from Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Chinese government and businesses.

"Crystals, jets, and magnets — is this how to make cooling greener?",Chris Baraniuk,2023/06/20,"
In a world scorched by climate change, cooling technology is far from a luxury. It saves lives, keeps food fresh and ensures comfort at home or in the office. Ten new air conditioners are to be sold every second between now and 2050, according to the International Energy Agency.
But all those machines, running for hours on end, gobble up vast quantities of electricity. These devices also tend to contain refrigerant gases that are many thousands of times more damaging in terms of global warming potential than CO2. The gases gradually leak, including after old air conditioning units or fridges are thrown away.
Ironically, then, cooling ourselves down to survive the climate crisis could actually make the problem far worse. That’s why there are multiple startups in Europe, as well as around the world, investigating new technologies that could make cooling much more efficient than it is today. And they are coming up with some unusual ideas.
No fluids, no leaks
At a lab in Cambridge, Xavier Moya, co-founder of Barocal, has a prototype machine that applies pressure to plastic crystals – lattices of organic molecules. This produces a strong cooling effect, dropping temperatures by, say, 20˚C or 30˚C.
“We are not using a gas, so it’s not going to leak,” says Moya. Barocal currently has six employees and has raised £1.5 million in funding.
The technology relies on the fact that molecules in the solid refrigerant are naturally spinning but when pressure is applied, they stop. “When you remove pressure, the molecules want to rotate again and they need to absorb energy – this is why they cool down,” says Moya. 
He adds that the process is a little bit like what happens inside liquid crystal displays. Such displays contain molecules that change their orientation when an electric field is applied, so you can see numbers appear on your calculator screen, for example.
Barocal’s solid refrigerant could be used inside air conditioners or fridges, and on either a domestic or commercial scale, Moya says. He claims the system will be extremely efficient. In cooling and heating systems, one kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity is often used to produce multiple kilowatt hours of thermal energy – known as the coefficient of performance (COP). Modern heat pumps, for instance, might get you a COP of 3 at home, which means 3 kWh of heat resulting from every kWh of electricity consumed.
“We are expecting efficiencies that are twice or more,” says Moya, though he adds that his firm is still years away from releasing a commercial product.
Another startup that aims to do away with refrigerant fluids is Dynamic Air Cooling, in Poland. The firm employs 13 people and has raised €3.5 million in funding, €2.3 million of which has been in the form of grants.
‘Mini tornado’
Co-founder and chief executive Pavel Panasjuk says his team came up with the idea more or less by accident when experimenting with the same technology used in jet engines.
“We created a process which is very similar to a mini tornado,” he says. It’s the twisting and spinning of the air that achieves a cooling effect since it converts thermal energy in the air to kinetic energy instead, he explains. The system can reliably push temperatures down by at least 45˚C and in experiments this has worked from starting points ranging from 0˚C to 35˚C or so, adds Panasjuk.
One tricky aspect is that, currently, there’s no finalised method of determining a specific output temperature, so the team is working on a control unit to do that. “There is a solution,” hints Panasjuk, who adds that the system should achieve a COP of around 4.
If all engineering challenges are dealt with, he adds that Dynamic Air Cooling hopes to have a commercial product ready in as little as one year from today. The firm is targeting industrial refrigeration for food storage and transport.
Magnotherm, in Germany, is also determined to make fridges greener but with a totally different kind of technology. Timur Sirman, co-founder and managing director, explains that his startup’s device relies on rotating magnets. Imagine two of them, like burger buns, above and below the “burger”, which in this case is a special iron alloy full of pores, through which water may be pumped. The magnetic field created by the rotating magnets has the effect of cooling the metal alloy, and therefore any water that passes across it.
The quest for efficiency
The company, which has 32 members of staff and has raised €6.3 million to date, already has a small commercial product – a fridge that it rents out to event organisers. The fridge, dubbed Polaris, can hold between 100 and 200 drinks, says Sirman, but only has a COP of 1, which isn’t very efficient. However, this can be solved by making a bigger fridge, he adds.
“The cooling power scales linearly with the amount of material that you put inside,” says Sirman. So with the same motors and water pump, but more of the porous iron alloy, the team hopes to achieve more cooling and a COP of up to 5 in 2024. 
In principle, the same technology could be used in an air conditioning system, though that is not Magnotherm’s focus at present. The hope is that their system will be used in commercial fridges, in a modular unit that can be taken out and placed into a new fridge whenever the customer, for instance a supermarket, decides to update their hardware.
It’s “fantastic” to see so many innovations in the field of cooling, says Nicole Miranda, a researcher on the Future of Cooling Programme at the Oxford Martin School, part of the University of Oxford. She emphasises that, in the coming years, passive cooling techniques – from textiles that keep our bodies cool to increased shade in city centres – will be just as important as technologies that require electricity to work.
But the demand for air conditioners and fridges really will be huge across the world, she adds, so it’s important to develop sustainable systems now that will not guzzle excessive amounts of energy, or be constructed from materials that have a high carbon footprint.
Consider also the many homes around Europe that were never designed to keep out excessive summer heat. And it’s not yet clear that the energy systems in such countries will be able to cope with booming demand for cooling tech in the coming years.
“It’s an easy solution to just go to a shop and get an air conditioner,” says Miranda. “That’s a huge risk for those places’ electrical networks.”

Startup Genome: 2022 was tough — but a recession is a great time to invest in tech,Thomas Macaulay,2023/06/15,"
The tech sector is experiencing an unprecedented slowdown, but analysts see immense opportunities for startups that survive the downturn.
Across the world, VC funding in 2022 plummeted by 35% from the previous year, according to a new study from Startup Genome and the Global Entrepreneurship Network (GEN). The Global Startup Ecosystem Report 2023 (GSER 2023) also observed slowdowns in deal counts, exits, and unicorns. But a deeper dive unearths grounds for optimism.
After a year of heavy market losses, inflation is now slowing and economic growth appears to be holding up. The headwinds remain challenging, but the GSER 2023 notes that recessions are good times to invest in startups. 
Historical trends substantiate the theory. Startups funded during the Great Recession had higher exit multiples over total money invested than those funded during economic expansions. During downturn years, startups that achieved Series A financing were able to multiply by 20 the value of that round by the time of exit. 


“Lean economic times can produce high-performing startups.


Tangible examples of successful startups born in a recession include Spotify raising a Series A in 2008, Twitter doing the same in 2007, and Flipkart in 2009. Similar successes emerged after the 2001 dot-com crash. When the bubble burst, pessimists tolled the death knell for the tech industry. Within a few years, their prediction was proven entirely wrong.
The spree of mass layoffs is also set to unleash a fresh wave of startups. A vast pool of elite talent with tech know-how and industry expertise is now looking for new ventures. 
“Given that over half the companies on the 2009 Fortune 500 list launched during a recession or bear market, we know that lean economic times can produce high-performing startups,” said Jonathan Ortmans, Founder and President of GEN. 
“Despite recent downturns in investment, this report foreshadows where we might see the world’s most disruptive and solution-driven companies emerge in the years to come — and provides unparalleled insights that policymakers and community leaders need to build resilient startup ecosystems.”
Furthermore, the report notes that high-interest rates can actually benefit startups. They concentrate capital and talent into ventures that create value, weeding out the less competitive ventures. Indeed, while fewer startups were funded in 2022, they received larger sums. According to the GSER, the average deal size grew by 2%.
Increasingly, those investments target artificial intelligence. AI and big data was the sub-sector with the highest count of total VC deals in 2022, making up 28% of the global share. 
European prospects
The report highlights numerous positives for European startups. Despite macroeconomic woes and geopolitical tensions, 2022 was the second-biggest year overall for European VC activity after 2021, with deal count and amount surpassing pre-2021 numbers.
The continent has also captured more unicorn land. While there’s been a global slowdown in the number of startups valued at over $1 billion, Europe’s share of unicorns increased from 14% to 20% in 2022.  
Of the seven ecosystems that produced their first tech unicorn in 2022, three were in Europe: the Sofia-based Payhawk, Zagreb’s Rimac, and Rohlik Group in Prague.
Europe is also the most represented region in the GSER’s “Emerging Ecosystems,” which is comprised of startup communities at earlier stages of growth. The continent expanded its share from 37% to 41% since last year, and contains the number one ranked ecosystem: Copenhagen.

Europe’s performance was even stronger in the Strong Starters category, which features the 25 Emerging Ecosystems where early-stage funding activity is most robust. Over half of the class is European, including the top four: Istanbul, Barcelona, Estonia, and Madrid.
Among the leading ecosystems, London remains number one in Europe and joint-second globally. 
The UK capital has the most companies valued at over $1 billion. The city’s 83 exits over $50 million include Wise, at a valuation of $12.2 billion, and Deliveroo at $10.5 billion. Revolut, one of Europe’s largest Fintech unicorns, is valued at $33 billion.
In second place is Berlin. The German capital minted five new unicorns in 2022, increasing its total from 14 to 19. Exits over $50 million have increased by 40% since the GSER 2022, with AUTO1-Group attracting the highest value in a $9.2 billion IPO. 
The third spot was retained by Amsterdam, thanks to an increase in exits over $50 million, early-stage deal count, and unicorns. Banking platform Backbase is the most recent addition, valued at 2.7 billion. 


“This essential mission cannot be put on hold.


Another ecosystem that deserves special attention is Zurich. The city rose 10 places to 36th place in the world, marking the biggest year-on-year improvement in Europe. Exits over $50 million have grown a massive 300%, with Healthtech Pharvaris exiting at a valuation of $636 million. The unicorn count, meanwhile, has surged from two to six, including Blockchain company Dfinity, which is valued at $9.5 billion.
Zurich offers further evidence that startups can still thrive through a downturn. JF Gauthier, Founder & CEO of Startup Genome, expects further success stories to emerge.
“Despite current economic challenges, we are confident that, equipped with the right knowledge, entrepreneurs, policymakers, and community leaders everywhere can leverage opportunities to come together and show how innovative technologies can not only continue to drive growth and job creation, but simultaneously help save the planet and ensure a better future for everyone,” he said. “This essential mission cannot be put on hold while we wait out rocky economic times.”

Mistral AI secures €105M in Europe’s largest-ever seed round,Linnea Ahlgren,2023/06/14,"
The artificial intelligence hype shows no sign of fading just yet, and investors are practically falling over themselves to fund the next big thing in AI. Yesterday, Paris-based startup Mistral AI announced it had secured €105mn in what is reportedly Europe’s largest-ever seed round. 
Mistral AI was founded only four weeks ago, by a trio of AI researchers. Arthur Mensch, the company’s CEO, was formerly employed by Google’s DeepMind. His co-founders, Timothée Lacroix (CTO) and Guillaume Lample (Chief Science Officer), previously worked for Meta. 
The company has yet to develop its first product. However, on a mission to “make AI useful,” it plans to launch a large language model (LLM) similar to the system behind OpenAI’s ChatGPT in early 2024. 
A large part of the funds raised will be used towards renting the computer power to train it. The idea is to only use publicly available data to avoid the legal issues and copyright backlash faced by others in the industry. 
While Mistral hopes to take on OpenAI with actual open-sourced models and data sets, it is setting itself apart from the Microsoft-backed step-change initiator by targeting enterprises instead of consumers. The company says its goal is to help business clients improve processes around R&D, customer care, and marketing, as well as giving them the tools to build new products with AI.
Vision coupled with hands-on experience
The funding round is led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. The VC’s partner, Antoine Moyroud, says that Lightspeed has had the opportunity to meet with several talented researchers-turned-founders in AI, but few had a vision beyond the technical field. 
Mensch, Lacroix and Lample, on the other hand, according to Moyroud, are “part of a group of select few globally who have both the technical understanding required to build out their own vision along with the hands-on experience of training and operating large language models at scale.”
Generally, the American VC says it believes that Europe has “a decisive role” to play in the AI field. Just in September last year, the firm opened up new offices in London, Berlin, and Paris, and says it is looking to partner with more European founders of the same ambition behind Mistral. 

“Our investment in Mistral, and all our portfolio companies in Europe, are evidence of our firm conviction that a new generation of global players will emerge from this ecosystem,” Lightspeed said in a statement.  
JCDecaux Holding, Motier Ventures, La Famiglia, Headline, Exor Ventures, Sofina, First Minute Capital, and LocalGlobe also participated in the round, along with private investors including French billionaires Rodolphe Saadé and Xavier Niel, as well as former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and French investment bank BpiFrance.

8 things we’re excited about at TNW Conference day 2,Thomas Macaulay,2023/06/13,"
Ladies and gentlemen, friends and nemeses, the moment has finally arrived: TNW Conference is this week! 
After taking our show on the road to València in April, we’re returning to where it all began: Amsterdam. The two-day event kicks off on June 15  — and you’re all invited.
Expect our usual smorgasbord of talks, networking, learning, and festival vibes, but with a new unifying theme. Following a turbulent few years, this year we want to reclaim the future — and reignite the positive power that tech can have.
That spirit has been infused throughout the conference agenda. It featured prominently in our guide to day one, and it’s equally pervasive in our top picks for day two. Read on for our highlights from the jam-packed agenda.

1. Spellbinding speakers
Our stellar schedule is bursting with splendid speakers, but we have to whittle the day down to four faves. Why? Well, because that’s what we did for day one, and we love our conference days like our kids: equally (at least, that’s what we tell them).
Lila Ibrahim, Chief Operating Officer of Google DeepMind
DeepMind is one of the most exciting artificial intelligence labs in the world. From its humble roots as a UK startup conquering games, the company has risen to lead the AI revolution at Google. At 10:10 on the Vision Stage, we’ll be hearing from the woman helming the company’s growth: Lila Ibrahim, DeepMind’s first-ever COO.
We had the pleasure of interviewing Lila ahead of her keynote, which left us eager to hear more on the epochal subject of her talk: the future of AI.
Viktoriia Itskovych, Deputy CIO of Kyiv City
Ukraine’s tech sector has proven remarkably resilient since Russia’s invasion. As well as keeping the country’s economy afloat, IT has played a central role in fighting the war.
At 14:40 on the Vision Stage, we’ll get the inside story from one of the key figures on the digital frontline: Victoria Itskovich, the deputy CIO of Kyiv.
Philip Rosedale, Founder of Second Life
Virtual worlds existed long before the metaverse hype. The most popular of them all, Second Life, has provided a parallel reality for 20 years.
At 16:00 on the Discovery Stage, the platform’s founder, Phillip Rosedale, will share his insights from running the community — and what it can teach us about the future of virtual worlds.
Nagin Cox, Spacecraft Systems Engineer at NASA Jet Propulsion Lab
Nothing excites us more about the future than space travel. At 16:10 on the Vision Stage, we’ll get an inside glimpse into the direction we’re heading.
Nagin Cox, spacecraft systems engineer at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, will explain our path towards the cosmos — and the role that robots will play in the mission.

2. Fun and games at our revamped festival site
Our festival site has had a major makeover this year. The Wi-Fi’s been souped-up, the co-working spaces have expanded, and the badge pick-up’s gone auto. But most importantly of all, we’re bringing games.
You can find the likes of ping-pong and Dutch shuffleboard around the venue. It’s a great way to break the ice, do business, or ruthlessly humiliate your rivals.
To find your way around the fun and games, you can use our floor map.

3. Healthy runs and indulgent breakfasts
On the sidelines of the big show are a medley of marvellous side events. Our recommendation for day two is a healthy run around the picturesque Vondel Park, followed by some unhealthy drinks with our friends at Techleap. 
If that balanced diet doesn’t appeal, there are options on the menu to suit every taste.
4. The Startup Liasion Network + Netherlands Point of Entry Breakfast Session
TNW Conference is an international festival, but we’re also highlighting the opportunities in our home country. At 09:00 in TNW HQ, we’re opening a gateway to the Dutch tech ecosystem.
Over breakfast, the Netherlands Point of Entry and the Startup Liaison Network from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are joining forces to unite entrepreneurs and explain how the Dutch government can support startups. After the grub, the hosts will whisk you straight to TNW Conference by bus.
You can reserve a spot at the event here.

5. DEI talks, mentoring, and networking
TNW Conference 2023 has partnered with the Dutch DEI Coalition to celebrate and accelerate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in tech.
The day’s agenda begins with a roundtable on the challenges and opportunities to spur DEI in the sector. Next up is a plenary talk on the role of tech and new metrics in DEI strategies. In the afternoon, there are mentoring sessions with senior representatives from Diversity Hero, Techleap, Taskforce D&I by NLdigital, and Booking.com. We’ll then bring the programme to a close with networking drinks.
You can find the full itinerary for the day here.
6. Startup pitch battles (and lessons)
It wouldn’t be a TNW Conference without a pitch battle, but this year’s contest has a more harmonious edge. In line with our conference theme, we’ll be shining a sector spotlight on tech for good at 10:10 on the Glasshouse stage. The winner will progress to the finals at 16:10 on the Growth Quarters stage.
The pitching doesn’t end there. At 14.00 at the Glasshouse, pitching coach David Beckett will provide a masterclass on the art. There’s also the second half of the impact-driven Startup Pitch Hour at the Amsterdam Pavilion at 14:00.
7. The official closing party
What would TNW Conference be without a massive closing party? From 17:00, we’ll close the event in style at the event garden. Bring your dancing shoes and head to the giant disco ball to catch our DJ on the wheels of steel.

8. The ferry shuttle
We like to think that the whole agenda is full of unmissable events, but one thing you definitely shouldn’t miss is your ride to the venue.
Our favourite mode of transport is the free ferry service.  The pick-up spot is next to Amsterdam Central at SUPPER Cruise. You can find the location on Google Maps and the full timetable here. The boat journey from there to our conference site takes around 45 minutes.
If you prefer to travel by road, you can get to the venue by public transport, car, or bike. We’re also providing a free shuttle bus service between Zaandam Central Station and the venue. Check out our travel guide for everything you need to plan your trip to the event.

The goals of decarbonisation and the circular economy are two sides of the same coin. We cannot achieve one without the other, and both are vital to a sustainable and equitable future for humanity. 
Just a few years ago, however, actionable tools for businesses and consumers to reduce emissions and waste were hard to find. But thanks to pioneering entrepreneurs like Lubomila Jordanova and Jamie Crummie, ways to measure and reduce our carbon and material footprint are now within reach.    
Jordanova is the founder and CEO of Plan A, an AI-powered carbon accounting tool that helps companies measure, reduce, and report on CO2 emissions. So far, Plan A has built a 100-strong team of leading scientists and developers, secured big name clients like BMW and the European Commission, and claims to have 5Mt of carbon under its management. 
Operating in a very different market, Crummie is the co-founder of sustainable food app Too Good To Go, which enables consumers to buy unsold food from restaurants and retailers. It is currently the world’s largest marketplace for surplus food, active in 17 countries, has over 75 million registered users, and 135,000 active food businesses. The app claims to have rescued over 200+ million meals of food.  
Both companies entered the market in the mid-2010s, a time when climate tech received a mere fraction of the funding it does today. Despite an unfavourable investment landscape, both startups overcame their respective challenges and positioned themselves for impressive growth. 
At TNW conference next week, Jordanova and Crummie will take to the stage to discuss their respective journeys, and ways to successfully deliver measurable impact within a for-profit business model. 
So if you’re an entrepreneur looking to found a startup, or scale your existing business, make sure not to miss this talk! The future of the planet could depend on it.   

Balancing profit, purpose, and planet is one of several startup growth topics that will be explored at TNW Conference. You can find more on the event agenda — and remember: for a 25% discount on business passes, use the promo code READ-TNW-25.

EU pours €8B of state aid into chips and microelectronics,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/06/9,"
The EU has approved an €8.1bn state aid package to boost the development of chips, aiming to strengthen the bloc’s microelectronics and comms sector.
The subsidy falls under the framework of “Important Projects of Common European Interest” (IPCEI) — an initiative that provides easier access to public funds.
The IPCEI will undertake 68 projects across 14 member states: Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria, the Czech Republic, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Poland, Romania, Spain, and Slovakia.
It will involve 56 companies in total — from major players such as Airbus and ASML, to startups and SMEs — and over 30 associated partners located in five additional member states.
The projects will target the research and development of “resource-efficient technologies and components,” including chips, sensors, and processors; new materials and tools; and chip design and manufacturing processes.
“Microchips are the backbone of innovation and of Europe’s industrial competitiveness in a digital world,” said Margrethe Vestager, Executive VP in charge of competition policy. “We need to be pioneers and develop truly innovative solutions and their first industrial deployment in Europe.”
The IPCEI’s aim is to use the upcoming technologies for the advancement of multiple sectors, including 5G and 6G telecoms, autonomous driving, AI, and quantum computing.
The first products may reach the market already in 2025, but the projects’ overall completion is expected in 2032. By that point the IPCEI hopes to have unlocked an additional €13.7bn in private investments, bringing its total impact to €22bn.
Meanwhile, the EU is finalising its Chips Act with the aim to boost domestic semiconductor chip production and capture at least 20% of the global market share by 2030.

Uncommon bags €28M to scale lab-grown meat using RNA technology,Linnea Ahlgren,2023/06/9,"
Global livestock contributes 14.5% of all manmade greenhouse gas emissions. Our food systems need a significant revamp, not to say a revolution, if we are to have any chance of feeding a growing population while also making sure there is still a planet that is worth populating at all. 
Some of that revamping is happening in the lab, with cell biology taking centre stage. With global meat consumption showing no sign of slowing down (in fact, quite the opposite), cellular agriculture could be one of the keys to reducing livestock-related emissions. 
UK-based cultivated meat startup Uncommon announced today it has raised $30mn (€28mn) in Series A funding. The round was led by Balderton and Lowercarbon, but also included angel investors in the form of Sam Altman (of OpenAI fame) and his brother Max. 
Patent-pending RNA technologies
Uncommon, founded in 2018 and based out of Cambridge, leverages RNA technology to cultivate bacon and pork belly from pig cells. If RNA sounds familiar to you, it is probably due to the mRNA vaccines developed to fight COVID-19. RNA stands for Ribonucelaic Acid, a molecule that contains the instructions, or recipe, that directs cells to make a protein using its natural machinery. 
“As the only cultivated meat leveraging RNA technologies, we believe we have a competitive advantage that could help us become the largest protein company in the world,” said Benjamina Bollag, founder and CEO of Uncommon. 
The cultured meat startup has now raised a total of approximately €35mn, including a £1mn (€1.16mn) Innovate UK grant. The latest round will go toward bringing down the cost of goods further, the regulatory application procedure, and the scaling of production at a pilot manufacturing facility at Cambridge Technopark. Furthermore, the company says it will double its team over the next 18 months. 
Will cultivated meat succeed where plant-based alternatives appear to have failed?
Investors who backed the initial rush towards plant-based meat alternatives have not had a great time of it over the past couple of years. But if the failure to capitalise on the early enthusiasm for vegan meat substitutes has proved anything it is this: people will not stop eating meat, even if the future of the planet depends on it. 
Even though the taste and texture of plant-based alternatives have come a long way, they cannot fully replicate actual meat. Lab-grown meat doesn’t have that problem since it is, well, actual meat. 
Cells are taken from an otherwise unharmed animal and then cultivated in a lab setting. Uncommon transforms the individual cells into induced pluripotent stem cells in a process called “reprogramming,” a technology that won the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 2012. 
Costs associated with the technology have thus far been prohibitive of commercialisation (and that is saying nothing of regulatory hurdles still to be overcome). However, companies in the sector claim that scaling production will reduce costs to where, in a few years time, the products will reach price parity with conventional meat. Indeed, Uncommon says it aims to own 5% of the global pork market by 2035. 
UK cell agriculture investment is booming
Analysts differ in their estimates, but the cellular agriculture market could be worth hundreds of billions by 2040; an attractive proposition for investors willing to play the long game and potentially do something good for the planet. Globally, the cultured meat industry raised $869mn (€806mn) in venture capital funding in 2022, down from $1.3bn (€1.2bn) in 2021. However, in the UK, investments rose by 400%. 
While most people have come to know him as the CEO that brought ChatGPT to the world, Sam Altman is an avid startup investor. He has backed over 100 companies over the years, including several biotech startups, for instance, Elon Musk’s Neuralink. 
Securing food supply
Cultivated meat may be one of our best bets when it comes to curtailing the slaughter of 200 million animals per day and cutting down the vast emissions and overuse of antibiotics associated with land use and factory farming. What’s more, it may help assist with food security. 
It is perhaps no coincidence that the first country to approve cultivated meat for human consumption – Singapore in December 2020 – imports 90% of its food. The US also approved the first cultivated meat product (chicken) in November 2022. 
However, the EU could be in for a bit of a tussle, as Italy’s government recently backed a bill that would ban lab-grown and other synthetic meats in the name of cultural food heritage. Although, given it is the country’s 68th government in 76 years, things may still change in time for when the technology becomes commercially mature.

This AI-powered platform could predict the next big flood,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/06/7,"
The European floods of 2021, which affected large areas of Germany and Belgium, took the lives of 209 people and cost over €30bn in damages. Catastrophic floods like these are becoming more and more common as climate change increases the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. 
While there is no easy fix for preventing floods, there are ways we can prepare for them. One company tackling this challenge head-on is Norwegian climate tech startup 7Analytics. Founded in 2020 by a team of data scientists and geologists, the startup aims to help municipalities and businesses better predict flooding and minimise damage to infrastructure. 
The startup’s main offering, FloodCube, applies AI and machine learning to vast quantities of terrain and land use data in order to predict how a future flood will unfold. Whereas the weather forecast tells you when a storm is approaching, 7Analytics will tell you exactly how the water from this storm will travel through your community, to a metre-scale accuracy.  
Recent advancements in computing power and AI couldn’t have come at a better time for the startup. “These technologies enable us to analyse data and generate predictive insights in a way that was impossible just a few years’ ago,” says Jonas Aas Torland, co-founder and CCO of 7analytics.

While there are a handful of other companies operating in this space in the US and Australia, Jonas says that none of them offer such high resolution data nor do they constantly reprocess data to account for physical changes in the landscape.  
For governments or businesses looking to minimise damage to infrastructure, the value of these predictive insights cannot be understated. “Knowing how a flood will occur in the future gives you the gift of time,” Jonas told TNW. 
“Our platform can tell you if a flood will occur in your area of interest and issue alerts 72 hours in advance so you can take all the necessary actions to protect employees and assets,” he says. 
These insights are also of interest to insurers, who are always looking for more accurate ways to predict future risks to assets.  
So far, 7Analytics has secured contracts with the likes of the Municipality of Bergen, construction giant Skanska, and, most recently, French oil conglomerate Total Energies. 
The startup secured €2.5m in its first funding round last year, and looks to grow its customer base both in Europe and the US.

Adapting to the new climate reality
Investors are pouring trillions into climate mitigation technologies like renewable energies and EVs in an attempt to reduce carbon emissions. While essential, there is increasing acknowledgement that investing in technologies that help humanity adapt to a changing climate is an equally urgent priority.  
In 2021, however, less than $50 billion — or just 10% of all climate finance — was allocated to adaptation measures such as flood and wildfire prevention, resilient agriculture, and clean water supply.  
This is partly because climate adaptation tech investment has often been regarded as the realm of NGOs and government, not private capital, partly due a false perception that there is no money to be made. But this outlook appears to be shifting.  
Bill Gates’s Breakthrough Energy Ventures pledged last year to expand its scope to climate adaptation technologies, while water tech firm Gradiant — which helps companies reduce water usage — hit ‘unicorn’ status last month after a $225m raise. 
Michiel de Bruin, portfolio manager for Dutch investment firm Robeco, says that recent climate disasters are a “wake-up call,” directing “more attention to adaptation.” 
Jonas believes that solutions like his flood prevention platform are part of this new wave of climate adaptation tech. The startup is now plotting its Series A funding round for next year, and looks to expand its offerings to predict landslides and other natural hazards.

The case for letting workers live in the WFH la-la land,Kirstie McDermott,2023/06/7,"
Work can be pretty stressful these days: globally tech workers have had to deal with the effects of the pandemic, adjust to remote work—and handle all those more recent return-to-office mandates—in addition to dealing with fears of redundancy in an environment that has seen hundreds of thousands of sector layoffs since mid-2022.
It’s not surprising that workers are feeling the strain. Forty-four percent of European workers reported that their work stress had increased as a result of the pandemic, according to an EU-OSHA workers’ survey.
Burnout is rife, with a 2021 study finding that 66% of Polish workers and 59% of workers in Czechia experienced, or were close to burnout. Workplace trends such as quiet quitting, rust-out, and compassion fatigue are all symptoms of the same thing: employees are overworked, under-recognised, and fed up.
Your resilience depends on your age and expertise level too. Cigna 360’s Global Well-Being Survey found that 98% of young adults aged 18 to 24 (aka Gen-Z) are experiencing worker burnout globally.
What doesn’t help workers’ stress or exhaustion levels are the sweeping decrees from tech billionaires, such as Elon Musk. You could argue that by their very nature, billionaires are removed from the concerns of the average worker anyway, but Musk takes things further.
As the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and the former CEO of Twitter, he is hardline when it comes to how and where his employees should do their jobs. He recently told CNBC that “It’s not just a productivity thing, I think it’s morally wrong,” in reference to how service workers have no choice but to show up, while Silicon Valley engineers are the work-from-home “laptop classes living in la-la land.”
Musk also said he’s a big believer that people are more productive in person, saying that “People should get off their goddamn moral high horse with the work-from-home bullshit.”
Some are on Elon Musk’s side, with a Forbes survey revealing that 45% of 65 surveyed billionaires don’t believe in work-from-home culture either. But for many workers, his comments feel out of touch, and his declaration that he works seven days a week, and only takes “two or three” days off a year is even more alienating.
The future of work is shifting fast
European and global workers have experienced a sea change in the way they work over the past few years.
Workers want a remote or hybrid model as it eliminates commute time (and cost), can be a much more effective way to do deep work, and it also fosters a culture of flexibility, where a set schedule doesn’t matter as long as the work gets done—which is particularly attractive for working parents.
The rise of four-day working weeks is another aspect of change. Successfully trialled in the UK by non-profit 4 Day Week Global, the initial results found that 91% of participating companies will definitely continue or plan to continue with the format.
As return to the office mandates begin to make an impact, nearly a third of Eurozone workers want to work from home more frequently than their employer allows them to, according to a recent European Central Bank study.
The study found that workers who commute more than one hour each way want 10 work-from-home days each month. Those with a commute time of less than 15 minutes want six days at home a month.
Employees will vote with their feet if necessary. “Workers are more willing to change jobs if they have remote work preferences that exceed those they perceive their employers to have,” the study’s authors say.
Offering flexibility in the form of working styles is now considered to be an employee benefit, and it’s one that positively contributes to employee happiness, which increases as much as 20% by having the ability to work 100% remotely.
Work-life balance goes beyond what benefits employees. It’s good for business too, with companies offering fully remote jobs now able to utilise a much larger, global talent pool to boost their success. In addition, a survey conducted by Airtasker found that remote employees get more done, working 1.4 more days every month, or 16.8 more days every year, than those in the office.
For workers though (beyond mere happiness), the biggest benefits of achieving an optimum work setup, whether that is remote, hybrid, or fully flexible, is that it can help reduce chronic stress, prevent burnout, and as a result help to mitigate physical and mental symptoms such as anxiety, hypertension, digestive troubles, and heart problems. A true win-win.

Inside CUR8’s mission to scale carbon removals and help save the planet,Linnea Ahlgren,2023/06/7,"
Most of us have heard of carbon offsets by now. However, the average person perhaps doesn’t give them much thought beyond when prompted by an airline to “offset the CO2 of your journey” (for a suspiciously small amount). But how familiar are you with carbon removals? 
Offsetting and carbon credits (sort of like permission slips for emissions) are not only big business, but part of a new climate-accounting reality to which companies will have to adapt sooner or later as they embark on net-zero roadmaps. 
Offsetting as a practice has gotten a pretty bad rep, and not at all unjustified. As John Oliver quipped “if the idea that you can simply invest a little money and make your carbon footprint disappear sounds too good to be true, that’s because it absolutely is.” 
Indeed, at times, carbon offsetting projects have been proven to do more harm than good. Whether from well-intentioned incompetence or unscrupulous greed, issues have ranged from biodiversity loss to land grabbing. 
However, a different approach to reducing – and removing – CO2 emissions is evolving. A growing body of carbon removal technologies and projects might just actually contribute to cleaning up the mess we have made for ourselves in more efficient and, importantly, equitable ways. 
Brokering hope 
Carbon removals are also referred to as carbon dioxide removal (CDR), carbon drawdown, or negative emissions. Where carbon offsets simply aim to compensate for emissions by investing in emission reduction projects elsewhere, carbon removals target the capturing of CO2 from the atmosphere and locking it away for decades or even centuries.
And cleaning up the atmosphere is exactly what the London-based startup CUR8 wants to help facilitate. The company, which is building what it calls a market-maker platform for carbon removals, was founded in 2022 and recently raised £5.3 million (€6.15 million) in a pre-seed round led by GV (Google Ventures) and including funding from CapitalT. 
CUR8 co-founder and serial fintech entrepreneur Marta Krupinska says that when she first heard of carbon removals in December 2020, it blew her mind, and gave her what is “not a common feeling” for anyone working in climate – hope.  
“I’ve definitely felt that there’s been all of the scientific proof that we’ve left it too late. So to suddenly think that there are ways in which we can build these time machines that will undo the damage that we’ve done, that was just absolutely mind-blowing,” Krupinska told TNW. 
“It’s going to be a trillion dollar industry, and we have to build it faster than any industry we’ve ever built before. So obviously, that for an entrepreneur is very enticing,” she continued. The problem was, at the time, she didn’t know much about climate science. 
Krupinska, who has led Google for Startups in the UK and co-founded international money transfer platform Azimo, was introduced in 2021 by a friend to Dr Gabrielle Walker, the former climate editor at the prestigious journal Nature and features editor at New Scientist. 
Dr Walker, who has taught at Cambridge and Princeton Universities and founded non-profit Rethinking Removals, decided to focus her attention on removals after asking people from the IPCC if reaching the Paris Agreement would be possible without them. Basically, the response she received was, “Are you having a laugh?” 
Committed warming
Why they are so adamant is down to what is called committed warming. This means that even if we were to stop emitting greenhouse gases tomorrow, the warming effects of what we have already released would not simply stop; they have already been baked into the system (hence the need for removals). 

Indeed, the IPCC predicts we will have to remove 10 billion tonnes of CO2 by 2050 to have any chance of keeping global warming below 2°C by 2100. 
At first, Dr Walker was sceptical about CDR because, as she says, “It is hard to get CO2 back out of the air.” But having visited a small-scale pilot direct air carbon capture facility in British Columbia and coming away bolstered by the promise of the technology, she said to herself, “Ok, that could work, we need to make it happen.” 
However, in turn, she knew nothing of running a company. As such, Krupinska and Dr Walker bring “immensely complimentary skills” to the startup they have founded together with their third partner, Mark Stevenson. 
Stevenson has been an advisor to the UK Ministry of Defense on Peace, Security and Climate Change and to Médecins Sans Frontières, and is an ambassador to Client Earth and chairs the Impact Board for Climate.vc. The three have banded together along with their team to achieve CUR8’s ambition of facilitating 10% of all global carbon removals over the next 25+ years. 
Direct air capture
There are several pathways to carbon removal, both technology and nature-based. On the technology side, there is direct air capture, or DAC. Essentially, this sucks carbon out of the air using chemical reactions. Then, it pumps the CO2  deep underground for storage. Alternatively, it can go into other hydrocarbon products, such as (more) sustainable fuels but, of course, this means it goes straight back into the atmosphere again. 
According to the IEA, DAC is “a key part of the carbon removal portfolio.” However, it is categorised as “technology readiness level” 6 (on a scale of 1 to 9). This means that it is in the large-scale and prototype phase, but not ready for commercial deployment. As such, costs have previously been prohibitively high for anyone but the likes of Microsoft. But CUR8’s approach of including it in a portfolio will help achieve economies of scale and make it accessible to a broader range of companies. 
Spectrum of drawdown speed
Other pathways include something referred to as enhanced rock weathering (ERW). Some rocks with high silica content, such as basalt, sequester CO₂ from the air as a part of a chemical reaction, triggered by rainwater. This process can be sped up by spreading large quantities of selected and finely ground rock material onto land areas, beaches or the sea surface.
Further types of negative emission approaches include aforrestation (with respect for biodiversity), soil-based sequestration, and turning crop and forestry residue into biochar – storing carbon for millennia, instead of releasing it into the atmosphere. Making buildings out of timber also ensures the carbon stays locked in the wood, as well as replaces more polluting materials such as concrete. 
The oceans also provide a multitude of carbon removal opportunities, including photosynthesis-enhanced seaweed farming and oyster reef restoration and alkalinity enhancement. All of these methods come with their own set of benefits and challenges. 
“If you’re buying removals, you should always invest in all of the methods around because not a single method will scale to 10 billion tonnes by 2050,” Krupinska says.
“Our portfolio will always contain methods from across the spectrum,” she continues. “We try to achieve the maximum durability with maximum biodiversity and social benefits pulled together in one portfolio that’s significantly cheaper than the top end of price points of removals.”
CUR8 has, among other clients, provided carbon removals for The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee Pageant and The State Funeral of HM Queen Elizabeth II and large-scale events including British Summer Time and All Points East. The portfolio comprised technologies including direct air capture (1pointfive), enhanced rock weathering (UNDO) and durable soil carbon (Loam Bio). 
The cost of carbon 
Carbon credits range in price depending on the type, location, and availability of the projects that generate them. They can cost anything from between $0.30 to $300. (Remember the dubiously low cost of your air travel emissions offset?) 
Carbon offset credits represent one tonne of carbon dioxide prevented or reduced. Carbon removal credits (CRCs) on the other hand represent one tonne carbon dioxide equivalent that is removed from the atmosphere. 
CUR8 has set the cost of its CRCs at £150. This is pegged to $185 – what has been calculated as the “social cost of carbon,” or the economic cost to society from emitting one metric tonne of CO2  into the atmosphere. 
Speaking of social cost and impact, 40% of CUR8’s portfolio will be located in the Global South. “If we can help set up more of the carbon removal supply in the Global South, we can genuinely turn climate change victims into beneficiaries of this new economy,” Krupinska says. 
“There are credits that we need to get money towards, which are transforming infrastructure, from fossil infrastructure to clean, in the Global South, particularly, because that’s where the money isn’t available,” Dr Walker adds. “That’s a part of the climate system that otherwise might be harder to solve.”
Fostering trust in the process
The company says it performs all supplier due diligence in-house, tracking 100+ data points across impact, integrity, and scalability. And scaling the industry needs, and rapidly. 
The benefits of a portfolio approach, CUR8 says, is that by working with a range of suppliers it also helps to grow the entire sector, ensuring there is enough supply in 1, 5, 10, and 25 years time. Furthermore, it balances benefits and challenges with drawdown speed, as well as reduces risks. 
“We’re a market maker, so we’re going beyond the broker model. The broker model is the way that we’re starting. But we’re also talking constantly, both with suppliers and in the demand market to understand what’s actually needed to accelerate this,” Dr Walker says.  
“And the aim is not just to see a market that’s developing and grab a piece of the pie, or even make it a bit easier for some people who would otherwise have to do something that is a bit harder. This market needs to go from a few hundred thousand tonnes of high durability removals now to somewhere between 10 and 15 billion a year by 2050.” 
Not to be overly dramatic, but the fate of the world may actually depend on it.

Why the future won’t look like a sci-fi movie,Andrea Hak,2023/06/7,"
This article features an interview with Nick Foster, former Head of Design for Google X. Foster will be speaking at TNW Conference, which takes place on June 15 & 16 in Amsterdam.

When we think about the future, our minds tend to conjure up images of cyberpunk cities where flying cars zoom overhead, 3D hologram advertisements pop up as you walk by, and everyone is dressed in sexy post-apocalyptic gear with unidentifiable tech gadgets hanging from Batman-style utility belts.
“We’re sort of stuck in a science fiction fantasy land,” says Nick Foster, former Head of Design at Google X.
Foster has been a designer and futurist for 20 years, working for a wide range of tech companies from Dyson to Sony to Nokia. What he’s discovered over two decades of working in future and speculative design is that:
“Science fiction has really colonised the world of technology futures to an unhelpful degree. It’s very rare that you can build something that came from a book, a movie, or a series that would actually be useful.”
But it’s natural for us to imagine a future of hoverboard skateboards and lightsabers, of evil empires and galactic alliances.
“Whenever we look at the future, because it doesn’t exist yet, by its very nature it has no manifest reality. So we have to tell stories and those stories tend to fall back on the natural tropes of storytelling. They have a hero, they go through an arch, they’re made for entertainment, and they’re mostly dominated by science fiction — exciting space operas and flying machines,” Foster says.
But what’s the problem with living in a sci-fi fantasy vision of the future? 

At CES this year, there was a curious exhibition called The Gallery of Flops including long-lost products like the ill-fated Sony Google TV remote featuring a confusing collection of 88 buttons, magnified Nike sunglasses for runners that required the wearer to glue magnets to their forehead, and a horrifying Jason-like face mask that was meant to restore youthful looks through electric stimulation.


The future may not be sexy, but it sure as hell will be practical for you and me.


What all of these varied products had in common was that they cost their companies millions in lost revenue. Foster states,
The highway of history is littered with the corpses of products like that, where people haven’t done the rigorous work and really thought about how it’s going to fit into people’s lives.
Technology can be intoxicating. Those things become ossified into everyone’s brain both in the consumer space and the creator’s space. So that just becomes the primary dominant method of stimulus for creating new products for the future. I’ve worked in this space long enough to see that happening almost homogeneously across the board.
It’s my job to actually design for the future. If you just tell a fantasy and produce sexy renderings of futuristic vehicles, it just doesn’t go anywhere. It gets clicks but it’s essentially the work of marketing, rather than new product development.
The future mundane 

Over the last 10 years, Foster’s switched over to the dark side so to speak. Rather than hoverboards and jet packs, he’s been drawn towards the nuts and bolts of everyday life in the future.
“Thinking about what a middle-income family might be experiencing in 2040 is way more exciting than thinking about the most extreme virtual reality life on Mars,” explains Foster.
What he’s talking about is the future mundane: Trying to think about the future in ways that are relatable, ordinary, and normalised, rather than escapist science fiction fantasy futures.
If we are gonna make flying cars, we have to talk about: where we can park them? How old do you have to be to fly one? Are there motorways in the sky? How do we regulate that? What’s the cost? How do these things refuel? We have to really ask those rigorous questions, otherwise, it’s just a fun escape for the afternoon.
Essentially that means, the future may not be sexy, but it sure as hell will be filled with practical and affordable inventions aimed at making your life and my life better (and for all those who don’t have 10k to shell out for a flying skateboard).


Science fiction has polluted our potential for thinking about the future.


That doesn’t mean we can’t have nice things. Amongst the remnants of product flops past, there was an early Nintendo VR headset from ‘95. Aside from its gender non-inclusive branding (“Virtual Boy”), as we see today, it wasn’t an implausible idea. However, in the 90s, the massive price tag this technology came with was simply not worth the rudimentary 3D graphics (nor the neck and eye spasms it induced in some users). And it was certainly not an option for most of Nintendo’s target audience (children and pre-teen boys).
It is possible to get to some of the ultra-futuristic tech you’re dreaming up, Foster says. But you need to take small steps forward and build on existing architecture. For Nintendo, this would have meant waiting until the technology and price tag had developed enough to make it a viable option for their audience — even if that would take another 30 years. (Which by the way also happens to coincide with the time when their target audience — now full grown adults — has the money to buy said virtual toys).
How to start thinking about the mundanity of everyday life in the future

As Foster explained, for companies, it’s just good economics. If you’re just talking at theoretical and abstract levels and not engaging with the lives ordinary people lead, from their desires to the dinners they eat, and the friend and family circles they interact with, you’re not going to convince them to spend money on something new.
His number one tip is to be pluralistic:
We live in such a volatile and changing world now that accurately saying this is where we’ll be in the future is impossible. The further you move out from today, the more uncertain you can be. The way futurists approach long-term projects is by populating them with many different scenarios. As the world changes, you reassess each one. It’s a bit like scenario planning.
Science fiction has gotten into our brains and has polluted our potential for thinking about the future. You need to free yourself of that to build truly useful and sustainable products that real people will use in the future.

European startup funding to drop 38% in 2023 — but there’s cause for hope,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/06/6,"
European tech startups will see a 38% investment drop in 2023 compared to 2022 levels, the latest report by Atomico finds. Specifically, startups are expected to raise $51bn in funding — down from $83bn in 2022 and $106bn in 2021.
But Europe isn’t alone in navigating a tough year for tech. The US and China are also looking at a 49% investment decrease in 2023 compared to 2021. According to the report, this global retraction in funding has a domino effect on the flow of capital between the regions. For Europe, this translates to a significant reduction of capital from US investors, which will mostly impact companies raising larger later-stage rounds.
While the funding slowdown is visible across all European countries, the biggest fall between H2’22 and H1’23 is expected in the UK with a 57% investment drop. This is followed by France at 55% and Germany at 44%.
As a result, founders are adjusting to the new reality, which, according to Atomico, means that layoffs were accelerated in Q1 2023, while valuations are dropping and down rounds are increasing.
Don’t worry, it’s not all doom and gloom
Despite the rough funding landscape, the European tech ecosystem’s total value is forecast to reach $1tn this year — climbing back to (the highest ever) 2021 levels.
The ecosystem also accounts for 29% of the global funding going to early-stage companies — almost at parity with the US (at 36%), after nearly halving the gap in the past five years. At the same time, Europe is leveling with the US in terms of startup creation, although the pace has slowed somewhat.
In addition, startups in the continent continue to lead in “purpose-driven tech” that meets the UN’s sustainability goals. Specifically, investments in “climate and purpose” have so far reached an all time high, representing 18% of the total funding.
Notably, the flow of capital in generative AI is also on the rise. This year to date, companies developing the technology have secured 35% of all funding going to AI/ML — the highest share ever — jumping from 5% in 2022.
“We should think about this period as a return to first principles,” said Tom Wehmeier, Partner and Head of Insights at Atomico. “From this cycle we have the opportunity to build an even healthier ecosystem, with a clearer focus on quality. In the short-term, there will be fewer companies started, but the ones that break through will more likely be winners, with a strong foundation of senior talent and greater share of the region’s resources.”

This AI-powered carbon tracker is fighting corporate greenwashing,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/06/6,"
This article features an interview with Lubomila Jordanova, founder and CEO at Plan A. Jordanova will be speaking at TNW Conference, which takes place on June 15 & 16 in Amsterdam. If you want to experience the event (and say hi to our editorial team!), we’ve got something special for our loyal readers. Use the promo code READ-TNW-25 and get a 25% discount on your business pass for TNW Conference. See you in Amsterdam!
In 2016, on a surfing trip in Morocco, Lubomila Jordanova experienced a serendipitous moment that would redirect the course of her life. That moment came not in the barrel of a wave, but on shore.  
“Looking around I noticed litter everywhere. I ended up spending that week cleaning the beach and, in the process, I realised I had basically no knowledge about pollution and climate change,” the Bulgarian entrepreneur tells TNW. “So after my trip, I embarked on a one-year journey to educate myself.”
At the end of that year, Jordanova quit her corporate job as an investment banker to forge a path as a climate tech entrepreneur. “I think it was an incredibly irrational decision,” she says. “I was working for a really successful fintech company at a time when the sector was exploding.”
But Jordanova was convinced that she had a moral obligation to dedicate her skills and knowledge to the climate cause. In 2017, she founded Plan A — an AI-powered carbon accounting tool that helps corporates measure, reduce, and report on CO2 emissions. 
“I was basically on my own,” she says. “Climate tech wasn’t even a thing at that time, and I had no experience as an entrepreneur. I learnt a lot in those first two years, lessons that are now helping me succeed as a founder and CEO.”

Out of the plethora of climate tech solutions, Jordanova chose carbon accounting because she believed that companies were lacking the necessary tools to precisely quantify their environmental impact, thereby impeding progress towards a more sustainable economy. 
The “key magic” behind the platform, says Jordanova, is an algorithm that gathers up to 20 million data points each month and automatically prescribes a list of actions a company must take to reduce its footprint. These actions include improving energy efficiency, sourcing goods from more sustainable suppliers, and, particularly for financial institutions, making climate-friendly investments. 
Jordanova has assembled a 100-strong team of leading climate scientists and developers to design and run the platform, which looks to make carbon accounting more accurate, robust, and, well, accountable.  
So far Plan A has been adopted by the likes of BMW, Deutsche Bank, N26, and the European Commission. The company does not, however, work with coal or oil and gas firms.   
Carbon accountability
As the world warms, pressure is mounting on corporations to decarbonise. But measuring a company’s footprint is far from straightforward. The fragmented and non-standardised nature of carbon accounting methods hampers accurate measurement and transparency in tracking corporate emissions.
Moreover, most companies in the EU, other than the largest ones, are not required to report on scope 3 emissions — which includes all indirect emissions outside a business’ purview, like those of suppliers. This scope, however, typically represents the largest chunk of a company’s total emissions.  
Failure to report scope 3 emissions, therefore, gives an incomplete measurement and may encourage greenwashing, says Jordanova. “When companies market their goods as sustainable without fully accounting for their emissions, they risk deceiving the consumer and furthering unsustainable consumption patterns,” she says. 
Fast fashion companies, for instance, have come under fire in recent years for falsely labelling products as ‘recyclable’ or ‘sustainable’ while masking the true impact of these products across the supply chain.   


 “Climate risk is business risk. 


Inaccurate carbon accounting isn’t just an enabler for greenwashing either; it can also squander genuine corporate efforts to decarbonise. Without accurate measurements, businesses cannot accurately reduce emissions or accurately report these reductions to customers, partners, and shareholders.     
“We want to turn carbon accounting from corporate headache to actionable opportunity,” says Jordonova.       
By automating the process with AI, Plan A looks to eliminate the human error associated with manual carbon accounting methods, which often rely on spreadsheets and manual calculations. All data is traceable in the platform, in an effort to improve transparency and accuracy.   
Importantly, the platform is aligned with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, the international standard for carbon accounting, as well as the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which provides decarbonisation targets based on the goals of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2°C above preindustrial levels.  
For Jordanova, transparent and accountable carbon accounting aligned with the best science simply makes business sense. “Climate risk is business risk, and anyone who ignores the writing on the wall will get left behind,” she says. 
While there is still a long way to go on the path to a net-zero economy, Jordanova is optimistic about the future. “I feel like things are bubbling,” she says. “There is a lot of excitement in this space and businesses we work with are showing a genuine interest in changing their practices. Let’s hope that momentum builds even further.”

"Finally, a useful blockchain application: Tracing halal meat",Thomas Macaulay,2023/06/5,"
Blockchain is frequently derided as a solution in search of a problem. But buried beneath the crypto scams and Web3 utopianism hide some intriguing use cases.
Some of the most powerful applications are in traceability. When embedded in supply chains, blockchain can track the entire product lifecycle, from origin to consumption. As the tech provides permanent, indelible, and unalterable records, extensive data about items and transactions can be securely stored and authenticated.
In the food sector, the benefits are particularly attractive. In one pilot project by UK startup Provenance, blockchain and smart tagging were used to track illegal tuna fishing, seafood fraud, and forced labour. As well as ensuring ethical practices, the scheme exposed blockchain’s potential for corporate auditing, tackling counterfeits, and reducing administrative costs.
In Wales, blockchain boffins have found another promising target for traceability: halal meat. In a European first, British startup iov42 is developing a data-sharing platform that provides secure records of compliance with halal standards — which are often breached by fraudulent products. 
The culprits range from sole traders to international organised crime groups. One of the most notorious transgressions emerged in 2020, when a Malaysian “meat cartel” was exposed for bribing customs officials, distributing meat from uncertified slaughterhouses, and passing off kangaroo and horse flesh as halal beef.
The scandal sparked an outcry in Malaysia — where Muslims comprise about 60% of the population — and across the Islamic world. It also threatened to cause deep financial problems. Malaysia was aiming to become a global hub for the $2.3 trillion halal market, and was already exporting $9bn in halal-certified products.
iov42 is betting that blockchain can reduce the risks of such offences. By tracing produce from the farm to the table, the company aims to embed provenance tracking, boost certification schemes, and increase impartiality in the halal market.
“Our technology was designed to help improve traceability in industries just like this,” said David Coleman, Chief Product Officer at iov42.
To bring the project to life, iov42 is collaborating with certification experts at  Prime UK, a Cardiff-based compliance services provider. Last week, the companies announced that they’ve attracted a cash injection from the Welsh government’s Blockchain Demonstrator Challenge Fund.
The government scheme was launched to develop the local blockchain sector. If the halal project is a success, it could provide a rare example of the real-world benefits that blockchain can bring to Wales.

You can now book seats on all-electric flights in Scandinavia — but read the small print,Thomas Macaulay,2023/06/2,"
A European airline today opened reservations for its first-ever commercial electric flights — but don’t expect a booking for this year’s summer holiday. Or the next four after that. Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) aims to make the maiden voyages within Sweden, Norway, and Denmark in 2028 — and even that sounds ambitious.
The company still hasn’t chosen the aircraft for the trip, which is unsurprising as the planes are still being built. SAS also isn’t ready to tell customers the date, departure location, distance, or duration of their flights. The airline promises to reveal further details “when decided.”
Another potential obstacle is regulatory hurdles. The new certification rules for electric aviation have, thus far, lagged behind technological development.
All of this makes it natural to have doubts about the timeline. According to SAS, the projections are based on talks with potential suppliers and the first electric flight “is estimated to be carried out in 2028.” Notably, that’s when the ES-30 airliner is due to enter service.

Developed by Swedish startup Heart Aerospace, the ES30 is expected to carry 30 passengers along a 200km all-electric range. In September 2022, SAS signed a “letter of support” about adding the model to its regional fleet.
The airline, however, says it still hasn’t made a final decision on which aircraft will operate the first flight. Nonetheless, it’s billing the ticket sales alone as a historic moment.
“The fact that we can now invite our passengers to the next major milestone in the future of aviation is a natural continuation of that pioneering spirit and a significant step on our journey towards more sustainable aviation,” said Anko van der Werff, CEO of SAS, in a statement.
Despite the apparent confidence, SAS isn’t willing to guarantee takeoffs in 2028. On the plus side, tickets are priced at a relatively reasonable 1946 Swedish krona (€168) — a nod to the year SAS started flying. And if your plans change, you can transfer the reservation to someone else.
If that convinces you to take the chance, you can reserve a seat here. There are 30 seats available on each of the three inaugural flights.

OpenAI CEO teases European HQ ahead of fresh talks with EU,Thomas Macaulay,2023/05/31,"
Sam Altman’s turbulent relationship with European regulators has taken two more turns. The OpenAI CEO is reportedly set for further talks with the EU — and a new HQ on the continent.
Altman last sparked an uproar after criticising the EU’s AI Act. The 38-year-old threatened to withdraw OpenAI’s services over plans for the landmark legislation, which would force his company to comply with extra obligations. 
Following a fierce backlash from lawmakers, Altman made a swift U-turn. The ChatGPT maker was “excited to continue to operate here,” he tweeted, and had “no plans to leave.”
 The charm offensive continued in an interview with Politico. “We really need an office in Europe,” Altman told the outlet. “We also just really want one.” 
Regardless of what he wants, the need is clear. Once the AI Act is passed, OpenAI will require a presence in the EU. But there are still chances to modify the regulation before it’s finalised.
With that in mind, a pair of new additions to Altman’s calendar could prove significant.
The first is scheduled for this Thursday, when he’s due to meet European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Brussels. The second is reportedly set for next month, when Altman and EU industry chief Thierry Breton will discuss compliance with the bloc’s impending rules.
Whatever the outcome, OpenAI’s explosive rise shows no signs of slowing down. New research from VezaDigital found that visits to openai.com grew by 54.21% in March to nearly 1bn monthly users — the greatest leap among the world’s top 50 websites. The site jumped 33 positions in the global rankings within just two months.
As for the company’s presence in Europe, Altman said he’d pick France if the choice was purely based on AI research talent. But he added that he’s “been super-impressed by the talent and energy everywhere.” Impressing the EU lawmakers will be the next test of his flattery.

This building in Amsterdam is almost 100% reusable,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/05/31,"
Dutch architecture firm MVRDV has completed Matrix One — a 6-storey, energy-efficient, office and laboratory block constructed using over 120,000 reusable components. 
The building is the largest of seven that make up the Matrix Innovation Center in the Amsterdam Science Park, which serves as a hub for scientists and entrepreneurs developing solutions to some of the world’s toughest challenges.
Matrix One has been designed for disassembly: almost everything from the doors and windows to ceilings and furniture is fully detachable and reusable. Even the floors are made from prefabricated concrete slabs with no fixed connections — they can simply be unscrewed and removed. 
MVRDV teamed up with Dutch startup Madaster to create ‘material passports’ for the building. These digital IDs store key information about each component — like weight, dimensions, and material characteristics — which aids efficient reuse further down the line.
Once the building reaches the end of its useful life or gets renovated, these components could be available for purchase on a second-hand marketplace (think eBay for buildings). According to MVRDV, 90% of the building’s materials can be used again. 
“In the future, we hope this is how all buildings will work,” said MVRDV partner Frans de Witte.

Construction and demolition is currently responsible for a third of all waste generated in the EU. Making the sector more circular — that is, to minimise waste to the furthest extent possible — has been identified as a key priority for the Dutch government, in line with its commitment to transition to a fully circular economy by 2050.  
Parallel to the push toward circularity is cutting down the carbon footprint of buildings and infrastructure, which account for a whopping 37% global CO₂ emissions. Projects like Matrix ONE act as a testbed for many of the technologies needed to minimise these impacts. 
“Matrix ONE offered an excellent opportunity for us to test a number of carbon-reduction strategies we have been investigating for a long time,” said de Witte.
The rooftop of Matrix One is covered with a 1,000 sq.m solar array, with the rest given over to greenery, helping improve insulation. Lighting and heating are controlled by sensors and via a phone app, to reduce energy consumption. 
Matrix One also has a restaurant on the ground floor, a bar at the top of the staircase, a 100-seat auditorium, and storage space for bikes.

Einride brings its futuristic electric self-driving trucks to the UAE,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/05/31,"
Einride, a pioneer in electric and autonomous freight transport, is expanding its services to the Middle East, following a collaboration with the UAE government to accelerate the region’s transition to sustainable shipping.
Founded in 2016, the Swedish startup is on a mission to decarbonise the industry by developing and deploying a holistic freight mobility ecosystem. This includes its electric and autonomous fleets, its intelligent platform, called Einiride Saga, charging infrastructure, and connectivity networks.
Einride, which is already operating in Europe and the US, has now signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the UAE government to deploy its ecosystem over a 550km stretch across Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Sharjah. The so-called Falcon Rise Grid will encompass 2,000 electric trucks, 200 autonomous trucks, and eight charging stations with more than 500 charging points. Einride will develop the project over the course of five years.

“This collaboration gets to the core of what Einride provides — the transformation to effective and sustainable shipping that is fully electric,” remarked Robert Falck, Einride’s founder and CEO. The company, which has partnered with global firms such as Coca Cola and Oatly, says its clients have seen an up to 95% reduction in emissions, while remaining cost-competitive.
“Through this collaboration with Einride, we aim to leverage the latest technological advancements to reduce emissions and enhance the efficiency of freight operations across the region,” said HE. Sharif Alolama, Undersecretary for Energy and Petroleum Affairs of the UAE.

The Falcon Rise Grid project in the UAE follows a series of market expansions over the past 12 months, including Germany, Benelux, and the UK. Einride’s presence in the Middle East also represents another significant milestone for the startup. In 2019, the company became the first in the world to deploy an electric autonomous vehicle on a public road, in Sweden. In 2022, it became the first company to receive approval to do the same in the US.

UK startup taps ChatGPT to launch AI playlist generator,Thomas Macaulay,2023/05/30,"
A UK startup has tapped ChatGPT to build a text-to-music playlist generator.
The AI system is the brainchild of Uppbeat, an audio platform based in Leeds. Targeting content creators, the feature finds copyright-free tracks for video soundtracks. Uppbeat claims it’s the first tool that lets people use their own language to find the songs they want.
“Generative AI music is rife with copyright and overall quality issues,” said Lewis Foster, CEO of Uppbeat, in a statement. “Our catalogue is full of incredible artists and AI doesn’t come closet. But, we asked ourselves, ‘What if we can use AI to help creators pinpoint the perfect copyright-free music for their content?’
“This ‘What if?’ moment has evolved into our game-changing AI Playlist Generator and I’m excited to share it with the world. We believe it promises to positively impact the way creators soundtrack their content with AI. Give it a try!”
To use the tool, just enter a description of your video, scene, music vibe, or personality. The system will then return a custom playlist of matches from Uppbeat’s catalogue of tracks.
As the tool is currently available in a freemium version, we tried to give it a whirl.
The system can process a diverse array of prompts. Credit: Uppbeat
We asked for a playlist about an apt scene: “A tech boss uses AI to take over the world.” Within seconds, the machine spat out a mix titled, “Tech Takeover Tunes.”
We were impressed by the selection. Although smash hits were lacking, it was a suitable soundtracking for a cyborg Musk pillaging his way across the planet.

German startup secures funding for bizarre twisted fusion machine,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/05/30,"
A German startup has secured its first investment to scale a bizarre twisted-looking fusion machine that could power the world with abundant, clean, and limitless energy.   
Proxima Fusion raised €‎7mn in funding to build a device known as a stellarator, a little-known fusion reactor that could hold the key to unlocking the potential of atom-fusing power within our lifetime.  
While the initial funding round was small, it is noteworthy because the startup is the first spinout from Germany’s esteemed Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics.  
The institute is solely dedicated to fusion research and is home to the world’s largest stellarator. Dubbed the Wendelstein 7-X, the machine is the result of 27 years of research and design (and €‎1.3bn of investment), aided by recent advancements in supercomputing and state-of-the-art plasma theory.

While the physics behind the machine is extremely complicated, what matters is that stellarators offer a number of potential advantages to the more popular doughnut-shaped tokamak — a design that has dominated the fusion sector for decades.  
The twisted configuration of the superconducting magnets in a stellarator help to keep the super-heated plasma they contain stable enough to fuse nuclei and release energy. Even more crucial for a future fusion power plant, they can theoretically operate continuously, whereas tokamaks must stop periodically to reset their magnet coils. 
However, stellarators are notoriously complex to design and build, which is why they were largely set aside in the 1960s in favour of their simpler cousin, the tokamak. 
“A tokamak is kind of easy to design, hard to operate, whereas a stellarator is super hard to design but once you’ve designed it, it’s way easier to operate,” Ian Hogarth, co-founder of Plural Platform, which is leading the €7mn investment, told the Financial Times.
Since the German Chancellor at the time, Angela Merkel, turned on W7-X in 2016, it has achieved a number of scientific breakthroughs that are “basically defining the whole field of magnetic confinement fusion,” said Hogarth.  
Fusion physicist Josefine Proll of the Eindhoven University of Technology is equally excited. “All of a sudden, stellarators are back in the game,” she said. 
Proxima Fusion, aided by the initial investment, looks to take these developments commercial. Its CEO Francesco Sciortino believes that the startup’s connection to the Max Planck Institute, which has more people working on plasma physics than MIT, offers a unique advantage. “The question is, can we execute just as well, and really make this a European champion?” he asked. 
While private investment has poured into tokamak pioneers — such as the likes of MIT spinout CFS, valued at over $2bn — recent breakthroughs in stellarator technology could pave the way for a new cohort of fusion startups like Proxima. 
Type One, a spinoff from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Proxima’s only other competitor so far, raised $29mn in March from Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Ventures to develop a commercially viable stellarator. 
While the stellarator startup scene is powering up, Thomas Klinger, director of the Max Planck Institute’s Greifswald branch, cautioned that commercially viable operations could still be 25 years away. 
However, if the technology can deliver on the promise of limitless, clean energy — then it’s probably worth the wait. 
If you, like me, would really like to nerd out on stellarator technology a bit more, check out this fascinating explainer from the Max Planck Institute:

Another European eVTOL startup delays launch amid certification hurdles,Linnea Ahlgren,2023/05/30,"
If you, like me, have been waiting for the day when urban sprawls begin to resemble your favourite sci-fi scene with flying taxis journeying in silent files high up amongst the skyscrapers, it seems you may have to wait a little while longer. 
Bristol-based urban air mobility (UAM) startup Vertical Aerospace is the latest in a long line to announce the (second) delay of entry into service of its aircraft, the VX4. The company has told investors it is now targeting certification from the UK’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) by the end of 2026 – two years behind the original timeline. 
Setting dates to get the first electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicle (eVTOL) certified was always bound to be something of a gamble. Most of the companies developing these zero-emission ‘air taxis’ are aerospace startups (albeit supported by established OEM partners) with little to no experience of the actual aircraft certification process required. 
As acknowledged by Vertical’s CEO Stephen Fitzpatrick in a letter to investors seen by the Financial Times, “Attempting to predict a date with certainty when it is several years away is challenging and achieving it depends on agreeing compliance methods for new technology with the authorities.”
First mover problems
Straddling the axis of innovation and sustainability, eVTOL technology has the potential to revolutionise urban and regional mobility of both passengers and cargo. However, with new technologies come new regulatory requirements. This will be especially true for the fully autonomous aircraft predicted to enter the market in a decade or so. 
A report by Morgan Stanley in 2019 predicted that the global eVTOL market would grow to $1.5 trillion by 2040. Two years later, the figure was downgraded to $1 trillion. However, by 2050, the company estimates the market will have reached a staggering $9 trillion.
 Furthermore, the report acknowledged that the industry’s first movers had a “regulatory Mount Everest” to confront before launching their aircraft into service.
It’s not as if Vertical hasn’t been groundbreaking in the sector; the company has already been flying full-scale prototypes for the past four years. In March it received what is known as a design organisation approval (DOA) by the CAA – the first time any regulator has granted one to an eVTOL maker. 
And there are many customers waiting eagerly to begin making a dent in net-zero pledges; Vertical Aerospace has a pre-order book of 1,400 aircraft. Prospective customers of the four-passenger-one-pilot VX4 include American Airlines and Virgin Atlantic, as well as Irish aircraft leasing giant Avolon. 
Who will actually make it to market?
Currently, there are about 500 electric vertical takeoff and landing developers worldwide. The market is concentrated in North America (with the notable exception of Embraer in Brazil), Europe, and Asia.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the US and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) have taken slightly different approaches to certifying eVTOL. The FAA has adapted its existing aircraft certification framework, whereas the EU has developed draft regulations and a new eVTOL certification framework. The UK CAA announced in June last year it would use the same standards set out by EASA. 
Both approaches seem to be having the same kind of impact on many manufacturer timelines. In the US, notable new developers such as Joby Aviation and Archer first proclaimed entry-into-service dates in 2024, but recently pushed them to 2025. 
Brazil’s seasoned aircraft manufacturer Embraer has taken a more conservative approach, stating it will have its EVE eVTOL delivered to customers in 2026. Meanwhile, European aerospace giant Airbus has had to push back the first flight of its CityBus NextGen prototype to 2024, a year later than planned when announcing the project back in 2021.
Nonetheless, there are developers that are still bullish on their original plans. Germany’s Volocopter is adamant that it will have certified its aircraft in time for the Paris 2024 Olympics. Its compatriot Lilium (setting itself apart from other companies by developing a eVTOL jet), however, has delayed its early estimate of 2024 by a year. 
Meanwhile, Lilium has commenced wind tunnel testing of a 40%-scale prototype at a joint German-Dutch facility in the Netherlands after securing a new round of funding at the beginning of May. 
Most likely, as predicted by Morgan Stanley, the first movers will have the largest regulatory mountain to climb. Perhaps after the summit, the UAM revolution will begin in earnest, and we can all catch a silent, zero-emission rideshare and reminisce about the time we used to waste in noisy, polluting traffic jams.

Dutch startup targets European intercity air taxi service from 2027,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/05/26,"
Dutch aviation startup ELECTRON Aviation has inked an agreement with Twente Airport, in the next step of its plans to launch a zero-emissions short-haul flight service from 2027. 
The startup’s planned fleet of electric air taxis will transport up to four passengers at a time to various European cities within a 500km radius of the airport. 
“To be clear, that gets you to Berlin, London, or Paris, all in under 2 hours,” said Josef Mouris, CEO and co-founder of ELECTRON. 
The startup’s Electron5 plane, which is still in the prototype phase, will fly at around 300km/h with a max range of 750km on a single charge. By aiming for smaller aircraft, the company hopes to build out its fleet at pace. 
“To fly meaningful distances within this decade, we had to compromise on the aircraft size, limiting ourselves to five seats. Which, if you think about it, is the perfect size for our on-demand business model,” said Mouris.

The startup plans to provide a quick, easy service akin to the Uber of planes — offering a faster and greener way to travel between major European centres. The plane needs 800m of airstrip to take off, which means it can launch from most regular airports, the startup said.
Previously, Josef was quoted saying that a 400km trip in one of his air taxis would set you back around €225. However, in a press release yesterday, the CEO said the “low operating costs” of the aircraft (in comparison with other low-emissions alternatives like hydrogen) would eventually enable the startup to “match or beat” the price of an economy-class plane ticket. 
The startup is part of Electric Flying Connection (EFC), a Dutch consortium of companies that recently submitted a funding application to the Dutch Growth Fund to scale battery-electric flying in the country. 
Jan Schuring, CEO of Twente Airport, which joined the consortium this year, said that demand for improved connectivity in the region was high, both within the Netherlands and for cross-border travel to Germany, France, and the UK.  
By bringing in ELECTRON aviation as the second operator, Twente Airport looks to position itself as the airport of choice for electric air taxi startups looking to launch their services in the country. 
ELECTRON also signed a similar agreement with Groningen airport in 2021 and plans to roll out a fleet of battery-electric, zero-emissions aircraft at both airports in 2027.

‘Digital bridge’ between brain and spine enables paralysed man to walk again,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/05/26,"
Over a decade ago, a cycling accident left Gert-Jan Oskam paralysed after causing him a spinal cord injury. Now, he’s able to stand and walk again thanks to an innovative brain-spine interface (BSI) developed by a team of Swiss neuroscientists.
To walk, the brain must send a command to the region of the spinal cord that’s responsible for movement control. But a spinal cord injury interrupts this communication.
“Our idea was to reestablish this communication with a “digital bridge”, an electric communication between the brain and the region of the spinal cord that is still intact,” said Professor Grégoire Courtine, one of the project’s lead neuroscientists.
To do that, the team created a wireless interface between the brain and the spine using brain-computer interface (BCI) technology that transforms thought into action. As a result, Oksam can now stand, walk, and climb stairs naturally just by thinking about it.

To establish this digital bridge, two electronic implants in the brain detect neural activity when Oskam wants to move his legs. These signals are then transmitted to a processing unit, which he wears as a backpack. A specially-developed algorithm decodes them and sends them as instructions to another electronic implant, inserted in the spinal cord regions that controls leg movement. This implant works as a neurostimulator which, in turn, activates muscles to move.
Oskam had to undertake two surgeries and around 40 rehabilitation sessions to regain voluntary movement of his legs. “The most surprising thing, I think, happened after two days,” he said during an interview. “Within five to 10 minutes, I could control my hips.”

What is particularly noteworthy is that Oskam can also walk short distances without the device if he uses crutches. The researchers believe that the device has not only improved his sensory and motor perceptions, but also helped develop new nerve connections.
Oksam is the only individual to have tested the technology, but the research team is currently recruiting three people to examine whether a similar device could restore arm movement. The neuroscientists believe that the BSI could also deliver promising results for stroke-caused paralysis.
The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) along with project affiliated companies ONWARD medical and CEA have received funding from the European Innovation Council (EIC) to develop a commercial version of the digital bridge and make the technology available worldwide.

London crowned tech king of the world,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/05/25,"
London has been named the world’s most high-tech city, according to Z/Yen Group’s seventh edition of the Smart Centres Index, published today.  
The British capital secured the top spot for its world-leading financial services, deep talent pool, quality of its business environment, and international reputation.
Climbing from second place, London was joined in the top five by New York, San Francisco, Zurich, and Lugano. Oxford came in seventh place, putting four European cities in the top 10. 
The news that London has taken the top tech title from New York will undoubtedly be welcomed by British PM Rishi Sunak, who has on multiple occasions expressed his desire to make the UK as a whole a tech and innovation superpower. 
In a rather humourous speech recently Sunak even labelled the country “Unicorn Kingdom,” in a not-so-subtle nod to the fact that the UK has so far birthed 162 startups valued at $1 billion or more.     
While the PM definitely shouldn’t forge a career in comedy, he does have a point. During 2022, UK tech firms raised £24bn in funding, more than France (£11.8bn) and Germany (£9.1 bn) combined, making it the world’s third-largest tech sector.  
Leading this investment is London, which is currently home to a number of up-and-coming tech firms including Deliveroo, Revolut, and Wise, as well as emerging startups like AI research lab DeepMind and metaverse developer Improbable.

Britain’s deepest mine could unlock secrets to permanent settlement on Mars,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/05/25,"
You might already know that humans are planning to permanently settle on Mars sometime in the near future. When and how that will happen is anyone’s guess, but scientists at the University of Birmingham believe some of the answers could lie beneath our feet.      
The researchers have set up a laboratory 1.1km underground in Britain’s deepest mine to investigate how scientific and medical operations would take place in the challenging environments of Mars and the Moon.   
The lab is located in a 3,000m3 tunnel network adjacent to the Boulby Underground Laboratory, a deep underground research facility in Yorkshire focused on particle physics, Earth sciences, and astrobiology research.
The lab is the first of many subterranean facilities under Bio-SPHERE, a project that will study how humans might work — and stay healthy — during long space missions on other planets. Comprised of a 3m-wide module, the lab will specifically test and simulate biomedical procedures.
“This project will help to gather the information that can advise on the life support systems, devices, and biomaterials which could be used in medical emergencies and tissue repair following damage in deep-space missions,” said Dr Alexandra Iordachescu, who is leading the study. 
The project also looks to recreate the operational conditions humans would face working in similar caverns on the Moon and Mars, including remoteness, limited access to new materials, and challenges in moving heavy equipment around. 
According to the researchers, constructing caverns underground might be a viable way to overcome the many hazards of living on the surface of other planets, such as deep-space radiation and falling debris from meteorites.   
“Bio-SPHERE promises to help answer some key logistical questions in establishing sustainable living conditions in remote, subterranean environments, and in doing so will significantly contribute to the essential preparations for our collective long, difficult, and exciting journey ahead [to other planets],” said Professor Sean Paling from the Boulby Underground Laboratory.
Outside the realm of research, commitments to developing permanent settlements on Mars have already been made by public space agencies including the ESA and NASA, as well as by private organisations SpaceX, Lockheed Martin, and Boeing.

Your next home could be 3D-printed. Here’s how,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/05/25,"
Experts estimate around 60% of buildings that will exist in 30 years’ time have yet to be built. This equals constructing a city the size of Stockholm every week until 2050. However, the construction sector currently doesn’t have the people or the skills to deliver the infrastructure and homes we need at the pace required. But what if we could offload some of the work to robots?  
Enter 3D concrete printing — an emerging technology that uses 3D printers to create all manner of structures, from bridges and sculptures to houses and even whole neighbourhoods. These huge printers work much like their desktop equivalents, but instead of using ink, they extrude concrete. A giant robotic arm deposits the concrete layer by layer, like a tube of toothpaste, according to plans laid out in a digital blueprint.
This application of 3D printing technology has caused quite a stir in recent years, captivating millions on social media. Just take Aiman Hussein, director of printing at US-based startup Alquist 3D. His TikTok videos of 3D concrete printers building homes have racked up tens of millions of views and scored him over 60K followers.

But while the process of a robot depositing layer after layer of smooth concrete might be mesmerising to some, the real buzz around 3D concrete printing is in its potential to make construction faster, cleaner, and greener.
Building better 
Construction is one of the oldest professions on earth and is vital to our everyday lives: it builds the houses we live in, the infrastructure we travel on, and the schools our children learn in. But, the sector is plagued by cost overruns, chronic inefficiencies, and labour shortages. What’s more, it has a gargantuan environmental impact — the built environment is responsible for almost 40% of global CO₂ emissions and accounts for a third of all waste generated in the EU.  
“If we are to deliver the homes and infrastructure we so desperately need over the coming decades — in a way that is sustainable and cost-effective — something drastically needs to change,” Rob Wolfs, professor in structural engineering at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e), tells TNW.   
Wolfs is one of the foremost global experts on 3D concrete printing. “This technology can help tackle some of the greatest challenges facing the construction industry today,” he says, as we zip down the escalator into the basement of TU/e’s built environment department.
Located down a narrow concrete stairwell behind a set of wooden doors is the department’s R&D lab. It smells like sawdust, fresh concrete, and potential. This is where bright ideas go to get tested and validated. It’s also home to the university’s very own 3D concrete printer. For almost a decade, the printer (which sadly doesn’t have a cool nickname) has been used to refine and develop 3D printing technology and has laid the foundation of knowledge for many of the commercial-scale projects we see today. 
Rob Wolfs stands in the shadow of TU/e’s 3D concrete printer during TNW’s visit to the university’s built environment lab.
3D printing offers the ability for mass customisation that was previously too challenging or costly to achieve using traditional methods. Want to create a bespoke house design or a unique building component or even an artificial coral reef with complex twists and shapes? 3D printing offers that freedom of design. “You can really make everything unique, everything optimised, tailored to a specific application,” says Wolfs. 
But crucially, because 3D printing is an “additive” process, building a product layer by layer, it can build structures using only the exact amount of material required. Numerous studies have shown that 3D printing in construction can reduce waste by 30-60%. 
The efficiency of the process also means less concrete is needed overall: Finnish startup Hyperion Robotics claims that its 3D printing micro-factories can reduce concrete use by 75%. If concrete were a country it would be the third largest emitter of CO₂ — so the less we use it the better.  


 “Robots do the hard work, so you don’t have to. 


3D printing automates many of the tough tasks involved in construction, such as bricklaying, reducing the number of people needed on site. Given the chronic lack of workers entering the industry, many consider automation and robotics to be the only solution to delivering the infrastructure we need at the pace and scale required. 
“Robots are not going to take people’s jobs,” says Wolfs. “They’re going to do the dirty, hard labour, freeing up people to do safer, more skilled work.” 
Automation also increases speed and efficiency, with some 3D printing companies claiming they can print the entire structure of a house in 24 hours. 
So 3D printing in construction has the potential to produce complex designs, boost efficiency, reduce waste, improve sustainability, and address workforce challenges. But can it deliver? 
Taking shape 
In 2021, Dutch couple Elize Lutz and Harrie Dekkers, retired shopkeepers from Amsterdam, became Europe’s first inhabitants of a 3D-printed house in Eindhoven. Their new home, which cost €1,400 per month to rent at the time, is the first of five houses under Project Milestone — a collaborative effort between TU/e, the government, and the construction industry to validate and scale 3D construction printing. Here’s some pics of their new abode:   

 
Construction company Weber Beamix printed the boulder-shaped house, which consists of 24 separate concrete elements, at its facility in Eindhoven. The elements were transported by truck to the building site, bolted together and secured to the foundation, after which the roof and frames were added and the finishing touches applied — the whole process took around 120 hours. The partners aim to construct the next four houses completely onsite using one giant printer.     
Weber Beamix has been working closely with TU/e for years, to bring its research to market. So far the company, a subsidiary of French construction giant Saint Gobain, has printed all manner of structures: a 30-metre-long bridge in the Dutch city of Nijmegen, a 9-metre-tall pigeon tower in Qatar, and a skate park in Eindhoven. 
But that’s just a drop in the ocean. In the last couple of years, 3D-printed structures have been popping up all over the show, with some seriously ambitious projects in the works.      
In 2021, Germany’s first ever 3D-printed house was unveiled in the town of Beckum. In 2022, a two-storey apartment building, also in Germany, was 3D-printed in just 72 hours by a two-person crew and is now occupied by five households. In the same year, French 3D printing startup XtreeE successfully constructed five social homes in the city of Reims.

Perhaps the world’s most ambitious 3D-printed affordable housing project is in the small town of Accrington, England. The £6m Charter Street scheme, developed by Irish architecture firm Harcourt Technologies and local social housing provider Building for Humanity, will house homeless veterans and low-income families in 46 eco-homes that can each be printed in weeks. Full planning permission has already been secured for the site, and construction is set to begin imminently. 
At the time of writing, Danish manufacturer of 3D concreteprinters, COBOD, is working with humanitarian foundation Team4UA to 3D-print a school in Ukraine. Over 2,000 schools have been damaged or destroyed since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year, and it is hoped that 3D concrete printing can expedite reconstruction efforts.

But it’s not just 3D-printed buildings that are making the headlines. The design freedom afforded by 3D concrete printers means they can create just about anything, from staircases and protective sea walls, to septic tanks and even wind turbine foundations. 
According to Henrik Lund-Nielsen, CEO at COBOD, the technology can deliver its “biggest bang for the buck” not in housing but in industrial projects where reinforced concrete makes up a much larger part of the project’s total cost.  
These applications are not just bound to Earth either. In December 2022, NASA awarded US startup ICON a $57m contract to develop 3D-printing technology to build roads, launchpads, and homes on the moon’s surface, as part of NASA’s Artemis program, which plans for long-term human exploration of the moon. ICON is currently developing a large 3D printer that could be transported to the moon, using lunar materials instead of concrete to print the lunar base.

More and more big players are entering the 3D construction printing space, lured by its potential benefits. COBOD, which claims to be the largest provider of 3D printers to the construction industry, is backed by a number of global industrial giants, including General Electric, which recently built the world’s biggest additive construction facility to 3D print concrete bases for wind turbines.  
Yet despite the impressive progress to date, according to a recent report, there are currently only 130 completed 3D-printed buildings globally. Clearly then, the 3D printing in construction is making its mark, although its true potential is not so concrete.
Beyond the hype
“When this technology arrived on the scene around 10 years ago, people thought we were going to 3D print everything in the future — but it hasn’t quite turned out that way,” Wolfs told TNW. 
Wolfs’ insights on the development of 3D printing nod to Gartner’s Hype Cycle, which outlines the five distinct phases of a technology’s lifecycle.   
Gartner’s Hype Cycle offers a view of how a technology or application will evolve over time.
As Wolfs pointed out, around 10 years ago, 3D printing as a whole was in the hype phase, or the ‘peak of inflated expectations’. Startups were popping up all over the place, VC capital was flowing, and 3D printers were expected to be busily cranking out all the tools, human organs, and automobiles anyone could ever want or need. 
Then came the inevitable descent into the ‘trough of disillusionment’ somewhere around 2015 — flaws in the technology emerged, early adopters encountered performance issues, and there were low returns on investment.    
Fast forward to the present day, and 3D printing as a whole appears to be on the up again, as kinks get ironed out, early adopters start to see returns, and the technology matures. However, there is a great disparity between different applications of 3D printing as to where they sit on the Gartner Hype Cycle. 
“Almost all dental implants these days are 3D printed. The technology is now mainstream because it’s proven to be the best way to manufacture that product,” says Wolfs. “However, in construction, we’re not there yet, not even close.”


 “3D printing won’t solve the housing crisis on its own. 


Perhaps the biggest buzz around 3D construction printing lately has been its potential to solve the housing crisis. As countries worldwide face a shortage of homes, proponents believe houses that ‘can be printed in a day’ could be the solution. Wolfs is not so sure. 
“3D printing won’t solve the housing crisis on its own — that issue is far too complex and is not just a technological problem,” he says. “It doesn’t make sense to replace all the traditional building methods with 3D printing either, but to find applications where 3D printing really makes sense.”
There are two key areas that could propel 3D construction printing up the ‘slope of enlightenment’, according to Wolfs: standardising the technology and making it more sustainable.  
“We have to come up with ways to assess and guarantee the quality of our printed structures  and move towards standardisation of this technology. It is moving so quickly it risks getting in its own way,” he said.
Will a 3D-printed home last as long as a traditionally built home? Will it be structurally sound and safe in the event of a fire or natural disaster? Since the development of the technology has outpaced updates to widely used codes and standards, it has left builders with few answers. 
At TU/e, researchers are undertaking strength and material testing on a smaller scale in order to validate on a larger scale, with the idea that eventually the results will become enshrined in standards like the Euro code. For now, 3D concrete printing pioneers have to hope that their designs will pass building codes written up for structures built using traditional methods.

Then there’s the sustainability aspect. While 3D construction printing cuts waste, it still relies heavily on cement. The scaling of low-emission cement alternatives — like those infused with graphene or made from local clay — will be key to ensuring 3D printing can meet its environmental credentials. 
Key to all of this is trial and error. As research advances, more projects break ground, and big players enter the industry, it seems only a matter of time before 3D construction printing can cement its place in the market. 
Printing the future  
Despite an apparent decade-long inertia, the digital transformation of construction is now in full swing, with technologies like Building Information Modelling (BIM), digital twins, drones, robotics, and blockchain helping contractors deliver structures more efficiently and sustainably. 
Going forward, Wolfs predicts that 3D printing will become part of this ‘toolbox’ of technologies, as construction moves toward increasing levels of automation and digitisation. 
As the technology continually develops, opportunities will emerge to print bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. One day, 3D printers might even be able to print multiple materials from the same nozzle, allowing the construction of not just concrete walls but steel frames, windows, and insulation, in one sweeping motion. 
There is also the possibility that future structures will be printed by ‘teams’ of 3D printing robots of different sizes — one large printer for the structure, multiple smaller ones for elements like doors and windows, and swarms of flying 3D printing drones for the finishing touches. 
3D printing in construction, then, is not so much of a revolution as an evolution. Either way, it seems likely that the buildings of the future will, in some part, be 3D printed.

Google launches €10M social innovation AI fund for European entrepreneurs,Linnea Ahlgren,2023/05/25,"
In conjunction with a visit of CEO Sundar Pichai’s visit to Stockholm yesterday, Google announced the launch of the second Google.org Social Innovation Fund on AI to “help social enterprises solve some of Europe’s most pressing challenges.” 
Through the fund, Google is making €10 million available, along with mentoring and support, for entrepreneurs from underserved backgrounds. The aim is to help them develop transformative AI solutions that specifically target problems they face on a daily basis.
The fund will provide capital via a grant to INCO for the expansion of Social Tides, an accelerator program funded by Google.org, that will provide cash support of up to $250,000 (€232,000). 
In 2021, Google put up €20 million for European AI social innovation startups through the same mechanism. Among the beneficiaries at that time was The Newsroom in Portugal, which uses an AI-powered app to encourage a more contextualised reading experience to take people out of their bubble and reduce polarisation.
Mini-European tour ahead of AI Act
Of the money offered by the tech giant this time around €1 million will be earmarked for nonprofits that are helping to strengthen and grow social entrepreneurship in Sweden. 
During his brief stay, Pichai met with the country’s prime minister and visited the KTH Royal Institute of Technology to meet with students and professors.

— KTH Royal Institute of Technology (@KTHuniversity) May 24, 2023

Sweden currently holds the six-month-long rotating Presidency of the European Union. Pichai’s visit to Stockholm preceded a trip to meet with European Commission deputy chief Vera Jourova and EU industry chief Thierry Breton on Wednesday. 
Breton is one of the drivers behind the EU’s much-anticipated AI Act, a world-first attempt at far-reaching AI regulation. One of the biggest sources of contention — and surely subject to much lobbying from the industry — is whether so-called general purpose AI, such as the technology behind ChatGPT or Google’s Bard should be considered “high-risk.” 
Speaking to Swedish news outlet SVT on the day of his visit, Pichai stated that he believes that AI is indeed too important not to regulate, and to regulate well. “It is definitely going to involve governments, companies, academic universities, nonprofits, and other stakeholders,” Google’s top executive said. 
However, he may be doing some convincing of his own in Brussels, further adding, “These AI systems are going to be used for everything, from recommending a nearby coffee shop to potentially recommending a health treatment for you. As you can imagine, these are very different applications. So where we could get it wrong is to apply a high-risk assessment to all these use cases.” 
Will Pichai be successful in convincing the Commission? Then, just maybe, Bard will launch in Europe too.

Improbable launches new metaverse think tank amid strategic pivot,Thomas Macaulay,2023/05/24,"
British unicorn Improbable has sharpened its metaverse focus with the launch of a new think tank.
Dubbed the Metaverse Society, the think tank will explore the social and economic impacts of the nascent tech. Improbable told TNW that it wants to develop use cases, clarify misconceptions, and reduce risks associated with the metaverse.
“We want to contribute to ensuring the metaverse holds its promise of being a network of meaning that unlocks creativity, social interaction, and economic opportunities, free from gatekeepers,” said Herman Narula, Improbable’s founder and CEO.
“The convergence of AI, metaverse, and blockchain technologies offers a unique moment to shape a space where communities, content developers and brands can re-imagine engagement, loyalty, and culture. We need to bring together key players and address the misconceptions around the metaverse.”
Improbable plans to present a detailed program of Metaverse Society activities at the end of June. 
To kick things off, the company is bringing its own research portfolio to the think tank. This includes studies of potential metaverse sectors, a report on European regulation — and a new research memo that offers clues on Improbable’s evolving strategy. 


“Without blockchain-based solutions, the metaverse is not possible.


The new memo emphasises the value of blockchain in making the metaverse decentralized, interoperable, and monetisable.
“The metaverse will rely heavily on blockchain technology, particularly in terms of economic activity… Without blockchain-based solutions, the metaverse is not possible,” write the authors.
On the blockchain
The think tank and memo were unveiled amid a big strategic pivot for Improbable. The company has developed virtual worlds for over a decade, but recently shifted to focus exclusively on the commercial metaverse.
As part of the shift, the Softbank-backed firm has abandoned plans to build its own video games. In December, the company also shuttered its US defence arm, which provided war-gaming simulations for military forces.
The subsidiary’s former president, Caitlin Dohrman, said Improbable had decided to “refocus on its commercial metaverse business” amid a need “to accelerate its path to profitability.”
Instead of in-house games and defence, Improbable is now concentrating on metaverse infrastructure. A key component of this effort involves blockchain tech.
In September, the Financial Times reported that Improbable was closing in on a new €100m funding round, which would value the company at more than €3bn. The round was led by Elrond, a blockchain company.
Improbable is also developing M2, a blockchain-enabled network of interoperable metaverses, and is collaborating with the company behind the Bored Ape NFTs on a virtual world project.
The pivot to a blockchain-powered metaverse aims to end Improbable’s operating losses. Narula says he expects the company to be profitable in 2023.

Electric hypercar Rimac Nevera smashes 23 performance records in a single day,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/05/23,"
Since its launch in 2021, the all-electric Rimac Nevera has hit the hypercar world like the storm it’s named after — and for good reason. With an impressive 1,914 horsepower and a 0-100km/h acceleration in just 1.85 seconds, this beautiful machine not only holds the top EV speed record, but also outperforms its petrol-powered counterparts.
Now, the Nevera has hit another milestone: it has broken 23 performance records in a single day, claiming the title of the “ultimate record-breaking hypercar.” The tests were run at Germany’s Automotive Testing Papenburg (ATP) facility, and were independently verified by third-party companies Dewesoft and RaceLogic.
The insane Rimac Nevera. Credit: Rimac Automobili
The EV’s strike was led by the 0-400-0km/h run, the utmost test of hypercar straight line performance, combining acceleration, aerodynamics, top speed, and stopping power. The Nevera managed to accelerate from 0km/h to 400km/h and come back to a standstill in 29.93 seconds — over a second faster than the previous record holder, the Konigsegg Regera.
In practice, the Nevera shuttered most existing acceleration records. It did a 0-200km/h run in 4.42 seconds, continued to 300km/h in 9.22 seconds, and reached 400km/h in 21.31 seconds. The hypercar even outperformed itself clocking 1.81 seconds for 0-100km/h — four seconds faster than its official acceleration spec. Not to mention that smashing 23 records within a day is a record in itself.
Below you can find the full list of benchmarks:

Behind the success lies Rimac’s in-house technology, encompassing the Nevera’s aerodynamic design, powertrain, battery system, and software.
To name its most essential specs, the Croatian-made EV comes with a 120kWh battery pack and uses four electric motors — one for each wheel — which produce an impressive 1.4MW of power. It also features a top notch regenerative braking system combined with 390mm Brembo CCMR carbon-ceramic brake discs, and six-piston callipers.

“I am proud to say that the car we’ve created can get to 400km/h and back to 0 in less time than it took the McLaren F1 to accelerate up to 350km/h,” Mate Rimac, founder and CEO of the company, said in a statement. “And not only that, but it can do it again and again, breaking every other performance record in the process. If you had a Nevera and access to a track, you could do it too.”
Rimac will make only 150 Neveras, so if you’d like to feel the power of this breathtaking car, you’d better act fast. You’ll also need to pay an estimated €2m to buy it, but that’s a rather fair price for recreational record-breaking.
In the meantime (or if the EV is far off your budget), you can watch the Nevera smashing records on the video below:

A glimpse into AI’s future in architecture: Inflatable skyscrapers,Thomas Macaulay,2023/05/23,"
Designers have given a glimpse into the future of urban architecture: AI-generated inflatable skyscrapers.
The buildings are the brainchild of Zumo, a Barcelona-based architectural practice. Founded in 2020 by Andre Sashko and Alessandro Lussignoli, the firm blends classical knowledge and contemporary tech to visualise new construction forms.
Their latest project adds Midjourney to the art of architecture. Zumo used the text-to-image model to visualise the wobbly edifices in urban settings.
First published by Design Boom, the images depict the superstructures towering over future cities. To my unsullied eyes, they resemble illuminated balloons soaring into the skyline. But my cruder colleagues compared them to giant condoms.
You can draw your own analogies after scrolling through the gallery below:

Inevitably, there’s a sustainability component to the project. As inflatables, the buildings can be pumped up to lofty heights, flattened for transportation, and reconstructed in locations where they’re needed. Just make sure to dispose all sharps before entry.
Powered by renewable energy, they also have a reduced environmental footprint — which could be useful if they were real. One day, perhaps they will be.
AI takes on architecture
Zumo’s buildings may be fake, but AI already has a role in designing real buildings. Zaha Hadid Architects, for instance, recently revealed that it uses text-to-image generators to produce ideas for “most” of its projects.
Although popular, the practice is proving divisive. Supporters argue that AI can provide fresh inspiration, engage clients with the design process, and replace menial tasks. But critics say the systems are biased towards certain architectural and visual styles.
There is also a broader concern about the threat to human designers. In January, three artists turned the issue into a class action lawsuit. The plaintiffs allege that Sta­bil­ity AI, DeviantArt, and Mid­jour­ney have violated the rights of “millions of artists” by remixing their copyrighted works.
These companies, the case argues, train their tools on pictures scraped from the web without the consent of creators. It’s hardly a contentious claim — Midjourney’s founder has admitted to the practice. 
Inspired by the original artworks, the systems now pump out endless AI-generated images — at a profit. Arguably, they’re stealing both past and future work from artists. But if they can deliver a glorious future of living in condoms, perhaps it’s justifiable.

EU fines Meta record €1.2B as feud over data transfers to the US escalates,Thomas Macaulay,2023/05/22,"
In a seminal moment for international data flows, the EU has fined Meta a record-breaking €1.2bn for privacy violations.
The penalty is the largest ever for a violation of GDPR, which was introduced to protect personal information. According to EU regulators, Meta broke the rules by transferring user data from the bloc to the US for processing.
The Facebook owner made these transfers on the basis of standard contractual clauses (SCCs), which govern the flow of personal data. But an EU investigation determined that SCCs don’t provide enough protection from US surveillance.
Andrea Jelinek, chair of the European Data Protection Board, called the infringement “very serious” because the transfers were systematic, repetitive, and continuous.
“Facebook has millions of users in Europe, so the volume of personal data transferred is massive,” she said. “The unprecedented fine is a strong signal to organisations that serious infringements have far-reaching consequences.”
Meta called the fine “unjustified and unnecessary” and said it would appeal the ruling.

The intervention could prove pivotal for data transfers more broadly. Lawmakers in the EU and US are currently developing a new transatlantic Data Privacy Framework that would clarify the requirements for moving information across borders.
Nick Clegg, Meta’s head of global affairs, said the new ruling had disregarded the progress being made on this issue. He called it “a dangerous precedent” for data transfers that imperils the foundations of an open internet.
“Without the ability to transfer data across borders, the internet risks being carved up into national and regional silos, restricting the global economy and leaving citizens in different countries unable to access many of the shared services we have come to rely on,” said Clegg.
Naturally, Clegg has a vested interest in easing data flows to the US, but he’s not alone in wanting the removal of digital borders. According to Janine Regan, Legal Director for Data Protection at law firm Charles Russell Speechlys, there’s political agreement on both sides of the Atlantic to resolve the issue. 
“It’s likely that an alternative transfer mechanism will be ready over the summer so that Meta does not have to completely suspend transatlantic transfers, but this will be little consolation for a company facing such a record-breaking fine,” she said.
Dangerous times for data violations
The new ruling also serves as a warning to other companies that transfer data. Chris Linnell, Principal Data Protection Consultant at cyber security firm Bridewell called it “a stark reminder” that SSCs alone don’t adequately protect personal data.
He advised all organisations to undertake transfer risk assessments when processing personal data outside of the EU. In addition, he recommends regular ongoing reviews of compliance and potential risks to data subjects.
“Ultimately, contracts in place between parties will not act as a safeguard when recipient organisations have their own legal obligations to fulfil when it comes to national surveillance laws, such as FISA in the United States,” said Linnel.

3 ways tourism businesses can use tech to reduce their carbon emissions,Singapore Tourism Board,2023/05/22,"
Sustainability has become a major trend across different industries, and tourism isn’t an exception. In fact, 83% of leisure and business travellers worldwide believe that sustainable travel is vital.
Some, such as the Sands Expo, which is now carbon neutral, have used this status to differentiate themselves on the market and attract new eco-conscious customers.
Before we dive further, just what is sustainable tourism?
The UNWTO defines it as:
Tourism that takes full account of its current and future economic, social and environmental impacts, addressing the needs of visitors, the industry, the environment, and host communities.
In practice, this means more tourism businesses are looking internally to see how they can address issues like decarbonization, waste and pollution reduction, increasing future green investments, thereby providing more eco-friendly travel experiences.
Many are finding that going green isn’t only the right thing to do, it also makes business sense by helping reduce costs and make operations more efficient.
The emergence of new sustainability tech is helping usher in this new era of sustainable, eco-conscious tourism by offering innovative solutions that can be adopted by both large and small-scale businesses.
Here we will highlight best practice examples from various tourism companies and some practical things you can do to make your business more sustainable.
Eliminating food waste
Around a third of all food produced for human consumption is wasted. According to the UNEP Food Waste Index 2021, around 931 million tonnes of food waste was generated in 2019 – 39% from food service and retail including restaurants, hotels, and shops. Together, food loss and waste is responsible for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions annually and results in $940 billion in economic losses.
Singapore is making good progress in reducing food waste overall, however, it still accounts for 10% of the total waste generated in the country and the recycling rate remains relatively low. For example, the only landfill in Singapore, Semakau, might run out of space by 2035. That’s why reducing food waste is one of the country’s three priority waste streams under the recently launched Zero Waste Masterplan.
In this regard, the Singapore National Environment Agency (NEA) has launched a $1.24 million Food Waste Fund that covers the capital cost of food loss treatment solutions for Singapore businesses. The Singapore Hotel Association was among the beneficiaries.
Interestingly, studies have shown that for every $1 hotels and restaurants invest in programs to reduce kitchen food waste, they save $7 on average in operating costs. Therefore, finding ways to reduce food waste is a win-win as it helps travel businesses cut both carbon emissions and costs. Funding opportunities, cost reductions, new tech are leading to some interesting new innovations.
The Grand Hyatt Singapore has its own waste management plant which is capable of converting 1,000kg of food waste into organic, pathogen free fertiliser which can be reused to keep the hotel’s greenery looking lush. On top of this, they’re now saving $100,000 per year by cutting out the need for waste haulage.


Sustainable initiatives have allowed venues to cut emissions, and also costs.


MICE venues are also getting into the recycling game. MAX Atria, the convention wing of Singapore EXPO, is composting food waste into fertiliser that can be used in their garden. They were the first MICE venue to receive Singapore’s Building and Construction Authority Green Mark Platinum Award for their efforts.
The Mandarin Oriental Singapore invested in an aerobic food digester that can convert up to 20 tonnes of food waste into (unharmful) greywater each month. This grey water can then be put back into the normal sewage system, without causing any harm. Alongside this, the hotel conducts an annual audit to see how they can improve their waste management operations.
So how can you get started and what can you do if you don’t have the funds to invest in your own food processing system?
To lower food waste, you will need to first have a clear picture of how much waste you are producing. Singapore Tourism Board’s accelerator alumni, Lumitics, created a plug and play food waste solution tailor-made to the food & beverage industry. Their product has become a seamless smart food waste tracker that gives real insights into how much food waste a kitchen generates. With this data, users can create a strategy to eliminate food waste and track their progress over time. And this is not just for restaurants, some of their clients include hotels, cruise lines, and airlines.
EATLAB is another accelerator alumni that provides restaurants with the data and insights they need to optimise their operations. With consumer modelling insights, kitchens can make smarter ordering choices, lowering costs and avoiding inefficiencies.
While some food waste is always inevitable, take a page from the Marina Bay Sands and the Grand Hyatt Singapore which have both introduced programs to donate non-perishable food items (such as bread and pastries) and frozen cooked foods to charities including the Singapore Food Bank, Food From The Heart, and Kerbside Gourmet.
Introducing green utilities
To reach emissions reduction targets, most companies are shifting their portfolios to add green renewables. A number of travel businesses including hotels, meeting and conference venues, restaurants, and retail businesses are adopting innovative new ways to make their water supplies, heating and cooling systems, and electricity green. This has not only allowed these venues to cut emissions but, again, also costs.
Singapore has introduced a Green Plan to encourage these innovations and aims to transform the city into a greener and more sustainable place to live by 2030 which could mean potential subsidies for green energy initiatives.
Grand Hyatt Singapore has been recognized as one of the first businesses to install a gas-powered trigeneration plant to cover 30% of its electricity needs. The system generates hot air for its laundry facilities and air-conditioning. This initiative has helped the hotel to reduce its carbon footprint by 1,200 tonnes per year.


A new wave of eco-conscious travellers want to lower their carbon footprint while travelling.


Parkroyal on Pickering uses cutting-edge environmentally-friendly utilities and technologies. In regards to controlling heating and cooling conditions in the hotel, cascading greenery keeps the west-facing wall cool and reduces the energy consumption needed. The hotel’s landscape areas are designed to be self-sustaining; water usage is minimised by harvesting rain and usage of NEWater. They have also introduced high performance glass that reduces solar heat and provides natural light inside the building.
The Pan Pacific Orchard hotel, which has a zero-impact and zero-waste agenda, is planning to use green spaces to regulate temperature. Among other features, a rainwater harvesting system, a recyclable water system, and a compactor which turns food waste into compost have been integrated into the building’s architectural plans. Meanwhile its public spaces, meeting spaces and guestrooms are designed to make use of natural daylight, reducing lighting costs.
Again, when looking to introduce cost-saving green utilities or infrastructure, the most important place to start is with data. Singapore Tourism Board’s Accelerator alumni Winsar provides a comprehensive software solution for hotel management that provides all-in-one insights into operations including everything from purchasing and receipt of materials and tracking of usage to accounting. Having such insights in place will allow you to monitor the success of your new initiatives.
While these upgrades may require an initial investment, they can help reduce costs in the long term. To learn more, check out our earlier article about how Marriott International saved on long term costs by going green.
Using AI to help travellers lower their carbon footprint
A new wave of eco-conscious travellers want to lower their carbon footprint while travelling. For businesses in many countries, cutting their carbon footprint – also on business trips – has become a necessity to reach national emissions targets. But many don’t have the means or the time to spend calculating emissions and finding the most eco-friendly options. Travel agents, MICE tourism, and transport businesses that can help their customers easily organise low carbon trips and conferences will have an edge.
For example, Dutch meeting management platform, Meetingselect, is now working on a new AI-based feature that will help companies calculate “The Best Place to Meet” in terms of Total Travel Time, Total Travel Cost, and CO2/carbon footprint reduction, and ease the process of flexible workspace and co-working space bookings.
A number of airlines have started promoting сarbon-neutral trips by compensating for carbon emissions. For instance, in 2021 Singapore Airlines (SIA) Group launched a voluntary carbon offset programme for customers. With the help of an AI-based digital solution, customers can calculate the contribution needed to offset the emissions of their journey. They can then contribute to a number of projects SIA has launched to help protect forests in Indonesia, support renewable solar energy projects in India, and provide efficient, clean burning cookstoves for rural families in Nepal.
Event organisers and MICE tour operators can also take advantage of new tools to plan low emission travel routes. On Google Flights you can see emissions estimates for each leg of a trip. You can also sort results by carbon emissions and filter options by low emissions.
For the hospitality industry, it is important to know that Google also allows users to search for eco-certified hotels and filter based on the sustainability practises the hotel follows. To ensure your hotel appears higher in the search, it helps to become eco-certified by an independent source. Google provides a list of its approved certification agencies.
While sustainable tourism is still a niche sector in which travel businesses can distinguish themselves, we believe that this trend will become mainstream in the not too distant future. Those that start now by, not only adopting sustainability tech, but also adopting an eco-conscious mentality across their operations will be ahead of the curve.
For MICE, event organisers, venues, and the hospitality industry, this means knowing your sustainability performance today and reviewing sustainability initiatives – from food waste to water management – on a regular basis to see where further eco-efficiencies can be introduced and rethinking how physical structures can be utilised to reach sustainability goals i.e. for green spaces and rainwater collection. Meanwhile, transportation, travel agents, and travel organisers will become more focused on providing low-carbon travel options that will allow travellers to minimise their carbon footprint, while still enjoying the experience.
New advances in sustainability tech will be key to helping travel businesses, big and small, make the transition.
To support our vision of becoming a sustainable urban destination, where large experiences come with small footprints, Singapore Tourism Board’s startup accelerator program has an open call for founders with bright ideas on how to innovate in this space.

How to turn university spinouts into commercial success: A must-see talk at TNW Conference,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/05/22,"
Krijn de Nood, Julie Hawkins, and Stephanie Klein Nagelvoort-Schuit will be speaking at TNW Conference, which takes place on June 15 & 16 in Amsterdam. If you want to experience the event (and say hi to our editorial team!), we’ve got something special for our loyal readers. Use the promo code READ-TNW-25 and get a 25% discount on your business pass for TNW Conference. See you in Amsterdam!
Renowned university spinouts such as chip designer Arm in the UK and immunotherapy pioneer BionNTech in Germany have proven the importance of bringing scientific innovation to real-world industries. But the road from academia to enterprise is no bed of roses.
Back when I was in uni, I was part of a project that I hoped would place me and my fellow team under the “tech startup to watch” radar. But my dreams were quickly shuttered when I asked the leading professor if he would consider commercialising our tool outside of the university. His answer was succinct: “It’s far too complex.”
With outstanding academic institutions, Europe has the potential to emerge as the most attractive spinout ecosystem in the world — especially in the fields of computing, engineering, bioscience, and deep tech.
Although the number of spinouts on the continent has increased over the years with many deep tech startups in particular having strong university roots, it seems that founders still have to tackle considerable challenges: from high equity demands and a long spinout process, to securing later stage funding and cultivating entrepreneurial skills.
At TNW Conference, navigating the challenging journey from academia to startup gets the spotlight it deserves. On day one of the event, a group of leading experts and entrepreneurs will take the stage to discuss the crucial steps needed to bring academic innovations to market.
These are Krijn de Nood, CEO of Meatable, the trailblazing lab-grown meat startup; Julie Hawkins, General Partner at UK early-stage VC firm Local Globe; and Stephanie Klein Nagelvoort-Schuit, VP at University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) and founder of abcdeSIM, an e-learning spinout company from the Erasmus University Medical Center.
De Nood, Hawkins, and Klein Nagelvoort-Schuit will explore success stories of university spinouts and delve into some of the most significant challenges these startups face, such as bridging funding gaps and developing go-to-market strategies.
So if you’re a potential founder who wants to learn about the unique hurdles associated with university-born ventures and aspires to usher your own spinout into commercial success, make sure not to miss their talk! I know I won’t — and perhaps I’ll get inspired to go into academia again.
Navigating the spinout process is among many startup growth topics that will be explored at TNW Conference. You can find more on the event agenda — and remember: for a 25% discount on business passes, use the promo code READ-TNW-25.

Crypto payments can now be traced like bank transfers under new EU law,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/05/22,"
The EU Parliament agreed last week on the world’s first comprehensive set of rules to regulate the transfer of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, as it looks to crack down on money laundering and illegal transfers in the bloc.
From 2024, all crypto transfers, regardless of amount, will be covered by the so-called ‘travel rule’ — information on the source of the asset and its beneficiary will have to travel with the transaction and be stored on both sides of the transfer. 
The regulation requires firms that want to issue, trade, and safeguard crypto-assets, tokenised assets, and stablecoins in the 27-country bloc to obtain a licence.  
“Recent events have confirmed the urgent need for imposing rules which will better protect Europeans who have invested in these assets, and prevent the misuse of the crypto industry for the purposes of money laundering and financing of terrorism,” said Swedish finance minister Elisabeth Svantesson. 
MiCA — as the new regulation is known — is designed to ensure that crypto transfers within the EU can be traced in much the same way as ordinary bank transfers. Furthermore, they are meant to protect investors by increasing transparency and putting in place a comprehensive framework for issuers and service providers including compliance with the anti-money laundering rules. 
The new rules also require crypto-asset service providers to share mandatory information with tax authorities through an automatic exchange. However, they do not apply to person-to-person transfers conducted without a provider or among providers acting on their own behalf. 
Additionally, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) will be given powers to step in and ban or restrict crypto platforms if they are seen to not properly protect investors, or threaten market integrity or financial stability.
Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin trace transactions via a blockchain record. While all transactions are recorded in a publicly-accessible ledger, they can only be traced back to a user’s public key, not their real-world personal information. This pseudo-anonymity is what drew many to invest in crypto in the first place, but it poses a number of risks. 
Currently, when dealing with crypto-assets, people are not covered by EU consumer protection rules and risk losing money. Furthermore, the EU fears that the widespread use of crypto could drive financial instability, market manipulation, and financial crime. 
In 2022, the amount of cryptocurrency obtained either illegally or for groups or individuals to use for illicit purposes — including terrorism and human trafficking — stood at just over $20bn, according to Chainalysis, a platform that provides data on blockchain technology.
The technology also uses vast quantities of electricity: the energy consumption of bitcoin is estimated to equal that of a small country. 
‘World’s first comprehensive crypto rules’
So far, policies worldwide have ranged from ignoring to fully banning the use of cryptocurrencies. The UK has outlined a phased approach, starting with stablecoins and broadening out to other crypto-assets later on, but there is no firm timeframe. Meanwhile, the US has taken somewhat of a ‘case by case’ approach to the matter like prosecuting individuals or working to recover ransomed funds. 
In a departure from the global trend, MiCA is slated to be the world’s first comprehensive set of rules to regulate crypto-assets. This is part of a package of legislative proposals to strengthen the EU’s anti-money laundering and countering terrorism financing rules, presented by the Commission in 2021. The package also includes a proposal to create a new EU authority to fight money laundering.
MiCA also addresses environmental concerns surrounding crypto, with firms forced to disclose their energy consumption as well as the impact of digital assets on the environment.
Rather than scaring away crypto firms, MiCA is expected to attract both startups and prominent businesses, setting the stage for more healthy competition. 
According to Reuters, crypto firms say they welcome the “certainty in regulation”, putting pressure on countries to copy the EU rules, and on regulators to come up with global norms for cross-border activity. 
Brinda Paul, director of compliance at Australian crypto-asset firm Banxa, told CryptoPotato that he believes MiCA “sets a high standard for consumer protection”, which will create a more reliable and trustworthy crypto market and “benefits customers immensely.”

UK’s £1BN semiconductor plan branded ‘disappointing’ by chip sector,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/05/19,"
After a two-year wait, the UK has finally announced its semiconductor support plan, aiming to grow the domestic sector, increase its competitiveness, and reduce the risk of supply chain disruptions. But while industry players welcomed the strategy, they also criticised its level of support.
Under the new scheme, the government will invest up to £1 (€1.15) billion in the next decade, with an initial £200 million to be deployed in the next couple of years.
This amount, however, is dwarfed by similar initiatives in the West. The US has pledged $52bn in subsidies to boost its domestic semiconductor industry, while the EU’s Chips Act is offering €43bn to attract chip makers to build facilities within the bloc and ensure a European chip supply.
For Amelia Armour, partner at Amadeus Capital Partners, a UK VC firm which invests in semiconductor startups, the government’s funding is insufficient.
“The level of investment announced for the next two-year period is disappointing, especially considering the UK needs to try to keep pace with the investment levels announced as part of the EU and US Chip Acts,” Armour told TNW. “£200m spread over many initiatives won’t achieve much and will need to be allocated in a very targeted way to have an impact.”
Spreading the £1bn investment over a decade is also problematic, according to Amanda Brock, CEO at OpenUK, a non-profit organisation which represents the country’s open technology sector.
“It simply won’t build a world-leading semiconductor sector even with the existing world-class R&D experience we have in the UK today. We need to see faster action behind bigger numbers to achieve the goal,” Brock explained.
Unlike the US and the EU, the UK’s plan comes without particular focus on strengthening manufacturing capabilities. Instead, it targets international cooperation and the growth of focus areas where the country already holds a leading position: R&D, design, compound semiconductors, and intellectual property.
The funding will also be used to improve the talent pipeline and enable easier access to necessary infrastructure for British firms, with a special focus on startups and SMEs.
According to Mark Lippett, CEO of Bristol-based semiconductor company XMOS, manufacturing isn’t the only way to ensure competitiveness and a secure supply chain.
“The UK will not be able to develop a full supply chain to fulfill its semiconductor needs — it’s beyond the scope of even the US or Europe,” Lippett told TNW. “The question is, how does the UK secure ‘a seat at the table’ when global allocation is being determined? By having technology that the others want.”
But for OpenUk’s Brock, coupling investment with skills, deep industry knowledge, and a semiconductor manufacturing sector are key elements for the UK’s success.
“Until the UK has all of those building blocks in place, either in-country or as part of established semiconductor supply chains that will involve the UK as a principal supplier, it will not be close to being the global science and technology superpower [Sunak] is seeking,” she said.

"VC funding gap puts Europe’s climate targets at risk, report warns",Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/05/18,"
While Europe’s climate tech companies raised a record $13.2bn in 2022, investment is nowhere near the levels required to combat climate change, according to a new report by World Fund.
Specifically, analysts from the European climate tech VC, in collaboration with Cleantech Group and PwC, have found that investment needs are outpacing investment volumes at an exponentially increasing rate.
The numbers are telling. For the EU to reach its goal of reducing emissions by 55% by 2030, an annual investment of €1 trillion would be needed. By the same year, 29% of emission reductions would need to come from new technologies, such as batteries and renewable energy. And by 2050, 50% of emission reductions would need to come from technologies that are yet to be developed, as in the case of quantum computing.
World Fund highlights that in this environment, climate tech startups emerge as crucial drivers of transformation, but they require sufficient funding to do so.
“Climate tech startups are more than twice as likely to have a significant hardware component than a typical startup,” Daniel Valenzuela, the author of the report and World Fund’s Head of Impact and IR, told TNW. “This requires significant capital expenditure on R&D and tech infrastructure, as they seek to scale to the point where they’re actively removing carbon from our industries and economies.”
Since 2014, the EU has spent over €58bn in climate tech R&D from the Horizon Europe programme, with an additional €34bn in funding expected until 2027. This is accompanied by an annual €100bn investment from national R&D budgets.
Globally, this places the EU at the forefront of R&D capital allocation, ensuring the technological foundations on which to build businesses. But to retain this leading position, the report claims it’s critical to secure follow-up funding to scale these technologies.
This is where VCs can have a catalytic impact, according to World Fund. That’s because they’re able to support the fast technological and commercial de-risking of innovative climate tech solutions.
Yet, climate tech only represented 13% of the total VC funding in 2022. Specifically, the report identified that the largest funding gap is seen in later-stage VC, which targets the commercialisation of ready-for-market technologies. Namely, Series B funding accounts for a $13bn gap per year.
Valenzuela attributes this to two main factors. “On the one hand, we have seen new funds and first time managers come in, which are naturally smaller,” he explained. “On the other hand, there was a historic gap in Europe, and the players that do invest at that stage, are more generalists and only have limited capacities to understand the unique challenges and scientific lenses needed for scaling climate tech.”
But with climate action expected to create a multi-trillion dollar investment opportunity within the decade, it’s high time for both public and private actors to move faster. Especially for VCs, the report points to the growing role of science-led investment decision-making to gain a thorough understanding of the underlying climate science of a suggested target. This can range from the decarbonisation impact, to the technological barriers to be overcome.
“A well-directed scientific-led approach could overall unlock market dynamics towards climate effective solutions, overall accelerating the climate transition,” Valenzuela noted.
“Europe has the potential to lead the global climate tech revolution, and whilst we have lost a lot of time, it’s not too late to prevent the worst consequences of the climate crisis. We must grasp the full economic and environmental potential of the technological revolution unfolding before us,” said Danijel Visevic, Founding Partner at World Fund.
For the VC community, this means “doubling down” on areas such as climate deep tech and solutions to replace carbon-intensive industries, Visevic added.

Social impact startups face unique challenges — joining the right accelerator is key,Andrea Hak,2023/05/18,"
A growing number of founders are leveraging the power of technology to help solve some of society’s biggest problems, from developing self-monitoring digital health platforms that give patients more autonomy to finding new solutions for storing renewable energy.
Today, on Global Accessibility Awareness Day, it’s particularly important to recognise the advancements a growing number of founders have made in making technology open, equal, and accessible to all, from creating devices that take into account deaf and blind communities to using AI to build groundbreaking advancements in prosthetics.
But, due to the novel and often disruptive approaches they take to solve common problems, these startups also need to contend with additional hurdles. They often struggle with developing their product and business models, complying with regulations and bureaucratic red tape, gaining funding, and marketing their products and services.
Zeng Xi Feng, founder and CEO of TangTangQuan, a new platform that offers professional health management to children with Type1 diabetes, understands this all too well. With digital and wearable technology, his company aims to help diabetics maintain a normal life and combat key issues, such as discrimination in social environments and gaps in medical insurance coverage.
However, despite the potential TangTangQuan has to change lives for the better, Xi Feng and his team faced a number of challenges.
Challenging the status quo
Ironically, the main difficulty social impact startups are up against is not inventing a new solution, but getting people to change their habits and ways of thinking. As Xi Feng explained, many chronic disease patients place a greater focus on medicine and body examinations than on continuing health monitoring and management, which are actually more beneficial for therapy.
“The most difficult hurdle for digital health startups is developing a business model. Patients with chronic disease are used to paying for doctor visits, physical medicines, and examinations, but there is no notion of paying for digital services.”
Despite the fact that the type 1 diabetes community is already one of the chronic disease community’s most concerned about continuing health management, Xi Feng shared that less than 10% of patients are willing to pay for the health service.
Gaining funding
Many VCs still carry the outdated notion that social impact can’t be profitable, especially when it’s targeting new and niche audiences. For many social impact startups, this can make it difficult to raise funding amongst traditionally risk averse investors.
“The type 1 diabetes we are targeting is actually a very small community with few patients. Many of our peers and investors felt that our team would not survive the fierce competition using such a large team to serve such a small number of patients. As a result, we do not receive as much financing from VCs as other firms in the digital health field.”
Building a network
Xi Feng and his team realised forming a partnership with a large industry player would be the best move to gain the influence, credibility, and network TangTangQuan needed to reach more users. But attracting attention would be difficult.
“In China, business health insurance is still in its early stages. So there is no way to get the business model off the ground as rapidly as digital health startups in Europe and the United States can by working with commercial insurance companies,” Xi Feng explained.
That’s why they decided to enter the OPPO Inspiration Challenge which is aimed at empowering startups with innovative solutions to solve some of the world’s most pressing issues.
TangTangQuan was selected as one of the top ten proposals in the 2022 OPPO Inspiration Challenge, gaining access to OPPO’s tech, marketing, and business experts, and allowing it to establish a longer-term partnership with the brand.
Could joining an accelerator programme be right for you?
Joining an accelerator is a great way to get the guidance, mentorship, network, and visibility you need to take your startup to the next level. However, you need to select the right one for your business.
1. Define your goals and needs
Each program has its own unique strengths and areas of focus, so it’s important to find the one that best suits your startup’s specific needs. Start by clearly defining your startup’s long-term goals. It’s important to consider the growth stage your startup is in and what it would take to make it to the next level of growth, whether that’s access to new markets, technology, or funding.
Xi Feng had identified OPPO as a partner with the technology and market influence TangTangQuan needed to get its business off the ground.
“We had been researching the OPPO watch on our own before joining this challenge. We wanted to integrate the blood glucose monitoring app and the artificial pancreas app into the OPPO watch, and then have the watch send the blood glucose data to the cloud, allowing the patient’s parents to have real-time distant blood glucose monitoring as well as local blood glucose management.”
After being selected as one of the top 10 winning proposals last year, TangTangQuan started a partnership with the company. Now, OPPO watch (Chinese version) can be applied to the app to help more type 1 diabetes patients. Meanwhile, its IoT team has also helped TangTangQuan optimise data connection and transmission, making the app more accurate and convenient for patients to use.
“Of course, I think the value of participating in the OPPO Inspiration Challenge is still in the business model optimization mentioned earlier. In China, it’s still quite difficult for digital health startups to charge for their services, but by combining with OPPO hardware, we can successfully productize the service physically, while being able to transmit data remotely and make the service easy.”
2. Assess network access
When evaluating accelerator programs, it’s crucial to consider their market influence and reputation. Take a deeper look at the program’s network both in terms of potential corporate partnerships and its media presence. A well-connected accelerator can provide invaluable introductions, partnerships, and guidance from experienced professionals who can help propel your startup forward.
“Of course, OPPO’s brand influence and corporate awareness remain high, which is a positive endorsement for us. The variety of media coverage we received as a result of our participation in the Inspiration Challenge also contributed to our increased visibility. At the same time, we made many new acquaintances and generated commercial potential for future collaboration. In addition, we were also invited to participate in the filming of a video to promote our startup project to a wider audience.”
3. Research past alumni
Look for programs that have a strong track record of success, with alumni who have gone on to achieve notable milestones or made significant industry impact. Programs that have produced successful startups in your specific sector can also provide valuable market connections and credibility. Research the program’s alumni network and don’t be afraid to reach out to previous participants.
2023 OPPO Inspiration Challenge now open for applications
If you’re a social impact startup developing innovative new solutions in the fields of digital health, accessibility, and environmental protection, the OPPO Inspiration Challenge could be for you.
Together with Qualcomm, GSMA 5G IN, Amazon Web Services and LinkedIn, OPPO and its global technology ecosystem partners aim to bring new and innovative solutions to life by providing funding, support, and partnership opportunities. By working together, OPPO hopes these innovations can create a positive impact, and encourage greater awareness of the issues that affect global communities.
Each of the final top 5 winners will receive a grant of $50,000 (tax-included). The top 15 will be invited to OPPO’s Acceleration Camp where they will receive mentorship from experts and industry partners. Additional partnership opportunities will be open to the global top 45 participants.
The deadline to submit your proposal is 30 June 2023. Check out the OPPO Inspiration Challenge’s official website for more information.

Tech’s role in the quest for climate justice: What not to miss at TNW Conference,Linnea Ahlgren,2023/05/17,"
Award-winning innovators Caroline Lair and Lucia Gallardo will be speaking at TNW Conference, which takes place on June 15 & 16 in Amsterdam. If you want to experience the event (and say hi to our editorial team!), we’ve got something special for our loyal readers. Use the promo code READ-TNW-25 and get a 25% discount on your business pass for TNW Conference. See you in Amsterdam!
Social inequality and climate risk have become central to understanding what will drive innovation – and investment – for the future. On day two of TNW Conference, Caroline Lair, founder of startup and scaleup communities The Good AI and Women in AI, and Lucia Gallardo, founder and CEO of impact innovation “socio-technological experimentation lab” Emerge, will be on the Growth Quarters stage for a session titled “Technology-Driven Climate Justice.” 
The climate crisis is itself the result of a deeply embedded and systemic exploitation of nature and people in the name of profit. Its impact is already being felt disproportionately over the world, with severe heat waves, droughts, and entire nations disappearing below sea level. What’s more, the people worst affected are those who have contributed little to the greenhouse gas emissions driving global warming.
Climate justice is the idea that climate change is not just an environmental but also a social justice issue, and aims to ensure that the transition to a low-carbon economy is equitable and benefits everyone. Lair and Gallardo will specifically speak about how technologies such as AI, blockchain, and Web3 can play a crucial role in addressing these issues. 
AI for good
Artificial intelligence can be applied in the quest for climate justice in several ways, given that it is implemented in a way that ensures transparency, accountability, and fairness. These include data analysis and prediction, discovering patterns and informing policies, as well as evaluating their effectiveness. 
It can also enhance climate modelling capabilities, crucial for developing adaptation strategies. Furthermore, AI-powered technologies can monitor, for instance, weather systems with real-time data and also optimise resource allocation and energy distribution.
Reimagining value
Emerge’s objective is to “reimagine impact innovation with regenerative monetisation models.” Regenerative finance goes beyond traditional models that focus on profit, taking into account broader social, environmental, and economic impacts. 
Blockchain technology can, for instance, offer transparency for transactions, ensuring that funds are indeed directed to regenerative investments. It can also tokenise regenerative assets such as renewable energy installations, sustainable agriculture initiatives, or ecosystem restoration projects, representing them as digital tokens and making them more accessible to a broader range of investors. 
Meanwhile, in the words of Gallardo, “Integrating crypto into existing ecological initiatives doesn’t automatically mean it is applied regenerative finance. We must be intentional about how we’re reimagining value.”
Reclaiming an equitable future
Why am I looking forward to this session? The theme of this year’s TNW Conference is “Reclaim The Future”. In all honesty, I belong to a generation that, while I hopefully have several decades more of on-earth experience ahead of me, will most likely not have to deal with full-on dystopian scenarios, battling to survive climate catastrophe.
I am also privileged in terms of geographical location and socioeconomic status not to have to worry about immediate drought and famine. (Flooding may be another matter, but as someone said when convincing me to move to Amsterdam – “wouldn’t you prefer to live in a place that is already used to keeping water out?”) 
However, this does not mean that we who enjoy such privileges get to simply shrug our shoulders and carry on indulging in business as usual. TNW has always been about the good technology can do in the world. And what is better than employing it in service of one of the greatest challenges of our time?
 

 
Beyond the obvious urgency of the topic, I am excited to attend the session because, let’s face it, the moments in the tech industry where women grace the stage alone are few and far between. According to the World Economic Forum, only 22% of global AI jobs are held by women. In this instance, it is particularly potent as women and girls suffer to an even greater extent from issues arising from climate change such as food insecurity, water scarcity, and displacement with associated gender-based violence. 
The female lead
Caroline Lair is the founder of The Good AI, a community of AI talent, startups, and scaleups that are committed to helping companies transition toward a more responsible and sustainable business. She is also the co-founder of nonprofit Women in AI, a platform where women in artificial intelligence can come together to share, learn, and support each other. Furthermore, she has worked at Snips, building private-by-design AI Voice Assistant, which was acquired by Sonos in 2019, and was an investor and partner of HCVC venture capital firm. 
Lucia Gallardo is the founder and CEO of Emerge, which calls itself an experimental technologies lab at the convergence of sustainable development and social impact. She also sits on advisory boards and standard-setting committees and councils such as at the InterAmerican Development Bank and World Economic Forum. Among many other accolades, she has been named MIT Innovator under 35, and worked with clients including the US State Department, Hard Rock International, and the United Nations Development Program.

"Crypto has ‘no intrinsic value’ and ‘no useful social purpose,’ say lawmakers",Thomas Macaulay,2023/05/17,"
The crackdown on cryptocurrency escalated today when lawmakers called for consumer trading to be regulated like gambling.
In a new report by a cross-party committee, British politicians claimed the likes of Bitcoin and Ether have “no intrinsic value” and serve “no useful social purpose.” 
They also noted several adverse impacts of cryptocurrencies. Specifically, they highlighted the vast energy consumption, the risk to consumer traders, and the criminal use in scams, fraud, and money laundering.


‘Effective regulation is clearly needed.


Due to the public risks, the committee warned against regulating trading as a financial service — which the UK government has proposed.
“Effective regulation is clearly needed to protect consumers from harm, as well as to support productive innovation in the UK’s financial services industry,” said Committee chair Harriett Baldwin.
“However, with no intrinsic value, huge price volatility and no discernible social good, consumer trading of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin more closely resembles gambling than a financial service, and should be regulated as such. By betting on these unbacked ‘tokens’, consumers should be aware that all their money could be lost.”
Unsurprisingly, the comments have sparked an uproar in the crypto community. CryptoUK, an industry lobby group, was particularly affronted by the comparison with gambling.
“Professional investment managers see Bitcoin and other cryptoassets as a new alternative investment class — not as a form of gambling — and institutional adoption of unbacked crypto assets has increased significantly,” said Ian Taylor, board advisor at CryptoUK.
“Furthermore, gambling is exempt from capital gains tax. Does the government really wish to exclude tens of millions of pounds in tax income from gains made by the buying and selling of unbacked crypto assets?”


‘Crypto has been crucial for the unbanked.


Taylor further criticised the lawmakers for overlooking evidence submitted by CryptoUK. He argued they had neglected the sector’s moves to track, monitor and report, as well as efforts to mitigate fraud with analytics, and commitments to work closely with regulators and law enforcement.
In addition, he disputed claims that cryptocurrencies lacked useful social purposes.
“Crypto has been crucial in serving the unbanked as a force for good, making secure and efficient peer-to-peer payments available to the most vulnerable in our society,” he said. “Also, the report bears no mention of tokenization of financial products, which we specifically highlighted in the evidence session as a key benefit of the technology. 
“The ability to represent financial products such as bonds and equities on a blockchain defers a host of benefits. These include faster settlement times, reducing intermediaries thus saving costs, new access to markets, increased liquidity, and automation through smart contract technology.”
His arguments, however, arrive at a tough time for the industry. Trust in cryptocurrencies has been battered by market turmoil, the FTX scandal, and the collapse of “stablecoin” terra. In response, governments around the world are pushing for further regulation of the sector.
As is so often the case with tech legislation, the EU is leading the charge. In April, the European Parliament approved the world’s first comprehensive set of rules for crypto-assets.
In the UK, meanwhile, the election of a pro-crypto Prime Minister has sparked hopes that the country will become a global hub for the sector. But the new committee report shows any such objectives face powerful opposition.

"Funding down, exits muted, and valuations flat in rough quarter for European startups",Thomas Macaulay,2023/05/16,"
It’s been a rough start to 2023 for European startups. In the first quarter of the year, dealmaking decelerated, valuations flattened, and exits remained subdued, according to new research.
Analysts from PitchBook, a financial data firm, found that investor priorities have shifted from growth at all costs to profitability.
After a boom in VC activity that trickled into early 2022, reports of lower growth rates, workforce reductions, and tougher funding conditions have emerged. As a result, due diligence processes have lengthened, with revenues, valuations, and runways under heightened scrutiny.
Nalin Patel, the report’s author, noted that investors across the board have become more selective.
“We are seeing declines across financing stages, sectors, and geographies,” Patel told TNW.
Deal value and count for unicorns fell, respectively, 87.5% and 65.5% from Q1 2022.
Rays of hope were hard to find in the report, but a few shone through the gloom. Angel valuations were robust, with the median pacing at €3.7 million—above the €3m figure registered in 2022.
Early adoption may be tougher for startups in the current climate, but Pitchbook expects less mature companies to be protected from the turbulence affecting companies with high costs.
Indeed, current market conditions could force investors to focus on ideas with the potential for long-term success.
Consequently, Patel believes that seed and early-stage companies in long-term industries such as clean energy could remain appealing investments. Overall, however, the financial landscape remains treacherous.
“Companies are not growing at the same rate during the past few years, and valuations are cooling across the market,” said Patel. “We expect more colour on valuations to emerge as funding needs persist this year.”

Picture a future where technology enables sustainable living on Earth, while preparing for life in space. That’s the exact mission of Interstellar Lab — and this future is happening now! So if you share my excitement about humankind’s prospect to become a multiplanetary species, then at TNW Conference, you’re in for a treat.
On day one of the event, Barbara Belvisi, founder and CEO of the company, will tell the audience about how the startup’s BioPod is the next-generation greenhouse for the Earth and beyond.
It all started in 2018, when Belvisi founded Interstellar Lab, driven by her childhood passion for nature and space.
The French-American startup entered the industry with a visionary project: the development of mini extraterrestrial cities, called Experimental Bio-regenerative Stations (Ebios). The concept encompasses an array of modules, which, independently or combined, house all the infrastructure and resources needed to support and sustain human life on Mars and the Moon.
The first module developed is a sustainable farming system called BioPod. But its purpose isn’t only to prepare for life in space; it can also alleviate the climate crisis we’re currently facing.

We did it! First full-scale BioPod is out and operational. 🌱🚀
Our first BioPod is inspired by space and designed for earth. BioPod provides sustainable farming solutions for agriculture, natural ingredient sourcing and bioconservation.

According to Belvisi, the team first came up with the idea of a dome structure that could fulfill the nutritional needs of four astronauts on the Moon. They then turned this design into a product for the Earth.
Built to withstand extreme climates, BioPod is a 55m2 bubble-shaped greenhouse made of an inflatable membrane and composite base. It’s a fully autonomous, controlled-environment module that, thanks to AI and its aeroponics system, can create any type of climate, securing the ideal conditions for plants to grow.

🏆We have won the #BOLDAward in the #SpaceFrontier category 🚀! Congratulations to all the nominees and winners of the @Bold_Awards and hope to continue boldly innovating the way we grow food and protect life on Earth and beyond! 🌏🌿

The benefits of this technology are large and far-reaching. BioPod’s ability to cultivate virtually any plant and examine their hidden potential — such as producing fruits with higher nutrition concentration or cosmetic plants with specific oil concentration — render it a groundbreaking solution for a variety of purposes: from agriculture, research, and cosmetics, to medicine and bioconservation.
Notably, Interstellar Lab claims that each BioPod can increase yield by approximately 300 times, reduce water consumption by 98%, lower energy consumption by about 20 times, and capture 1 tonne of CO2 annually.
At the TNW Conference on June 15, Barbara Belvisi will share how Interstellar Lab is disrupting sustainable agriculture on Earth, while providing a test-bed for future life support in space.
I, for one, can’t wait to hear how merging space and Earth tech can help us live a better life on this planet and beyond.
Barbara Belvisi’s insights on multiplanetary life are merely one attraction of TNW Conference. You can find more on the event agenda — and remember: for a 25% discount on business passes, use the promo code READ-TNW-25.

First Contact: Finland’s Framery reveals new office pod with in-person effect,Andrii Degeler,2023/05/16,"
If you’re working with other people — which most of us are — it’s quite likely that you’re spending a sizeable chunk of your time in meetings. Before COVID-19, you’d expect most meetings to be conducted in-person, and business travel was much more prolific than it is these days.
The pandemic changed that dynamic beyond recognition, as startups and corporates alike suddenly discovered that a lot of things can actually be discussed and solved in a video call. Combined with people being generally reluctant to return to the office, this has ushered in an era of telepresence, where at least 84% of meetings (or even 98% depending on whom you’re listening to) have at least one remote participant.
But spending a bulk of your meeting time looking at the screen is tiring, and the rapport established over a Zoom meeting is nothing like what you can expect in-person. In an attempt to address this issue, Finland-based office pod pioneer Framery has just unveiled Framery Contact, an indoor call booth aimed at emulating an IRL meeting as closely as possible.
Most suitable for one-on-one meetings, the Contact is essentially a blacked out office pod with a large high-quality 4K screen, strategically positioned lighting, and a camera with a mirror system that gives the feeling of proper eye contact.
A couple of weeks before the official unveiling, TNW (represented by yours truly) went to Tampere, Finland to experience the pod and learn more about Framery’s journey that led to its creation. (Disclosure: travel and accommodation for the trip were covered by Framery. The company had no editorial influence on this story and didn’t see it before publication.)
Silence is golden
Founded in 2010 in Tampere, about a two-hour drive north from Helsinki, Framery started as a passion project of two young guys whose manager had insisted on making loud sales calls in their open-plan office. One of the guys, the company’s CEO Samu Hällfors, says that the company became the world’s first and biggest producer of truly soundproof office pods. From the first one-person enclosure, Framery O, the startup has extended its offering over the years with the four-person Q and six-person 2Q models.
In 2021, the company also presented Framery One, a version of the one-person pod with advanced connectivity options, built-in occupancy sensors, and calendar integration capabilities, which allowed booking it the same way you would a meeting room. Since then, the Finns have been hard at work on the software part of the product, aimed at providing insight into the pods’ usage for the HR or building managers.
Framery’s office and production facility in Tampere, Finland
Going even further, the team is currently working on a project that would see a heart rate sensor integrated into the seat in the pod, which could potentially provide anonymised and aggregated data on the users’ health and mental well-being.
The company, which currently employs some 400 people, saw €154 million in revenue in 2022. Back in 2018, Finnish private equity firm Vaaka Partners acquired 60% of Framery for an undisclosed amount.
Hello darkness
With the new office pod, Framery is definitely making a big bet on the importance its customers attach to the presence effect. Hällfors assumes that the first users of the product will be “international companies with offices on different continents;” having a Contact in each of them would supposedly make one-on-one meetings more engaging.
Achieving the desired effect, however, is likely to take some time, as the tech may require some getting used to. Unlike Framery’s other pods, Contact has blackout glass walls, so entering it for the first time feels very unusual; it certainly did for me.

Inside the pod, I found a seat and a side table, as well as a small screen on the left-hand side where you can control the calling system. The pod’s software suite runs on Windows 10 IoT with the UI written using the Qt framework. Its custom architecture is based on Scalable Video Coding (SVC) and uses the H.265 compression standard.
A portrait-oriented 4K screen occupies most of the pod’s wall in front of the user, with two bright lights to its sides. When Hällfors, who was in the US at the time of the test, called from another pod, I saw his image with proper depth right away, although some other people reported that it took them a couple of minutes to adjust.
The reason is that Framery Contact isn’t using any sophisticated technologies like volumetric or light-field displays, opting for a normal 2D screen together with our own mental capabilities.
“Removing the surroundings with black [backdrop] helps your brain to actually fill in the gaps and build this kind of 3D representation,” Hällfors explained.
Framery Contact uses only one camera; Karvinen didn’t name the brand or model, but mentioned that it’s an off-the-shelf component rather than a custom-built device. The camera is clearly optimised to deliver the most crisp image when the person in the pod is sitting upright; if they lean forward or backward, however, their image on the screen quickly becomes a bit blurred.

Combined with a mirror-based system that gives the illusion of eye contact and a seemingly decent audio setup in the soundproof booth, Framery Contact does feel much closer to an in-person experience. Although it supposedly only requires a bandwidth of 10Mbit/s to work, I was able to see a few stutters and jitters during the five-minute call, although the experience was hardly affected by them.
Done is better than perfect
At the moment, there are under a dozen Framery Contact booths in existence. Most of them are installed at the offices of the company’s unnamed pilot customers — and Framery is looking for more of those.
As for commercial availability, Hällfors doesn’t expect it to happen before some time next year. The planned price for the new pod is around €24,000; for comparison, a Framery Q pod that the Contact is based on costs around €16,000.
Framery’s unveiling comes just a few days after Google presented the latest update on its Project Starline, which uses several cameras and heavily relies on AI to create a 3D representation of the person you’re talking to on the screen. The obvious advantage of Google’s approach is that it doesn’t require a blacked out pod; the obvious issue, however, is that there’s no timeline on when it’d become commercially available. In addition, Google has continuously deflected questions about Skyline’s possible pricing, which suggests that it’s going to be sky-high indeed.

In addition to corporate offices, Hällfors sees the Contact being used in industries like telehealth and recruitment among others. He also mentioned that the next step for the company will be to scale the technology to allow meetings with up to two people on each side.
“I don’t think the Contact will replace all of our products, I don’t think the technology will be useful for all the use cases,” he said. “[Framery pods] are also used for in-person meetings, hybrid meetings, concentrated work, and so on.”
Another feature to be added in the future is interoperability with traditional video conferencing services like Google Meet, Zoom, or Microsoft Teams to allow a one-to-many usage scenario. According to Hällfors, it’s not a particularly difficult task from a technological standpoint; the biggest obstacle at this point is that none of those apps support 4K video, which is paramount for the product.
All in all, Framery Contact is an impressive feat of engineering that could signify a new technological trend and bring our expectations for online meetings to a new level. It’s not quite clear, however, how much is too much when it comes to creating a real-life feeling. In the meantime, look out for those black-glass booths in a corporate office near you to answer this question for yourself.

"Biohack me, baby: Why I can’t wait for Teemu Arina’s talk at TNW Conference",Thomas Macaulay,2023/05/12,"









Teemu Arina will be speaking at TNW Conference, which takes place on June 15 & 16 in Amsterdam.

Use the promo code READ-TNW-25 and get a 25% discount on your business pass for TNW Conference. See you in Amsterdam!
I often fantasise about biohacking my useless brain. At TNW Conference, my dreams could finally be fulfilled.
On day two of the event, biohacker Teemu Arina will immerse attendees in the fascinating realm of human enhancement.
Arina is one of the world’s leading authorities on the movement. He co-authored the bestselling Biohacker’s Handbook and founded the Biohacker Summit — Europe’s leading conference for optimising human performance. He’s also the co-founder of Biohacker Center, an independent think tank that researches peak performance, health, and well-being.
Naturally, Arina meticulously biohacks himself. Initially, I imagined this would involve drilling brain chips into his skull. But biohacking is closer to DIY biology.
Arina’s website provides a more detailed description:
“Biohacking is the art and science of optimizing your body, mind, and performance with systems thinking, technology, and biology — in other words, better living through science.”
Arina entered the field after he was afflicted by a chronic illness. Biohacking provided a route to recovery. That led him to further optimise his health and performance with biological and technological tools.
Some of these tools are surprisingly accessible. Arina uses activity trackers to manage stress, a headset to measure brainwaves, a muscle scanner to guide fitness training, and a blue light device to synchronise his circadian rhythm.
At TNW Conference on June 16, Arina will unravel the next phase of biohacking — and how it can unlock human potential. He promises to share his pioneering techniques for enhancing physical and mental performance.
To my decrepit mind and body, that sounds like an unmissable offer. And just in case Arina wants to ramp it up, I’m bringing my brain and scalpel.

Northvolt to build gigafactory in Germany after state aid pledge,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/05/12,"
Northvolt, Europe’s biggest battery maker, has confirmed that it will build its next gigafactory in Heide, Germany, following the federal government’s pledge to provide state aid.
The announcement comes after several months of uncertainty. In March 2022, the Swedish manufacturer and the German state of Schleswig-Holstein signed a memorandum of understanding to construct a factory in the region. But in October 2022, Northvolt said it might postpone the plan and priotirise a US expansion instead — unless the EU was willing to match the IRA’s loftier subsidies for green technologies.
In response, the German government has now confirmed it’ll fund the gigafactory under the Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework (TCTF) — a new EU state-aid plan, designed to support the development of green projects in view of the US’ respective subsidies and Russia’s energy monopoly.
The funding needs to be approved by Brussels first, but the federal government said it’s already “in the first constructive discussions” with the European Commission.
“Backed by this commitment of the federal government, Northvolt has decided to take the next steps towards our expansion in Heide,” said Peter Carlsson, founder & CEO of the company.
The gigafactory will have a 60GWh annual production volume of battery cells, aiming to supply approximately 1million EVs. It’s expected to unlock a multi-billion euro private investment, and create 3,000 direct jobs with thousands more estimated in the surrounding industry and service sector.
“With the next steps regarding Northvolt, Germany can look forward to one of the most significant lighthouse projects of the energy and transport transition,” said Robert Habeck, Germany’s deputy chancellor and economy minister.
In addition to the Commission’s approval, the gigafactory still requires preparational on-site work for construction and the final building permission. Deliveries of the first battery cells are expected in 2026.

Fairphone unveils user-repairable wireless headphones,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/05/12,"
At a time when the electronics industry is constantly luring consumers into buying the latest and most advanced devices, Amsterdam-based Fairphone has made a name for itself by doing the exact opposite.
Best known for its sustainably-made, modular, and repairable (DIY style) smartphones, the startup is now applying the same ethos to another product segment: headphones.
The newly-launched Fairbuds XL are a pair of over-ear wireless headphones, priced at €249. Much like the company’s smartphones, they’re sold mainly in Europe, although some authorised resellers ship to other parts of the world as well.
The Fairbuds XL come with a 30 hour battery life, 40mm dynamic drivers for sound quality, and active noise cancellation. They also feature a USB-C connector for charging, a 10m Bluetooth range, and smart assistants capabilities.
But their most impressive element is undoubtedly the design. The modular headphones consist of nine components/potential spare parts: battery, speaker to speaker cable, earcap covers, headband, ear cushion, headband base, speakers, and headband cover.
The components of the Fairbuds XL. Credit: Fairphone
Customers can order any of them on the company’s website or the Fairbuds app, and easily replace or repair parts that are broken or worn over time. The headphones come with a two-year warranty, which means that within this period the components’ cost will be most likely covered by the startup.
To further boost their positive environmental and societal impact, the Fairbuds XL are made with 100% recycled plastics, aluminium, and tin solder paste to the maximum extent possible, while the startup claims it’ll pay $0.55 per headphone to fill the living wage gap of the production line workers.
Fairphone’s overall ethos aligns with the EU’s goal to drastically reduce e-waste and move towards a circular economy by 2050. Upcoming policies such the Right to Repair and the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products could give a significant regional boost to the startup’s approach.

Browning bananas under threat as Philippines approves gene-edited version,Thomas Macaulay,2023/05/12,"
Overripe bananas could soon become a mere memory — in the Philippines, at least.
Tropic Biosciences, a startup in the UK, has tapped gene editing to banish the browning fruit — and mitigate the havoc that it’s wreaking.
Currently, over 60% of exported bananas go to waste before reaching consumers. According to Tropic, the non-browning version could cut food waste and CO2 emissions in supply chains by over 25%.  In terms of CO2 reduction, the impact is comparable to taking 2m passenger vehicles off the road every year.
For the Philippines, there’s a more urgent appeal. The country is the top producer and exporter of bananas in Southeast Asia, but it’s being ravaged by a devastating plant disease. Known as Panama TR4, the disease threatens 80% of global banana production — and there’s no cure.
Tropic may have a solution: gene-editing bananas to make them disease-resistant. Unsurprisingly, the Philippine government has welcomed the prospect.
In a press release issued last month, Tropic announced that Filipino officials have given the green light to the non-browning bananas. Under the country’s newly-defined gene-editing rules, the product can now be freely imported and propagated.
“The Philippines government has implemented a science-based, transparent, and efficient process for assessing the safety of gene-edited plants,” said Dr Ofir Meir, Tropic’s Chief Technology Officer.
“This is exactly the type of system that encourages companies like Tropic to invest in innovative technologies to develop sustainable solutions for Filipino farmers.”
Meir previously served as R&D director of the crop protection division of Evogene, a computational biology company based in Israel.
For Tropic, bananas are just the start. Using gene-editing tools including CRISPR and the proprietary GEiGS system, the company can change the DNA of multiple organisms. As well as delaying ripening in bananas, the startup has already reduced caffeine in coffee and increased the yield in rice.
The benefits could be vast. Tropic promises higher output, expanded shelf-life, improved disease resistance, reduced waste, and lowered CO2 emissions. The company says it can also cut costs for growers.
Investors have clearly recognised the potential. Last year, Tropic raised $35 million in a fresh funding round. The cash injection followed a $28.5 million Series B raise in June 2020.
Naturally, that splurge isn’t solely motivated by altruism. Blue Horizon, which led last year’s round, estimates that the total market for Tropic’s produce is worth over $400 billion.

Wingcopter bags €40M from EU to scale ‘new era for drone delivery’,Linnea Ahlgren,2023/05/11,"
German drone solution startup Wingcopter announced today it had landed €40 million in funding from the European Investment Bank (EIB) to scale up services and ramp up production of its latest model. 
According to its developers, the Wingcopter 198 introduces a “new era for drone delivery.” Additions to the latest version of Wingcopter’s aircraft, “the world’s first triple-drop delivery drone,” include delivery of up to three packages to multiple locations during one flight. 
What’s more, a single operator can fly up to 10 units simultaneously and beyond visual line of sight. The model also features an AI-based visual detect-and-avoid solution and smart precision landing capabilities. 
The Wingcopter 198 has a wingspan of, you guessed it, 198 cm, and stretches 152 cm from front to tail. It can carry up to 6 kg and when carrying a 5 kg payload, it has a range of 75 km. Without any cargo, it can fly for up to 110 km.
The drone’s default cruise speed is 100 km/h, but it has a maximum speed of 144 km/h. Additionally, its developers say it can withstand strong winds due to a patented tilt-rotor technology – 15 m/s average, 20 m/s gusts. 
Creating jobs at home and abroad
The €40 million investment is backed by the European Commission’s InvestEU programme under its sustainable infrastructure window, and the funds are provided as a quasi-equity investment, meaning that it ranks between equity and debt.
Of course, EIB, the lending arm of the European Union, does not splurge on projects simply because it features some cool tech. It also looks for broader social and environmental benefits when deciding whether or not to fund a project. 
“Our goal is also to improve lives by creating many jobs — in R&D and manufacturing at our headquarters in Europe, as well as in the countries where we provide services, where we train and qualify local young people to operate our drone delivery networks,” said co-founder and CEO Tom Plümmer.

Furthermore, replacing carbon-intensive modes of light cargo transport with electric drones will reduce emissions and help further the bloc’s climate agenda. 
“Backing European cleantech pioneers with global reach like Wingcopter is central to our mission,” said EIB Vice-President Ambroise Fayolle. “Electric cargo drones are an important vertical segment for a future of sustainable transport and logistics.”
Bringing it home
Wingcopter expects to operate its flagship model for the first time in Germany this summer. It will launch in a pilot project that will test the potential of on-demand transport of groceries and consumer goods. 
The project, in turn funded by the German Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport and conducted together with the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences, is intended to improve local supply in rural German communities through a sustainable delivery service
Wingcopter was founded in 2017, by Tom Plümmer, Jonathan Hesselbarth and Ansgar Kadura. To date, the advanced air mobility startup has raised over €100 million over nine funding rounds. Investors include European retailer REWE Group, ITOCHU, Xplorer Capital and Uber co-founder Garrett Camp’s investment arm Expa.
The Darmstadt-based developer is both a manufacturer of aviation-grade drone technology and a service provider for a wide range of drone operations. It has already deployed its unmanned aircraft, such as the Wingcopter 178, to deliver goods across small-scale commercial and humanitarian missions, as well as carry out geological surveys and infrastructure inspection in difficult to reach terrain. 
One of the major advantages of drones in cargo operations in hard-to-reach and rural environments is that they require no additional infrastructure for take off and landing. Last summer, the company raised close to €40 million to deploy some of its drones in Sub-Saharan Africa. 
Wingcopter has also participated in a joint project between UNICEF and the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) in Malawi, delivering life-saving medicines and medical supplies.

Quantum computing is fiendishly complicated to commercialise. Despite claims that it will save the planet and cure cancer, real-world applications are yet to emerge from the hype.
For startups, this offers both promise and peril. Ominously, any practical use cases may not emerge for years — if at all. But when they do emerge, the potential applications and revenues are unimaginable — and untapped.
With untold riches beckoning, budding leaders in the sector are prepared to play the long game.
“With quantum computing, there’s not a real-world advantage today,” Joe Fitzsimons, CEO and founder of Horizon Quantum Computing tells TNW. 
“It’s a milestone that’s coming — and hopefully, quite soon — but we still haven’t reached that point. For everyone in the space, it’s still about pushing technological progress as much as possible.”
Fitzsimons has been pushing this progress for his entire career. After baby steps into the quantum realm at Oxford University, Fitzsimons moved to Singapore for a stint in quantum research, before pivoting from academia to industry.

In 2018, Fitzsimons founded Horizon. The startup is currently developing a system that automatically constructs quantum algorithms from classical code.
In November, the company announced a major step in its mission to become a quantum computer powerhouse: its first  European hub — and first office outside Singapore — will soon open in Dublin. 
The expansion aims to tap the impressive talent and prospective customer base in Europe, one of the world’s top markets for quantum computing.
Going global
Fitzsimons had numerous reasons for picking Europe — and Dublin — as the first stop on Horizon’s global expansion. They include a propitious tech ecosystem, the ease of doing business, and supportive legal structures. But perhaps the biggest pull is the potential to plug the quantum talent gap.
It’s a major constraint on the sector. According to research by McKinsey, there’s only one qualified quantum candidate available for every three quantum job openings. By 2025, the consulting firm predicts that less than 50% of quantum computing jobs may be filled.
Ireland offers a unique solution to this problem. An enticing tax regime has attracted many of Silicon Valley’s biggest names to make the emerald isle their European home. Adding their influx to a young population that’s among the world’s most-educated and a pioneering quantum programme at Trinity College Dublin has produced a deep pool of engineering talent.


“You can hire from both the UK and the EU.


Since Brexit, Dublin’s pipeline has only become more alluring. Ireland is now the biggest English-speaking country in the EU — and retains an incomparable connection to the UK.
“You have the advantage of being able to hire both from the UK and from the EU, visa-free,” says Fitzsimons. “And that’s really a big advantage, because quantum computing talent is spread out globally.”
In Europe, that talent has spread across a flourishing array of quantum computing leaders. They encompass quantum internet experiments at TU Delft in the Netherlands; ion-trapping at Austria’s AQT; control systems at Zurich Instruments; quantum algorithms at the UK’s Phasecraft; dilution refrigerators at BlueFors in Helsinki; and quantum processing units at Finland’s IQM Quantum Computers. 
It’s a formidable range of pioneers, but they still have immense barriers to hurdle.
Europe’s quantum disadvantage
 Across the globe, quantum computing startups face a range of challenges, from crippling computation errors to eye-watering costs. In Europe, some further obstacles have been thrown into the path to profitability.
One of the problems is ubiquitous across tech articles: access to late-stage capital. While Europe is renowned for scientific research, it lacks the growth funding to develop global tech leaders.
In quantum computing, the fundraising problem has an extra dimension: investors need to be unusually patient. In time, their rewards could be incredible. Analysts expect the quantum advantage to extend across all aspects of society — but it won’t get there overnight.
“It takes a lot of work, so you need patient capital,” says Fitzsimons.
Fitzimons recently raised over $18m to expand Horizon’s engineering team and accelerate product development.
Regrettably, funding isn’t Europe’s only shortcoming. A recent report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) highlighted three further issues: national siloes, a dearth of tech titans to consolidate the sector, and struggles turning academic talent into quantum professionals.
To mitigate these issues, BCG advises the EU to foster a private sector that can scale, create business-oriented quantum talent, and interconnect all of the bloc’s quantum computing efforts.
It’s a daunting entreaty to EU leaders. In the infamously weird world of quantum computing, the impacts of investments are hard to predict. Nonetheless, Fitzsimons is confident that they’ll pay off.
“Essentially, you’re talking about what could be computing all over again — and the upside of that is tremendous.”

Sweden to pave world’s first permanent e-road for EV charging while driving,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/05/10,"

As countries across Europe scale up efforts towards fossil fuel-free mobility, Sweden is working on the world’s first permanent electric road — allowing electric cars and trucks to charge while driving.
The project is led by the Swedish Transport Administration, Trafikverket, which has selected the E20 highway. Specifically, it will build the electric road system (ERS) on the 21km route from Hallsberg to Örebro, located between the country’s two largest cities, Stockholm and Gothenburg.
The e-road is now at the procurement and final planning stage, while Trafikverket expects to complete and introduce it to the public in 2025/2026.
How will it work?
Trafikverket has yet to determine which technology it will use for the ERS. Currently, there are three types available: overhead conductive, ground-based conductive, and ground-based inductive charging.
In the first type of charging, power is transferred from overhead wires to a vehicle through a pantograph — much like how trams operate. This technology, however, is only suitable for heavy-duty vehicles that are high enough to reach the electric lines.
The other two ground-based options work in a similar way. In conductive charging, power is transferred from special rails or tracks placed below or on the road. The vehicles charge with the help of a mechanical arm or stick that touches the rails. In the inductive system, the power transfer takes place between coils embedded in the road and the vehicles.
Sweden’s bet on electric roads
The ambitious electrification of E20 follows a series of successful ERS pilot projects in the country. From 2016 to date, Trafikverket has tested all three road charging technologies in various parts of the country, including Lund, Gotland, and Sandviken.
Most of the focus has been on trucks and buses and for a good reason. Electrifying the road network that connects the country’s biggest cities would reduce emissions of heavy duty vehicles by 1.2m tonnes in 2030, research estimates.
But, in 2018, Sweden began testing road charging for both commercial and passenger EVs as well on a 2km route between Stockholm’s Arlanda airport and a logistics area in Rosenberg.
The government’s plan is to deploy 2,000km of ERS on public roads by 2030 — the same year it has proposed to ban new fossil fuel-powered cars. But whether betting on e-roads constitutes a fruitful strategy remains a controversial topic.
On the one hand, electric road systems will enable longer distances to be traveled between charging station visits, increasing the adoption rate of EVs and, in turn, reducing carbon emissions.
A recent study by the Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg has further found that e-roads would also lower the demand on the grid during peak times, working as an alternative to home charging. The team also suggested that combining home (static) and on-the-go (dynamic) charging can reduce the battery size by up to 70%.
“This would reduce the need for raw materials for batteries, and an electric car could also become cheaper for the consumer,” said Sten Karlsson, co-author of the study.
There is, however, an important counterargument: the lofty investment and maintenance costs for a nascent type of infrastructure that, in the long run, may prove obsolete as battery development accelerates.
But according to the study’s findings, the risk doesn’t seem that high. The team estimates that only 25% of the national and European roads would need to be electrified for the system to work.
Sweden is not alone in developing e-roads, with Italy, France, Germany, and the UK testing the technology as well. In fact, Europe’s interconnectivity might indeed give a winning chance to an electric road network.

Not ready for a 4-day work week? The nine-day fortnight could be for you,Suzie Coen,2023/05/9,"
You’ve heard of the four day week. Now, meet its slightly less fun but still a good time younger brother: the nine-day fortnight. It’s taking workplaces by storm, with leaders lauding this new model as a happy medium between burnout and excessive time off.
Its growing popularity is not surprising. The need for a dynamic approach to the changing landscape of the workplace isn’t just advisable, it’s a necessity.
According to an Economist report, 59% of people say they would consider taking a job with a company that offers better well-being benefits than their current employer. But, if the last few years have taught us anything, it’s that there isn’t a blueprint for flexible working policies.
Companies have experimented and continue to experiment with the models that seem best suited to their individual organisations — from the new nine day fortnight to complete location flexibility; a remote-first policy to offering employees flexibility around when they work.
What is a nine-day fortnight?
The nine-day fortnight working pattern effectively means that across 14 calendar days, nine of them are working days and five are days off.
Every other week, employees get an extra day off, often a Friday. Some companies ask employees to work longer hours on the days they’re working to allow for the extra day off, or to take a small pay cut—typically around 10%. Others say this isn’t important to them as long as their output remains consistent.
What are the benefits?
The idea is that it isn’t only a sweet deal for workers, but for employers too. Many of the benefits are similar to those of the four-day week, according to those who have tested it.
Studies have shown that reduced working hours can actually lead to higher productivity, meaning increased company profits, and improved well being among workers.
It could also help to reduce carbon emissions, improve gender equality in the workplace, help tackle unemployment and lead to a better work-life balance.
Where has it gotten substantial buzz?
Worldwide trials of flexible working models have been in operation post-Covid with mostly positive results. In Australia for instance, many workers moved to the nine-day format and took 10% pay cuts in the recession,
The model is also very common in the UK’s public sector bodies. At London Councils, a 9-day fortnight is based on a compressed working week, and allows staff to work nine working days instead of ten over a two week period—as long as the total number of hours worked meets contractual working hours.
And Public Practice, a company delivering services to support the public sector, has just concluded a six-month 9-day fortnight study where it trialled a number of approaches. These included a 10% reduction of working hours, benefits adjustments and flexibility. Once the body conducts an analysis on the impact of the trial, it will take a decision on whether it will be implemented formally.
Why should companies consider a 9-day fortnight?
Bottom line, it’s going to be hard to attract talent if you’re not offering some flexibility. Even for companies that haven’t considered four-day weeks, nine-day fortnights might work best in the long term anyway.
For some workers, four day weeks can feel quite intense. Alternating four and five-day weeks creates a better balance. With a nine-day fortnight, employees are able to switch between working styles and can adapt to how they work based on how many days their working week has, as well as enjoying quality of life improvements.
Businesses should think creatively about what type of adjusted work week works for them. Too often the options are presented as binary (a five-day or a four-day week), but there are lots of potential routes in between.
If you’re striving for a proper work-life balance this year, it’s time to explore new ambitious career paths that also offer more attractive flexible working opportunities.
Employers offering flexibility
If flexibility is key for you, or indeed new to you, it’s worth checking out roles at progressive companies like Improbable on The House of Talent Job Board.
Flexibility is deeply rooted in this British metaverse technology company’s values and culture and the majority of its workforce is hybrid. Right now it has exciting open positions on offer such as Senior Backend Engineer and a Senior Producer, both of which are entirely remote.
If you’re looking to work for a company that’s particularly focused on a hybrid work model, look no further than the European ecommerce platform Zalando with current openings in Berlin for a Senior MicroStrategy Developer and a Project & Talent Development Manager in Ansbach.
Zalando’s hybrid working model is 60% remote per week, as well as a commitment to flexible working hours. The cherry on the cake here is the opportunity to work from abroad for 30 (working) days per calendar year.
Other leading firms like the German engineer company Bertrandt AG are similarly dedicated to promoting a great work-life balance model. Open roles for Squad Lead Software Development in both Ehningen and in Hamburg come with options for mobile and flexible working hours as a standard, plus an attractive assurance of a high degree of freedom in team construction and leadership.

EU set to embrace open access research and rein in scientific publishings ‘racket’,Thomas Macaulay,2023/05/9,"
The EU is set to rein in the “racket” of scientific publishing by backing open access to publicly-funded research papers.
The proposals, first reported by Research Professional News, emerged in a new document from the Council of the EU.
In draft conclusions due to be adopted later this month, the council called for open access to be the default in scholarly publishing. It also wants to end the controversial practice of charging fees to authors.
“Immediate and unrestricted open access should be the norm in publishing research involving public funds, with transparent pricing commensurate with the publication services and where costs are not covered by individual authors or readers,” reads the text.
The position has been agreed “at technical level,” according to the document. They will now be submitted for approval by research ministers at a 23 May 2023 meeting.


“Publicly funded research should be publicly available for free.


The EU’s move could have sweeping implications for a divisive industry. Academic publishers can charge thousands of euros to access single articles — despite the papers being based on taxpayer-funded research. Furthermore, the study author often has to pay the publisher to issue the paper.
The EU’s proposals could upend this staggeringly profitable business model. Unsurprisingly, tech entrepreneurs that harness research have welcomed the move.
“I don’t know why it took so long to rein in the scientific publishings racket, but it looks like the EU is finally making it happen,” tweeted Mikko Alasaarela, a serial startup founder based in Helsinki. “Publicly funded research should be publicly available for free. It is finally becoming a reality!”

Spanish island builds ‘giant water battery’ to boost energy security,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/05/8,"
Gran Canaria is perhaps best known for its sandy beaches, eternal sunshine, and volcanic past. But isolated far from the European mainland, the island relies heavily on imported fossil fuels to power its growing economy — 76% of its electricity comes from burning oil. 
In an effort to decarbonise, the government has been investing heavily in renewable energies to harness the island’s abundant wind and solar resources. In 2022, renewables made up 24% of the island’s energy mix, up from just 12% in 2018. But as more renewables come online, the island faces another problem: storage.   
Last year, the government invested €400m in the Canary Islands’ first-ever energy storage scheme, to stabilise the grid when the wind isn’t blowing or the sun isn’t shining. This project won’t build battery packs, however, but convert two existing dams into one giant water battery.
Salto de Chira, as the ‘pumped hydro’ project is known, will pump water from the Soria dam into the Chira dam — which sits at a higher elevation — during periods of low energy demand. During periods of high energy demand, water will be released from Chira, down a tunnel, over a set of turbines, and back into Soria. And the cycle continues.

Pumped hydro is often referred to as a ‘giant water battery’ because it can store and release power on demand. According to the International Energy Agency, it is still the most widely deployed storage technology today, accounting for over 90% of global energy storage capacity. 
When it comes online in 2027, the Salto de Chira project is expected to generate up to 200MW of power at times of high demand, equivalent to more than a third of the island’s needs. Last week, Spain’s grid operator Red Eléctrica selected GE Energy to supply the turbines for the plant, in another step forward for the scheme. 
According to Red Eléctrica,  the project will increase the island’s share of renewables from 24% to 51% and save €122m a year in imported fossil fuel. It is also expected to create more than 4,300 jobs, of which around 3,500 will be on Gran Canaria itself.  
President of the Canary Islands, Ángel Víctor Torres, called the project a “great boost” to the archipelago’s ambitions of fully decarbonising its economy by 2040, ten years ahead of the targets set by the EU. 
“Energy storage is going to be one of the key elements in the energy transition, both for its contribution to electrification and for its capacity to enable enhanced management of renewable energy, which is especially important in non-interconnected systems such as the islands,” he said.  
The Soria dam is the only arch dam built on the Canary Archipelago, and standing at a lofty 132 metres is among the highest dams in Spain.
The Canary Islands has ramped up its decarbonisation efforts significantly in the last five years. The archipelago’s largest renewable energy complex, comprising eight wind farms and 12 solar plants, was inaugurated in 2022 and provides enough energy for around 54,000 households. 
Spain’s government and the European Union also recently announced plans to provide €20m in funding to support the development of 65 new solar projects across the Canary Islands by the end of next year. The archipelago is also exploring alternatives such as wave energy, with the first such pilot project launched in February,led by Danish startup Wavepiston.
Key to the success of all these projects, says one study, will be the deployment of sufficient energy storage solutions to stabilise the grid during peak demand, and the construction of sea cables to connect the islands. Pumped hydro seems to be taking care of the former, while the latter is gaining momentum with the first of many power links now under construction to connect Tenerife and La Gomera. The links are expected to decrease the cost of electricity for taxpayers and improve energy security in the archipelago.  
As European countries decarbonise their energy systems, adopting energy storage solutions to balance the intermittent supply of renewable energy and increase energy security is becoming increasingly urgent. According to the European Association for Storage of Energy (EASE), the EU will need 200GW of energy storage by the end of the decade and 600GW by 2050.

A new industry coalition launched last week aims to promote sustainable energy storage technologies like batteries, hydrogen, and pumped hydro in order to reach these targets. 
“Energy storage is key to building a future-proof, resilient, and decarbonised energy system,” said EU energy chief Kadri Simson at the launch. 
Pumped hydro projects can be controversial, however, particularly when they involve dams on rivers that flood land to create new reservoirs and affect ecosystems. But as highlighted in an article published in The Conversation last year, most pumped hydro projects do not require the building of new dams, but the retrofitting of existing ones, as is the case with the Gran Canaria project.  
Either way, the IEA’s landmark 2021 Net Zero by 2050 report estimates that an additional 1300GW of hydropower is required if we are to meet the climate targets outlined in the Paris Agreement. This is double the current global capacity.

When will AGI arrive? Here’s what our tech lords predict,Thomas Macaulay,2023/05/5,"
Every tech baron worth their Patagonia vest is talking about AGI these days — albeit with mixed feelings. Some await our robot overlords with rapturous excitement; others anticipate a digital apocalypse.
The divergence stems from varied motivations: personal perspectives, vested interests, and the ambiguity of what exactly constitutes artificial general intelligence.
DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis defines it as “human-level cognition” — and his opinion carries weight. Hassabis has made the London-based DeepMind one of the world’s leading AI labs, with building AGI as its core mission.


“The progress has been pretty incredible.


This week, the former chess prodigy and video game pioneer revealed his own expectations on AGI’s arrival.
“The progress in the last few years has been pretty incredible,” Hassabis said on Tuesday at the Wall Street Journal’s Future of Everything Festival. “I don’t see any reason why that progress is going to slow down. I think it may even accelerate. So I think we could be just a few years, maybe within a decade away.”
He’s left some wiggle room, yet clearly doesn’t consider AGI a distant prospect. But what about his fellow tech luminaries? Here’s what they predict.
Geoffrey Hinton — Turing Award-winner and ex-Googler
Geoffrey Hinton is so concerned about AI that he quit Google to warn about the field’s risks. In the wake of his departure, Hinton made a fresh prediction on when AI will surpass human intelligence. Ominously, the deep learning legend dramatically accelerated his original forecast of 30-50 years.
“I now predict five to 20 years but without much confidence,” he said on Twitter. “We live in very uncertain times. It’s possible that I am totally wrong about digital intelligence overtaking us. Nobody really knows which is why we should worry now.”

Ray Kurzweil — author, inventor, executive, and futurist
Ray Kurzweil, a fabled futurist, loves making predictions — and they’re admirably precise. At the 2017 SXSW Conference in Austin, Texas, Kurzweil gave a typically pinpoint prediction.
“By 2029, computers will have human-level intelligence,” he said. “That leads to computers having human intelligence, our putting them inside our brains, connecting them to the cloud, expanding who we are. Today, that’s not just a future scenario. It’s here, in part, and it’s going to accelerate.”
Ben Goertzel — CEO at SingularityNET and chief scientist at Hanson Robotics
A divisive figure in tech circles, Ben Goertzel helped popularise the term AGI. He’s also prone to bold pronouncements about technology’s future. At a conference in 2018, he added a couple more.
“I don’t think we need fundamentally new algorithms,” he said. “I think we do need to connect our algorithms in different ways than we do now. If I’m right, then we already have the core algorithms that we need… I believe we are less than ten years from creating human-level AI.
Before you flee to the bomb shelter, it’s worth noting that Goertzel isn’t the most sincere forecaster. “It will occur on December 8, 2026, which will be my 60th birthday,” he added. “I will delay it until then just to have a great birthday party.”

Jürgen Schmidhuber — co-founder of NNAISENSE and Director of IDSIA
Often described as the “father of AI,” Jürgen Schmidhuber is notorious for making outlandish claims. 
When it comes to tech predictions, Schmidhuber is looking beyond AGI and towards “the singularity.” Broadly, this refers to a time when AI becomes so uncontrollably advanced that it irreversibly changes humanity. What could possibly go wrong?
“[The Singularity] is just 30 years away, if the trend doesn’t break, and there will be rather cheap computational devices that have as many connections as your brain but are much faster,” he told Futurism in 2018.
Yoshua Bengio — professor of computer science at the University of Montreal
Like his friend and fellow Turing Award-winner Yann LeCunn, Bengio prefers the term “human-level intelligence” to “AGI.” Regardless, he’s sceptical about predictions for its advent.
“I don’t think it’s plausible that we could really know when, how many years, how many decades, it will take to reach human-level AI,” Bengio told Professor Toshie Takahashi.
Herbert A. Simon — AI pioneer
A founding father of AI, Herbert A. Simon has the earliest forecast on our list. The Nobel Prize-winner once went so far as to estimate that AGI would arrive by 1985. In fairness, he did make that guess back in 1965. “Machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do,” Simon said. 
Simon’s guess shows what a fickle game tech predictions can be. If you think you could do better, let us know via the usual channels — but do it soon, because the clock is ticking down quickly. Possibly.

From Michelangelo to robots: This startup is carving a new era of sculpture,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/05/5,"
Carrara, the Italian city famous for some of the world’s finest marbles, has given birth to the masterpieces of Renaissance masters, such as Michelangelo and Antonio Canova. Now, right in the heart of the city’s quarry district, a startup aims to carve a new era of sculpture in which robots pick up — or rather become — the chisel.
Founded by Filippo Tincolini and Giacomo Massari, Robotor’s mission is to revolutionise the industry by simplifying the sculpting process with the use of robotics and artificial intelligence. The aim is to make sculpture faster, easier, and more sustainable, while enabling artists to create works that would otherwise be inconceivable.

Drawing from research and the interaction between art, the local area, tradition, and technology, the startup has developed a robot chisel, driven by self-programming software.
It all started in 2004, when Tincolini founded Torart, a company specialising in merging sculpture, contemporary art, and design with the application of new technologies. Torart developed the first robot two years later, and in 2010 Giacomo Massari joined the team as well.
Following increasing orders, collaborations with world-renowned artists such as Barry X Ball, and the creation of the Arch of Palmyra replica — after the original was destroyed by ISIS in 2015 — the duo founded Robotor in 2019. The size and funding of the company remain undisclosed.
“Our robots are born from sculptors for sculpture,” co-founder Giacomo Massari tells TNW. “They are born from those who perfectly know traditional sculpture in a territory, Carrara, which is the homeland of sculpture.”

The idea behind their development is “to entrust a robot with tiring work,” Massari adds. “But the entire Robotor project is born from a precise philosophy that is the ‘daughter’ of 18 years of experience in stone processing.”
Putting the robot sculptors to work
The robotic system consists of a mechanical arm that uses electro-spindles of various sizes and capacities, and features an automatic tool change function.
The arm is mounted on a multifunctional, modular base, which contains the necessary electrical and hydraulic components. It’s also accompanied by a seventh-axis rotary table, where the marble and future sculptures stand. The table rotates in full interpolation with the robot’s movements, making the most of its flexibility, and can support a workload of up to 50 tonnes.

At the heart of Robotor’s system is the company’s proprietary software, called OR-OS — designed either for programming by expert operators, or for fully automated self-programming.
The software takes a 3D model and automatically generates an optimised workflow and tool paths without requiring human intervention. It then simulates the process internally to identify any potential issues before sending the instructions to the robotic chisel.
Based on the selected work path, the OR-OS software prompts the robot to choose which types of products and tools it will use for the different stages of the production process: from sculpting, to polishing and cleaning.

The robot then analyses the stone or material it’s going to work on, and reviews its shape and properties, to identify where and how it can be carved, before moving to production.
Besides the robot’s ability to work fully autonomously, users can also opt for programming it and choose the work path it’s going to follow. They’re also able to control various machine functions in real time, including speed adjustment, and monitor the status of the robot and its components, conveniently receiving alerts in case any anomalies occur.
From the human to the robotic hand: speed, accuracy, and innovation
Robotor’s mechanical sculptors come with an array of intriguing advantages.
First off, the robots are designed to eliminate all the tiring phases of the production process, work in extreme environments that would otherwise be endangering humans, and avoid any human error.
“The use of appropriate tools combined with the optimisation of work paths allow for machine use without interruptions 24/7, responding to the need for precise control of work times and costs,” Massari says. This, according to the co-founder, translates into a significant reduction of execution times and expenses.
While cost savings are difficult to quantify, Massari notes that a work of art can, on average, be created by the robots in one-tenth the time that traditional techniques require — excluding manual finishing.
Despite this fast pace, Robotor’s sculptors boast an impressive level of accuracy.
To demonstrate this, Massari mentions the reproduction of The Muse Terpsichore, a famous sculpture completed by Canova in 1811, which was featured in the exhibition “A tempo di danza” at Vetulonia’s Archaeological Civic Museum. The museum opted to display the replica without any hand finishing to avoid confusion between the copy and the original.

Most notably, Massari believes that the robotic chisels can push the boundaries of sculpture, by allowing artists to create works that would have been “inconceivable” before the robots’ facilitation.
“Artists who collaborate with us, such as Quayola and Barry X Ball, present themselves to the public with never-before-seen sculptures designed to be realised with the support of a robotic system, and exploiting its peculiarities,” he says.
“Every work of art is primarily determined by the materials available to the artist and their ability to manipulate them.”
The robots’ diamond-tipped tools that extract material without breaking or splitting it, open new possibilities for material use as well, including conglomerates of stones and earth that can not be processed with traditional methods.
This, according to Massari, is also linked to sustainability, which is accentuated by the software’s 3D model simulation and work path optimisation. That way, the marble block can be excavated with precise knowledge of the final artwork’s dimensions, without any waste.
While suitable for any stone product, Massari says, the robots are mainly targeting three market groups: traditional sculpture workshops aiming to introduce robotics into their production line, artists who wish to manage all creation phases themselves, and designers who produce their own pieces directly. And thanks to their self-programming software, Robotor’s machines are accessible to everyone.
Apart from facilitating the creation of novel artworks, Robotor gains its main satisfaction from the preservation and communication of cultural heritage through the reproduction of great works of the past.
Such an example is the Arch of Palmyra, which was reproduced on a 1:3 scale, based on photographs taken during a documentation campaign of the archaeological site.

The replica was created in five weeks using 20 tonnes of Egyptian marble, technologically ‘reviving’ the 2,000-year-old monument destroyed by ISIS. In 2016, it was displayed in Trafalgar Square in London, and the City Hall Park in New York.
Another example is Amore e Psyche, one of Canova’s most famous sculptures, completed in 1793 after five years of work, and exhibited at the Louvre Museum.

In 2020, Robotor’s replica was manufactured in just over 10 days, and was featured in the exhibition “Eterna belezza” in Rome, along with 170 other artworks from museums around the world.

In 2022, the startup made a total of some 400 sculptures. Massari didn’t disclose the price of the machines or the cost for commissioning a sculpture.
Human vs robot: who is the real creator?
Robotor’s mechanical sculptors are fast, accurate, and efficient, and can even rival the works of Renaissance masters. This bids the question: is there enough space for human agency?
Massari’s answer is succinct: the robot will never replace the artist. “It is not a creative, but a mere executor,” he emphasises.
For the co-founder, the robotic chisels are essentially replacing the laborious and time-consuming work that artists would normally entrust to specialised laboratories to execute their vision.
“It is rare to see the artists themselves executing all the phases,” explains Massari, noting that they may intervene in the finishing phase directly, or by giving precise instructions.
“This was how Michelangelo operated, and it is how artists operate today,” he adds.
In fact, he explains that the creative process hasn’t changed at all. Sculptors have used clay or plaster sketches for centuries before moving on to marble work. Today there is one more step: a 3D model that’s created from the sketch, which is essential for the software that controls the robot.
And by replacing the traditional strenuous and time-consuming production process, Robotor aims to actually expand the creative possibilities of artists.

“The history of art is a continuous history of innovations,” says Massari. “Artists have always relied on technological knowledge and ingenuity to find the materials and tools they need to express their dreams, thoughts, visions, or beliefs. And innovation has always had an impact on the way art is made.”
The startup’s ultimate goal is to usher in a new era of sculpture, in which human artists’ expression is supported and expanded through the use of robotics and AI. As the co-founders put it, “this era no longer consists of broken stones, chisels, and dust, but of scanning, point clouds, and design.”

"AI that decodes what mice see can enhance future BCIs, say researchers",Thomas Macaulay,2023/05/4,"
An AI tool that decodes what mice see could enhance future brain-computer interfaces, according to a new study.
Named CEBRA, the system was developed by researchers at EPFL, a university in Switzerland. Their aim? To uncover hidden relationships between the brain and behaviour.
To test CEBRA (pronounced “zebra”), the team tried to decode what a mouse sees when it watches a video.


“Given the brain is the most complex structure in our universe, it’s the ultimate test for CEBRA.


First, the researchers collected open-access neural data on rodents watching movies. Some of the brain activity had been measured with electrode probes in a mouse’s visual cortex. The remainder came via optical probes of genetically modified mice, which were engineered so their neurons glowed green when activated.
All this data was used to train the base algorithm in CEBRA. As a result, the system learned to map brain activity to specific frames in a video.
Next, the team applied the tool to another mouse that had watched the video. After analysing the data,  CEBRA could accurately predict what the mouse had seen from the brain signals alone.
The team then reconstructed the clip from the neural activity. You can see the results for yourself in the video below:

Unsurprisingly, the researchers aren’t solely interested in the movie-viewing habits of rodents.
“The goal of CEBRA is to uncover structure in complex systems. And, given the brain is the most complex structure in our universe, it’s the ultimate test space for CEBRA,” said EFPL’s Mackenzie Mathis, the study’s principal investigator.
“It can also give us insight into how the brain processes information and could be a platform for discovering new principles in neuroscience by combining data across animals, and even species.”
Nor is CERA limited to neuroscience research. According to Mathis, it can also be applied to numerous datasets involving time or joint information, including animal behaviour and gene-expression data. But perhaps the most exciting application is in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).
As the movie-loving mice showed, even the primary visual cortex — often considered to underlie only fairly basic visual processing — can be used to decode videos in a BCI style. For the researchers, an obvious next step is using CEBRA to enhance neural decoding in BCIs.
“This work is just one step towards the theoretically-backed algorithms that are needed in neurotechnology to enable high-performance BMIs,” said Mathis.

We’re closer than ever before to creating a real lightsaber,Robert Jones,2023/05/4,"
Ever dreamed of being a Jedi? Armed with an elegant weapon for a more civilised age, many of us have fantasised about cutting a bright green (or blue) swathe across a galaxy far, far away. Disney even released a patent in 2018 for one such device, although ‘Sword device with retractable, internally illuminated blade,’ doesn’t quite evoke images of cutting through blast doors or droid armour.
That begs the question on this Star Wars Day: is it actually possible to build a lightsaber, and if so, how far away from holding it in our hands and whistling ‘Duel of Fates’ are we? The answer might surprise you —but first, we’ll have to set out exactly what we mean when we say lightsaber and learn some science on the way.
So what would you need to make a lightsaber as we know it?
There are six fundamental boxes a lightsaber must tick: it must light up and glow when in use, it must be able to cut through an object, it must be retractable, it must make a trademark whooshing noise, you must be able to cross them in a fight, and most importantly, it must obey the rule of cool. The bad news is that not all of these are possible at once — yet — but the good news is that all of them are already possible individually — at least, in theory.
Whilst we don’t have access to Kyber Crystals in our galaxy, the laws of physics make more than a fine substitute. The first problem to tackle is the light and cutting edge, and for that, we can utilise the physical principle of laminar flow. This is when all the components in a gas or fluid are moving in the exact same direction without colliding into one another, a little like when you use a shower head. 
This then allows us to use any kind of fluid fuel-oxidiser mix to make a single, high-intensity beam of cutting power. Whilst we may be tempted to use a rocket-grade propellant and fuel, the reality is that something simple like the liquid propane used in BBQs is more than enough. With these ingredients; BBQ fuel, and a laminar flow jet, the task simply becomes one of tuning the fuel mix and valves to get a retractable blade. For the iconic whoosh, it’s a matter of building a circuit with a speaker and accelerometer to make the famed sound of a lightsaber when it’s swung.

The final touch is the famous colouring of the blade. While Wien’s Displacement law states that the temperature of an object is directly related to its colour, this won’t give us the intense colour we usually associate with this aspect of the Star Wars universe. Instead, by introducing small amounts of specific chemical compounds at the end of the hilt, we can influence the colour. By burning strontium metal for example, we can achieve that iconic Sith red or potassium chloride for the Mace Windu purple. The intense glow of the lightsaber will come from the heat of the plasma generated by the fuel-oxidiser mix.
This still leaves us the issue of being able to cross them in a duel, which necessitates a resistance to temperatures high enough to melt a blast door. At present, the material with the highest melting temperature is the Tantalum hafnium carbide alloy (Ta4HfC5), which melts at a whopping 3990 °C. This unfortunately is the approximate temperature of burning liquid propane. When making something retractable, you also introduce small weaknesses in a metal, which makes fractures and failures more likely. Therefore, even when working with ultra-heat-resistant materials, appropriate care is needed to keep the material from failing due to stress.
This means that any plan to build a lightsaber you can duel with needs to involve not only a heat-resistant material, but a robust one as well. 
How close are we to being able to wield the favoured weapon of the Jedi?
There are two main stumbling blocks to us waving around a screen-accurate lightsaber: the fuel and the duel. Assuming that we’re still following the principle of laminar flow mentioned above, we can achieve a steel-melting, glowing beam by finding a fuel with a high density, and a high burning temperature. The former we want so we can keep the fuel in a nice little rechargeable cylinder, like a battery, and the latter so we can melt through the blast doors of any would-be rebels. 
Acetylene or rocket-grade kerosene could be good candidates, with acetylene being used in plasma cutters and kerosene having put men on the moon in the Apollo programme. Yet, these still don’t quite fit the bill. Acetylene isn’t dense enough to be stored in a battery, and you would need a large tank of it to power a lightsaber for any amount of time. Kerosene on the other hand has a relatively low flame temperature, meaning it would struggle to cut through metal.

Then comes the issue of being able to cross the blade, as you need a sturdy material which can simultaneously handle the stresses of high temperature and combat with a mortal enemy. My guess for realising this design would be a central core of a high-melting-point material, like Tantalum hafnium carbide alloy, which can be telescopically extended with the high-temperature flame from the propellant and fuel mixture.
The good news is that modern science is making leaps and bounds in this area. Ongoing research into high-density, energy-rich fuels and stress-resilient materials means that we’re now closer than ever to producing a real-life lightsaber. The only question left to ask is, what colour do you want yours in?

ChatGPT is back in Italy,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/05/1,"
In March, Italy became the first Western country to temporarily ban access to ChatGPT within its borders. Citing concerns over “unlawful” data collection and the lack of an age verification mechanism for minors, the country’s data protection agency — Garante — blocked the service, requiring OpenAI to meet a series of demands for the suspension to be lifted.
As of April 28, Italian users have regained access to the AI system, after OpenAI implemented the majority of the measures ordered by Garante. These address age verification, transparency, and the rights of users and non-users alike.
First off, the US-based company has introduced a “welcome back” pop-up box, which asks users to confirm they’re above 18 years-old, or that they have obtained parental consent if they’re aged between 13 and 18. They also need to specify their birthday on the sign-up page to gain access.
The pop-up box upon entering ChatGPT using an Italian IP address.
In addition, the pop-up’s text contains links to OpenAI’s new privacy policy and a help center article on how ChatGPT is developed and trained. This information notice is easily visible both on the log-in and the sign-up page.
By clicking on the links, users can get information about what kind of data is being processed for training purposes and under what conditions. OpenAI has now clarified that it’ll continue processing certain types of data on a contractual basis to enable the performance of its services, but for algorithm training data processing will be on the legal basis of legitimate interest.
To enable users and non-users to better exercise their rights, as requested by Garante, the company has further included an opt-out form for the processing of personal data. Users can also obtain erasure for inaccurate information, although, for now, OpenAI claims it’s “technically impossible” to provide rectifications.
While the Italian regulator welcomed OpenAI’s new measures, it called on the company to comply with the extra requests it had ordered as well.
Besides the age gate, OpenAI has to introduce an age verification system that prevents minors from using the service. It also needs to conduct a campaign informing Italians that their personal data may have been used for ChatGPT’s training, while raising awareness of the new information policy and attached data rights.
The Italian agency said that it “acknowledges the steps forward made by OpenAI to reconcile technological advancements with respect for the rights of individuals and hopes that the company will continue in its efforts to comply with European data protection legislation.” Nevertheless, it will continue its investigation into the company’s compliance with GDPR.
While Italy’s ChatGPT ban didn’t last for more than a month, it’s the first attempt in the Western world to regulate a generative AI tool like OpenAI’s model. The company’s compliance may set a precedent for other European countries as well — with several other data protection agencies (including France’s, Ireland’s, and Spain’s) paying close attention to the developments.

Getir eyes Flink takeover as Europe’s rapid grocery delivery sector consolidates,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/05/1,"
The COVID-19 pandemic was a veritable gold rush for food delivery startups — as the world shut down, people ordered in. These companies promised rapid delivery of groceries from local stores using bikes and scooters, and as demand skyrocketed, investors poured cash into the booming industry. 
But now, amid soaring inflation and a post-pandemic downturn, the ‘quick commerce’ market is undergoing rapid consolidation with small companies being swallowed up by a few big players.
Founded in 2020 at the height of the pandemic, German-based grocery delivery startup Flink remains one of Europe’s last remaining independent grocery delivery groups. But that could be about to change: Turkish competitor Getir is in talks to acquire the startup, Financial Times reports. 
The talks come just five months since Getir acquired Berlin-based rival Gorillas in a $1.2bn deal that valued the combined group at $10bn, making it Europe’s largest quick commerce company. Getir operates in around 50 cities across seven European countries, including the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, and Portugal.
Parallel to the takeover talks, Flink is looking to raise $100m from existing investors at a valuation of $1bn for the entire company. This is a major departure from mid-2022, when the startup, which is still loss-making, was valued at $5bn. 
Despite turbulent economic times and less demand from consumers, the startup’s core German business aims to become profitable by the end of this year. It also has subsidiaries in France and the Netherlands and hopes its overall business will be in the green by the end of 2024.  
It is yet unclear how much Getir is willing to pay for Flink. There is no guarantee of an agreement being reached, either, said FT, citing people familiar with the matter. However, an eventual takeover could be streamlined by the fact that Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Company holds a stake in both companies.  
The merger would further consolidate Europe’s food delivery market, which has seen a number of major acquisitions in recent years. In addition to Getir’s blockbuster buy-out of Gorillas, it also acquired UK’s Weezy and Spain’s Blok in 2021, while US-based Gopuff bought British startups Dija and Fancy in the same year, and Flink acquired French startup Cajoo in 2022.  
If the takeover is completed, Getir’s only competition in the European market would be GoPuff, which recently downsized and only operates in the UK and France. This would essentially give Getir a monopoly over rapid grocery delivery on the continent. 
While Deliveroo and UberEats also offer grocery delivery, they have a different business model, relying on third-party shops while Getir has its own warehouses or dark stores, which offers a “competitive advantage”, says the company’s CEO. The only other potential competitor is Zapp, but it operates solely in London.  
Despite its apparent success, Getir’s place at the top is anything but secure. The company is not yet profitable in Europe, and in May 2022 it has cut 14% of its global workforce, citing soaring inflation. But there is hope that as competition lessens the remaining big players like Getir will be able to cash in on demand for rapid grocery delivery, which still remains relatively high.

"Transatlantic chip wars? UK needs to up its policy game, leading startup says",Linnea Ahlgren,2023/05/1,"
While the UK is being labelled as “closed for business” and Rishi Sunak is playing Unicorn Kingdom in Silicon Valley, the British chip industry risks losing some of its strongest players due to a lack of supportive policies. 
Based in Cambridge, UK, Pragmatic Semiconductor, funded in part by the CIA’s investment branch In-Q-Tel, has created an ultra-thin, ultra-low-cost, flexible integrated circuit (FlexIC). Instead of relying on silicon, it is made from indium gallium zinc oxide at a fraction of the cost. 
The application of the technology spans a wide range of sectors, including healthcare, pharmaceuticals, packaging and games. In the words of Pragmatics, it offers “digital traceability and interactivity to everyday objects.”
Scott White is the Founder and Executive Director, Strategic Initiatives, of Pragmatic. According to White, the company could end up leaving British shores if the UK government’s semiconductor strategy fails to meet expectations. 
So what would British politicians need to offer to provide adequate support to rival the allure of the US $52.7 billion CHIPS Act? White tells TNW that Pragmatic wants to see the government support innovative new companies through public procurement. 
“By creating home-grown revenue opportunities, and becoming a major customer for new semiconductor technologies addressing key national priorities such as net zero and affordable healthcare, the government can provide the reassurance and certainty that investors need to support startups and scaleups,” White said. 
Following the lead of Arm?
The current lack of ability to effectively raise funding for the business in the UK means that Pragmatic could move its operations overseas. Furthermore, it could potentially list outside of the UK in the future, following in the footsteps of Cambridge-compatriot Arm. Earlier this year, in a significant blow to London, the chip architecture giant and crown jewel in the UK tech industry chose to only list the company in New York.
What would a sufficient strategy look like in more detail? White believes that annual public sector procurement targets, commitments for public institutions to ‘buy British’, and encouraging public bodies, like NHS Trusts, to explore uses of the technology, would provide the required opportunities. 
Furthermore, such a strategy would address both supply and demand, ultimately making “the UK a more attractive place from which innovative semiconductor companies can build and maintain a global base.” 
Funding from the government, the CIA and… China
After a Series C $125 million round (an oversubscription by more than 50%) late in 2022, the CIA’s investment branch In-Q-Tel, also referred to as IQT, owns part of Pragmatic. British Patient Capital, a subsidiary of the UK government’s economic development bank, also participated in the funding.
The company has now raised over $190 million to date and employs over 200 people. Puhua Capital, a Hangzhou-based VC focused on health and technology, has also invested an undisclosed amount. Although, Pragmatics has intentionally kept Chinese investment low, due the sensitive geopolitical situation. 
The geopolitics of chip-making capabilities
According to Chris Miller, the author of Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology, the process of designing and manufacturing chips is the most complex technological process that humans have ever undertaken. In Miller’s words, the supply chain needed to produce an advanced chip “stretches across multiple continents, involves some of the most purified materials, and the most precise machine tools ever made.” 
In 2022, the global semiconductor market size was over $​​573 billion, and is predicted to grow to $1,380.79 billion by 2029. Meanwhile, Miller further believes that it is not only a matter of business, economics or technology, but also a question of political relevance as to which countries have these capabilities and which don’t. 
As such, successful startups like Pragmatic could find themselves caught in strategic tug-of-wars, stretching well beyond the scope of applied technological excellence.

Major VCs unite in alliance to help startups and investors reach net zero,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/04/28,"

A group of over 23 VCs across Europe and the US have joined forces this week to guide startups and their early-stage investors towards net zero, in an effort to decarbonise the global economy and the venture capital industry.
The Venture Climate Alliance (VCA) consists of both generalist and climate-focused firms, and its members manage a combined $62.3 billion in assets, according to Crunchbase figures.
To begin with, participating VCs pledge to inventory their Scope 1-3 emissions and, in turn, reach either net zero or negative emissions for their own operations (such as office energy consumption and employee commuting) by 2030 or earlier.
VCA’s members will also encourage their portfolio startups to align with the net zero goals by 2050 or sooner, and will help founders in setting the right targets for their businesses. For climate-focused companies, this could include support to existing efforts. For non-climate-focused companies, this could entail providing access to additional resources, such as specific tools and methodologies.
Once startups have set their net zero transition goals, the VCA will offer further assistance depending on their needs, such as supporting response mechanisms to climate-related risks, or adapting to regulatory developments.
The alliance’s members will share annual updates on both their own and their portfolio companies’ progress.
“Our goal is to bridge the gap between what’s happening in public markets, where hundreds of companies have made bold forward-looking net zero commitments, and early stage innovation, which has the potential to decarbonise legacy industries through a combination of better products, more efficient processes, and lower costs,” said Alexandra Harbour, founder & chair of the VCA and a principal at Prelude Ventures — one of the alliance’s founding members.
“By harnessing the collective expertise of top venture capitalists from both sides of the Atlantic, the VCA has the potential to significantly influence the funding decisions that shape the future of climate startups and technologies,” added Danijel Višević, Founding Partner at VCA member World Fund.
The Venture Capital Alliance counts 10 founding members: Prelude Ventures, Capricorn Investment Group, DCVC, Energy Impact Partners, Galvanize Climate Solutions, S2G Ventures, Union Square Ventures, Tiger Global, World Fund and 2150.
The following firms are also participating: Obvious Ventures, Congruent Ventures, Valo Ventures, Clean Energy Ventures, Fifth Wall, Overture Ventures, Blackhorn Ventures, Spring Lane Capital, Azolla Ventures, Systemiq Capital, The Westly Group, Innovation Endeavors, and ReGen Ventures.
The VCA is also an official partner of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) and the UN Climate Change High-Level Champions as part of its Race to Zero campaign.
Membership to the alliance is open to any VC that agrees to pledge to its commitments.

Can plant-based meats be healthy? This foodtech startup says yes,Linnea Ahlgren,2023/04/27,"
Barcelona’s food tech startup Heura has unveiled its new patent-pending technology aimed at producing meat substitutes without the lengthy and sometimes off-putting ingredients list. The company says it is the first scalable technology of its kind to add “superior” nutritional value to plant-based foods. 
The data is abundantly clear – if we are to have any chance at halting global warming, we need to revolutionise our food systems. Approximately 14.5% of all anthropogenic greenhouse gases come from the raising of livestock. 
Furthermore, research has shown processed red meats to be carcinogenic. This means that what we choose to put on our plates matters, for the health of both the collective and the individual. 
However, the initial enthusiasm for vegan meat alternatives has waned somewhat, with shares in one of the most eponymous alternatives, Beyond Meat, losing over 60% of their value over the past year alone. 
Often, companies behind the fake meat revolution are criticised for relying too heavily on artificial additives, with long lists of unpronounceable ingredients. Furthermore, the ultra-processed products are often devoid of essential nutrients. 
“I think that the worst enemy of the category are bad products,” said Heura’s co-founder Marc Coloma. “We see that there has been kind of a gold rush in this category where a lot of products had been launched super fast to the market without meeting consumer expectations.”
Patent-pending thermomechanical technology
Most approaches to creating vegan meat substitutes are sort of trial and error. Producers experiment with different blends of binders and additives as well as vegetable proteins to see what works. 
Enter Heura’s patent-pending technology. The thermomechanical technique uses heat and mechanical energy to shape or modify a material’s properties. This, Heura says, allows it to create plant-based meat substitutes with higher quality inputs and a shorter ingredients list. 

Día histórico en Heura: hoy presentamos nuestra primera patente (de muchas que vendrán) y no podemos estar más felices. #Sucesores pic.twitter.com/1mwG7VbOK8
— Heura Foods #FoodActivists (@HeuraFoods) April 25, 2023

We haven’t been able to glean the exact details about the actual breakthrough. However, during the launch of the project platform, named Good Rebel Tech, last year, the company’s Science and Technology director Isabelle Férnandez, stated that, 
“Instead of focusing on extracting and isolating proteins from legume seeds, we are researching ways to leverage the functionality of whole plants in their naturally occurring structures.” 
For now, focus will be on products in the deli, cheese and whole meats. And as anyone who has ever dined in Spain can attest, these are far more popular categories than the most commonly substituted burger patty.
But, protein?
The company has already developed two products using the technology: a frankfurter-style sausage and ham-style slices, both made from soy protein. The frankfurters have a protein density of 72%, and the “ham” 70%. Heura is hoping to have both products hit store shelves by the end of Q4 2023. 
List of ingredients for the frankfurter? Water, soy protein isolate, extra virgin olive oil, radish, carrot and paprika flavour concentrates, lemon juice from concentrate and vitamin B12. 
You may have noticed it does not, like so many fake meat products, contain coconut oil. This is due to another milestone reached by Heura’s R&D department last year, where it managed to replace the saturated fat alternative with a 100% olive-oil-based analogue. 
Successful equity crowdfunding
Heura Foods was founded in 2017, in a co-working office in the centre of Barcelona. Its first customer was a small, local business in the Poble-sec neighbourhood. The startup has raised €36 million to date – including an equity crowdfunding campaign which landed it €4 million in just 12 hours. In 2022, the company secured a turnover of €31.4 million, and in 2023, it grew 44% in Q1 compared to the same quarter the year before. 
Furthermore, Heura has tripled its market share in Spain over the past three years, and has agreements with retailer groups in Austria, Switzerland, Poland, the Netherlands, Portugal and the UK.
Could the possession of a patent in an otherwise quite wild west low barrier-to-entry plant-based meats industry lure more investors to Heura’s cause? We will enjoy a cruelty-free frankfurter (or two) while we wait to find out, thank you very much.

Netflix minus 1M users in Spain over no-password-sharing policy,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/04/26,"
Netflix’s password sharing crackdown has cost it one million users in Spain during the first quarter of 2023, a new study by market research group Kantar has found. This translates to an approximately 15% decrease of its total users.
The streaming platform introduced the new measures in Spain in early February, asking for a €5.99 monthly fee from users sharing their passwords with other households. According to Kantar, this is directly linked to the decline of the country’s user base.
Out of the one million users who opted out of Netflix, two-thirds were benefiting from password sharing. One-third were actually paying for the account, meaning a loss in subscribers which results in a negative impact on revenue.
At the same time, the study found that subscription cancellations nearly tripled in this year’s first quarter compared to the previous period. Furthermore, 10% of Spain’s remaining subscribers plan to cancel their plan in the second quarter of 2023.
Meanwhile, competition in the country is increasing with Amazon Prime Video accounting for the majority of new subscriptions at 34.4%, followed by the newly-launched Sky Showtime at 32.6%.
“There are of course inherent risks with clamping down on password sharing, particularly when back in 2017 Netflix was seen to be actively encouraging it,” said Dominic Sunnebo, Global Insight Director at Kantar’s Worldpanel Division. “Some users were expected to be lost in the process, but losing over one million users in a little over a month has major implications for Netflix and whether it decides to continue with its crackdown globally.”

Love is sharing a password.
— Netflix (@netflix) March 10, 2017

Alongside Spain, the streaming platform has so far implemented its new password policy measures in Portugal, Canada, and New Zealand, following testing in several countries in Latin America. According to Neftlix’s estimates over a 100 million households are sharing a password.
“We’ve got folks that are watching Netflix who aren’t paying us as part of basically borrowing somebody else’s credentials,” Gregory Peters, the company’s COO and CPO, said during the latest earnings call.
“Our goal is over this year to basically work through that situation and convert many of those folks to be paid accounts, or to have the account owner pay for them,” Peters added, noting that “a cancel reaction” to that is to be expected in the beginning.
And while Netflix has fallen off its targets for new subscribers in the first quarter of 2023, the company believes that the new password policy in combination with cheaper add-based subscriptions will boost growth in the second half of the year.
It remains to be seen whether Spain’s user decline is just an anticipated short-term pitfall, or a clear indication that Netflix’s plan will cost it even more subscribers.

Exclusive: Swiss startup unveils ‘world-first’ AI translation service,Thomas Macaulay,2023/04/26,"
A startup claims to have launched a world-first AI speech-to-speech translation system.
The tool, called Aivia, was developed by Interprefy, a Zurich-based provider of translation services. The firm focuses on interpreting meetings and events — a market being turbocharged by globalisation. 
As interactions spread across borders, they can become harder to understand. Although English is the language of international business, it’s only spoken by an estimated 17% of the world. The remainder is often excluded from the conversation.
Interprefy supplies a way to remove this language barrier — and the demand seems strong. In the eight years since the company was founded, Interprefy says it’s supported over 50,000 meetings. They range from remote press conferences at the Euro 2020 football tournament to interviews with astronauts at the International Space Station.
Aivia was designed to expand this client base. At the touch of a button, the service translates speech into audio and captions in real time. Interprefy claims it’s the first-ever advanced automated speech translation service for online and live events.


“Many organisations and events lack the budget to book professional interpretation.


Oddmund Braaten, Interprefy’s CEO, has grand ambitions for Aivia. He wants the tool to finally make simultaneous translations mainstream.
“Over the last eight years, our remote interpreting technology has helped democratise access to these services greatly and has seen wide adoption, especially during the Covid era,” Braaten tells TNW. 
“But we’ve still seen many organisations and events lacking the budget to book professional interpretation. That’s why we developed a service that provides affordable real-time translation as well as the flexibility and support needed to ensure a seamless multilingual user experience.”
Braaten is bullish about the results. He believes Aivia is the most accurate and flexible AI speech translator on the market.
Braaten was promoted from COO to CEO at Interprefy last year.
Under the hood, Aivia integrates three main AI technologies: automatic speech recognition, machine translation, and synthetic voice generation.
To enhance their outputs, Interprefy built a benchmarking toolkit to evaluate the best AI for every language combination. The company also uses a glossary extraction tool to further customise Aivia for each event. This preps the system with relevant keywords and hard-to-catch names or abbreviations from pertinent content.
According to Braaten, this approach addresses two shortcomings in real-time speech translation: inconsistent results and the needs of event organisers.
“We believe we’ve solved both pain points,” he says. “Because we’ve been supporting events of all shapes and sizes for nearly a decade, we have the expertise to support event organisers hands-on. We’ve also built a solution that can benchmark leading AI solutions to use only the best-performing AI technologies available on the market.”
Initially, Aivia will be available in 24 languages and regional accents. Both in-person audiences and platforms such as Microsoft Teams, Zoom, and ON24 can use the service.
Interprefy plans to add many more languages in the near future — and with good reason. Globally, an estimated 30% of internet users now use online translation tools every week — but real-time speech interpretation remains a challenge. Aivia offers a new solution to the problem.

Aivia arrives amid rapid advances in AI translation. Last year, an Italian interpretation company predicted that machines will surpass the top human translations by the end of the decade.
Naturally, the progress raises concerns about the future prospects for the profession. Braaten argues that AI and humans can play complementary roles.
Only skilled linguists, he says, can translate the subtleties of context, tone, humour, and idioms. Furthermore, they’re the only safe option for sensitive content.
“Interpreters have the unique ability to adapt their translation to every scenario, as well as being able to paraphrase and interpret non-spoken information such as body language and tone of voice,” says Braaten. 
“These are qualities that AI simply cannot replicate and are especially important for higher-level communication such as board meetings, legal meetings, or diplomatic conversations.”
AI, meanwhile, is better suited to situations in which nuance is rare and risks are low. In these scenarios, machine translations can provide a more affordable and practical alternative.  
Yet for live events and meetings, simultaneous interpretation remains a niche service. Braaten hopes Aivia’s accessibility can change that.

Swedish startup wants €1.5BN to build emissions-free steel plant,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/04/24,"
Swedish startup H2 Green Steel has announced its plans to raise more than €1.5bn in equity funding to build steel plants that emit virtually no emissions.
The startup, backed by high-profile investors such as Mercedes, Maersk, and Spotify’s chief executive, is constructing a ‘green steel’ manufacturing plant in Boden, north Sweden. 
Construction of the plant will be financed through more than €5bn in debt and equity. The startup said in October that it had received support from European financial institutions for €3.5bn in debt financing, making it one of the most capitalised climate tech projects in Europe. 
H2 Green Steel confirmed today that it is now in the process of securing the remaining €1.5bn equity funding and is working with advisers from Morgan Stanley, Financial Times reports. 
Traditionally, steel is made by combining iron ore with coke (a type of coal) at extremely high temperatures. The burning coke produces carbon monoxide, which converts the iron ore into ‘pig iron’ — the basis of steel. The only problem is, when the coke burns it produces a lot of CO2. In fact, the steel industry as a whole is responsible for an estimated 8% of global CO2 emissions. 
H2 Green Steel looks to decarbonise steelmaking by replacing coke with ‘green’ hydrogen (hydrogen produced using renewable energy). Hydrogen reacts with the iron ore to create pig iron — but without the emissions. The only by-product, the startup says, would be water vapour.

The hydrogen itself would be made in an electrolyser at the Boden site. The electrolyser would be powered by ​​renewable energy, including hydropower from the Lule River and nearby wind farms. Overall, this process is predicted to slash steelmaking emissions by 95%.    
If successful, the Boden plant will be the first large-scale green steel plant in Europe, with its products used to construct everything from cars and cargo ships to buildings and bridges. The startup expects to roll out the first commercial batches of its steel by 2025 and aims to produce five million tonnes of green steel a year by 2030. 
However, global annual steel production is currently around 2,000 million tonnes, according to figures from the World Steel Association. This would make the production capacity of the Boden plant a mere “drop in the sea,” Ms Lund Waagsaether, senior policy advisor at the Brussels-based climate think tank E3G, told the BBC.  
But the Boden plant isn’t the only one of its kind in the pipeline. H2 Green Steel has already signed an agreement with Spanish company Iberdrola to build a plant powered by solar power on the Iberian peninsula. Hybrit, another Swedish company, hopes to open a fossil-free green steel plant by 2026 in a joint venture with mining operator LKAB, Nordic steel company SSAB, and energy company Vattenfall. GravitHy plans to open a hydrogen-based plant in France in 2027, and German steel giant Thyssenkrupp recently said it aims to introduce carbon-neutral production at all its plants by 2045.
These projects are set to boost Europe’s domestic production of green steel, and could soon have political backing too. The EU is in the process of finalising the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a strategydesigned to make it more expensive for European companies to import cheaper, non-green steel from other parts of the world.

Irish startup and CERN join forces on experimental energy transmission project,Thomas Macaulay,2023/04/24,"
An Irish startup has teamed with CERN to develop a new form of insulation for superconducting cables, which are designed to accelerate the green energy transition.
Named SuperNode, the company has invented energy transmission cables that can transfer immense power across long distances. As the system requires less space and voltage than conventional copper-based cables, the environmental impact is reduced.
These benefits derive from superconductivity. This phenomenon occurs when certain materials are cooled below their critical temperature — typically -180°C for high-temperature superconductors. As a result, superconductors can offer a hefty power density and zero electrical losses.
To harness this potential, SuperNode needs unique scientific resources — which is where CERN comes in.
“In its research, CERN pushes the limit of superconductivity to reach record energy levels and operates one of the largest vacuum systems in the world,” said CERN’s Paolo Chiggiato in a statement.
“In particular, to avoid collisions with residual gas molecules inside the accelerators, we must reach extreme levels of vacuum. Vacuum is also used at CERN as a thermal insulator for our superconducting magnets. We believe that this know-how can be successfully applied to evaluate the technological solutions proposed to insulate the superconducting cables developed by SuperNode.”
To test the tech, CERN will subject candidate materials to temperatures, pressures, and environments that replicate the conditions that the cables will face. CERN will also design and develop a novel test rig to validate scale prototypes. Eventually, the rig will be installed at SuperNode’s Dublin headquarters — dubbed the European Cryogenic Centre for Superconductors.
A study commissioned by SuperNode found that an integrated pan-European energy grid could reduce energy costs by 32%. Credit: SuperNode
The tie-up with CERN caps a busy month for SuperNode. Last week, the company announced that shareholders Aker Horizons and Dr Eddie O’Connor had committed €16 million of extra money towards developing the tech. The new funding followed a previous €14m cash injection made last year.
John Fitzgerald, CEO of SuperNode, believes adding CERN to the mix will provide a further boost.
“To meet increasing electricity demands, future transmission grids will have to reliably transfer bulk electricity over distances of hundreds of kilometres — connecting consumption hubs with areas of production, which are often located far away,” he said.
“We believe that by working together, we can find innovative solutions to improve the world’s energy infrastructure. Without new grid technology, we cannot integrate the level of renewables governments across the world have targeted and we will not achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement”.
SuperNode says its system is more efficient, cheaper, and better for the environment than any other viable alternative. Credit: SuperNode
The collaboration also comes at a historical moment for CERN. The lab has just taken its first steps towards building a 91 km-long particle accelerator. The new system would more than triple the length of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) — currently the world’s largest and most powerful particle collider — which will complete its mission around 2040.
The plans were revealed amid growing competition for Europe’s leading position in the field.
The most notable rival is China, which also intends to build the world’s largest particle accelerator. CERN’s Malika Meddahi told AFP last week that “China displays the same ambition” as Europe.
“Let’s be vigilant and be sure that we are not on the verge of a change in this hierarchy,” she said.
Some concerns have also been raised over the enormous cost of the new collider. Critics worry that the investment in fundamental science would be better spent in applied sciences. But the collaboration with SuperNode is further evidence that CERN’s work can lead to practical applications.

Icelandic startup bags €6M EU grant to fight drug-resistant infections,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/04/24,"
Reykjavik-based Akthelia Pharmaceuticals and the University of Iceland have been awarded a €6m grant by Horizon Europe to combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR). This occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites evolve and no longer respond to medicines, making infections harder to treat.
AMR is listed among the WHO’s most pressing health threats of our time, with the potential to give rise to the next global pandemic as “pan-drug”-resistant strains emerge. It’s also estimated that AMR associated infections already contribute to approximately 5 million deaths per year — more than AIDS/HIV or malaria.
Now, the EU-funded IN-ARMOR project, led by Aktelia and the University of Iceland, aims to tackle this challenge in collaboration with eight other universities and institutes and six companies across Europe.
The project’s aim is to develop a new type of drug that will boost the body’s natural immune response, also known as “innate immunity.” It will address infections caused by bacteria, viruses, and fungi.
IN-ARMOR will tap into Aktelia’s R&D on innate immunity and antimicrobial peptides – short protein chains that play a key role in the immune systems of mammals, including humans. The startup‘s work builds on the research of the University of Iceland, which is one the company’s owners.
The project will develop the new medicine using computer-aided drug design and in-silico approaches. It will harness nanotechnology to target drugs to specific areas within the body, extending their effectiveness and reducing side effects.
Upon completion, IN-ARMOR will move to clinical validation. The team hopes that the new drug could be used not only in combination with other antibiotics, but also by itself.
“By concentrating on stimulating the body’s innate defences against infection, we can avoid the use of traditional antibiotics and develop revolutionary new treatments to tackle multiresistant bacteria. This could save countless lives across the world,” said Guðmundur Hrafn Guðmundsson, professor at the University of Iceland and CSO at Akthelia.
If successful, IN-ARMOR would have the potential to save long-term €107 billion in antibiotics development. Furthermore, it would reduce the global disease burden by 97 million DALYs — the years of life lost due to premature mortality or the years lived with a disability as a result of a disease.

New research milestone could solve quantum scalability,Linnea Ahlgren,2023/04/21,"
Wherever you fall on the quantum sceptic spectrum, you cannot deny that the potential of the technology is fascinating. Don’t worry, we will admit to not understanding it fully yet either, but the founders of QuiX Quantum do. 
Together with scientists from the Leibniz University Hannover, the team has demonstrated a fully-integrated quantum light source on a chip smaller than the size of a one-euro coin. 
The study, called “Fully on-chip photonic turnkey quantum source for entangled qubit/qudit state generation,” just FYI, was published in Nature Photonics this week. Its results could reportedly prove a game-changer for technologies such as quantum computing. 
Photonics offer temperature advantages
Quantum photonics is a field of research that explores the behaviour of light and its interactions with matter at the quantum level. Quantum light sources produce photons that can be used as quantum bits, or qubits. One of the main advantages of photonics compared to superconductor approaches is that it is compatible with room temperature operating conditions. 
However, most sources are external laser systems, making them bulky and non-reproducible and thus unsuitable for out-of-lab use or production at larger scale. Integrated, or on-chip sources are becoming popular due to being more compact and stable. 
A fully-integrated light source, such as the one demonstrated by QuiX and Leibniz University scientists, will allow all stages of the Quantum Information Processing (QIP) to be on a single chip, which will lead to greater stability and scalability of the technology.
Plug-and-play photonics solutions
QuiX Quantum was founded in January 2019. Since then, the company has raised over €5.5 million in funding and already become the European market leader for quantum computing hardware based on photonics. They sold their first quantum processors in 2021, and are building 8- and 64-qubit Universal Quantum Computers worth €14 million for the German Aerospace Center. 
The company says its goal is “the continued disruption of quantum computing with our high-tech, scalable, future-proof, plug-and-play integrated photonic solutions.” Its recent breakthrough could not come at a better time. The EU has just launched a €19 million project to help quantum startups transition from lab to market. 
Earlier this year, QuiX Quantum took home the prestigious Prism Award for its 20-mode Quantum Photonic Processor. This award is known as the “Oscars of Photonics,” presented during the Photonics West conference in San Francisco.
“In four years, we went from an idea to delivering award-winning, market-leading hardware for photonic quantum computing,” Stefan Hengesbach, CEO of Quix, stated. “This awarded processor is the core element of our current generation quantum computers, which has already created a huge impact in the quantum ecosystem as an excellent tool to perform fundamental quantum mechanical experiments on-chip.

You can now eat dinner in space — for just €120K,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/04/21,"
It turns out you don’t need a rocket to explore the edge of space. 
French startup Zephalto has just announced plans to send eager tourists to the stratosphere in a space balloon by 2025. Starting at €120,000 per person, the six-hour round trip would offer “unparalleled views” of Earth and a fine dining experience from the comfort of a luxurious pressurised capsule named Celeste.      
“We choose 25 km high because it’s the altitude where you are in the darkness of space, with 98% of the atmosphere below you so that you can enjoy the curvature of the Earth in the blue line. You’re in the darkness of space, but without the zero gravity experience,” Vincent Farret d’Astiès, Zephalto founder and aerospace engineer, told Bloomberg.  
The trip would include gourmet meals both before and during the flight, aperitifs, winetasting, stratographic photography, and the possibility to share the experience instantly with the people back on Earth via Wi-Fi. The capsule, currently being designed by French architect Joseph Dirand, would have 20 square metres of interior room, accommodating six passengers and two pilots.

The balloon, filled with helium or hydrogen, would depart from France and rise to 25 km over the course of about one and a half hours. This is about twice as high as commercial jets operate but well below the boundary of space (which lies 80-100 km above sea level). Once at peak altitude, the balloon will hover for three hours to ensure you have enough time to soak up the views, before descending back to the ground.  
While this might seem like a load of hot air, the startup, founded in 2016, has already secured backing from some high-profile players, including Airbus, Dassault, National Center for Space Studies (CNES), and European Space Agency (ESA). 
Zephalto aims for 60 flights per year once it begins commercial operations. It has already conducted three test flights with pilots on board, though none have reached the full altitude. However, the company expects to hit the target height in a test flight later this year.

Crewed high-altitude balloons are not a novel idea. In 1931, Swiss physicist Auguste Piccard ascended 16km in a pressurised capsule attached to a helium balloon, becoming the first person to ever reach the stratosphere. Since then, crewed high-altitude balloons have risen to over 34km, although the technology has never gone commercial — yet. 
Space Perspective and Worldview, both US-based, are also developing their own versions of the technology. They both plan to launch even earlier than Zephalto, in 2024. Spanish startup Zero2Infinity is also developing a space balloon although it has yet to announce a launch date. Furthermore, Japanese startup Iwaya Giken has built a much smaller capsule that it hopes will cost just tens of thousands of dollars once the company achieves economies of scale.   
While perhaps not quite as alluring as blasting off into real space aboard a rocket, as promised by billionaire-owned firms like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic, proponents say balloon trips offer a number of distinct advantages. 
Firstly, they’re a lot cheaper. A Virgin Galactic flight starts at $450,000, while a trip aboard one of SpaceX’s rockets could set you back tens of millions of dollars. Even though the balloons don’t travel as high as these rockets, which average altitudes between 50-120km, operators say they still fly high enough for viewers to experience the overview effect — an intense perspective shift that many astronauts say kicks in when you view Earth from above.

What’s more, despite numerous advances in recent years, rockets remain complex, expensive, and unpredictable (SpaceX’s launch failure this week is a prime example). Passengers must undergo significant training and medical checks before even thinking of boarding one. However, Zephalto says that anyone healthy enough to fly on an airliner can board a space balloon.  
The startup also claims that the first Celeste flight will mark the lowest amount of CO2 generated by a space flight: 26.6 kg for the entire 6-hour journey, equivalent to the carbon footprint of a “pair of denim trousers.” By contrast, at a launch in 2016, the Space X Falcon 9 rocket emitted a whopping 116 tons of CO2 in just 165 seconds.
All this equates to what could become a more sustainable and accessible alternative to rocket-based space tourism. 
However, Zephalto hasn’t even completed its first commercial test flight or arrived at the final design for the capsule, and keeps pushing back the launch date. The startup is also vague on a number of details, including where exactly the balloons will launch from, or whether it has secured permission to fly from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Other startups like Worldview follow a similar trend — it announced in 2013 that its space balloons would enter commercial operations in 2016.
But despite the fact that the space balloon startup scene seems better at making promises than delivering them, Zephalto, like most of the other startups mentioned, is already taking pre-reservations. Lift-off could take place in two years’ time — if all goes to plan.

EU launches project to bring quantum startups from lab to market,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/04/20,"
A new EU-backed project aims to help quantum tech startups and SMEs move faster to hardware production, enter this very competitive field early, and remain within the union’s borders.
Dubbed Qu-Pilot, the €19m project aspires to solve a pressing challenge of the European industry: transitioning innovation from lab to market. The ultimate goal is to accelerate the time-to-market of the bloc’s industrial innovation in quantum technology and help establish a trusted supply chain.
Qu-Pilot will remove a significant barrier for companies, namely piloting, which requires considerable cost, infrastructure, and time investments.
The project will leverage existing piloting infrastructure, primarily spread across European research and technology organisations (RTOs). It will also facilitate product development loops in collaboration with the union’s hardware sector. This will result in the first federated European production capabilities for quantum technologies, which will contribute to setting standards in the field and be accessible to startups and SMEs.
These federated pilot lines will focus on four technology platforms: superconducting, photonics, semiconducting, and diamond technologies, enabling applications in quantum computing, communication, and sensing.

Qu-Pilot consists of 21 partners from nine different countries, including the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), Belgium’s Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre (IMEC), and Fraunhofer Society in Germany. The project started this month and will run for 3.5 years.
Alongside the Quantum Technologies Flagship, the newly-launched Qu-Pilot is part of the EU’s strategic plan to boost quantum development in the bloc, convert research into commercial applications, and secure its technological sovereignty in the field.

Reddit expands its European operation with a new hub in Amsterdam,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/04/20,"
Following its European expansion in Dublin, London, and Berlin in the past few years, Reddit is now opening its first regional sales hub in Amsterdam.
Centrally located in the wider European market, adjacent to countries with a strong customer base such as Germany and France, and breeding a competitive talent pool, the Dutch capital emerged as the perfect location to further drive the growth the US-based company has seen in Western Europe.
The hub’s mission is to bring together the platform’s EMEA markets in a central location and support a wide array of customers spread across Europe in meeting their advertising goals. It will house over 50 employees in sales and engineering, and serve as the home base for the EMEA Ads Engineering team as well.
According to Susanne Mostertman, EMEA Head of Mid-Market and Small Business (SMB) Sales, who will be leading the hub, the company plans to significantly growth both the sales and engineering teams by the end of 2023, and Amsterdam will be Reddit’s largest office in continental Europe by employee number.
“We know from our research that Reddit users in Europe are open to seeing ads or content from brands on the platform, and are more likely to trust a brand that participates on Reddit than brands they see advertising on other platforms,” Mosterstman told TNW. “By expanding our footprint in Amsterdam — and Europe more broadly — we’re able to better connect Reddit’s audience with brands they’re interested in and care about.”
This new chapter of Reddit in Europe, Mostertman added, enables the platform to focus on the teams and resources that can best attend to its advertisers in the region “with local and country-specific experts ready to provide tailored guidance.”
These efforts will not only support large advertisers such as Google, Warner Bros., and reMarkable, but European startups as well. The Amsterdam hub is already working together with a number of existing partners, including payment provider Klarna and refurbished device marketplace Back Market.
“Partnering with Reddit has allowed us to reach out to a wide variety of communities — from tech to fashion and everything in between — to encourage responsible shopping at the right time,” said Salah Said, Head of Sustainability at Klarna.
Reddit’s new European office will located in Amsterdam’s Plantage neighbourhood in the city centre. Hiring is still ongoing and the company plans to host a recruiting event later this spring.

"UK can rejoin Horizon without paying for last two years, says EU",Thomas Macaulay,2023/04/18,"
The UK has been told it won’t have to pay for the two years it had been out of the EU’s Horizon research programme — removing a big barrier to rejoining the €95.5bn scheme.
Britain had been locked out of Horizon because of a post-Brexit dispute over trade in Northern Ireland. The recent Windsor Framework deal had opened the door to reentry, but talks have stalled over the financial terms.
The British government argues that its contributions to the seven-year innovation scheme should be cut, because its late entry has reduced the potential returns.
A key concern involved the payments for 2021 and 2022, when the UK was blocked from Horizon. Officials were reportedly concerned that Britain would still have to pay for those two years. According to the European Commission, that will not be the case.
“We are not being unreasonable. We are not asking them to pay for the years they were not associated,” an EU official told the Guardian.
“We are ready to work on it very quickly. But there is still that doubt about the willingness of the UK to take part.”
More at stake than money
Despite the EU’s officials, there may be further roadblocks ahead. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is said to be “sceptical” about Horizon’s value. The British government has also unveiled a backup R&D funding scheme, which will be activated if negotiations to rejoin the EU programme fall apart.
However, among UK scientists and technologists, support for rejoining Horizon is widespread. In addition to €95.5bn funding pot, they point to the benefits of international collaboration, common rules, and established research cycles.
“The government must also remember there is more at stake here than money,” Tony McBride, Director of Policy and Public Affairs at the Institute of Physics, said last week.
“Should it be needed, any alternative to Horizon must also make up for the loss of the established networks, partnerships, and infrastructure the UK has benefitted from over many, many years, as well as for the disruption and uncertainty caused by these years of delay.”

EU backs 100+ women-founded deep tech startups,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/04/17,"
The European Commission has announced the results of the second round of Women TechEU — a programme designed to help women-founded deep tech startups scale.  
The round, which has a budget of €10m, saw applications from 467 women-founded deep tech startups from across Europe, 134 of which have been selected to participate. It follows on from a successful pilot in 2021 which featured 50 startups.
The startups selected for the second round will now each receive an individual grant of €75,000. The female founders will also be offered mentoring and coaching under the European Innovation Council (EIC) Women Leadership Programme, and be afforded access to EU networking opportunities.   
The startups operate in 16 different deep tech sectors, and have developed solutions ranging from new medical drugs and carbon capture technologies, to digital learning and autonomous robotics. 
Among the participants is Sweden-based Norbite, which uses insects to recycle plastic waste, Netherlands-based Agurotech, which digitises farming using AI, and Lithuania-based Inobiostar, which has developed a waste paper-based material for removing oil spills.  
“By combining innovative ideas, female entrepreneurship, and excellent research and development, this year’s companies selected for WomenTechEU will contribute to enhancing the quality of life for the citizens of the EU and beyond,” said the European Innovation Council.
Deep tech makes up over a quarter of Europe’s startup ecosystem, with European deep tech companies valued at a combined €700bn in 2021. 
Yet women remain chronically underrepresented: last year only 3% of VC funding in European deep tech went to women-founded startups. 
These inequities are prevalent across the industry, but magnified in the deep tech sector. Deep tech startups tend to have longer R&D cycles, and require higher capital outlay than traditional startups, which makes it even harder for women-led and women-founded teams to scale up.    
This is not just bad practice, it’s also bad for business. According to consulting firm McKinsey, the European tech ecosystem will only be able to remain competitive if it manages to attract and retain more female talent. 
And investors seem to agree: “Diversity of thought, opinion and creativity is essential for our deep tech ecosystem to thrive,” said Christina Franzeskides, deep tech investor at Lakestar, in the 2023 European Deep Tech Report. 
“To that end, we must strive towards inclusivity, across all backgrounds and genders, for the space to reach its full potential,” she added. 
The European Commission believes that giving women-founded startups the right support and investment early on can help bridge deep tech’s gender gap, and strengthen the ecosystem as a whole.

"UK startup Space DOTS wants to test space materials… well, in space",Martin SFP Bryant,2023/04/17,"
This story is syndicated from the premium edition of PreSeed Now, a newsletter that digs into the product, market, and founder story of UK-founded startups so you can understand how they fit into what’s happening in the wider world and startup ecosystem.

The burgeoning industry around space technology is based heavily on hardware, but the materials that hardware is built from need to undergo rigorous testing on Earth before they’re sent out into orbit and beyond.
Space DOTS is a startup that wants to transform material testing in the space industry by skipping the tests down here, and sending the materials straight up into space.
“What we do is a smartphone-sized version of a testing lab that anyone would use on ground to test materials’ properties before actually going into space. We have shrunk everything down so that it can be launched very quickly and easily at a lower cost, directly into orbit,” explains co-founder and CEO Bianca Cefalo.
“Instead of going through the entire process of iteration, failure, and iteration on the ground, you can just ‘fail fast, iterate’ faster, directly in space at a cost that is not going to break the bank of anybody doing so.”








Space DOTS co-founder and CEO, Bianca Cefalo


Cefalo gives the example of graphene, the light, strong, and thin material that has excited a lot of people since it was first discovered in Manchester 20 years ago. Before it could be used in, for example, the panels of a spacecraft, you would need to understand its properties (for example its reaction to heat) and how they perform in space.
She explains that this tends to be done first via simulation software, and then in labs that simulate the conditions of space. These tests help to understand the material’s performance in a vacuum, in reaction to the radiation in space, and the like.
“All these different environmental conditions are all simulated on the ground, then you cross-correlate the results. And you have an estimated understanding of what’s going to happen to this material once it goes into space… However, the last mile of validation is to actually test it in space to see how it really behaves under real space conditions.”
London-based Space DOTS wants to cut out all the ground-based estimations with the 10x10x1 centimeter laboratory it is developing, inside which tests can be conducted onboard spacecraft.

A closer look at the tech
The first test the startup has developed is a tensile test, where a small sample of a material can be stressed to breaking point.
“That’s going to tell us what happened to it from a structural perspective in the exact environment, with the cumulative effects of the vacuum of space, radiation, the atomic oxygen, everything. That’s something that you wouldn’t get on Earth.”
Cefalo says the alternative on Earth would be to test each of these conditions separately in washing-machine sized tensile testing machines. But separate tests create a cumulative margin of error for how the material would really behave under all those conditions at once.
Cefalo is understandably guarded about the secret sauce behind exactly how they have minaturised a materials testing lab to such a small size.
“All I can say is it’s a mechanism that doesn’t use any gears, motors, or bearings, because they wouldn’t work in space, they would freeze. What we’re doing is just based on pure physics.”
Making an impact on the future of space tech
Cefalo argues that the impact Space DOTS technology could have on the industry is huge, as it’d reduce the cost and time of certifying a material for use in space.
Whereas a traditional approach could cost millions of pounds and take years, Space DOTS hopes to charge much less, with the specific pricing depending on many variables. “And you know, certainly, how it’s going to work and you don’t have to repeat anything again on the ground because you’ve been to space, which is the ultimate validation.”
So that companies no longer have to get in line to eventually get a testing slot on the International Space Station, or shop around the difficult-to-penetrate space industry to find someone else willing to carry their experiment, Space DOTS plans to become a full service testing provider.
Cefalo says they are partnering with commercial space companies so anyone who needs a material tested in space can simply engage with Space DOTS and not have to worry about how the material actually gets up there and how it gets back.
“We take that load off the customer and we say ‘okay, tell us what do you need to do, tell us what kind of materials you want to test, what kind of orbital conditions or applications you have in mind. And we do everything for you, from mission requirements to sending it into space, and you don’t have to talk with anybody else.”
The plan is to allow customers to get into space “in a framework of months rather than years.”
And Cefalo hopes the Space DOTS approach can help the space industry catch up with progress in materials science. She says many newer materials aren’t covered by bodies such as NASA and the European Cooperation for Space Standardization (ECSS).
“You will find aluminium alloys, titanium, some plastics – a very basic database of materials. There are a whole lot of other materials and for those ones, there isn’t really a standardisation of how you should test them to be applied in space.
“Material sciences move very fast, and the space industry isn’t catching up quite as quickly as the material sciences moved. And we should be, because we think that space tech is sci-fi, but actually a Formula One car is more sci-fi than a spacecraft.”

The route to Space DOTS
Cefalo grew up in Naples, Italy, where she studied aerospace engineering . She then interned with a German company where she assessed the impact of Martian dust devils on an instrument that was eventually sent to Mars.
From there she spent several years in Berlin as a thermal engineer in the space industry, before moving on to work for Airbus Defence and Space in the UK as a space systems thermal product manager.
“I had to look at methods, solutions, and materials that would make the next generation of telecommunication spacecraft lighter, more powerful, smaller, and cheaper,” she says.
But despite there being plenty of opportunity to use cutting-edge materials, customers baulked at the idea of being the first to use a material in their very expensive new spacecraft.
Cefalo and a colleague, James Sheppard-Alden, realised this was a common issue in the industry and identified ‘direct orbital qualification’ as a solution.
“As much as you wouldn’t test a rain jacket in the sun, you would not test materials for space on Earth. They need to be tested directly there.”
Cefalo saw this issue again in her next role with aerospace materials company Carbice, so she and Sheppard-Alden teamed up to address the problem. They founded Space DOTS in 2021.
They have signed up customers under memorandum of understanding agreements, as they work towards the target of initial commercialisation in 2025, following their first-in-orbit demonstration next year.
Investment
Cefalo says Space DOTS has been bootstrapped to date, with the exception of some financial support as part of the ESA Business Incubation Centre’s incubation programme. 
The company is currently in the process of raising a £1.5 million pre-seed round.
Vision
Cefalo sees Space DOTS’ future as filling an essential gap to fulfil the space industry’s potential.
“​​If you’re thinking about where the space industry is going, it’s going well beyond spacecraft and rockets. It’s going to commercial space stations, it’s going to an ecosystem in space, habitats on other planets, manufacturing in space…”
She says this will require recycling debris from space, and even creating new materials or manufacturing from zero in space.
“The one thing that is missing at the moment is how to make sure that what’s being recycled in space or is being manufactured in space can be used in space without having a protocol or a quality control system in place. So far, nobody’s really thought about that.”
So Space DOTS aims to become the way materials are tested in orbit, on the Moon, on Mars, or beyond.
Challenges
Aside from the obvious technical challenges of proving this thing works (yes, in-space testing needs in-space testing), Cefalo recognises the need to ensure the perceptions of what they’re doing are right.
“[We need to make sure] that what we’re doing is not seen as going against the status quo of qualification and testing in rounds.”
She doesn’t want Space DOTS to be seen as revolutionary.
“This creates a resistance with everything that has been done so far, especially when you go into the sales cycle. You may piss off people that think ‘oh, you’re coming in with this new technology with this new way of qualifying, or do you mean that everything I’ve done in my career so far is invalidated?’
“No. What we’re saying is that Space DOTS is just the organic evolution of where the industry is going and how we have to make sure to use the resources that we have, directly in space. We will never be the ones removing what has been done so far.
“The software simulation and the lab simulation will always need to happen. We want to facilitate the time to market of advanced materials by giving the extra mile of the validation in an easier, cheaper, and better way and making sure that these will be sustainable once an entire in-space ecosystem is built.”
Competition
“There are other companies who are doing very easy access to space high frequency testing, but they are focused on biotech, pharma, drugs, which is something that we don’t do because it’s that’s not our area of expertise, and it’s not something that we intend to do in the long term,” says Cefalo.
“So I think again, our main competitor is the status quo, which is how do we make sure that we are not going against them, but we’re actually helping them just as the next step of the evolution?”

What app developers actually think about the EU vs Apple debate on third-party app stores,Linda Rosencrance,2023/04/17,"
Under the European Union’s new Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to increase competition, large online platforms, including Apple, must open up their devices to third-party app stores.
The DMA also requires these online platforms to permit sideloading, i.e., letting users install software that they download from the Internet. These platforms have until 2024 to comply with the DMA.
Passed in 2022, the goal is to prevent dominance of so-called “gatekeepers” within the market and ensure a level playing field for all EU businesses.
In particular, EU regulators have been concerned about the advantage Apple currently has in the market as it doesn’t allow the use of third-party app stores on iOS devices, as such Apple sets the rules and prices for app developers who want to reach its users (currently they have 34% of market share in Europe). In the past, developers who violated these rules have been banned from the App Store.
While the consensus is that this provision of the law is good for users and even Apple, it’s unclear how the regulation will affect application developers.
The question is what do app developers think about these new regulations? Will they actually be beneficial to EU based developers and what will be the short and long term impact on the EU’s app market? We spoke with a few to find out.
More opportunities to innovate
Strict rules can be a barrier to innovation and not getting accepted into the Apple App Store can break a business, said Markus Müller-Simhofer, CEO of IdeasonCanvas, creator of MindNode, a visual brainstorming and mind mapping app.
“So developers are cautious and avoid crossing the lines defined by the App Store rules,” he said. “[Consequently], many interesting new features or apps will never get developed.”
Max Seelemann, co-founder and executive director at Ulysses, a writing app for Mac, iPad, and iPhone, agreed that Apple does impose a lot of rules on developers — rules that developers may be tempted to break. However, doing so could get them expelled from the App Store.
For example, in August 2020, Apple removed Epic Games’ Fortnite from its App Store because the developer tried to get around paying Apple’s 30% commission on in-app purchases.


How regulators and Apple decide to address security could have a major impact on user experience.


However, with third-party stores, developers will have a plan B if the Apple App Store doesn’t work out, Müller-Simhofer said. “This adds a much-needed safety net for developers who try to strive for more innovative features,” he said. “In the end, the App Store will also benefit from this.”
The DMA, therefore, allows developers to try out new business models and ways of selling/marketing their apps without the risk of losing Apple users. Mykola Savin, product lead at Setapp, a third-party app store that offers subscription-based access to a curated collection of apps on its platform, said that this provision of the DMA will create many more opportunities for developers to innovate.
“They will have the creative freedom to develop products,” Savin said. “And this will open up a system that will provide developers with more chances to experiment and to find what works for their users.”
For example, a number of app developers on Setapp (for macOS) who are focused on creative professionals have found new ways to attract users when offered as part of a suite of productivity apps, rather than as a standalone application. This reach could expand as the platform becomes available on iOS.
Müller-Simhofer said, “What I like about Setapp is that it offers a curated selection of quality apps. When we first joined [in 2018], it was also an excellent way for us to try out a subscription model for our app. As a result, we’ve moved our App Store version to a subscription business model.”
Security and privacy concerns
Müller-Simhofer added that he has some concerns about security and privacy related to this change — issues that Apple has also raised.
“Apple does a lot of good things in this area,” he said. “They don’t catch every scam or malicious app, but at least they try to uncover most of them and remove them once they’re uncovered.”
Philip Young, founder of Session, a pomodoro style productivity app that blocks distractions and tracks progress, shares these security and privacy concerns as they relate to third-party app stores.
“While the App Store isn’t perfect, it does shield end users from low-quality apps, predatory pricing from bad developers who target vulnerable demographics, and user tracking without consent,” he said.
As we discussed previously with experts on EU and tech policy, how regulators and Apple decide to address security when implementing the provisions could have a major impact on usability and user experience.


It took me over six months and more than 30 tries to register.


Overall, Young’s opinion is that opening up Apple devices to third-party app stores will have a big impact on the EU’s app marketplace. He said that more developers will be willing to release their apps on third-party stores on iOS devices so they won’t have to deal with the Apple App Store’s arduous review process.
The issue is about money, not security and privacy
Not having to rely on Apple’s App Store, will also allow app developers to shop the market for app stores that will provide better customer service and more beneficial pricing options. This could help push both Apple and third party stores to improve their offering to developers.
“Bug fixes can be released faster compared to when they’re released on the App Store,” he said. “Waiting up to 20 days for bug fixes is frustrating, especially when it’s out of my control and I can’t contact Apple about it,” Young said.
In addition, developers won’t have to pay the 15%-30% Apple tax any longer.
“Imagine losing 30% of your gross revenue, then losing another 10%-60% of your net profit to pay the state tax wherever you live,” Young said. “You end up with almost nothing.”
Seelemann noted that many developers are also upset about the transaction fees that Apple charges.
“[Money] is at the core of the battle,” he said. “I can imagine that Apple is concerned that they’re going to lose a significant amount of revenue. They say it’s about safety, security, user experience, and what have you. But I would say these are only secondary concerns.”


It’s unlikely to topple the dominance of the App Store.


Seelemann said that he’ll likely put Ulysses on all the platforms that make sense for his company.
“And if the transaction fees are low on other platforms, we might even direct the users that come through our channels to the alternative [app stores] because they’re cheaper for us,” Seelemann said.
Young also said that some developers have had bad experiences with the App Store and as such have avoided building on the platform.
“My previous experience came from building web apps that are permissionless,” he said. “The App Store review has been a painful experience for me.”
Young explained that it took him three months to build Session, but he couldn’t release it because he couldn’t register for the Apple Developer Program.
“I couldn’t contact [Apple] for any reason, and it took me over six months and more than 30 tries to register,” he said. “Multiple calls to Apple Singapore proved useless. I was only able to register when I emailed them with my credit card and CVV number, so they could bill me directly. I know that’s not safe, but it worked, and now I’m registered.”
The long-term impact on the EU’s app market
While Apple initially seemed to be somewhat resistant to the requirements of the DMA, experts believe it’s unlikely to topple the dominance of the App Store.
And Seelemann said he isn’t even sure that this will be a major change for developers — at least in the short term.
“The [Apple] App Store right now is such an essential place,” he said. “And I don’t see that alternative app stores will overtake it in a short time. Maybe in [a few years] or even a decade things might change but, even when alternative app stores are installed, people will still go to the Apple App Store first to find apps. I don’t think when the gates open, there will be a flood coming.”
It remains to be seen what the full impact of the DMA will be on the EU’s app market but what we can say is that Apple isn’t going anywhere. As the App Store continues to be preinstalled on Apple’s devices, to reach these users, app developers will still need to contend with the company’s rules. However, more options may give newbie app developers more room to experiment, innovate, and grow their user base.

Europe’s Juice space mission blasts off towards Jupiter,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/04/14,"
The ESA’s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer mission — ‘Juice’ — successfully launched today from Europe’s spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana.    
The launch was supposed to take place yesterday but was postponed due to poor weather conditions. 
Today, the stars aligned and Juice was successfully blasted into orbit at approximately 14:19 CEST.
It took only two minutes for the Ariane 5 rocket to transport Juice into space, shortly after which it separated from the satellite, which now begins its 8-year journey to Jupiter.

 
Juice will make the 6.6 billion km trip to study three of Jupiter’s 92 known moons: Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa. Each of these worlds has an ocean of water hidden underneath an icy shell — an important target for astronomers searching for life beyond Earth.  
In the two weeks after launch, the satellite will deploy all of its antennas and instrument booms. This will be followed by a three-month long period where all of the spacecraft’s scientific instruments will be commissioned. 
It will take even longer for its first fly-by, which is only set for August 2024. At that time, it will fly by the Moon and then Earth about one and a half days later. The satellite will take advantage of the Earth-Moon gravitational field to sling itself on course for Jupiter. 
Juice is set to arrive at Jupiter in July 2031. Once it arrives it will spend three and a half years orbiting the gas giant and making close fly-bys of three of its moons.

In December 2023, the spacecraft will change orbits moving from Jupiter to Ganymede. By doing so, Juice will become the first satellite ever to orbit around a moon other than Earth’s. 
But it won’t be alone out there. NASA is also launching a Jupiter-bound spacecraft, the Europa clipper, in 2024, that will orbit Europa.
Norbert Krupp, an interdisciplinary scientist at the Juice programme, says the presence of NASA’s satellite is perfect timing and “allows for a two-point comparison of data” that will improve the overall impact of the mission.
Juice is equipped with 10 instruments that aim to give scientists a look not just at the surface of Jupiter and its icy moons, but what lies beneath. The hope is that this will allow for the creation of computer-generated, three dimensional images of its interior.
The satellite will use radar to look into the moons, lidar to create 3D maps of their surfaces, and magnetometers to explore their intricate electrical and magnetic environments. Other sensors will collect data on the whirling particles that surround the moons, and cameras will send back countless pictures to Earth.

Dr Caroline Harper, the head of space science at the UK Space Agency, believes it will confirm the existence of salty oceans beneath the surface of Ganymede.
“JUICE is not in itself designed to look for life on an icy moon, but if we’re going to find life elsewhere in the solar system, chances are it’s going to be underneath the ice, if there is an ocean, underneath the ice on one of those moons,” she said.
“So it’s going to be very exciting to look and see whether we do find what we expect to find, whether there are salty oceans under the icy crust that could contain the conditions that support life”.
Scientists are interested in Jupiter’s moons because they appear to harbour massive oceans of liquid water hidden by tens of miles thick shells of ice, and these oceans might possess favourable conditions for some form of life to exist. 
Although Juice is unlikely to find evidence of life on Jupiter’s moons, the mission will help scientists better understand whether the right conditions for life exist on these moons or not.   
Juice mission controllers plan to dispose of the spacecraft by crashing it onto the surface of Ganymede. This controlled destruction will prevent Juice from turning into a piece of space junk that could collide with future missions.  
The €1.6 billion launch of Juice comes after a series of setbacks for Europe’s launches, the most notable of which was the launch failure of Vega-C in December 2022.
However, on a more positive note, new research shows that Europe overtook the US in spacetech investment in the first quarter of this year, making it the world’s biggest market for private spacetech funding.  
The hope is that this funding will boost Europe’s domestic space capabilities, and offer startups the propulsion they need to scaleup.

Watch LIVE: ESA’s Jupiter-bound space mission makes second launch attempt today,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/04/14,"
The European Space Agency’s (ESA) Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer mission — ‘Juice’ — is ready to embark on its journey to the solar system’s largest planet.
Juice is scheduled to launch today, April 14, at 14:14 CEST (13:15 BST) from Europe’s spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana. 
The launch was supposed to take place yesterday but was postponed due to poor weather conditions.
Juice will make the 8-year, 6.6 billion km trip to study three of Jupiter’s moons: Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa. Each of these worlds has an ocean of water hidden underneath an icy shell — an important target for astronomers searching for life beyond Earth.   
ESA will stream the launch live on its website and on its YouTube channel which you can view below. French viewers can access ESA’s Web TV Two.

The satellite will blast off atop Europe’s Ariane 5 rocket. Due to the intricacies of the trajectory that will take Juice to Jupiter, the rocket has to lift off during a one-second window. Fortunately, additional one-second launch windows will be available every day until the end of April, should today’s launch be unsuccessful.

If all goes to plan, Juice will separate from the upper stage of Ariane 5 at 14.42 CEST, before sending its first signal down to the Earth’s surface by 14:51 CEST. The space agency expects solar arrays to be completely deployed by 15:55 CEST.

3 innovative energy storage firms bag £30M from UK government,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/04/13,"
Seeking to modernise the UK’s energy system and maximise the potential of renewables, the British government has awarded £30 million to three pioneering companies to develop new energy storage technologies.
According to the government, accelerating the uptake of these technologies will not only save billions of pounds in energy costs, but also help balance the National Grid, and increase the country’s energy security.
The funding will help the businesses test and prepare their technology for the market, encourage private investment, and create new jobs across the UK.
The selected companies are the following:
Invinity Energy Systems
The battery maker will receive £11 million to build the largest grid-scale battery ever manufactured in the UK.
The 30MWh system power battery system will be capable of delivering more than 7MW of power on demand — with a capacity equivalent to the daily energy use of approximately 3,500 homes for over two hours.
The system replaces lithium with vanadium: a malleable transition metal, discovered in 1801. The company claims that vanadium’s use results in higher-performance batteries: they’re inflammable, non-degrading, and over 97% recyclable, while they last for 25+ years.
Invinity Energy Systems will build the battery at its factory in Scotland, and will integrate it with the existing power infrastructure of the National Grid to alleviate pressure during peak times.
SynchroStor
SynchroStor will construct a Pumped Thermal Energy Storage (PTES) grid-connected demonstration plant. The system stores energy as heat, based on a closed-cycle Brayton loop, and converts heat to electricity when needed.
The facility will have a 1MW capacity and will be capable of charging, storing, and discharging energy for a period of 10 hours — outperforming current battery technology.
To realise the facility’s construction, the government has awarded SynchroStor £9.4 million.
Cheesecake Energy (CEL)
The startup will receive another £9.4 million to test their FlexiTanker technology which stocks electricity using a combination of thermal and compressed air storage.
Cheesecake Energy will install a set of pilot systems in a new mixed-use development in Colchester, which is being set up as a microgrid to handle local grid constraints.
The site will also have an 8MW solar farm and a central heat pump that will provide district heating to nearby residents and businesses. CEL’s system will collect surplus energy generated from solar power, which can then be used when demand is high.
“Storing energy for longer periods is vital to build a robust and secure energy system, and ensure that renewable energy is used efficiently,” said Graham Stuart, Minister for Energy Security and Net Zero.
“Fortunately the UK has a wealth of pioneering businesses that are making their mark on this industry. [The selected companies] will go on to play a role in our country’s energy security,” he added.
The £30 million funding is part of the Longer Duration Energy Storage Demonstration competition, which has awarded £69 million as part of the Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy’s £1 billion Net Zero Innovation Portfolio.

This hypersonic hydrogen jet could fly from London to New York in 90 mins,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/04/12,"
Flying across the world from Europe to Australia currently takes around 20 hours in a regular passenger jet.
But Swiss startup Destinus is looking to slash that time to just four hours — by taking jet travel to hypersonic speeds. 
Founded by Russian-born physicist and serial entrepreneur Mikhail Kokorich, Destinus is developing a prototype hydrogen-powered aircraft capable of travelling at Mach 5 and above. That’s five times the speed of sound: over 6000 kph. 
This would take you from Frankfurt to Sydney in just over four hours. London to New York? 90 minutes.  
To achieve such speeds the aircraft would travel at altitudes of over 50km, right at the upper edge of the Earth’s atmosphere, where drag is significantly lower. The hypersonic aircraft would use hydrogen-fuelled air-breathing turbojet engines for takeoff and landing, with a separate ramjet rocket engine to take it to hypersonic speeds. The startup claims the jet — essentially half rocket, half plane — would be net zero carbon, only emitting heat and water vapour. 
Destinus’ first aircraft, capable of carrying 25 passengers up to 7,500km will be ready by the end of this decade, projects Kokorich. Follow-on planes will be progressively larger, seating up to 100 passengers and beyond.
Destinus has been testing its prototype aircraft for the past couple of years, announcing successful test flights of its second prototype — Eiger — at an airport near Munich last year.

The company also recently received its share of two grants worth €27m from the Spanish Ministry of Science. The first grant (€12m) will help fund the development of a hydrogen engine test facility near Madrid, which will house the startup’s prototype aircraft. The second (€15m) will fund research into liquid hydrogen-powered propulsion systems. 
“We are delighted to have been awarded these grants, especially because they are a clear sign that Destinus is aligned with the strategic lines of Spain and Europe to advance hydrogen flight,” said Davide Bonetti, VP Business Development and Products for Destinus.
“For deep tech companies like us, access to these EU recovery funds is essential to carry out advanced research and accelerate the innovation needed to be competitive on a global scale. With these grants, hydrogen-based solutions for aeronautical mobility will be one step closer to becoming a reality.”  
The project is part of Spain’s push to be at the forefront of developing and producing hydrogen-based mobility in a number of sectors. 
But don’t start planning your holiday just yet.   
Hydrogen-powered aircraft are still very much in their infancy, and have been plagued by issues from the outset. Liquid hydrogen is four times lighter than jet fuel, meaning it requires four times the storage capacity on board, and big fuel tanks to match. 
It is also currently 20 times more expensive than jet fuel, and is unlikely to become price competitive this decade. Moreover, international airports will need to build hydrogen infrastructure from scratch to accommodate the new aircraft — an effort they aren’t likely to undertake without guaranteed returns.  
And things get even more complicated when taking these aircraft to hypersonic speeds. While we have travelled at hypersonic speeds before — the most recent being NASA’s test flight of the X-43 experimental unmanned hypersonic aircraft in 2004, which managed to reach a mindblowing Mach 9.6 — commercially viable hypersonic travel is still a long way off. There’s a lot that physicists don’t understand, particularly how to build a plane capable of withstanding the extreme heat.
While this is definitely a big reality check, it hasn’t necessarily deterred investors. VCs are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into hypersonic startups such as Hermeus and Venice Aerospace. Airlines are also hopping on the superspeed bandwagon: last year, American Airlines committed to purchasing 20 Overture Jets, developed by US startup Boom Supersonic.  
Researchers are also hard at work ironing out some of the technical hurdles. Scientists at the RMIT University in Melbourne recently developed 3D printed catalysts which they say can power hypersonic flight and act as a cooling agent to combat the extreme heat produced by hypersonic flight.

Scientists renew calls to rejoin EU’s Horizon after UK unveils backup,Thomas Macaulay,2023/04/11,"
The UK’s proposed alternative to the EU’s Horizon research programme has failed to sway support for the bloc’s funding scheme.
Named Pioneer, the programme provides a backup plan in case the UK doesn’t rejoin Horizon. A recent trade agreement for Northern Ireland had opened the door to reentering the EU scheme, but negotiations over Horizon’s terms have stalled. Pioneer will be activated if a deal is not agreed upon.
“We hope our negotiations will be successful, and that is our preference, but it must be on the right terms,” said Michelle Donelan, Britain’s minister for science and technology. “We must ensure we have an ambitious alternative ready to go should we need it and that our businesses and researchers have fed into it.”
The British government has pledged to provide £14.6bn (€16.6bn) for Pioneer — the same amount as it would have paid to associate with Horizon from 2021 to 2027. But critics warn that financial parity will not equate to equal benefits.
“The government must also remember there is more at stake here than money,” said Tony McBride, Director of Policy and Public Affairs at the Institute of Physics. “Should it be needed, any alternative to Horizon must also make up for the loss of the established networks, partnerships, and infrastructure the UK has benefitted from over many, many years, as well as for the disruption and uncertainty caused by these years of delay.”
As well as providing a big funding pot, Horizon spurs collaboration. The €95.5bn scheme invests in projects spanning different institutions across multiple countries. It also provides common rules and funding cycles that foster international partnerships. Any domestic programme would struggle to match the impact of the pan-European ecosystem.
Cancer research, for instance, has benefitted from the program’s networks and frameworks — as well as its grants.
“No one can beat cancer alone, and Horizon Europe offers a ready-made structure for scientists to bid for funding to tackle global problems,” said Dr Owen Jackson, Director of Policy at Cancer Research UK. “UK-based cancer scientists are in a strong position to win funding from Horizon Europe and the EU’s Cancer Mission. But they will be at the margins, rather than at the centre, of these important opportunities if we don’t get association over the line.”


“Many elements of Pioneer would be valuable additions.


In a 50-page prospectus for Pioneer, the British government highlighted the potential advantages of its “Plan B.” Notably, the proposals promise to build on UK strengths and develop new capabilities, while distributing resources and support across the country. 
Despite their support for Horizon, many UK-based researchers have welcomed aspects of Pioneer. Yet they emphasise that some proposals could be used alongside the EU programme.
“Many elements of Pioneer would also be valuable additions on top of the opportunities provided by Horizon and current UK programmes,” said Dr Andrew Clark, Executive Director of Programmes at the Royal Academy of Engineering. “We hope that the government will seriously consider investing in those aspects of Pioneer once association with Horizon has been confirmed.”
Clark’s sentiment was echoed by Professor Paul Boyle, Chair of the Universities UK Research and Innovation Policy Network.
“This should not be viewed as an either-or scenario,” he said. “Strengthening our links with Europe and beyond through Horizon can sit alongside a roll-out of elements of the Government’s alternative plans, giving the UK the best opportunity to cement our status as a science superpower.”
Clark’s hopes are not forlorn. The agreement on Northern Ireland and the conciliatory gestures in Horizon talks have renewed optimism that a deal will be made. After all, both sides agree on the most important term: associating the UK with Horizon can be mutually beneficial.

Climate startup will help decarbonise construction in Luxembourg,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/04/11,"
Cambridge-based climate startup Levidian is expanding its operations to the EU. The company is bringing its next-gen decarbonisation device targeting methane emissions — the second biggest contributor to climate change after carbon dioxide — to Luxembourg.
Using a proprietary low-temperature, low-pressure method with no additives, the so-called LOOP device breaks down and converts methane into its component atoms: hydrogen and carbon, which is stripped in the form of wonder material graphene — the thinnest and strongest material ever discovered.
Luxembourg-based construction company Stugalux will use LOOP to process biomethane gas produced from food and agricultural waste. The resulting hydrogen will power an electricity-generating turbine, while graphene will be integrated into Stugalux’s building products.
“[This] is a fantastic example of how a LOOP system can be used to decarbonise in three ways simultaneously [and] an incredible way to demonstrate the circularity of LOOP contributing to a cleaner economy,” said John Hartley, CEO of Levidian.
LOOP’s threefold decarbonising impact translates into some impressive numbers, according to Stugalux’s owner Joel Schons.
“Together, the three LOOP systems will process nearly 250,000 cubic meters of waste gas per year, producing more than 30 tonnes of graphene, and preventing 572 tonnes of CO2e every year,” he said.
Stugalux will initially deploy a LOOP20 on-site, meaning a device capable of removing approximately 20 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per year. By 2025, it hopes to have installed two LOOP100 systems, to scale up decarbonisation.
Levidian deployed its very first LOOP device in late 2022. In collaboration with Eco Group, the startup installed a LOOP10 system in southern Scotland, with future plans for over 60 LOOP1000 units within the next five years.

The rise of Europe’s drone sector sees new jobs taking off,Elaine Burke,2023/04/11,"
There was plenty of excitement late last year when Alphabet, Google’s parent company, announced a European testbed for its drone delivery subsidiary, Wing.
Wing’s delivery drone network is already being tested at scale in Australia and, last October, a small suburb of Dublin was selected for its first trials in the EU.
It signalled a vote of confidence from the Big Tech giant for the region’s drone ecosystem, with a spokesperson from Wing citing “the progress on drone regulations” in the EU as a reason for moving forward with tests there.
Ireland has already served as a successful launchpad for drone delivery startup Manna, which is now starting trials in the US, and there are many more drone startups taking off across Europe.
UK company Skyports plans to expand its drone delivery service across Europe and beyond, and recently opened offices in South Korea. Germany-based Wingcopter is currently looking into how hydrogen might power its fleet of delivery drones.
The drone industry isn’t just about delivery, either. Proveye, another Irish company, is advancing drone-based image processing for use in agriculture.
Swedish company Skyqraft uses a system of drones and AI to conduct power line inspections. Dutch startup Fusion Engineering develops flight controls for commercial drones. France-headquartered IVA Drones is spearheading the new business category of drones-as-a-service, offering businesses a way to book drones for any mission they might have for them.
Drones are in the entertainment business too, with companies such as Dronisos, also based in France, choreographing drone flights for dazzling light shows, and many more specialist operators working on film sets and photoshoots.
Putting drones to work
Also known as uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) or uncrewed aircraft systems (UASs), businesses are finding many uses for drones in their work.
While a prime opportunity has been identified in last-mile delivery services, this has proven a tough course to chart. Even a major player such as Amazon, which has spent many years trying to get its Prime Air project off the ground, has hit upon challenges that have set its plans back time and time again.
While this segment of the drone industry has experienced its rises and falls, there are other implementations of this technology making steady progress.
Drone photography and video capture is not only being used by creatives, but also in the industrial sector where the vantage point only drones can offer proves useful.
Drones give visibility to towering structures with minimal safety risk for the workers tasked with maintaining them. When combined with computer vision technology, they can be of further assistance in detection and monitoring.
Jobs in the drone industry
The industry rising up around drone technology means new jobs are being created in this sector.
First and foremost, companies who want to put drones to work need people who can fly them, such as drone operators and pilots.
Mechanical engineers are needed in the build and manufacturing stage, while drone technicians and mechanics are also required to ensure entire fleets are kept up to spec and flight-ready.
Photographers and videographers who have mastered the art of flying a drone while capturing stunning, steady visuals can find work in the creative sector or even provide a feed of stock footage and images for the industry.
Purpose-built drones also require purpose-built software, opening up a new category of software development. Autonomous drones in particular present a challenge for programmers, making use of AI for navigation and route-mapping.
And, as this is still an emerging tech space, companies going deep into the research and development of drones are hiring flight sciences teams to help understand, inspect, and improve aerodynamics, propulsion, performance, stability, and flight controls.
This is where specialists from the aviation industry can pivot to a career the drone sector, where their experience and skills come at a premium.
Getting on board
For those who have more than a fleeting interest in drones, a good place to start would be to invest in a craft and familiarise yourself with local regulations, such as height limits and geographic restrictions. If it’s a drone equipped with a camera or sensor, you’ll need to be extra careful in terms of data collection rules, and always be careful not to trespass on private property.
To fly it, you must register as a drone operator and pass a drone pilot exam. This can be completed following online training with your national aviation authority.

Digital twins could save your life. Here’s how,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/04/7,"
Digital twins — virtual replicas of real-world things — are already commonplace in manufacturing, industry, and aerospace. There are highly complex digital models of cities, ports, and power stations — but what about people? 
The idea of digital doppelgängers has long been confined to the realm of science fiction. But a new book presented at London’s Science Museum last week suggests the concept could be coming to life.  
In Virtual You, Peter Coveney, professor of chemistry and computer science at University College London, and Roger Highfield, science director at London’s Science Museum, show how far researchers have already got in their quest for accurate digital simulations of people. 
At the book launch, the authors were joined by leading experts in healthcare digital twins from the University of Oxford, UCL, and the Barcelona Supercomputing Centre (BSC). The panel discussed the opportunities and challenges in creating a digital twin version of the human body, and its implications for medicine.  
The BSC has already created virtual models of living cells and whole organs. The most notable example is Alya Red, a digital twin of a heart comprising around 100 million virtual cells. 
The heart beats not within a person but inside MareNostrum, one of the most powerful supercomputers in Europe. Working with the medical technology company Medtronic, the Alya Red simulations can help position a pacemaker, fine-tune its electrical stimulus, and model its effects.

Perhaps one of the most striking examples is Yoon-sun, a 26-year-old Korean woman whose entire circulation — a 95,000km-long network of vessels — has been mapped virtually through an international collaboration using several supercomputers. Researchers are using the model to study blood pressure and the movement of clots throughout the vascular system.
In silico 
These digital twins are not just confined to the lab. Several are already in use and, in some cases, approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
So far, these models have been deployed mainly for in silico trials — when a drug or disease is tested virtually rather than on real human or animal tissue. 
These trials allow companies to test their drug in ‘virtual patients’ before testing them in humans. This can help companies detect a “failure in the making” early on in the drug development cycle, says François-Henri Boissel, CEO of French clinical trial simulation platform Novadiscovery. This can result in significant time and cost savings for companies undertaking clinical trials. 
In silico trials also eliminate the ethical issues associated with animal testing, explained Blanca Rodriguez, professor of computational medicine at the University of Oxford, during the panel discussion last Wednesday. 
Rodriguez’s team has created a digital twin of a heart that is used to simulate the effects of different drugs and diseases on heart function. In one virtual trial, her team tested the effects of 66 different drugs on over a thousand different heart cell simulations, and were able to predict the risk of abnormal heart rhythms with 89% accuracy. Comparable research on animals was 75% accurate.  
These trials can also help fight the next public health emergency. During the COVID-19 pandemic, supercomputers were used to simulate nearly everything, from potential treatments to predicting how the virus might spread, as highlighted in the video below.     

 
And as simulations of human tissues, organs, and cells become ever more sophisticated, they could open new frontiers for testing of vaccines, personalised treatment of symptoms, and help doctors to explore the effects of an infection on the entire body.
Digital twins could also expedite the search for candidate vaccines for the big families of animal viruses that are at risk of spilling over to the human population, said Highfield.  
Coveney and Highfield believe that these advances are laying the groundwork for digital twins of the entire human body.
Virtual you
Computational models of patients would not only look like their human counterparts but behave like them too.  
Creating a virtual you requires the collection and analysis of enough personal data to provide a realistic representation. This could come from any number of scans of your body and its organs, as well as genomic, biochemical analysis, and wearable devices.  
“These digital twins can inform what action a surgeon takes, what drug you get prescribed, or even what kind of life you choose to live,” said Coveney.   
Your physician could run a number of scenarios through your digital twin — how you might respond to a certain drug or disease, for instance — without ever touching you (if you hate visits to the doctor, take note).  


 “Virtual patients could potentially save and extend your life. 

 
Your digital twin could accurately predict your risk of disease and recommend drug, diet, and lifestyle changes, potentially saving, and extending, your life.  
According to the European Commission, around 200,000 people die each year in Europe from drugs prescribed to them, partly because these therapies are generic and not designedspecifically for the patient.
The same goes for treatment of disease: doctors are forced to make decisions based upon similar but non-identical patients in similar but non-identical circumstances in the past. 
“Modern medicine is like driving a car while looking in the rearview mirror — it’s always looking back to try to figure out what is happening now,” said Highfield. “The hope is that digital twins will enable healthcare to become forward-looking, truly personalised, and predictive, removing much of the guesswork.”
Perhaps less consoling is the idea that your twin could be used to predict when you will die, to a fairly high degree of accuracy.
Moving on.        
So, when will I get a virtual me? 
Before you get too excited (or petrified) — let’s do a quick stock take.
Oxford University professor, Denis Noble, developed the first model of a beating heart cell in 1959. A few years later his work was scaled up to the level of patches of cells, and by the 1990s models of the whole heart, powered by the earliest supercomputers, began to take shape. Now, programmes like Alya Red are enabling simulations of almost any part of the human body. 
That’s the point where we find ourselves right now. To date, a digital twin of a whole human has never been created.
We asked Midjourney’s AI bot to create an image of a ‘healthcare digital twin’ — here’s what it came up with.
There are still “massive technical hurdles” to overcome, said Conveney. 
Simulations of this complexity will require access to incredibly powerful computers, such as Frontier, the world’s first and fastest exascale supercomputer. These computers are still few and far between, and require large amounts of energy to run. 
Another “huge challenge”, he says, is stitching together all the codes for each part of the virtual body. Each part of the digital human, like a cell or a heart, is technically a separate simulation. There are also multiple scales for the simulations: one model for a cell and another for the whole organ require different codes and run at different speeds. Getting all of these codes to load at once and at the same speed is no easy feat. 
There are also ethical considerations. The ability to predict almost anything about your health is a powerful tool for healthcare professionals, but potentially dangerous in the wrong hands.  
Within the limits of current technology, creating your own virtual twin right now is only be within the reach of billionaires, says Conveney.  
Even the most powerful computers conceivable in the distant future will not have sufficient capacity to analyse you in full molecular detail. You, my friend, are too complicated, even for the smartest computer.
But Coveney and Highfield do make a convincing case that incomplete digital representations will still be an extremely useful tool for advancing medical science and individuals’ health. As the late British statistician George Box opined, “All models are wrong. Some are useful.” 
The authors are also hopeful that the computing requirements of these twins can be reduced using, you guessed it, artificial intelligence. 
“AI and machine learning can replicate some of the code and enable the whole digital twin to load at the kind of speeds needed for effective medical decision making,” said Highfield. AI could enable virtual humans to be run on much smaller machines. 
While there are many hurdles to overcome, and definitely some ethical issues to iron out, fully functioning virtual patients, that offer healthcare professionals insights they can actually act on, are not as far off as you might think. 
Conveney, one of the foremost global experts on the topic, believes virtual patients could be available for practical medical uses in about five years’ time.

Mammoth meatball beef exposes foodtech’s patent problem,Thomas Macaulay,2023/04/6,"
A bitter feud has erupted over who first resurrected the woolly mammoth — as a meatball.
The de-extinct delicacy was unveiled last week at Nemo Science Museum in the Netherlands. Naturally, no mammoths were harmed in the making of this product — and nor were any other animals. In lieu of dead flesh, an Australian startup called Vow produced the meatball from DNA.
First, the team identified the DNA sequence for mammoth myoglobin, a protein that creates a meaty taste. To fill in some gaps in the sequence, they added genetic data from the African elephant — the pachyderm’s closest living relative. Using a low-current and high-voltage charge, they then inserted the gene into stem cells from a sheep. Finally, they multiplied and moulded the cells into a pasty.

It certainly looks the part, but did it pass the taste test? It seems an essential question, but it’s sadly one that remains unanswered. To the disappointment of daring diners, the meatball isn’t ready for human consumption.
That anticlimactic outcome sparked accusations that the whole endeavour was a publicity stunt. But the project team insists that their experiment serves an important purpose: showcasing cultivated meat’s potential to transform the food industry. They note that food production creates copious greenhouse gases and biodiversity loss. Cultivated meat, they argue, offers a sustainable alternative.
“Our aim is to start a conversation about how we eat, and what the future alternatives can look and taste like,” said Bas Korsten, a marketing executive who initiated the project. “Cultured meat is meat, but not as we know it. It’s the future.”
The meatball was created as a launchpad for the tech — and for Vow. With apparent justification, the company now claims it’s rewriting the rules of food. But a rival claims it’s also rewriting the rules of decency.

As Vow was being lauded in the Netherlands, a very different reaction was brewing across the border.
In Belgium, a scaleup called Paleo was considering legal action. The company was enraged by claims that Vow had showcased a mammoth protein for the first time.
Paleo argues that it developed the myoglobin tech two years earlier. The company had also filed patent applications at that time, which Paleo says have been publically available to competitors for almost a year.
Paleo contacted Vow before the event in the Netherlands. According to the Belgian scaleup, Vow’s legal team argued that the mammoth meatball “was not food” and dismissed Paleo’s claims.
“When we learned about the event, we were surprised,” said Hermes Sanctorum, CEO of Paleo. “We sent out a press release nine months ago to announce that we developed the exact same mammoth protein (myoglobin), based on our fundamental research and innovation.
“When Vow claim that no one has tasted mammoth myoglobin, this is simply not true. We developed the mammoth myoglobin and we tasted it in our lab.”

Vow has dismissed the allegations.
“The technology and innovation involved in Vow’s creation and presentation of the ‘mammoth meatball’ owes nothing to any technology or alleged invention by Paleo,” the company said in a statement.
“The ‘mammoth meatball’ was conceived, developed and created entirely by the hard work and ingenuity of Vow’s own scientists (and collaborators) and using a combination of publicly available genetic data and Vow’s own proprietary production processes.”
Paleo expressed some satisfaction with the response. The company said Vow had confirmed that it had not, in fact, showcased mammoth myoglobin for the first time. Nonetheless, Paleo feels that Vow crossed a red line — but the patents could prove difficult to enforce.

According to Vow, it has only been accused of adopting the idea of creating something with mammoth myoglobin. Vow argues that Paleo has no basis to claim that idea as its own. 
In addition, the startup notes that an examiner at the European Patent Office deemed Paleo’s patent application was likely invalid.  The Australian company described the application as an “attempted landgrab of outrageous proportions.”
“Patent rights exist in order to protect innovation and can (if granted and valid) protect truly new, innovative and proprietary ideas; but Paleo do not have any such patent rights,” Vow said in its statement. “Paleo has no granted patent in relation to mammoth myoglobin and therefore has no legitimate claim.”
Vow also criticised the pending application. If granted, the startup warned that the patent would prevent companies from using myoglobin from a wide range of animals — including pig, sheep, cow, chicken, tuna, and, of course, mammoth — as a meat substitute or food ingredient.
The feud will rumble on for now. Regardless of the outcome, the dispute has exposed the complexities of patenting food innovations.

Meet the finalists of the TNW València startup pitch battle,Thomas Macaulay,2023/04/2,"
Some of Europe’s hottest startups arrived at TNW València last week to develop ideas, expand networks, create new leads, and — and most importantly of all — fight.
Not in the physical sense, of course, but in a fiercely-contested TNW València pitch battle. After surviving a series of fiery knockout clashes, eight of Europe’s most electrifying startups were selected for the contest final on Friday.
València provided the perfect stage for the showdown. The region is Spain’s fastest-growing entrepreneurial ecosystem, with the most startups per capita in the country.  It was also bathed in glorious sunshine — but this was no vacation for the contenders. With thousands in attendance, an all-star jury on the front row, and a springboard to success on the line, the stakes were high for all the startups.
To the victor goes an array of spoils, including a 4 square-meter turnkey booth at TNW Valencia 2024 and two business passes for TNW Conference in Amsterdam on June 15-16. But best of all the prizes — and I say this without a scintilla of bias — is a full feature on TNW’s wonderful website by our marvellous media team.
Before we reveal the winner, here are the eight elite finalists who pitched for first place.
Internxt

Many of today’s biggest internet companies are essentially data mining companies. Google, for instance, generates over 80% of its revenue from advertising, which it amasses by leveraging user data for ad targeting.
Internxt has created an alternative model: data storage that respects user privacy.
The València-based startup provides an end-to-end encrypted cloud storage service, which means nobody can see your files. Founded in 2020, the company has positioned itself as a privacy-centric competitor to Google Drive.
“We provide an easy way to manage, share, and store user data in a completely private way,” says Joan Mora, head of data and analytics at Internxt.
Users can get 10GB of free storage. If they need more, premium subscriptions that provide from 20GB to 2TB are available for as little as low as €0.89 per month.
Sophie’s Bionutrients

Sophie’s Bionutrients has reimagined protein production. It’s the first company in the world that uses microalgae to develop 100% plant-based and sustainable alternative protein.
The microalgae is cultivated inside bio-reactors and harvested within days. This rapid process also minimizes the quantity of energy and water that’s required.
Both the idea and name for the company came from the daughter of Eugene Wang, the co-founder and CEO of Sophie’s Nutrients.
“Sophie is allergic to shellfish,” says Wang. “That’s how the whole thing started — I was looking for a way for people to get nutrition from the ocean without using the animals.”
The startup began life in Singapore, before moving its headquarters to the alt-protein hotspot “Food Valley” in the Netherlands. Wang now plans to take the product around the world, in a B2B business model that will first target small and medium-sized food manufacturers.
CAPS
CAPS wants to make urban flights a daily routine. Credit: CAPS
CAPS is developing a product that seems futuristic: an urban aircraft for single passengers. Yet the company expects the tech will soon be available to the public.
“My strong belief is that you will be experimenting with flights in urban areas within the next 10 years,” says Paul Cass, CEO of CAPS. “For that to properly be done, it has to be quiet, safe, and affordable.”
The startup’s founders got the idea after growing sick of their long commute to college. In a garage, they began to assemble a more convenient alternative: a flying car.
Their concept evolved into a driverless aircraft for single-passenger trips in urban areas. Both small and entirely-electric, the vehicle is built for a quiet flight with optimum security. In case of technical trouble or emergencies, a professional driver in the company’s operating centre can remotely control the aircraft.
CAPS  is confident that the design offers the safety, affordability, and practicality needed for mass adoption. With the world’s electric air taxi network scheduled to launch in 2024, the vision could be closer to reality than it first appears.
Wenalyze

Wenalyze is on a mission to protect SMEs, which represent 99% of all businesses in the EU.
In tricky economic times, these companies face mounting challenges. Insurers can provide a safety net, but bad information is reducing the security. According to Wenalyze, insurance companies have 47% of their data wrong, leading to underinsurance and premium leakage.
The Spanish startup wants to reduce the risks. The company uses open data analytics to correct, update, and enrich SME information. As a result, insurers, banks, and financial institutions can offer their clients the right coverage.
To access the enhanced insights, users only need to enter the name and address of the SME. Wenalyze’s system will then analyse open data sources and deliver real-time results.
“By protecting SMEs, we protect our economy,” says Carlos Albo, CEO and co-founder of Wenalyze.
Therminer

Amid a global energy crisis, the vast electricity consumption of data centres has become a pressing concern. But even greater harm to our climate comes from heating, which comprises half of the world’s total energy consumption. That’s roughly the same imapct as electricity and transportation combined.
Therminer has created a system that addresses both concerns: a cooling solution for servers that reduces their energy consumption and recycles the wasted heat to warm buildings.
According to Gonzalo García, CEO and co-founder of Therminer, the system cuts 95% of the energy consumed to cool servers — and recycles 90% of the heat they release. “Our competitive advantage from the data centre perspective is that we can reduce operational costs and our data centres are more sustainable,” he says.
From its base in València, Therminer produce the hardware, installs it in homes, and manages the data centre services. The initial target for the system is single-family homes.
“They can use our waste heat and we can create a decentralised network of data centres and then sell hosting power,” says García.
Chaise Longue
Affordable comfort is an elusive pleasure on flights. Credit: Chaise Longue
Flying economy is rarely a pleasurable experience, but Chaise Longue believes comfort doesn’t have to cost a fortune — and has the chair to prove it.
The Madrid-based startup has created a double-decker airplane seat configuration. The design increases comfort, reduces cabin weight, and provides at least the same passenger capacity. Best of all, it’s made for economy class.
The extra space comes from maximising the cabin’s verticle volume. Overhead luggage compartments are removed, with bags instead stored in bays under seats. The result is bigger recline angles, extended leg room, and more overall space.
The modular structure is designed for swift integration into existing aircraft. According to Alejandro Núñez, Chaise Longue’s founder, CEO, and designer, most leading airlines are interested in the system — and planes are just the start.
“We are also moving into other industries such as trains, buses, and ferries — for the lowest class and for the cheapest tickets,” says Núñez. “We are trying to improve that experience for everyone.”
Nightstream

Twitch enjoyed explosive growth during the pandemic, and still consistently doubles its pre-COVID audience numbers. Many advertisers, however, remain wary of entering the market, which can appear too large and complicated. Nightstream wants to help these brands to grow alongside smaller streamers.
The startup found that brands currently use just 250 streamers to advertise. That means that oer 1.5 million daily viewers — and 95% of streamers — are being overlooked. Nightstream’s software is designed to capitalise on these opportunities.
The company’s tools and services allow brands to connect with streamers that will reach their target audience. Streamers, meanwhile, get the chance to build their audiences, earn money, and win prizes.
Brands are given data dashboards and analytic tools to analyse the performance of each player in the ecosystems. Nighstream also picks moderators for each streamer and brand, which further strengthens the partnership. To increase the streamers’ audiences, the startup rewards viewers as they become part of the communities.
“With our API and software, they can develop and connect directly with brands that don’t have enough money to connect with the biggest streamers,” says Luis Ruiz Climent, co-founder of Nightwatch.
Crowmie

Crowmie has invented a unique approach to sustainability: the first investment platform in tokenised renewable energy projects.
The concept aims to turbocharge the adoption of renewable energy, while democratising investment in the sector. At present, the vast majority of the market is controlled by large energy generators, which are financed by the traditional banking system. Crowmie allows the public to make their own contributions — and get returns.
After registering, the user can invest a minimum of just €100 in any asset on the platform. The user receives tokens in return. These entitle them to monthly rents for the electricity generated and sold by the energy project. Users can also sell the tokens to another investor at any time.
The investment is used to build facilities that produce electricity. Once built, the projects generate renewable electricity that’s sold to the grid. Profits from this sale are distributed among investors according to the number of tokens they hold.
“We have completely changed the way of investing in traditional assets, accelerating the energy transition, supporting the business fabric, and allowing anyone in the world to invest from just 100 euros,” says Fernando Dávila, CEO and co-founder of Crowmie.

The conversations covered everything from funding secrets to sector spotlights, across keynote speeches, startup battles, panel discussions, workshops, fireside chats, and much more. Too much in fact to attend it all  — but don’t worry, we’ve got you covered. Read on for a few highlights.
MC Oison Lunny speaks to a packed audience at the Impact Stage on Day 1 of TNW València
Our MC for the event, the award-winning Oison Lunny, kicked things off with a call for connections across València’s tech sector. “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. If you want to go fast AND far, go as part of an ecosystem,” he said. 


 “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. If you want to go fast AND far, go as part of an ecosystem. 

   
After the opening speech, a battle ensued between Valencia’s most promising startups. There were some seriously impressive pitches, and the winners will now face-off at the finals tomorrow.   
The winners from today’s startup battles will go head-to-head at the finals tomorrow.
The role of ecosystems was a recurring theme on day one. Phill Robinson, the CEO of Boardwave, explained how Europe can replicate Silicon Valley’s famous network effects, while Erwin Verstraelen, digital chief at the Port of Antwerp-Bruges, divulged why he founded ‘The Beacon’, an IOT ecosystem of startups, scaleups, and researchers, to boost innovation.
Many of the startups in attendance harbour plans for global expansion, but the conference speakers stressed that they need local roots. At a talk titled, “Going global: a VC’s guide to preparing for international investment,”  Vanessa Palmer of CaixaBank DayOne said startups need people “working on the ground in that country who understand that market.”

The balance was succinctly summarised by one of the contenders in the startup pitch battle.“Our base is in Spain, but our focus is global,” said Mario García-Granero, CEO and co-founder of Feending.
Amid the rush to innovate and grow, attendees of the event frequently expressed the importance of the tech for the good — particularly around sustainability. “We need to speed up,” said Raquel Espada, sustainability lead at Schneider Electric in Spain. We don’t have time. Climate change is happening, there’s a wildfire near here right now and it’s 30 degrees [centrigrade] in March.” 
No doubt one of the most inspiring moments of the day came when endurance athlete and Barcelona ambassador Alex Roca took to the stage to share his unique perspective on persevering against the odds.

Once predominantly known for IKEA, Ericsson, and Volvo, in the past decade, Sweden has emerged as one the most valued tech ecosystems in Europe, with Stockholm ranking as the fifth top performer in 2021.
The success of Swedish startups such as Tink and Spotify has turned the capital city into a world-renowned tech hub, attracting the attention of international investors — and for good reason.
Stockholm is home to nearly 3,000 startups and scaleups, and counts 208 VC investors and 101,000 tech employees.
The city has also bred more tech unicorns per capita than any other region in the world except for Silicon Valley — that is, 0.8 per 100,000 inhabitants. Some of those unicorns include the buy-now-pay-later fintech firm Klarna, lithium-ion battery developer Northvolt, and e-mobility provider Voi.
Stockholm’s fertile landscape reflects Sweden’s overall growth in the tech sector. Last year alone, the Nordic nation not only retained its place as the EU’s best-performing innovation leader, but also emerged as Europe’s fourth top ranking country in VC funding per capita, reaching $540 (€504).
To get a closer look at the city’s thriving ecosystem, we’re zooming in on six trailblazing local startups and scaleups.
Let’s dive in.
Exeger
Founded in 2009 by Giovanni Fili, the Swedish deeptech scaleup has developed a unique solar cell, Powerfoyle, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing devices and convert all forms of light to virtually endless energy.
Unlike typical solar cells, Powerfoyle is a silicon-free technology, and thanks to a special dye, it absorbs indoor and outdoor light through a process called artificial photosynthesis.

For Fili, who has a multi-year background in entrepreneurship and the commercialisation of high-tech innovations, looking into the everyday applications of solar power was a natural step.
“We realised after a few years that this had a huge potential because we can screen print this solar cell, which allows a free-form design with different shapes, colors, and textures,” Fili tells me.
Now, 14 years later, Exeger has raised over €180 million across 12 funding rounds, counts more than 200 employees, and owns two solar-cell factories in Stockholm.
Currently, the Powerfoyle is integrated into a range of products, from bike helmets and remotes to headphones such as the Urbanista Los Angeles, the Urbanista Phoenix, and the Adidas RPT-02 Sol.

According to Fili, it’s all about providing consumers with energy independence, while also increasing product sustainability and reducing battery or cable waste.
For Exeger, Powerfoyle’s flexibility and customisable nature means the sky is the limit. The company recently secured a partnership with SES-imagotag to provide an alternative source of power to the electronic labels and IoT devices the company supplies to retailers. The scaleup envisions further applications for its technology in consumer electronics, IoT, and smart workplaces.
Sesamy
Sesamy was co-founded in 2021 by Måns Ulvestam, Karl Rosander, and Markus Ahlstrand — the same trio that founded Acast, the global podcast giant.
Sesamy also operates in the digital media realm, but with a focus on news and magazine content. The company targets publishers who want to offer their readers an option to purchase a single article as a complement to subscriptions.
“Our mission is to enable people to actually pay for good quality journalism, while helping publishers increase their incremental revenue,” Ulvestam tells me. And based on the company’s data, consumers are willing to pay on average €2 per article.
In case a reader purchases three or four articles from the same outlet, Sesamy’s Smart Software can identify whether it would cost them less to become a subscriber and prompts them accordingly, driving further engagement. “Some of the data we have so far are very encouraging; 5.5% of the readers buying a single-purchase article then become subscribers,” Ulvestam notes.

The startup counts eight publisher partners so far, boasting three big Swedish outlets: Breakit, Kvartal, and Nyheter24. Currently, Sweden is the company’s focus market, being “at the forefront when it comes to thinking about how to monetize news,” co-founder Karl Rosander says. Nevertheless, Sesamy is looking into expanding into other European countries as well.
Sesamy’s current business focus is to engage with as many outlets as possible in order to collect enough data on publisher revenue and consumer behaviour and thereby further develop its software — and, in time, for instance, suggest dynamic pricing based on the articles’ length, exclusivity, etc.
Apart from the pay-per-article option, the startup’s software platform offers various interchangeable web components including the integration of services such as payment methods, third-party webhooks, and social media login.
In November, Sesamy raised €3.3 million during its second seed round, bring its total to €7.3 million.
X Shore
The award-winning electric boat manufacturer aims to facilitate the transition to maritime emobility by combining Scandinavian design with technology, innovation, and sustainability.
The startup was founded in 2016 by one of Sweden’s best-known entrepreneurs, Konrad Bergström, but has been reinvented since 2019, when Jenny Keisu took over as CEO.

For Keisu, who has an extensive background in business law and impact investing, achieving price parity with fossil fuel-powered boats while offering high-performance vessels is key to the industry’s net-zero transition. And that’s what X Shore set out to do.
In September 2022, the company launched its second model, the X Shore 1, following the release of its first commercial boat, the Eelex 8000, in 2020. Both models come with a modular design for increased functionality and can be configured with various layouts that accommodate activities from fishing and diving to watersports and socialising — thus reducing the need for multiple boat ownership.
X Shore’s vessels also feature smart boating capabilities, including overboard detection, navigation, and range estimate. This is combined with a respective app and a special captain’s watch — a smart watch which can be used as a remote key to unlock the boat and  as a “person over board” detector. 
The Eelex 8000 is powered by a 170kW electric motor, comes with a 100NM range, and can reach a 30+ knot top speed. Credit: X Shore
Compared to the Eelex 8000, which costs a little over €300,000, the X Shore 1’s price starts at €99,000 — the average cost of a vessel in its category. “Within 48 hours after its launch, we sold out all boats that we could produce in the first half of this year, and we’re also sold out for 2023,” Keisu explains.
The X Shore 1 is powered by a 125kW electric motor, comes with a 50NM range, and can reach a 30 knot top speed. Creidit: X shore
Driving down the price enough to engage with a larger customer base — while maintaining sustainability — was the result of two factors: an EV-oriented design from the outset and in-house production.
The startup manufactures the hull and does the assembly using largely automated processes at its factory in the city of Nyköping, which leaves only the battery and electrical components to be sourced overseas.
X Shore sells its boats in Europe and North America, which currently represents its bigger market. For operators of multiple vessels, it also offers a Fleet Management System for connected X Shore boats. The startup raised almost €50 million in its latest funding round.
Alight
Alight is a leading Nordic provider of solar power-as-a-service, co-founded in 2013 by Dr Harald Overholm, Richard Nicolin, and Wilhelm Lowenhielm. The scaleup develops, owns, and operates solar projects for businesses that want to switch to renewable energy.
Alight helps companies cover their energy needs either with offsite installations in the form of solar farms, or with onsite installations of panels on rooftops, parking lots, or unused land. The scaleup provides energy through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) — fixed term contracts at a pre-negotiated price lasting between 10 and 20 years.
The company’s decision to focus on commercial solar stems from two reasons, according to co-founder and CEO Dr Harald Overholm. First comes the fact that 70% of power worldwide is used by companies. Second, the trio was inspired by the US market, where solar-as-a-service first got traction in the commercial and industrial segment, and shortly after in the residential.

“We had some sort of base hypothesis that commercial solar was a pretty good place to start,” Overholm says. “And we think that the European market is now moving very quickly towards us because government incentives are being rapidly scaled down.”
Alight is developing more than 1 gigawatt (GW) worth of PPA-based projects across Sweden, with a further 170 megawatts (MW) under development across the rest of Europe. It also handles Sweden’s largest operational solar park to date, and is set to have an installed capacity of at least 5GW by 2030. Some of its clients include Toyota, Swedbank, and trading company Bixia.

But the road to success has been no bed of roses.
“People could not understand why we started the company when we did so,” Overholm explains. “And it was also horribly difficult to find investors,” he adds, citing a lack of interest in impact and sustainability projects at the time.
“So when, in 2022, we raised €150 million in equity, with an additional €20 million to €30 million coming in [from] buying out secondaries from previous investors, it was insane.”
Prior to that the company had done two funding rounds — following an initial angel capital injection — raising €2 million in 2015 and €5 million to €6 million in 2019.
Now, Alight is also developing co-located battery storage to mitigate solar power’s intermittent nature and enable its further rollout.
Milkywire
At the age of 31, marketing veteran Nina Siemiatkowski decided to pursue photography in Kenya, where she witnessed first-hand the hurdles local organisations were facing to secure funding and resources in their efforts to address pressing environmental issues.
Siemiatkowski decided to build a company that solves this problem and founded Milkywire in 2018.
The startup provides a smarter and more efficient solution to environmental, cause-driven donation, connecting vetted impact organisations around the world with companies and individuals who want to offer support, but are unsure how to donate effectively.
‘Initially, when I founded Milkywire, the idea was to connect the platform to consumers directly,” Siemiatkowski tells me. “But a year and a half ago we completely pivoted as a business.” Since then, the startup has been implementing a B2B2C business model.

Milkywire’s platform enables companies to take responsibility for their environmental footprint and make a positive contribution by financing high-impact initiatives beyond their immediate value chain. Businesses can select organisations from five different causes, such as wildlife and climate transformation.
The platform also offers transparent and traceable reporting of the companies’ donations and impact metrics, which can be used to engage stakeholders and customers. To facilitate that, Milkyware provides integrated tools that enable customers to contribute to the same causes.
The startup currently counts numerous partner companies, including Klarna, PANGAIA, and Footway. To date, it has raised $25 million (€23.5 million) in donations.
“The timing couldn’t be better for us,” Siemiatkowski says. “There’s massive demand for sustainability solutions and, from what I know, we’re sitting with a quite unique solution.”
Doconomy
Founded in 2018 by Mathias Wikström and Johan Pihl, Doconomy has merged climate tech with fintech, and is on a mission to help banks, brands, and consumers to better understand their environmental footprint through financial transactions.
Since launching the world’s first transaction-based footprint calculator, Doconomy has been building a global ecosystem, with its technology used by Mastercard and world leading banks such as BNP Paribas and Nordea — which translates to over 850 million potential end-users across 30 countries.
Driven by the aim to inspire consumer behaviour change and encourage them into a more sustainable lifestyle, the founding duo was interested in the credit card as an everyday tool that’s connected to consumption patterns.

“We looked at how environmental data could be presented in a tool that you’re willing to use every day, and that, in the end, would motivate behavioural change,” Pihl tells me.
The result was Doconomy’s core solution, a cloud-based environmental impact index (Åland Index), which enables CO2 and H2O calculations for all digital financial transactions.
The Åland Index is complemented by a set of other digital tools, such as the Lifestyle Impact Calculator, helping individuals assess their footprint based on lifestyle choices, and the Product Impact calculator, which enables brands to calculate their products’ CO2 footprints. The startup also offers the DO mobile banking service, which allows consumers to manage their finances and everyday climate action.

Thanks to its data and the ecosystem it’s built, Doconomy has created a standardised language around how impact is measured. But using this language to drive consumer engagement and, in the end, behavioural change, remains “as tricky as ever,” co-founder Mathias Wikström says.
Doconomy is now focusing on achieving exactly this and believes that its recent acquisition of financial well-being fintech startup Dreams Technology will play an integral role in that objective.
What’s the secret to Stockholm’s success?
Stockholm has several unique and powerful ingredients that stimulate startup growth.
For Alight’s co-founder Harald Overholm, the city breeds a culture of entrepreneurship, while a strong network of entrepreneurs, mentors, and angel investors can provide guidance.
The collaboration and advice of like-minded entrepreneurs and expertswas also pointed out by Milywire’s founder, Nina Siemiatkowski, and Sesamy’s co-founder, Karl Rosander, who also added access to capital as an important element of the ecosystem.
“I think collaboration is closer at hand in Sweden than in many different markets,” Mathias Wikström, Doconomy’s co-founder and CEO, says. “There’s a strong social security network, a strong trade labour union, [and] a strong industry and trade labour union agreement dating back to the 40s and 50s. We’re not keeping our success close to our chest. We’re rather sharing it with many, I think slightly more than in other parts of the world.”
Swedish mentality plays a vital role for Johan Ekelin and Christian Ihre — co-founders of Lynxeye, a Stockholm-based strategy consultancy supporting companies in transformative shifts, which has been part of the ecosystem since 1999.

“We’re a bit of a caring nation, you could say, with a more human-centric mentality,” Ekelin tells me. “We want to find solutions to problems, and we try to democratise the offerings, and that’s good for innovation,” he notes, adding that Sweden is characterised by “a high level of social consensus.”
This, according to Ihre, stems from a simplistic survival instinct, the need to “stick together,” due to the country’s weather and climate conditions. Much like the Vikings created their own infrastructure webs and ecosystems, modern society has another kind of ecosystem, where companies, institutions, government, and people know they need each other to survive. “This has transcended our culture for millennia,” Ihre notes.
But this doesn’t mean that Sweden’s business sector is closed within itself. On the contrary, Ekelin believes that creating international brands and companies is one of its biggest strengths.
“Being a small country means that there’s a small home market, so you have to look openly for other opportunities around the world and be informed about what’s going on outside of Sweden.”

Opinion: The AI pope coat is the shape of hyperreality to come,Callum Booth,2023/03/29,"
By now, you’ll have seen it. Pope Francis walks across the frame, his focus on the mid-distance. He’s brightly lit as though it’s early morning. A silver cross hangs from his neck, dangling over his snow-white, Balenciaga-inspired puffer jacket. It’s the baller bishop, the steezy father, his holy drippiness — and he’s been ordained from on high.
If you were on social media at any point over the past weekend, you would have seen the image. And — if you were anything like me and seemingly millions of other people — you didn’t immediately realise it was AI-generated.
In history books, this will likely go down as the first time the public was fooled en-masse by an AI-generated image. But this is just the beginning, a marker of times to come.
The AI pope’s rise to prominence
The picture first reached the public in any real sense on Twitter, with this tweet in particular being widely shared:

OKAAYYY pic.twitter.com/MliHsksX7L
— leon (@skyferrori) March 25, 2023

The image itself was created by a Reddit user (interviewed by Buzzfeed here) and posted to the Midjourney subreddit on Friday, along with three other images the AI-driven picture generator created from the prompt.
Then it went haywire in that peculiarly online way; memes flowing, people sharing the image with comments like, “the pope slings pipe with a real fuccboi energy” — and, of course, individuals using Photoshop to the fullest extent of its mighty powers:

Are you wearing the… 
""papal puffer parka? yes. I am."" pic.twitter.com/59corwNlCe
— Nick (@nicktotin) March 25, 2023

It was only further through the weekend that many people who’d seen or shared the fake picture of the pope realised it was AI-generated. In some senses, it’s not hard to spot a computer is behind the image.
I’ve marked some areas where you can see tell-tale signs of an AI-generated image, from blurriness and odd textures to issues with creating hands.
The thing is, while you’re scrolling through thousands of images and videos on social media, these small details are easily missed. Let’s put it this way: if we had to sit and analyse every single image that came across our feeds, we’d never get anything done.
A mass hallucination
We’ve been getting closer and closer to an inflection point recently, much of it driven by the launch of Midjourney version five. In fact, we were close to the public believing an AI-generated image is real with pictures of Trump being arrested. Thankfully, the fact they looked clearly fake — as well as the lack of corresponding news stories about the incident — meant that the majority of people weren’t fooled at first glance.
But the AI pope changed all that.
This moment has been a long time coming — and it’s no surprise it was a celebrity or public figure that made us reach this inflection point. As journalist Ryan Broderick pointed out on Twitter, one possible explanation for this image in particular spreading like wildfire is “the pope aesthetically exists in the same uncanny valley as most AI art.” This makes bizarreness an inherent part of his public character, meaning these AI-generated images can pass our bullshit detectors easier.
I think it goes even further than that. Just consider the increasing surreality of the past several years. Picture the photo of Trump in the White House, beaming in front of piles of fast food with a sombre portrait of Abraham Lincoln behind him. Or the one of the capital riots’ shaman, a man wearing a horned hat with his face painted, cavorting around the heart of American politics.

Trump, who can't even spell hamburger, invited the Clemson Tigers to the White House and served them Wendy’s, McDonalds, and Burger King. 🍔
Now, the Trump administration is trying to blame Democrats for their poor decision: https://t.co/3cV1XcbcHd pic.twitter.com/3tYQaIOeXu
— Complex (@Complex) January 15, 2019

In retrospect, what feels more likely? The pope wearing a stylish jacket or the President of the United States serving McDonald’s in a historic reception room? It’s hard to tell, because society itself has become increasingly uncertain, truth and normality more and more abstract. 
Inching into hyperreality
The pictures of the pope with immaculate drip are broadly harmless, the worst outcome being that some people think the Catholic church and the man who once signed a Lamborghini are materialistic or money-obsessed. But if we applied the same mass belief of a fake image to something like politics, things can go downhill quickly.
AI-generated images would be bad enough in times of relative political dignity, but we’re currently living through what some refer to as a post-truth era, where many politicians and news stations simply, well, lie.
Not only is public trust in governments at historic lows, but this is made worse by an ageing population in the western world. Many older people struggle to use their phones, let alone can separate AI-generated images from truthful ones.
We are, for all intents and purposes, going further into hyperreality, a concept termed by Jean Baudrillard. This is a concept where the real and artificial merge, becoming indistinguishable from one another. It’s impacting everything, from fashion to the aesthetic of AI images themselves. 
Let’s put it in more concrete terms. Midjourney v5 and online communities are already pumping out images that poke at the edges of reality, creating scenarios that didn’t exist. The historic quality of those photos further undermines our own ability to separate fact from fiction.

Something wild is happening on the Midjourney subreddit.
People are telling stories and sharing photos of historic events – like the “Great Cascadia” earthquake that devastated Oregon in 2001.
 The kicker? It never happened. The images are AI-generated. pic.twitter.com/2ziHJYsTDK
— Justine Moore (@venturetwins) March 26, 2023

And it doesn’t take a huge analytical mind to consider what realistic images of, say, the moon landing being staged could have on the populace at large.
I’m really stuck between thinking this is awesome and being terrified. Terrisome. Awesified.
The influence of hyperreality doesn’t just mean things being created, its influence can go the other way too.
Think of the pictures of Boris Johnson standing in front of a bus declaring incorrectly that the UK will have an extra £350 million to fund the NHS after leaving the EU. Considering the bleak state of modern Britain, the food shortages and sky-high inflation, it feels unreal, almost AI-generated. 
And what’s stopping politicians from claiming that’s exactly what it is? Surely no one could’ve been that wrong? It must be AI. A fake. A generated image peddled by those who can’t accept the unfettered glory of a finally free United Kingdom?
Expect Conservative politicians to claim this image as doctored at some point in the future.
Thinking small to act big
Here, we come to the crux: what can be done to fight this insidious march of AI-generated images into an unprepared society? The worrying part is no one really knows.
Two years ago it would’ve been impossible to predict that an AI-generated picture of the pope would shake society, or that doctored audio of Biden and Trump amusingly talking about games would rip through the internet.
Yes, the EU and UK have been active in trying to create AI legislation, but even the best rules will lag behind the increasing pace of technology. This doesn’t mean that these rules should be abandoned, simply that more needs to be done around them.
Media studies — once derided as a ‘doss’ subject — is now more important than ever. In this era of mainstream misinformation, being able to analyse the passage of information is a vital skill. This must be extended.
In a world of AI generation, we need to teach people how these systems operate, how to check for doctored images, the value of sources, and basic methods of finding the closest approximation to the truth there is. This sort of AI-informed media studies should be rolled out to not only every school across Europe, but offered to those of all ages.
Another route that I believe is vital in this coming age of hyperreality is local action. As humans, we’re designed to operate in small groups. It’s one of the reasons why the news cycle is so anxiety-inducing; we’re simply not built to take in the problems of the whole world.
As AI spreads, it’s going to make getting an accurate picture of the wider world tougher. But what we can understand is what directly surrounds us.
Political divides can swiftly disappear when a hole in the road needs fixing or a school needs to raise funds. In these situations, you deal with living, breathing people that are attached to a community, rather than a faceless online mass. In a world of hyperreality, holding on to the aspects we know are true can help cut through the bullshit. 
As the phrase goes: think global, act local. If — alongside AI education and legislation — we look towards solving local issues with an eye on worldwide ones, the rise of this sort of technology can happen without turning society into some sort of mush. Hell, maybe AI generators of all kinds could be used for fun and harmless activities.
But if we allow this technology to drag us into full hyperreality without taking appropriate precautions, then who knows what might happen — but I don’t have high hopes of it being good.
And all this because someone put the pope in a drippy jacket.

Award-winning economist has tapped AI to close the gender equity gap,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/03/29,"
The gender equity gap in the tech sector is well-documented. Research has found that women occupy only 22% of all tech roles across European companies, while the proportion of funding raised by female-only teams has dropped from 3% to 1% since 2018.
The issue is prevalent at every level of the industry. A 2022 poll by Web Summit showed that 67% of women in technology feel unfairly paid compared to their male peers.
Despite this pessimistic picture, technology can also provide a means to close the gender equity gap.
That’s the mission of acclaimed gender economist and former Global 500 global executive, Katica Roy, who will be speaking at TNW València on March 31.
For Roy, the work has personal roots. When she returned to work after her maternity leave, she experienced pay inequity herself. She decided to devise her own solution. In 2017, she founded Pipeline Equity, an SaaS company aiming to improve intersectional gender equity in the workplace.
Pipeline Equity’s award-winning HR analytics platform uses AI and cloud computing to help companies operationalise their DEI commitments into daily actions, and improve inclusion and equality by 70% in three months.
“Interestingly enough, what we found in the market is that 96% of CEOs put equity in their top priorities, but only 22% of employees regularly see it shared and measured,” Roy tells TNW. “So you have this 74% gap between employer branding and the actual employee experience. That’s what we aim to close.”
Equally interesting is that the original research behind Pipeline Equity found that, across 4,000 companies in 29 countries, for every 10% increase in intersectional gender equity, there’s a 1% to 2% increase in revenue. “Equity isn’t simply the right thing to do, but also a massive economic opportunity,” Roy says. To be precise, that economic opportunity could add $12 trillion to global GDP.
In fact, equity’s economic return during a downturn is higher than in regular times, she explains. This means companies that put equity at the core of their crisis management during uncertain times can see twice the returns.
But despite the social and economic advantages of gender equity, Roy believes that there are two things companies are getting wrong: focusing on programmatic rather than systemic change, and focusing on ‘fixing’ women instead of fixing the system.
She argues that it’s “critically important” for us and our global economy to hardwire equity by phasing out our biases using AI.
“With a system that’s equitable by design, we have the opportunity to really facilitate equity within our lifetime. The question isn’t whether we can reach equity using technology. It’s whether we will choose to. Because it is within our realm to make this reality.”

Swedish startup takes commuting by boat to new heights — literally,Siôn Geschwindt,2023/03/28,"
Is it a boat or is it a plane? Put your glasses on! This is clearly an electrically-powered hydrofoil passenger ferry. 
The brainchild of Swedish startup Candela, the P-12 Shuttle is set to become the fastest and longest-range electric passenger vessel in the world when it launches this summer. 
Founded in 2014, Candela has spent years perfecting its design on recreational boats, and now, fuelled by a $20m cash injection, is looking to scale up production and bring hydrofoil passenger boats into the mainstream. 
The startup is currently building the first two vessels at its new factory in Stockholm, and is in discussions with 180 potential operators around the world, it told TNW in a written statement. 
Hydrofoils function similarly to aeroplane wings. As the water flows over the surface of the foil it creates an upwards force, lifting the boat out of the water. This doesn’t just look cool, it reduces drag and allows the boat to travel faster. It also makes the craft more energy efficient.
However, electric hydrofoil boats are inherently unstable. To overcome this problem, Candela spent five years developing computer-controlled hydrofoils that adjust 100 times-a-second using data from sensors that gauge wave height and wind speed. This balances the boat and reduces seasickness — the unsavoury side of many seafaring journeys.

Candela claims that the P-12 Shuttle will have a top speed of 30 knots (55km/h) and a range of 110km on a single charge. What’s more impressive is that it is slated to use 80% less energy than traditional vessels, slashing emissions. A recent analysis by the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm showed that the shuttle emits 97.5% less carbon dioxide over its lifecycle than an equivalent diesel vessel.  
Lars Jörnow, Partner at investor EQT Ventures, which co-led the funding round, believes the P-12 offers a “climate friendly and low-cost” solution that will be a “game-changer” for passenger water travel. 
Candela hasn’t just attracted investors, but city planners, too. In 2021, the startup signed a deal with the Swedish Transport Administration to build and trial the shuttle as a potential replacement for Stockholm’s fleet of 60 diesel ferries. 
The government has financed half of the project, with Candela covering the other half. The partners look to complete the P-12 at the end of 2023, and begin trialling the vessel in 2024, to connect the rapidly expanding suburb of Ekerö and the city centre. 
Ekerö residents currently have to undertake a 55-minute trip by bus, subway, or conventional ferry. The Candela P-12 Shuttle will cover the 15km route in 25 minutes — saving commuters 50 minutes a day.  
Maritime traffic is already Stockholm’s most popular public transport, but the current fleet is outdated and a significant source of emissions, says Gustav Hemming, vice president of the Regional Executive Board in Stockholm.  
“There’s a broad political support to replace more ferries in Stockholm, as the acting politicians’ outspoken goal is not only to reduce emissions from current vessels, but also transfer commuting from land-based to waterborne traffic,” Candela told TNW. The shuttle’s flying ability and subsequent lack of wake have allowed it to gain an exemption from Stockholm’s 12-knot river speed limit.

“Opening up urban waterways for high-speed electric transport can revolutionise commuting in cities such as San Francisco, Seoul, or Amsterdam – at a very low cost,” said Gustav Hasselskog, the founder and CEO of Candela. “There’s no need to build new infrastructure.”   
In addition to city commuting, Candela envisions inter-city and even international travel. On Sunday, it made the first ever high-speed crossing in an electric vessel between Malmö, Sweden, and Copenhagen, Denmark. According to company spokesperson Mikael Mahlberg, the trip took just 30 minutes and cost €3 in electricity.   
Key to Candela’s viability, it says, is affordability. “Most traditional battery powered or hydrogen vessels not only lack the speed and range of diesel vessels they’re intended to replace, but they’re also very expensive to purchase and operate,” Candela told TNW. 
Since conventional high-speed vessels use so much energy, they require large battery banks and charging infrastructure at the dock. Thanks to its hydrofoil tech, the P-12 uses much smaller batteries that can be charged using less expensive infrastructure.
Candela’s biggest challenge now is scaling up production to meet demand, said its CEO. Across the coastal and urban segments of vessels, Candela estimates the total addressable market for their electric watercraft to be almost €30bn.  
From London to Copenhagen to Amsterdam, many of the world’s biggest cities are water-based, making electric ferries an attractive option for clean, efficient transport.
Sweden’s neighbour Norway is considered to be leading the charge on electric ships globally, with over 60 electric ferries in operation, out of its total fleet of 200. 
Earlier this year, shipping was added to the EU’s Emissions Trading System (a ‘cap-and-trade’ system that limits the amounts of emissions per sector), which should accelerate the electric ship transition.
Currently, in the EU, passenger ferries are responsible for 7% of shipping emissions, making up 0.2% of the bloc’s total emissions.

How an outsider’s freedom can make a successful startup founder,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/03/28,"
Building a startup in a sector you’ve never worked in might seem a risky move, but it can actually provide a competitive advantage.
That’s certainly proven true for Vivino. Founded in 2010 in Copenhagen, the scaleup has raised $221 million in funding, and become the world’s most downloaded wine app and largest online wine marketplace, with a community of 50 million users.
This success came despite an unconventional background. Vivino’s cofounders didn’t come from a place with a rich history of wine, and neither of them had previously worked in the sector.
For Heini Zachariassen, co-founder of Vivino, and founder and host of Raw Startup, coming from outside the industry adds a big advantage. “You’re free to do whatever you want in any way you want,” he tells TNW.
So how does this freedom translate into founding and scaling a successful startup?
The first important aspect is the ability to bring a fresh perspective to the market, which enabled Vivino to help a customer segment that the industry was neglecting: wine lovers who don’t know much about wine.
Vivino supports these users with crowd-sourced data. When they take a photo of a bottle of a wine label, the app can show them ratings, reviews, and average prices for the bottle.
“If you’re in the industry and somewhat set in your ways, you can have a lot of baggage that influences the decisions you make,” Zachariassen, who will be speaking at TNW València on March 30, says.

The outsider’s position allowed Vivino to steer clear of industry politics that can apply pressure towards a certain direction, or certain standards to live up to.
“We didn’t listen to the industry. We didn’t listen to the wine experts. And we purposely didn’t do so,” Zachariassen explains. “Because we’re not building the product for those two groups. We’re building it for the casual wine drinker.”
This played a pivotal role in product development and design. In its beginning, the scaleup focused its resources on how to solve a specific problem for a specific user group, and how to create a good product to do so.
“This initially left the design looking scrappy,” Zachariassen says. “And that was fine for us. But that’s harder to accept if you don’t have freedom. If you have three generations of winemakers looking at you, for example.”
Having the flexibility to prioritise problem-solving and substance over style in the beginning was also beneficial for the company’s resource management.
“When you build a startup, it’s all about resources, right? Design was always a priority for us, but we didn’t want to do it upfront because we also knew it could kill us,” Zachariassen notes.

At the same time, the freedom to fully focus on a specific target group and think outside the box led to an innovative solution: a user-friendly wine rating system.
The typical rating of wine is based on an 100-point system, which for the scaleup’s team wasn’t relatable to non-experts. “Vivino is not for someone who has a wine cellar. It’s for someone who has five bottles on the kitchen table,” Zachariassen says.
This led Vivino to implement a five-star rating system. As this scale is used in most popular rating apps, the company felt it would be easy for everyone to understand.
There’s also a personal element to Vivino’s success. While Zachariassen was an outsider to the industry, he was an insider to the problem; he was the actual future user. “And that’s probably the key if you’re an outsider, really understanding the problem you’re trying to solve.”

These 3 fintech trends are key to building an inclusive future,Michael Schlein,2023/03/24,"
Michael Schlein will be speaking at TNW Valencia 2023 about How fintech innovation can drive inclusive growth. Check out this discussion on the Impact stage on Thursday, March 3oth.  
The world has changed so much over the past few years. The global pandemic, the war in Ukraine, worsening climate change, widespread social unrest — all these challenges have had major consequences for families, small businesses, and communities globally. For the first time in our lifetimes, global poverty and hunger are on the rise, and the economic environment remains uncertain and unstable.
As challenges evolve, so do solutions. While today’s challenges seem overwhelming, we’re also seeing powerful opportunities to build a fair, inclusive, and resilient economy. According to the 2021 Findex, more than a billion people gained access to formal financial accounts over the past decade — thanks to a digital revolution accelerated by the pandemic. This is very encouraging progress.
But 2 billion people remain excluded from the global financial system — and they will be much harder to reach. They are smallholder farmers, micro and small businesses in remote areas, and, more often than not, women.
As more people gain basic financial tools, they can use them to improve their lives — and access a broader suite of tools to build resilience. A farmer can purchase insurance to protect against climate disasters, a small business owner can access revolving credit to manage supply chain issues, and an aspiring software developer can save money and gain new skills to boost her income.
Inclusive fintechs are uniquely positioned to maximize these opportunities — and respond to challenges. Accion helped pioneer the field of inclusive fintech by launching one of the world’s first global fintech funds for the underserved, and by nurturing innovators with funding and support, we’ve seen how they can disrupt the status quo to deliver meaningful social change.
Today, we’re particularly excited by three fintech innovations with the potential to facilitate this momentum, and address the challenges disproportionately affecting underserved communities globally:
1. Embedded finance
While traditional finance often requires customers to jump through hoops, embedded finance makes it possible to offer services to customers upfront, using their data to anticipate their needs and credit risk.
For example, Accion’s seed-stage inclusive fintech investor, Accion Venture Lab has invested in Cashinvoice in India, which leverages data on small businesses to embed supply chain financing products in large platforms that small businesses already use, like suppliers of inventory for fast-moving consumer goods stores. This innovative practice has the potential to seamlessly equip millions of underserved people with the financial tools they need to improve their lives.
As more financial tools integrate with every aspect of the digital economy, we’re seeking to scale innovations that create new entry points for embedded finance in platforms that our end clients already use, like retailers selling seeds to smallholder farmers. We believe embedded finance solutions focused on reaching farmers, small businesses, and women have great potential to advance resilience and inclusion.
2. Agtech finance
Two thirds of the world’s working poor make a living through agriculture, and they are increasingly vulnerable to climate change. By equipping farmers with new financial tools and digital capabilities, we can help them build resilience. And in the relatively new field of agritech, we’ve seen exciting innovations emerge over the past few years that have great potential to generate social impact.
We’ve already seen encouraging results through our work with agtech fintechs like PULA and Apollo Agriculture that leverage technologies including satellite imaging and mobile apps to equip smallholder farmers across sub-Saharan Africa with crop insurance, customized advice, and credit. Through digital transformation and fintech integration, we’ve also deepened the impact of microfinance providers like Fundación Génesis Empresarial in Guatemala and Dvara KGFS in India that provide credit and other financial services to farmers.
As agtech finance continues to evolve, we’re particularly interested in targeting other service providers within the agricultural value chain, including aggregators, farmer-allied intermediaries, and distributors, to help them serve farmers and their communities more effectively.
3. Future of work finance
Increasingly, people are earning a living through non-traditional employment models, including gig or informal work, and they are particularly vulnerable to financial shocks. By nurturing financial service providers focused on these populations, we can help them gain a stronger foothold in the economy and strengthen their resilience.
For example, our fintech partner MyRobin has created a digital platform that provides blue-collar workers in Indonesia with access to fair employment opportunities, training, and financial services that strengthen their resilience and advance their careers, and our partner UGAFODE in Uganda is helping refugees start businesses and access financial tools.
In the short-term, we’re exploring opportunities to support workers shifting from informal to formal work through gig work platforms, prioritizing those that cater to women. In the long-term, we may also consider the global implications of automation, migration, and displacement on the workforce —and how solutions like cross-border payments and upskilling can help these workers build their financial health.
Accelerating change through knowledge and collaboration
Sharing our knowledge is critical to creating systemic change. Convenings like TNW Valencia are essential to share insights and explore the impact of new innovations — including those in embedded finance, agtech, and the future of work — to better gauge the effectiveness of our own work, and promote demonstration models that enable providers to better serve their clients.
I’m excited to work with our team — and with partners across the public, private, and social sectors — to scale our impact. The future is uncertain, but the challenges of the past have granted us new lessons, powerful tools, and greater resolve to support people with the most urgent needs.

How to pitch your startup: 9 tips from an expert,Thomas Macaulay,2023/03/23,"
Ah, the joys of pitching. Your entire masterplan squeezed into a few sentences, a room of powerful strangers with your future in their hands, and mere seconds to impress them. Who doesn’t love a quick dip in a shark tank?
Quite a lot of people, unfortunately. Luckily for them, pitching coach David Beckett is here to help.
Beckett has spent decades mastering the art of public speaking. He first honed his skills through over 1,000 corporate presentations across 16 years at Canon, before switching to the crisper craft of startup pitches.
In 2013, Beckett founded Best3Minutes, which provides in-person and online training in his method. The techniques have now been taught to more than 1,800 startups and scaleups, which have gone on to raise over €420 million between them.
“My goal is not to tell people what to say,” Beckett tells TNW. “My goal is to give them a framework to find their story, practice it, and make it land with their audience.”
At TNW València on March 30, Beckett will provide his latest pitching workshop. Ahead of the session, he shared some of his top tips for startups.
1. Tune in to your audience
Your pitch needs to align with the desires of your audience. Who are they? What’s important to them? How can you impress them?
Imagine you’ve created a crypto-powered parking app. You could expound on the benefits of storing driver data on a distributed ledger, but few people enjoy torture by blockchain.
”When we work on something day in, day out, we often just want to tell people about what we’ve built — but the audience might not care at all,” says Beckett.


“The execution comes from your product, process, and team.


A more powerful pitch will illustrate a real-world impact. You could say (if it’s true, of course) that people waste 20 minutes every day finding a parking space. With the click of a button, your app cuts the time down to 60 seconds.
That example, however, may not enthral everyone. To make your audience do what you want, you need to know who they are.
2. Focus on the problem and solution
Your pitch needs to focus on pain and gain. This should fit into a simple statement that reveals what you can do for customers.
A human problem makes the issues more relatable. What does the pain result in? How big is the problem? Will people pay to solve it? How have you validated that? Investors want these answers.
“Things that especially trigger them are the size of opportunity and execution against that opportunity,” says Beckett. “And the execution part is product, progress, and team.”
3. Establish a clear objective
A successful pitch results in action. The ultimate target is often a set investment, but startups normally need to take a different first step. It could be a follow-up meeting, an introduction, or scanning a QR code that shows the audience further information. The most important outcome is maintaining a connection.
Beckett’s former students range from furniture giant to Dutch startup Lalaland.
Whatever your objective, make it clear and memorable. You may only have a few minutes to convince your audience to take action.
“Of course, you can’t communicate all the details in that time, but that’s not really the goal,” says Beckett. “The goal of the pitch is getting to the next step.”
4. Use post-it notes to organise your thoughts
Once you’ve got an objective, you need a strategy to reach it. Beckett advises using post-it notes to get the ideas out of your head and into a storyline. To shrink the prep time, he also recommends downloading his Pitch Canvas, a free storytelling tool for structuring your pitch.
“It’s really difficult to deliver the pitch with certainty and passion when you haven’t got the story straight,” he says. “Once you’ve got the story straight, you can start going into the delivery part.”
5. Demonstrate your value
Investors want to see evidence that you can execute your plan. If you’ve got customer traction, explain who’s using the product. If you’ve got a demo, show the product working. When time is short, a screenshot can suffice.
“If you can convince them that it’s a business, not a concept, they’ll think differently about it,” says Beckett. “And what convinces people it’s a business, not a concept, is a working product and customers.”


“Once they say things out loud, they often find what they wrote is too technical.


If your product is still a concept, there are other ways to demonstrate your value. One is showing you have the passion to put in the hours. Another is any funding that you’ve already raised.
“There’s a couple of things that come from that. Firstly, people trust you. Secondly, you’ve been through a due diligence process, so they’re unlikely to get surprises.”
6. Captivate them with your opening
You need to quickly gain the interest of your audience. Investors can see up to 1,000 pitches a year and are always short on time. To capture their attention, your opening has to stand out.
If it doesn’t land, says Beckett, their support “is almost certainly going to be a no-go.”
7. Polish the delivery
Once you have a prototype pitch, it’s time to verbalise it. Practice saying it out loud in front of an audience, and use their feedback to fine-tune your delivery. You can then take a step back and reassess the clarity, focus, and rhythm. 
“Once people start saying things out loud, they often find out what they wrote is quite technical, and want to make it more direct,” says Beckett.
Beckett’s masterclass isn’t the only TNW València session on pitching. Startups will also take the stage for a pitch battle.
Your delivery should emphasise the words that matter. Beckett uses the example of a fictional delivery startup. In a pitch, the founder plans to say, “We deliver a sustainable and energy-boosting doughnut to meetings near you.”
If their focus is proximity, they can stress that doughnuts are delivered “to a meeting NEAR YOU.” If their USP is sustainability, they can emphasise that “we deliver a SUSTAINABLE and energy-boosting doughnut.” If they’re selling the energy effects, they can accentuate that it’s a “SUSTAINABLE and energy-boosting doughnut.”
Your delivery must also connect on a human level — a crucial element of pitching. Just one moment that shows your passion for the project can make an enormous difference.
8. Manage your time with a script
In discussions about public speaking, the relative merits of spontaneity and planning are endlessly debated. For Beckett, the best balance depends on your allotted time.
In a half-hour corporate presentation, you might only need to memorise the opening. In a short pitch, however, you’ll probably need a full script.
“For a three-minute pitch, the pressure is too much for most people’s brains to manage,” says Beckett. “If they don’t make a proper plan, they forget to say the things they really want to say, and spend too much time on things that are not so important.”
9. Time to perfection
Beckett has done extensive research on our listening and speaking capacities. He’s concluded that you should pitch a maximum of 150 words per minute.
 “If you speak faster than that, people can’t follow,” he says. “It’s best to speak a bit slower so that people can process it. Get a bit of air around the key messages, but with enough energy and speed.”
Those 150 words will fit into approximately nine sentences. A three-minute pitch, therefore, will typically comprise around 27 sentences. If you’re struggling to structure your story, those rough boundaries can help allocate the time.
And if that doesn’t quell the anxieties about being judged in a few minutes, just remember: it will all be over in a few minutes.

David Beckett will be speaking at TNW València, which takes place at the end of March. If you want to experience the event, we’ve got something special for our loyal readers. Use the promo code TNWVAL30 and get a 30% discount on your conference business pass for TNW València.

These are the new jobs generative AI could create in the future,Kirstie McDermott,2023/03/22,"
Search interest in ChatGPT has reached a 2,633% boost in interest since last December, shortly after its launch. For the artificial intelligence and machine learning industry, and for those working in tech as a whole, OpenAI’s chatbot represents a true crossing of the Rubicon.
A generative form of AI, it uses prompts to produce content and conversations, whereas traditional AI looks at things such as pattern detection, decision making, or classifying data. We already benefit from artificial intelligence, whether we realise it or not—from Siri in our Apple phones to the choices Netflix or Amazon Prime make for us to the personalisations and cyber protection that lie behind our commercial interactions.
ChatGPT is just one of an increasing number of generative AI tools, including Bing Chat and Google Bard. DeepMind’s Alpha Code writes computer programs at a competitive level; Jasper is an AI copywriter, and DALL-E, MidJourney and Stable Diffusion can all create realistic images and art from a description you give them.
As a result, generative AI is now firmly embedded in the mainstream consciousness, with much credit going to ChatGPT’s easy to use interface, and its ability to produce results that can be as sublime as they are ridiculous. Want it to produce some Python code? Sure thing—and it can generate you a funny Limerick too, if you’d like.
How generative AI will impact the job market
According to Salesforce, 57% of senior IT leaders believe generative AI is a game changer, and because it is intuitive and helpful, end users like it as well.
While your job may be safe from AI (for the moment), ChatGPT-generated content has gotten into the the top 20% of all candidates shortlisted for a communications consultant role at marketing company Schwa, and it has also passed Google’s level 3 engineering coding interview.
Roles that are likely to resist the advent of generative AI include graphic designers, programmers (though they are likely to adopt AI tools that speed up their process) and blockchain developers, but many other jobs are likely to be performed by AI in the (near) future.
These include customer service jobs—chatbots can do this efficiently. Bookkeeping or accounts roles are also likely to be replaced as software can do many of these tasks. Manufacturing will see millions of jobs replaced with smart machinery that does the same job, but faster.
But, while AI may replace some jobs, it will also generate a slew of new ones.
The World Economic Forum predicts that the technology will create 97 million new jobs by 2025. Jobs specifically related to the development and maintenance of AI and automation will see growing adoption as AI integrates across multiple industries.
These could include data detectives or scientists, prompt engineers, robotics engineers, machine managers, and programmers, particularly those who can code in Python which is key for AI development. AI trainers and those with capabilities related to modelling, computational intelligence, machine learning, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, and neuroscience will also be in demand.
Healthcare looks set to benefit too, with PwC estimating that AI-assisted healthcare technician jobs will see an upward surge. A sector that is already creating new jobs is automated transportation with Tesla, Uber, and Google investing billions into AI-driven self-driving cars and trucks.

From surplus energy to investment opportunities: Startups across Europe combat fuel poverty,Chris Baraniuk,2023/03/13,"
On Christmas morning last year, dozens of households in the Republic of Ireland woke up to a hot water tank that had been heated overnight – for free.
These households were part of a pilot run by the pioneering social enterprise EnergyCloud, which has found a way of using surplus wind energy on blustery nights to help people who are experiencing fuel poverty. 
All it takes is the installation of a special switch that allows EnergyCloud to activate water heating when there is bountiful energy on the grid. People can still heat their hot water tank via a manual switch whenever they choose and they can also switch the whole system off if they are away from their home for a time.
“We can remotely send a message that clicks on your hot water and heats up your immersion at night-time,” explains Derek Roddy, co-founder of EnergyCloud. He adds that free water heating was delivered multiple times last year, not just on Christmas morning.
Energy prices in Europe have soared in the last couple of years, due to shifts in demand during the pandemic and, more recently, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This has triggered a worrying rise in fuel poverty but efforts to help are afoot. Renewables, in particular, could be coming to the rescue.
EnergyCloud is a non-profit social enterprise with a voluntary board of 11 people. Funds and technologies are donated by EnergyCloud partners, including Roddy’s firm Climote, energy provider SSE Airtricity and Amazon Web Services.
People who receive free hot water get text message alerts so that they know when it is available. “It is making a difference in people’s lives,” adds Roddy.
Hot water tanks, he says, can be reimagined as batteries: “A typical hot water tank would store 6 kWh of energy in hot water, which is a staggering amount of energy.” If you added up all the hot water tanks in Ireland, you would get a total of around 6 GWh.
Costing the surplus
Surplus energy from wind farms is an increasingly expensive problem. In 2022, the UK’s National Grid paid £215 million to shut off wind generation when the electricity wasn’t needed – a cost that gets passed on to consumers, further raising prices. EnergyCloud has found a way of using surplus energy while also helping people who might be struggling to pay their energy bills.
Everyone, in theory, benefits from this – not least because a lack of heating and hot water can cause or aggravate health problems. The UK’s Building Research Establishment estimates that cold homes, in England alone, cost the National Health Service more than half a billion pounds each year.
Other initiatives to help households experiencing fuel poverty in the past have included a programme in Scotland that installed Tesla Powerwall batteries in more than 100 homes, though Roddy notes that the costs are minimal when you are able to divert energy to existing hot water tanks instead.
EnergyCloud says it aims to install its remote-controlled hot water tank switches in at least 10,000 homes by the end of the year and the enterprise is already planning to expand into Northern Ireland and Scotland. 
“It’s a really interesting concept,” says Marilyn Smith at the non-profit EnAct, which researches social issues around energy consumption. However, she notes that some people might hesitate to allow the installation of remotely controlled equipment in their homes. So far, that hasn’t been a barrier for EnergyCloud. All participants have been voluntary and Roddy says 65,000 additional homes have already expressed an interest in joining.
A ‘public good’
Smith argues that emerging energy companies are increasingly presenting renewables (and surplus electricity) as a potential “public good”. Other European ventures have sought to help low-income households around the world access renewable energy directly. Take Trine, a 16 person-strong firm based in Sweden that allows people to invest in solar energy projects in Africa, Asia and Central America. More than €80 million have been raised via the platform so far. 
“There’s plenty of technology out there – batteries, panels, converters,” says Trine founder Christoffer Falsen. “It’s really about being able to accelerate that with the injection of capital.”
He explains that Trine-funded schemes can, for example, allow a household in Kenya to purchase a solar panel in instalments, enabling them to access cheaper electricity and move away from fossil fuel generators, which are extremely common in much of Africa. To date, nearly 3 million people worldwide have accessed electricity from renewables funded by Trine’s investors.
Although it was “unthinkable” before, Falsen says Trine may soon allow investors to support renewables projects in Europe as well: the rise of energy prices on the continent means increased profitability from energy projects, so the potential returns have risen, too. Previously, European ventures were not attractive enough in this regard.
“I think there will be a bigger push for energy independence and that, I think, will be very good for this entire sector,” says Falsen. He notes, however, that there are questions over whether high energy tariffs in Europe will continue, adding to uncertainty for investors.
Electricity at cost
Europe’s growing cadre of “energy communities” – groups of households that buy into generation projects such as small-scale wind farms – already understand that energy independence can shield people from the highest bills. 
A long-running example is the community in Eeklo, Belgium that benefits from wind energy harnessed by EcoPower. It provides electricity to customers more or less at cost.
“We have a lot of wind in our region,” says Jan de Pauw, project engineer at EcoPower. There are 65,000 EcoPower members in Flanders, of which a few thousand live in Eeklo. The company has a headcount of around 50 people, operates a total of 20 windfarms in Flanders, and has raised €60 million of citizen-invested capital to date.
“People become members of EcoPower not because they want to earn a lot of money and have a high dividend but they want to have access to locally produced energy at a fair price,” says de Pauw.
The advantages have become clear during the last 12 months, as energy bills rocketed in Europe. EcoPower estimates that its members saved around €700 on their total bill for 2022. To become a member, households must buy a single share for €250 but people experiencing fuel poverty can pay this off in tiny instalments of just €3.50 a month for six years.
Similar schemes are blooming around Europe, including Ripple Energy in the UK.
With more and more renewable generation on the continent, expect to see increasing opportunities for sharing or cheaply distributing energy in the forms described above.
There could be other impacts of all this, too, as well as helping people in low income or fuel-poor households. Roddy says that, once participants in the EnergyCloud pilot heard that their free hot water would come from local wind farms, they expressed glowing acceptance of renewables. (TNW asked to speak to a participant but were told none was forthcoming.)
Big, white and pointy onshore turbines have occasionally been described as eyesores by some. But schemes such as EnergyCloud, which make clear the potential financial benefits of renewables, could change attitudes, argues Roddy.
“People got this straight away. This was not a hard sell,” he says. “I think we’ll have people literally approaching their elected representatives insisting that there’s wind farms and solar farms built in their area.”

Lark Optics is targeting your retinas for AR without nausea and other sickness,Martin SFP Bryant,2023/03/8,"
This story is syndicated from the premium edition of PreSeed Now, a newsletter that digs into the product, market, and founder story of UK-founded startups so you can understand how they fit into what’s happening in the wider world and startup ecosystem.
Whether you believe it’s the future of everything, or just a useful tool that will be part of the mix of tech we regularly use a few years from now, augmented reality is a rapidly developing field with one major drawback – like VR, it can leave you feeling sick.
For example, US soldiers who tried Microsoft’s HoloLens goggles last year suffered “‘mission-affecting physical impairments’ including headaches, eyestrain and nausea,” Bloomberg reported.
While the technology could “bring net economic benefits of $1.5 trillion by 2030” according to PwC, this sickness is a massive inhibitor to the growth of AR and VR.
One startup looking to tackle the problem is Cambridge-based Lark Optics, which has developed a way of bypassing the issues that cause these problems.
Mismatched cues
“In the real world, we perceive depth by our eyes rotating and focusing. Two different cues need to work in harmony. However, in all existing AR glasses, these cues fundamentally mismatch,” explains Lark Optics CEO Pawan Shrestha.
Having to focus on a ‘virtual screen’ on augmented reality glasses, means users have to switch focus between the real world and the augmented one. This depth mismatch causes physical discomfort and conditions like nausea, dizziness, eyestrain, and headaches.
What Lark Optics does differently, Shrestha says, is it projects the augmented reality image onto the user’s retina. This means the AR is always in focus no matter what your eyes do to adjust to the real world around you.
So far the startup has developed a proof of concept and is now iterating to refine its demonstrator model. Shrestha says they conducted two successful user studies with their proof of concept; one in their own lab and another with an external partner he prefers not to name.
When the tech is ready, they want to use a fabless model for producing the components they design, which they will then sell to original equipment manufacturers who make AR headsets.
Given they’re addressing such a fundamental challenge to the mass adoption of AR, it’s unsurprising that other companies are tackling it in other ways (more on that below). But Shrestha says his startup’s approach is the most efficient in terms of processing power and battery power, and doesn’t affect the user’s field of vision.
Up with the Lark
Shrestha grew up in rural Nepal (“really rural… I was nearly nine years old before I saw electric lights”). He says his parents’ enthusiasm for his education eventually led him to New Zealand where he obtained a masters degree in Electronics Engineering from the University of Waikato.
Keen to develop technology he could commercialise, he says he developed an interferometer. While that venture didn’t work out, his work led him on to a PhD from the University of Cambridge, where he spotted the commercial potential of a new approach to AR displays.
“It was scientifically challenging, but  it was also something that could touch the lives of many, many people,” he says.
Shrestha co-founded Lark Optics (which was previously known as AR-X Photonics) with his friend Xin Chang, and Daping Chu who previously oversaw the PhD work of Shrestha and Chang. The trio have been working together for around a decade but only got started with Lark Optics in earnest last year,
Shrestha says this week they have been joined by a new recruit, Andreas Georgiou, who previously worked at Microsoft as a principal researcher in the field of optical engineering.
The Lark Optics team (L-R): Weijie Wu, Dr Pawan Kumar Shrestha, Professor Daping Chu, Dr Andreas Georgiou, Dr Xin Chang
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Shrestha says being based in Cambridge is a big benefit to them, with a community of experienced advisers around them, and access to relevant investors. He is particularly inspired by the progress made by Micro LED tech startup Porotech, which has raised a total of $26.1 million to date.
And Shrestha has warm words for the Royal Academy of Engineering’s Enterprise Fellowship, of which he is a part. This provides up to £75,000 in equity-free funding to cover salary and business costs, along with mentoring, training and coaching. This was what allowed him to get started on developing Lark Optics as a business.
Lark Optics itself raised a pre-seed round of £210,000 in October last year, Shrestha says, and will be raising a seed round in Q2 this year.
Competition
As mentioned above, others are tackling the problem of AR sickness in different ways. LetinAR uses a ‘pin mirror’ method, Kura Technologies has developed a ‘structured geometric waveguide eyepiece’, while VividQ “compute[s] holograms in real-time on low power devices and integrate[s] them with off-the-shelf display hardware.” 
Another company, SeeReal develops holography-based solutions to address depth issues in 3D displays.
But Shrestha says these rival technologies either require a very high level of data throughput, with a related computational and battery power overhead, or require very high resolution displays. And while some techniques decouple the AR display from the real world like Lark Optics does, Shrestha says they are “like looking through a chicken fence.
“We solved the problem without getting a significant penalty on processing power or battery power, or artefacts. So that’s why I think our approach is the best.”
Vision and challenges
Lark Optics’ ambition is to become established as the best optics for AR, VR, and mixed reality glasses.
“We want to realise the full potential of AR and VR. Now we have AR and VR you can wear for 20 minutes or 30 minutes. We want to make it feel as natural to look at real objects, VR ,or AR, and allow people to use it for all-day, everyday use.”
Shrestha sees the biggest challenge to achieving this is being able to recruit the right people in what is quite a specialised field. But he’s optimistic that attracting just one or two high-level people will end up attracting more, and the endorsement of a good seed round raise in the coming months won’t hurt either.
AR, VR, and MR has been massively hyped in recent years but there have been questions over how much of a future it has. Investor disquiet over Meta’s huge spending in the ‘metaverse’ space, and Microsoft’s job cuts in its HoloLens division as it struggles to turn it into a viable business, show that there’s no straight line from here to a future where this tech is widely used.
But that said, the current jitters of the public markets over stock prices and tech company spending isn’t an end for AR, VR, and MR at all. Apple’s first headset is on the horizon, which will no doubt spin up another wave of interest in the space (although the latest report says it’s been delayed two months, until June). 
If technology like Lark Optics’ can help prepare AR, VR, and MR for the mainstream, the startup could be well positioned to reap the rewards.

3 women-led tech companies that are hiring right now,Susan Armstrong,2023/03/8,"
Call it an “old boys’ club” or “brogrammer culture,” there’s no denying the tech world is still dominated by men. Much has been written about the industry’s lack of diversity, of course. Most tech companies are run by men, and female role models are few and far between.
According to a report by The World Bank, women make up less than a third of the world’s workforce in technology-related fields. In the European Union, they make up just 17% of the ICT (information and communication technology) sector.
This gap grows further at the executive level, where women hold a mere 11% of leadership positions. To add insult to injury, Atomico’s State of European Tech report revealed the proportion of funding raised by women-only teams has dropped from 3% to a paltry 1% since 2018. And, those who do receive funding, get less than male-led teams and mixed men and women-led teams. Sigh.
Grim statistics
The statistics remain grim, even though countless studies show the most diverse tech companies consistently outperform homogenous ones. In a global analysis of 2,400 companies conducted by Credit Suisse, organisations with at least one female board member yielded higher return on equity and higher net income growth than those that did not have any women on the board.
And when VCs invest in women-led companies, they also make more money. Research shows that female leadership impacts business performance and overall growth. A survey conducted by BCG and Mass Challenge found women-run businesses deliver higher revenues—more than twice as much per dollar invested.
The following three women—Anne Boden, founder of Starling Bank; Victoria van Lennep, co-founder of lending platform, Lendable; and Dr Loubna Bouarfa, founder and CEO of OKRA Technologies—are living proof that women-led companies are ready to disrupt, innovate, and elevate the tech world. Better yet, all three are currently hiring.
1. Starling Bank
Anne Boden is quite the glass ceiling breaker. When Starling Bank gained its banking licence in 2016, she became the first woman in history to start a British bank. Since then, she has led her team to launch the UK’s first mobile current accounts, entered a partnership with the Post Office, raised over £300 million in funding, and opened three offices. Now, Starling employs more than 2,000 people and has over three million accounts.
“The vast majority of people in this industry are men in their early thirties, with beards. People don’t expect a fintech entrepreneur to be me,” said Boden, in The Times. “I think it’s harder when you stand out, but I’d much rather stand out by being the only woman who’s started a bank in the UK.”
Sound like the kind of leader you’d like to work for? Starling is looking for an Infrastructure Engineer to join its bank in London. Open-minded when it comes to hiring, Starling cares more about aptitude and attitude than specific experience or qualifications. It’s very open about how it delivers software. It believes in clean coding, simple solutions, automated testing and continuous deployment. If you care enough to find elegant solutions to difficult technical problems, Starling would love to hear from you. Find out all you need to know about this exciting role here.
2. Lendable
Just as Starling Bank won plaudits when it announced in 2020 that it was profitable after just three years, leading AI-powered consumer finance platform, Lendable, was quietly generating money with earnings well-ahead of most European unicorns.
Launched in 2014, and co-founded by Victoria van Lennep, its mission was to undercut traditional banks by offering competitive rates and fast-tracking applications. Now, it approves a new loan every 30 seconds, employs over 200 people, and has appeared in The Sunday Times Top 10 in Tech, ranking by fastest-growing sales.
Lendable is hiring a new Senior Data Scientist for its team. This role sits at the heart of the brand’s USP, developing the credit risk models to underwrite loan and credit card products. If successful, you will have access to the latest machine learning techniques, combined with a rich data repository to deliver the best in market risk models. Is your interest piqued? Read all about the role here.
3. OKRA Technologies
OKRA Technologies is a leading provider of AI-driven analytics for global life sciences. The company was founded by Dr. Loubna Bouarfa in 2015, with the vision of moving the healthcare industry towards a future of personalised medicine powered by explainable AI.
Dr. Bouarfa’s goal has always been to ensure that AI makes us more intelligent as humans, and empowers us to make better decisions. She has been instrumental in building the OKRA Explainability Engine which empowers users by providing explanations behind the outputs of AI systems.
Last year, OKRA made the 2022 Deloitte Tech Fast 50 list for the fastest-growing technology companies in the UK, and it also beat 70 startups from 20 different European countries to claim the prize for Best Female-Led Startup at the StartUp Europe Awards.
The company is currently looking for a Junior/Senior NLP Data Scientist to join its Leiden team in the Netherlands. As an NLP Data Scientist at OKRA, you’ll play a critical role in designing and building solutions using the leading AI engine for healthcare and life sciences.
You will build new capabilities that can be leveraged to capture insights in unstructured free-text data to drive appropriate actions and desired outcomes. In this role, you’ll be working closely with the executive team, who have experience implementing machine learning tech in real-world applications for over 15 years, turning research into commercial reality. Sound like your kind of role? You can apply here.

What the Mesopotamians can teach us about ChatGPT and the impact of new tech,The Conversation,2023/02/27,"
Adapting to technological advances is a defining part of 21st-century life. But it’s not unique to us: it’s been part of the human story since our earliest written records – even featuring in the plotlines of ancient myths and legends.
While ChatGPT threatens to change writing (and writing-related work) as we know it, the Mesopotamians, who lived 4,000 years ago (in a geographical area centred in modern-day Iraq), went through this kind of seismic change before us. Their civilisation is credited with the invention of writing.

Living in changing times
Just two months after launching in November 2022, OpenAI’s ChatGPT has already reached an audience of over 100 million people.
The large language model (LLM), sometimes called “autocomplete on steroids”, has drawn attention for its capacity to create human-like answers to queries. Its work has received passing grades on university law and business exams, and been used in a Colombian court to help decide a legal ruling.
Responses to ChatGPT and its competitors have vacillated between recognising the potential risks of the chatbot and extolling its possible benefits. We’re flooded with theories on how new advances in AI may change how we work, study and live.
Ancient Mesopotamia was home to many of civilisation’s early developments. Its people were world leaders in adapting to technological and cultural change.
Mesopotamians invented the wheel and agriculture, and pioneered advances in mathematics, urbanisation and transportation. These breakthroughs are reflected in cuneiform literature, one of the oldest known forms of writing.
The history of cuneiform writing is complex, but it seems to have initially developed to record economic data, such as debts that were owed. Over time, however, the Mesopotamians widened their use of signs inscribed into clay tablets to record a variety of information, in numerous languages. New uses covered everything from diplomatic correspondences to omen texts, to some of the world’s oldest literary masterpieces.
Tech-assisted heroes
In the world’s earliest known written epic, Gilgamesh, the eponymous hero is shown inventing and using technologies, such as diving weights and a sail, to further his journey to the edges of the world – and beyond.

Mesopotamian epics feature numerous battles, some using technology such as advanced weaponry. Wikimedia Commons
As noted by Assyriologist Andrew George, the young hero develops new technologies to help his quest for fame and immortality. These advances allow him to engage in previously unknown activities, such as sailing and deep-sea diving.
Another royal hero from Mesopotamia, Lugalbanda (sometimes known for his super speed) is also credited with technological advancement. Lugalbanda improves the technique of fire-starting by using flint to spark embers and bake bread. The heroes’ use of new tools emphasises their exceptionalism.
Inventions and ambiguity
Mesopotamian epics don’t present cultural and technological advances as unambiguously and uniformly beneficial. In Gilgamesh, the benefits of civilisation and urbanisation, such as advances in wall-building technology, are juxtaposed with their costs – such as environmental destruction and alienation from the wild.
Indeed, the epics often represent new technologies being harnessed in the service of human conflict – and disproportionately serving the interests of those with high social status. In the Sumerian epic Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta, the heroic king defeats his enemy by inventing and using superior technology: the ability to write on clay tablets.
This invention is also thought to be referenced in the Epic of Sargon, where Sargon appears to dodge a murder attempt through his epic reading skills. The text notes that while writing on tablets had been developed at that stage, the use of envelopes to hide their contents had not (perhaps luckily for Sargon).
In some ways, the representation of new technologies in cuneiform literature echoes contemporary concerns about AI: fears of increasing social inequalities and its potential use in cyberwarfare.

The future of history
Studying the past can deepen our understanding of how humans have adapted to modern technology over thousands of years. Conversely, modern technology continues to broaden our understanding of history.
In recent years, AI – the newest form of writing – has been used to decipher the oldest: cuneiform literature. The Fragmentarium project, for example, uses sophisticated algorithms to determine which fragments of shattered cuneiform texts belong together; these algorithms predict the text that once filled the missing sections.
AI will likely continue to alter the way historians analyse the past. This will require new considerations around familiar issues – such as how to represent the past accurately in light of possibly biased evidence, and the need to critically evaluate sources of information.
In the broader field of academia, the boundaries of how AI may be used have not yet been clearly explained. In January, for example, a top international AI conference banned the use of AI tools for writing scientific papers – though its use in editing papers was accepted.
Considering the limits of technology
Even those early tech adapters, the Mesopotamians, ran into problems the technology of the day could not address.
Climate change is thought to have resulted in the downfall of the Akkadian Empire, sometimes called the world’s first multi-national political entity. And even the crafty Gilgamesh couldn’t escape his own mortality.
Humans have been grappling with how to invent, use and adapt to technology since our earliest civilisations. In Mesopotamian epic literature, new technology helps heroic individuals travel beyond accepted limitations and develop new skills. But the technology and resulting knowledge are not always evenly distributed.
Knowing how we adapted to changing technology in the past helps us more fully understand the human condition – and may even help us prepare for the future.

Why US-based unicorn HackerOne keeps their dev team in Groningen,Andrea Hak,2023/02/22,"
Photo by Stella Dekker Fotografie
In 2012, two former students from Hanze University of Applied Sciences in the Northern Dutch city of Groningen, took a major gamble. They made a list of 100 companies they’d like to work for — including Facebook, Twitter, Spotify, and Uber — and hacked them. As you can imagine, this little stunt certainly got their attention.
Now, $159.4M in investment later, their cybersecurity company, HackerOne, reached unicorn status in 2022 and counts big players like Nintendo, AT&T, Hyatt, GM, and even the Pentagon amongst its clients.
HackerOne is a bug bounty hunting platform that enables companies to enlist the help of ethical hackers across the globe to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities and data breaches, which cost companies an average of $4.35 million.
While founders Jobert Abma and Michiel Prins now live in San Francisco, where HackerOne’s HQ is based, they surprisingly decided not to move their development team across the pond. In fact, over 50% of their engineering and product design team are still based in Groningen today.
The question is, does it actually make sense to keep half of your dev team in another time zone and is this a strategy other founders should actually consider? And why Groningen? With a global tech powerhouse like Amsterdam just a few hours away, why keep the team in this Northern Dutch city?
Follow-the-sun model
The story of HackerOne’s founders is the typical tech fairytale come true. Abma and Prins grew up across the street from each other in a small town in the North of the Netherlands and spent their time playing video games, building websites, and, of course, pulling the occasional prank hack.
They went to Hanze University of Applied Sciences in Groningen together, where they identified a major data leak in the institution’s system. Realizing this could be a successful business venture, they started a consultancy firm and built a small team of like-minded ethical hackers.
After gaining the attention of Silicon Valley’s biggest names, they realized it was time to spread their wings abroad.
HackerOne’s Groningen office
At the same time, keeping part of their dev team in Groningen presented a great opportunity to introduce a ‘follow-the-sun’ model, ensuring someone is always online and ready to tackle any issues that arise.
“The internet has no borders,” Abma says, “We have tens of thousands of people every single day that use our platform to collaborate and work together. We rely on such a distributed community of hackers, that I don’t see why we can’t do that as a company.”
Indeed, HackerOne facilitates this exchange between global, ethical hackers and companies by providing a platform where they can connect, without having to worry about tax forms, background checks, payment security, and other barriers.


Some who visited fell in love with the city and moved permanently.


While there are a number of benefits to having a distributed development team, it also comes with its challenges.
“Working across time zones requires everyone to become good at written and asynchronous communication. It’s important to let people take time to become good written communicators,” Abma says.
Another important point he shared is to make sure engineering and adjacent roles continue to be regularly exposed to other departments, such as sales, marketing, and customer success. This helps build context, breaks down silos, and allows teams to create better solutions.
One way HackerOne does this is by sending their Groningen team to visit the San Francisco HQ a few times a year and vice versa.
It’s important to enable people to build a stronger bond by having them spend time with each other in person, at least twice a year. They love that aspect of having a distributed team because they get to visit different cities and meet new people, but still have the comfort of being able to live in Groningen, which I think is a great city to live in and raise a family.
The benefits of a cosmopolitan city, on a smaller scale
Aside from the business benefits of maintaining a distributed team model, as Abma explained, most of the team simply wasn’t keen to follow them to San Francisco.
“Many people were starting their families and had significant others there, so they couldn’t move to the other side of the world, and we didn’t necessarily want them to.”
For a city of just 235,000, Groningen has an extremely cosmopolitan vibe. Through its two universities and growing startup community, it attracts almost 6,000 international students per year and a growing number of expats.
Some HackerOne employees who visited the Groningen office from San Francisco fell in love with the city and decided to move there permanently. Abma suspects it’s these ‘expat ambassadors’ turned hiring managers who have been key to getting more global talent on board by sharing their first hand experiences of moving to the city.


I think it’s good for Groningen to just be Groningen.


For Isuru Ranaweera, Senior Software Engineer at HackerOne, moving his family to Groningen was an easy transition.
“What I enjoy about Groningen is that it’s less busy and I actually find it a calm city compared to other places. Additionally, I feel safer here, making it a good place to raise my child. Another bonus is that the city is very green, with plenty of trees.”

Another great policy HackerOne has in place is that they pay developers in Groningen the same rates they would pay in Amsterdam.
As an expat, settling here was easier compared to my friends who have settled elsewhere in the Netherlands. Housing is available and affordable, which I found beneficial when migrating to a different country. Reducing costs is important and living here helped me to lower my housing costs during my first years of residency. The commute is also easy as you don’t really need a car. We’ve been living here with a child and a dog without having a need for a car, which is great. I also like staying away from the chaos of big cities.
Having a base in a university town also has the added benefit of access to a pool of young talent. Groningen in particular has two great universities located in the city that attract students from across the globe. Zahra Putri Fitrianti, Software Engineer at HackerOne, was recruited after studying and working at the University of Groningen as a teaching assistant.
Personally, I really like the atmosphere in the city, it’s very suitable for students as well as workers. The city has a sense of tranquility that helps me be productive at university and work. There’s also a lot of great hubs where you can work, such as the Forum cultural center that provides great support for people that spend their day there, albeit sometimes being quite crowded especially during exam season.

Groningen is changing, but hopefully not too much
Groningen is quickly becoming a more recognizable name in the global tech community with new startup success stories and university spinoffs putting its ecosystem on the map. Nonetheless, there are a few changes Abma still hopes to see that will help the city reach its potential:
For Groningen to really upscale that vibrant ecosystem, there are some fundamental building blocks that still need to be built, like more access to funding, tax breaks, etc. What would make me really proud is if, ten years from now, some of the people who we initially hired at HackerOne went on to found their own companies in Groningen. If they can make that transition, it would show the building blocks are really in place. Although I’m happy to see companies like HackerOne have a presence there, I’d like to see more of that.
However, having lived both in Groningen and now (arguably) the capital of the tech world, Abma hopes these oncoming changes don’t impact the character of the city:
“I think it’s good for Groningen to just be Groningen. It doesn’t need to be the next Silicon Valley. There are a lot of downsides to that kind of ecosystem as well.”
Photo by Stella Dekker Fotografie
The question is, like HackerOne, will Groningen’s humble beginnings morph it into a tech giant of the future? Probably not. But it will likely be a place of choice for expats and young talent looking for the perfect balance of exciting opportunities and compact city life. Unlike Silicon Valley’s cut throat culture, Groningen’s tight knit tech community can be likened to the theme song from Cheers: it’s likely everybody will know your name and actually be happy that you came.

Launching a startup with friends? Follow these 4 basic tips,The Conversation,2023/02/12,"
The new Netflix murder mystery film Glass Onion is a cautionary tale – but not about influencers, tech bros, or ironic architecture, as some have suggested. Glass Onion (along with HBO’s Succession) is actually a warning about the potential perils of going into business with your friends or family.
Such businesses are a huge contributor to any economy. Globally, between 70 and 80% of firms are co-owned or co-managed by family or friends. Close relations can be a great source of support and positive influence on a new idea or business.
My research, focusing on new business development within universities, shows that friends can be successful business partners. For students especially, entrepreneurial colleges and universities offer a range of support for friends to realize business dreams.
There are a few challenges when you start a business with someone that can be made easier when working with people you’re close to. Founders should trust one another, and understand each other’s likes, dislikes, and ambitions. If you and your partner have similar values and approaches to life, you’ll likely be able to predict how they’ll react in times of crisis or uncertainty. With this in mind, turning an existing relationship into a business relationship can be easily done.
The pitfalls
Of course, things don’t always work out. What can start as occasional bickering or disagreement about the direction of a new venture can lead to resentment, a decline in the business (and relationship) and even legal trouble.
A business involving family or friends can seriously disrupt work-life balance — which is critical to business success. Lack of boundaries and additional time spent discussing work can interfere with your personal relationship, leading to fatigue and resentment. It’s not realistic or healthy to talk about work all the time.
A family business spanning decades with the same people at the top may eventually stagnate, becoming overly reliant on what are now exhausted markets. This complacency, as with any type of business, can creep in and affect customer relationships, knowledge of competitors, and ability to innovate.
Without proper care, these issues can become commonplace. As happens in Succession, personality battles and power grabs can distract from productivity and threaten to derail the venture.
Protecting yourself and your business
Before getting started, it’s important to plan ahead. This should include creating a strategy for business partners to amicably exit the firm when necessary. It also must involve a consideration of the legal implications of a disagreement, and a plan to protect ideas, business contributions, and other intellectual property.
Research shows that in longstanding family businesses the existence of known successors can influence how seriously the founders take intellectual asset protection. Even with friends and loved ones, you should still document and register ideas, designs, prototypes, products, processes, and slogans.
Before you sign your ideas away (or write them on a napkin), here are five things to consider:
1. Transparency – what are everyone’s plans?
When embarking on a new business venture, it’s important to be upfront about intentions and goals – in the short and long term. What brought you all to this potential startup? What do you wish to achieve? These are questions you should ask.
2. Security – seek legal advice early
Along with officially registering the company, the owners should contact an intellectual property lawyer to receive expert guidance on fairly protecting initial and ongoing contributions with appropriate trademarks, patents, and copyrights where required.
3. Prioritise – stick to your strengths
This is what adds distinct value to businesses: remembering what skills you bring to the table. Even with friends, this isn’t an opportunity to simply hang out and have fun. Yes, you must enjoy your work, but time, money and livelihoods are at stake. A team comprised of many people with a variety of skills and experiences brings creativity, multiple perspectives, and resilience amid inevitable change.
4. Be kind – appreciate and consider life changes
Like the volatility of business, our lives can change instantly. Co-owners should be mindful of changes to working patterns, lifestyles, and important events to maintain health and happiness. This can be particularly relevant when friends co-owning a business are at similar life stages, such as starting a family or getting married. Showing compassion and preparing for these factors, when they arise, can reduce tension and conflict in the day-to-day running of a business.

This tiny flying robot could work as an artificial pollinator,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/02/7,"
The decline of pollinators, particularly bees, is having a grave impact on agriculture and human health. Scientists estimate that 4.7% of the world’s total production of fruit, 3.2% of vegetables, and 4.7% nuts is now lost because of inadequate pollination. But there’s hope. Researchers at Tampere University in Finland have developed a robot that could serve as an artificial pollinator.
The team was inspired by dandelion seeds and tapped into the technological advances in stimuli-responsive polymers used in small, wirelessly-controlled soft-bodied robots, which can walk, swim, jump, or even hover. The result was a polymer-assembly robot that uses wind and light to fly — a world first, according to the researchers.
The robot resembles a dandelion seed and has several biomimetic features. Its porous structure and light weight (1.2mg) enable it to float in the air, directed by the wind. Notably, the robot can also adapt manually to wind direction and force by changing its shape. And thanks to a stable separated vortex ring generation it’s suitable for long-distance wind-assisted travelling.
Here’s what the robot looks like. Credit: Jianfeng Yang / Tampere University
“[It] can be powered and controlled by a light source, such as a laser beam or LED,” Hao Zeng, the research group’s leader, said. Essentially, light can be used to control the structure’s takeoff, landing, and shape.
According to Zeng, the proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate a significant potential for “realistic applications” suitable for agricultural pollination. In the future, these artificial dandelion seeds — dispersed freely by natural winds and steered by light — could carry pollen towards designated areas requiring plant pollination.
With this goal in mind, the team’s planning to improve the material sensitivity that would allow the robot to operate in sunlight, and is looking to upscale the structure so it could be equipped with micro-electronic devices, including GPS, sensors, and biochemical compounds.
Nevertheless, the technology requires further research and collaboration with material scientists and microrobotics experts to address two main challenges: the precise control of the landing spot and reusing the device to make it biodegradable.

Lightyear halts production of its €250K solar EV to focus on its cheaper model,Ioanna Lykiardopoulou,2023/01/25,"
Netherlands-based solar EV maker Lightyear has announced that it’s freezing production of its flagship model, the Lightyear 0 — less than three months after going into production. As part of a “strategic restructuring,” the company will now focus on making the Lightyear 2, priced at around €40,000. This is expected to go into production in late 2025.
The company’s journey has been a long and impressive one. From a student team at a solar vehicle competition, Lightyear transformed into a startup in 2016, and quickly mapped itself on the automotive map with the Lightyear 0. The solar EV featured some stirring in-house tech, promising to be a game changer in a niche market. It also came with a prohibitive price tag: €250,000.

Lightyear says that it hasn’t taken this decision to pivot lightly, as it impacts its “employees,” “investors,” “clients,” “suppliers,” and “the government.” The reason behind the move remains vague, with the announcement citing “challenges” over the past months, which made the action a necessary step to “safeguard” the startup’s vision.
It’s not unreasonable to assume that battery supply bottlenecks, semiconductor shortages, and rising costs of materials due to inflation might have impacted Lightyear. And beyond that, with recession concerns increasing, switching from a limited luxury product to a more affordable one seems like a timely strategic move.
With the Lightyear 2, the company is targeting an entirely different (and wider) market, compared to the first model that was mainly intended as a technology demonstrator to be produced in limited quantities.

The new five-seater hatchback, with a promised range of 800km and 50% lower emissions compared to conventional EVs, was announced at this year’s CES. While the company hasn’t disclosed many details yet, it said that the vehicle will “inherit all of [the 0’s] innovations at a fraction of the market price.”
According to the CEO and co-founder Lex Hoefsloot’s statement, the new model already counts 40,000 waitlist subscriptions from individual customers, and 20,000 pre-orders from fleet owners.
“We hope to conclude some key investments in the coming weeks in order to scale up to Lightyear 2, an affordable solar electric vehicle available for a wider audience,” he added.

Concrete is one of the world’s most harmful materials. Graphene could change that,Thomas Macaulay,2023/01/11,"
Concrete has been described as the most destructive material on Earth. After water, it’s the most used substance in the world, with twice the usage of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminium combined.
To manufacture all this concrete, more than 4 billion tonnes of cement are produced every year. According to the Chatham House think tank, that creates around 8% of all CO2 emissions — more than what’s caused by all the trucks across the globe.
Cement makers urgently need to reduce this footprint. To meet the requirements of the Paris Agreement on climate change, the industry needs to cut emissions by at least 16% by 2030. At the same time, the sector faces growing demand from rapid urbanization and population growth.
It’s foreboding problem. But engineers believe that graphene offers a solution.


“Just 0.01% of the material is required.


First isolated at the University of Manchester in 2004, Graphene’s 2D nature provides a unique combination of strength, flexibility, lightness, and conductivity. These properties caught the eye of Nationwide Engineering, a British construction business. 
The firm’s memorably-acronymed R&D subsidiary, NERD (Nationwide Engineering Research and Development), was tasked with turning the “wonder material” into a new additive: Concretene. 
The substance has already formed floor slabs in the UK. Credit: Concretene
Concretene consists of graphene that’s produced at Manchester University. Small quantities of the liquid formulation are added during the concrete mixing process. 
The graphene provides both mechanical support and an active surface for the chemical reactions that occur during the cement hydration and hardening.
“Very low dosages of the material, in some cases less than 0.01%, are required to deliver substantial performance gains,”  Alex McDermott, the co-founder of Concretene, tells TNW.
“This means that Concretene is commercially viable with wholesale costs to be in-line with existing additives already used in the concrete industry.”

 
According to McDermott, Concretene used in real construction projects was up to 30-50% stronger than standard concrete. Subsequent lab tests have shown strength gains that surpass 100%. As a result, the volume of cement required can significantly reduce without impairing performance. 
Costs, shrinking, and cracking can also be trimmed, while increases in density cut concrete’s porosity.
“These factors will enable engineers to reduce the volume of concrete required in designs going forward, further reducing the CO₂  impact,” says McDermott.
Ultimately, he believes Concretene could be used in more than 99% of concretes worldwide.
McDermott’s team worked with the University of Manchester’s Graphene Engineering Innovation Centre (GEIC) to develop Concretene. Credit: Concretene
Initial tests of Concretene have produced promising results. 
In 2021, NERD laid the world’s first graphene concrete slab across the floor of a new gym in England. Further trials followed at a roller disco and a residential development.
In total, more than 1,000 tonnes of Concretene have now been poured in real-world projects. The next target is pushing the product into the mainstream.

Graphene has been challenging to produce at speed and scale, but recent breakthroughs have made mass-production a more realistic prospect.
These developments have restored faith from investors. In December, Concretene raised £8m from a VC funding round led by LocalGlobe. The cash will be used to accelerate the commercialization plans.
Concretene will now turn to collaborations with Heathrow Airport, Network Rail, Yorkshire Water, and the Environment Agency. Work will also soon begin on the first road trial of Concretene with National Highways
“Concretene is being put through ‘live’ trials in the places where it can be used most,” says McDermott. “This is a key step to achieving industry adoption.”
That could be good news for both the construction sector and the environment. Because despite the claims of British shock jocks, you can’t actually grow concrete — but you can grow graphene.

UK named Europe’s top tech sector with $1 trillion valuation,Thomas Macaulay,2022/12/23,"
New research values the UK tech industry at a whopping $1 trillion (€942 billion)  — making it comfortably the leading ecosystem in Europe.
This sector is now worth more than double Germany’s ($467.2 billion) and three times more than France’s ($307.5 billion), according to a report by data provider Dealroom. The UK also leads the continent in overall funding, unicorns, and startup numbers.
“UK tech has remained resilient in the face of global challenges and we have ended the year as one of the world’s leading destinations for digital businesses,” said Digital Minister Paul Scully in a statement. “This is good news and reflects our pro-innovation approach to tech regulation, continuing support for start-ups, and ambition to boost people’s digital skills.”
Breeding unicorns
Dealroom conducted the research for the Digital Economy Council, which is part of the British government’s Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport (DCMS).
The study found that fast-growing UK tech companies raised a near-record £24 billion (€27.3 billion) during 2022 — more than France and Germany combined. A total of 144 unicorns and 237 futurecorns have now been created in the country — up from 116 unicorns and 204 futurecorns at the same time last year.
DCMS credited sustained upskilling, investment, and growth for the expansion of the sector, which now employs 3 million people. The department also noted the UK’s focus on standards and values. It highlighted recent proposals for AI regulation, based on core principles such as safety, transparency, and fairness. DCMS claims it’s taken a less centralized approach than that of the EU.
Fintech dominance
The UK becomes the third country to hit the  $1 trillion milestone, after China and the US. A large chunk of this figure comes from British fintech, which dominates Dealroom’s list of the most valuable startups.
The Amsterdam-based organization named Worldplay, a payments software firm, as the UK’s most valuable tech company. The top five also included Revolut, FNZ, Rapyd, and Blockchain.com. 
Rounding out the rankings were The Access Group, Checkout.com, Global Switch, JustEat, and ION Group. The combined valuation of the top 10 is $177.9B — almost 20% of the entire ecosystem. 
Green energy also attracted growing investment — a shift that’s set to accelerate in the coming years.

Europe moves to protect WFH — as Musk does the reverse at Twitter,Thomas Macaulay,2022/11/4,"
Elon Musk is causing consternation among his new employees. According to Bloomberg News, Twitter’s new owner is set to cut around 3,700 jobs – about half the company’s workforce.
Those who remain are also bracing for upheaval. Musk reportedly intends to scrap the platform’s work-from-anywhere policy and mandate returns to offices from Monday.
The U-turn has reignited calls for legal rights to work-from-home on both sides of the Atlantic.
Changing times
Musk’s mooted move would scrap a groundbreaking policy. In 2020, Twitter became one of the first tech firms to allow staff to work from home indefinitely. 
The policy quickly proved popular with staff. In an internal survey that June, nearly 70% of employees said they wanted to continue working-from-home (WFH) at least three days a week. 
Twitter gave them further assurances this year. In March, the company reiterated the pledge to permit full-time remote work “forever.”
Musk, however, has been a vocal critic of the approach. In May, the world’s richest person demanded that staff at SpaceX and Tesla spend a minimum of 40 hours in the office per week. 
A pro-Musk Twitter account, Whole Mars Blog, asked the entrepreneur what he’d tell people who think coming into work is an antiquated concept.
“They should pretend to work somewhere else,” he replied.

They should pretend to work somewhere else
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2022

 
Musk is far from alone in calling for obligatory returns to offices. Supporters of the switch argue that WFH negatively impacts productivity, morale, and communication. Yet moves are afoot to take the decision out of their hands.
Legal rights
In Europe, many workers would balk at Musk’s demands. A 2021 survey of over 10,000 office-based workers across eight European countries exposed extremely negative feelings about ending WFH. The study found that most employees want mandatory work from offices to be illegal.

Their hopes may not be in vain. While US federal labour laws don’t yet include a right to flexible working, a range of countries in Europe are making moves to protect it by law.
A recent EU report found that 10 states in the bloc have adopted new regulation on telework since the start of the pandemic. Among them is the Netherlands, which is poised to make WFH legal right.
In July, the lower house of the Dutch parliament approved legislation that would establish home working as a legal right. If the new rules are passed by the Senate, employers will be forced to consider requests to work from home, as long as the jobs allow it.

Spain has also introduced legal rights for remote workers, while Italy has regulated “agile work” since 2017. Italy’s rules were rarely used until the COVID-19 outbreak, when the government used the regulation to combat the virus.
“By no surprise, even after the ‘return to the normality,’ the majority of the illuminated employers have chosen — or, sometimes, been forced to by their employees — to consider the agile work as an essential part of their organization and a powerful tool to attract talent,” said Michele Bignami, a partner at the law firm Advant.
In Germany, meanwhile, a new law is being drafted that would enshrine a right to request remote work. The employer would only be allowed to decline because of operational reasons.


Employees’ enthusiasm for mobile working is decreasing.


Markus Künzel, a Munich-based head of employment law at Advant, says acceptance of WFH in Germany varies between companies.
“The possibility to work from anywhere, even from abroad, is a benefit that can satisfy existing employees as well as attract new professionals and highly qualified workers — also from abroad,” he said.
“At the same, however, we see that the employees’ enthusiasm for mobile working is decreasing in the current crisis period and that many employees would like to return to the office also with regard to the increased costs at home.”
Indeed, not every move to protect remote working in Europe has been welcomed.
Mixed reactions
In the UK, a new Flexible Working Bill has raised concern from experts.
“Giving people the right to request flexible working from their first day of employment doesn’t make a jot of difference when the reality of ways of working often aren’t revealed till much later,” said Molly Johnson-Jones, founder of the Flexa Careers, which has advised Depop, Esports Technologies, and Carwow on flexible working policies.
“It also doesn’t mean that employers have to respond, but may well create tension between employees who make flexible working requests, and companies who wriggle out of accommodating them.”
Johnson-Jones is particularly worried about the impact this will have on workers with caring responsibilities or disabilities.


All employers have a duty of care.


Legal experts have emphasised that employees must provide a safe workplace for remote workers. This can encompass a range of requirements, from providing secure equipment to ensuring compliance with regulations, such as GDPR.
“All employers have a duty of care to provide their staff with a safe working environment, even if this is their home address,” said Paul Kelly, head of the employment law team at Blacks Solicitors.
That might not be a priority for Elon Musk, but other bosses are more amenable. Amid a global shortage of tech talent, legal protections on WFH could give European firms a rare edge in the labour market.

The hybrid workplace could make tech companies less inclusive — here’s what you can do,Andrea Hak,2022/08/22,"
We all know the drill. During the pandemic, offices shut-down, employees worked from home… and companies discovered, it wasn’t all bad.
Now, with half of workers wanting to continue the work from home life and the other half running back to the office with open arms, companies are weighing the potential benefits of remote, hybrid, and flexible work arrangements.
In the wake of the ‘Great Resignation,’ some say that offering remote and hybrid work options can even help create a more equitable work environment by leveling the playing field, allowing for more flexibility, and limiting the microaggressions people of color often have to confront in the workplace.
And a number of surveys support this by showing that diverse talent are in fact more likely to be searching for remote opportunities. This comes at a time when tech companies are coming under more scrutiny to improve on diversity and inclusion (D&I).
As a result, a number of opinion pieces have come out encouraging tech companies to offer remote and hybrid work as a means to attract more diverse candidates.
But before you start posting up a storm of vacancies, we need to stop and consider. Offering more remote and flexible work options may make our companies more diverse, but will it make them more inclusive? And will these benefits be enough to retain diverse talent in the long-term?
It’s not that simple. Here we’ll dig deeper into data gathered by Techleap.nl and D&I experts from the fast-growing Dutch tech scene.
Unintended consequences
As Slack found in its recent Future Forum Pulse:
“Executives, white knowledge workers, men and non-parents are opting into in-office work at higher rates, raising the risk that proximity bias could entrench existing inequities.”
While remote and flexible work options can provide easier working conditions, it can also bring a new divide between those who are in the office and those who work online.
When it comes to salary and promotion opportunities, it’s those who are seen on a daily basis who are top of mind. When it comes time for performance reviews, how will managers assess the performance of their remote employees vs those they see in person every day? These are just a few of the many new complexities that the future of remote, hybrid, and flexible work can bring.


 To improve D&I, we need to dig deeper into the potential side effects.


What’s more, diversity is an umbrella term that encompasses so many different people and situations, making introducing new D&I processes a complex undertaking with many variables to consider. What might have positive consequences for one group may have a negative impact on another. Even within one group, the impact of a new initiative or process can have different impacts depending on your perspective and even unintended spillover effects.
There are now a number of articles that generally proclaim hybrid and flexible work approaches improve gender equality. But, if you look at the research that’s been conducted so far, you can see mixed results. While some studies show that remote work allows more working mothers the flexibility they need to continue participating in the workforce, others show that these kinds of initiatives can reinforce traditional gender roles.
One great example is the Netherlands’ experience with part-time work. While its introduction was meant to help more parents find a better work-life balance, it led to more women than men taking part-time work.

While it means mothers are indeed continuing to participate in the workforce, with women working less hours, it also exacerbates the gender gap in terms of pay and promotion.

Are we doomed?
No. But when introducing such a sweeping change as hybrid work, we need to be more aware and intentional about how, what, and why we’re introducing these changes and how they’ll impact other processes across the organization.
All this is to say that, if we truly want to improve diversity and inclusion with a new process or initiative, we need to dig deeper into the potential side effects and fully consider what we want to achieve.


 People mean different things when they say hybrid work.


Whether or not you’re adopting a hybrid work structure to attract more diverse talent, the future of work is moving in this direction and, as such, we need to consider how diversity and inclusion will factor in moving forward.
Sounds overwhelming?
We spoke with two experts to find out how we can build more diverse and inclusive hybrid and flexible work structures.
Start with data
Here in the Netherlands, a recent report by Techleap.nl, Diversity Hero, and the NLdigital Task Force Diversity & Inclusion and supported by the Dutch ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate + Booking.com showed that, while the Dutch tech ecosystem has made some improvements, it still has a long way to go.
The report, launched during TNW Conference 2022, was the first time the Netherlands introduced a benchmark specifically on D&I for the tech industry, representing 30,000 employees. It found that:

Women now make up 30% of leadership roles within the digital industry
21% of tech roles are occupied by women
22% of women are in senior tech roles

Source: Accelerating greater inclusion and diversity in the tech industry
However, the Netherlands, like the rest of Europe, suffers from a lack of diversity data, with gender the only indicator that’s regularly tracked by tech companies. The report found that 70% of companies do not track ethnicity data, while disability, socio-economic background, orientation, and neurodiversity are among the least (if ever) tracked indicators.
Source: Accelerating greater inclusion and diversity in the tech industry
One of the authors of the report, Yeni Joseph, Lead of the Taskforce Diversity and Inclusion by NLdigital, explained why it’s essential to start tracking this data now:
If we actually measure the current situation of D&I in the workplace, we’ll know better which interventions are needed to accelerate change and improvements. And, this really allows us to actually measure the impact/effect of those interventions.
By having D&I data, companies can set dedicated KPIs, goals, targets (and treat it as seriously as e.g. sales targets). Because too often there are no dedicated D&I KPIs, there is no consequence for not meeting D&I targets, as they are seen as ‘nice to haves.’ We know that ‘what gets measured, gets done easier/faster.’ Especially with companies in the tech space that are used to making decisions based on data.
By joining an industry benchmark (like the D&I in digital benchmark by Diversity Hero) companies can compare their own efforts and results with others in the industry to actually know where they stand. If they do well, it’s something that helps them to attract new, diverse talent. If not, they can learn from peers in the industry how to improve.
Define what the future of work means for you
Dr. Yuval Engel, Associate Professor of Entrepreneurship at the University of Amsterdam and an expert in startups’ D&I practices, says the most important thing to do is define the question you want to answer.
And it’s not as simple as saying: “If we introduce hybrid work, will our organization become more diverse/inclusive?”
“People mean different things when they say hybrid work,” Engel said. “And then, even for people that mean the same thing, companies implement it differently, so it comes in many different flavors. Then people use these flavors in many different ways.”
Introducing a completely new system like this can be extremely disorienting at first, because it uproots established norms and creates a sort of workplace wild west until new ones are formed.
Start by defining what hybrid, flexible, or part-time work means for your company. Does hybrid work mean working from home one or four days a week? If you have a meeting, where can people dial in from? Even simple things like deciding whether people should have their cameras off or on during meetings are important to define from the start.
Redefine the ideal worker
Having half of your staff working remote can easily lead to bias during performance review, compensation, and advancement conversations.
“If the ideal worker is still the one who comes to the office regularly, the one that stays up late working on whatever is urgent, etc, this will unconsciously create an image of who the top performers are based on old ideals,” Engel said.
If you implement a hybrid system, but your image of who the ideal worker is doesn’t adapt to it, then everything remains serving the existing power structures, which tend to benefit certain demographic groups and not others.
Rethinking your image of the ideal worker, Engel added, “helps change all the policies from ‘Who are we hiring?’ to ‘How are we promoting people and what type of remuneration are they getting?’”
Having trouble defining these terms?
Not to worry. The missing ingredient in creating an inclusive culture is often making the process itself inclusive.
Joseph suggests using surveys to learn more about the workplace models that your employees are looking for and actually desire:
When crafting hybrid work policies, be aware of the inequities hybrid work can create or worsen. Designing with these practical dimensions of inclusion in mind is critical for creating an equitable organization. For example, offering sufficient (financial) support to have the right facilities to work from home like office furniture, supplies, stable internet connection, etc.
Last but not least, don’t forget the power of connection. A number of studies show that, while remote has its upsides, loneliness is often the tradeoff. But the more friends employees have at work, the more likely they are to be engaged and satisfied with their job.
“Create opportunities/moments to celebrate and recognize success, both as a company/team and as individuals,” Joseph said.

Egypt’s booming startup scene is becoming the gateway to MENA,Marris Adikwu,2022/07/25,"
In the last few years, Egypt’s startup ecosystem has become one of the most vibrant on the continent, presenting rapid growth potential for the near future. According to a recent report by Startup Genome, Cairo, the country’s bustling capital, marked an overall increase of 60% in VC funding rounds over the past five years, and in 2021, saw a 156% increase in total VC funding rounds compared to 2020.
Walking on the streets of Cairo, it’s now common to see colorful billboards bearing the distinct logo of Fawry, an e-payments platform which has gained funding big enough to attain unicorn status. Other startups like Vezeeta and Swvl are not only offering seamless essential services to a wide client base, but also attracting major investments that boost Egypt’s track record in the tech startup space.
According to Walid Faza, Chief Operating Officer at MSA Capital, Egypt is now seen as the tech hub of Africa, and a lot of products coming out of the country could scale to the rest of the continent with sufficient funding.
“Over the past two or three years, we’ve seen exponential growth in Egypt,” he says, speaking at the recent Hangout with VCs event organized by Egypt’s Information Technology Industry Development Agency (ITIDA) and TNW. “Companies in the country are solving real problems and are tackling the bottom of the pyramid – they have innovation that can really scale and have an impact.”
Here, we’ll take a look at Egypt’s burgeoning startup ecosystem and a lot of important takeaways for VCs looking to invest in emerging markets and entrepreneurs thinking of launching their startup in the country.
Egypt’s supercharged startup scene
According to Disrupt Africa’s 2021 Egyptian Startup Ecosystem report, 562 tech startups were in operation across Egypt as of September 2021, making it the fourth largest startup ecosystem on the continent. Out of those, at least 318 Egyptian startups have raised almost $800 million in funding since 2015.
Unlike most African countries where finance platforms take the lead in the tech ecosystem, Egypt’s fintech startups come in second place behind e-commerce. However, each of the 65 active startups here have grown at a rapid pace, making Egypt the fourth largest country in fintech investments in Africa and the second largest in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The Egypt Fintech Landscape Report 2021 shows that 24 of these startups have expanded within and outside the country, and are now established across the Gulf Cooperation Council and in Europe.
Before 2017, there were only six active telehealth startups in operation, but as the demand for digital healthcare services goes up, the telehealth sector in Egypt has grown to over 53 ventures, providing solutions for bookings, virtual healthcare, diagnostics, health insurance, and emergency response. But as the Startup Ecosystem report explains, all of these startups are based in Cairo, which proves that there’s room for more investment in this sector.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have also found a thriving place in Egypt’s ecosystem. The startups in these subsectors cover different areas like bot building, business intelligence, big data solutions, and AI solutions in cybersecurity and queue management. The Egyptian government is now tapping into this nascent sector to refocus on its once-thriving offshoring industry, which presents remarkable growth potential for the country.
Egypt’s fourth fast-rising sector is educational tech, with 42 startups making up 7.5% of the tech ecosystem. These startups are a mix of online learning platforms, learning management systems for educational institutions and value-added learning solutions. Along with establishments in other key sectors like transport, logistics, marketing, and real estate, about 39% of Egypt’s startups have taken part in an acceleration or incubation program, including renowned international accelerators such as Y Combinator and 500 Global.
The era of funding
From 2015 to 2021, 318 startups from Egypt have raised $791 million in total funding, across 447 different rounds. According to the startup analysis platform Disrupt Africa, investment in the country’s startup ecosystem really took off in 2017, with 139% growth in the number of funded ventures. This steady growth continued until 2019, where more Egypt-based startups were backed than any other on the continent, including the traditional ‘big three’ of South Africa, Kenya, and Nigeria.
The early stages of tech startup investment in Egypt may have been dominated by e-commerce and telehealth, but the last few years have seen higher investor interest in the fintech space. Funding in this sector took off last year, and is now responsible for more than one-third of the total raised by Egypt’s startups in the first nine months of 2021.
The number of active investors in the country is also on the rise. Out of 122 named investors so far, the majority each year are international accelerators like Flat6Labs and Y Combinator. However, Egypt’s startup scene also maintains a strong local VC presence, securing funding from firms such as Algebra Ventures, Kepple Africa Ventures, and Sawari Ventures.
In September 2021, Plug and Play and ITIDA announced the opening of an accelerator and incubator to develop Egyptian startups. The three-year agreement outlined an accelerator program that will run two cycles each year, targeting a total of 60 companies. The incubator will provide support to 60 early-stage startups each year, split into two cycles.
What’s behind the current investor interest in Egypt’s startup scene?
In a few years, Egypt transformed into a fast growing hub for startups across the MENA region. With a population of over 100 million people and one of the fastest growing economies in the region, Egypt presents a teeming market for companies providing digital solutions for everyday needs.
“The current global economic slowdown has brought a shift towards investing in startups with sustainable business models that are filling a technology gap in the market,” explained Ahmed Mahmoud, founder and CEO of AI-driven software company DXwand, at the Hangout with VCs event. This presents an important opportunity for isolation and market penetration.” This is one of the strengths of the Egyptian ecosystem.
According to Mahmoud, the Egyptian government is also boosting the country’s appeal as an investment destination by making significant efforts to support tech startups. “In addition to this, there’s an exposure to talent and training on a global scale (among Egypt’s startups), and we’re also exposing our talent and experiences to other perspectives,” he says. “There’s also more access to talent as universities are starting to collaborate with startups, and laws are being made to protect startups.”
In fact, fellow panelist Oscar Ramos, general partner at SOSV’s Orbit Startups, decided to invest in DXwand the previous year. According to Ramos, “They built one of the most sophisticated NLP engines for Arabic languages.”
Working for a Chinese investment firm, an important message Ramos had for entrepreneurs growing their startup in Egypt was to look for investment opportunities outside of the traditional markets.
“We are seeing right now that investors from Asia are also looking more and more at Africa, North Africa, and the Middle East for investment opportunities. And that can be a very big opportunity for entrepreneurs whereas, traditionally, they tend to look at the US as the most relevant market. Obviously, the US is huge in creation and very relevant for anybody, but it’s also worth considering other options.”
What the future holds for Egypt’s startup ecosystem 
Egypt’s tech industry was the only sector that continued to grow during the pandemic and experts predict that the coming years will break more records. According to Magnitt’s 2022 Egypt Venture Investment Report, the ecosystem observed a 168% year-on-year increase in capital investment to reach a new all-time high record of $491 million. As Egypt takes on other African ecosystems to compete for more investment funds, it’s clear that the country is set to maintain a strategic position in the growing startup market.
The Egyptian government has become proactive when it comes to supporting the local tech startup market. This support is evident from several government-backed initiatives like the intellectual property rights protection guide for startups, the Central Bank’s $64 million fintech fund, scholarship programs for tech entrepreneurs and the launch of the Creativa Innovation Hubs in collaboration with public universities, to support students and startups to meet up, access resources and develop digital solutions. With government support in this growing ecosystem, Egypt is on track to becoming one of the most advanced tech ecosystems in Africa.
