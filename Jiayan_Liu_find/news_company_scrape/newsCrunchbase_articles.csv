North American Startup Funding Fell Across All Stages In Q2,Joanna Glasner,2023/07/7,"

The good times are not back for North American venture funding. 
Sure, there may be upbeat signs, like the mounting AI buzz and some resurgence in the IPO and M&A markets. But when it comes to the actual funding tallies, the totals are unequivocally trending lower.
How far down? For the second quarter of 2023, investors put $31.8 billion into seed- through growth-stage rounds for U.S. and Canadian startups, according to preliminary Crunchbase data. That’s by far the lowest quarterly total in more than three years.
For perspective, we chart out quarterly investment totals, color-coded by stage, for the past 10 quarters below:


Funding was down at every stage both quarter over quarter and year over year, with the most pronounced decline at later stages (Series C and beyond). In addition to putting less money to work, investors completed the lowest number of deals in two years, as shown in the chart below: 


Still, there were some large financings in the second quarter, including a $450 million Series C for generative AI platform Anthropic, and a $401 million Series D for gene therapy startup ElevateBio. 
Also, seed- and early-stage dealmaking saw relatively modest quarter-over-quarter declines, so the pipeline of fundable companies remains pretty robust.
For a more detailed sense of how the quarter and first half of the year played out, we break things out by stage below. We also take a look at exits, both M&A and IPOs, and contemplate where things are likely to go from here.
Late stage and technology growth
We’ll start with late stage, which typically gets the largest share of investment.
For Q2, North American startups pulled in $15.3 billion in late- and technology growth-stage financings1, per Crunchbase data. That’s a drop of 48% quarter over quarter and 54% year over year. 
The declines look less steep when we consider that the Q1 total included a huge and unusual transaction: the $10 billion Microsoft-backed round for OpenAI, which calls itself a “capped profit company governed by a nonprofit.” Without that deal, Q1 and Q2 totals would be much closer together.
Round counts also ticked up slightly in Q2. This indicates investors are slightly more open to consummating deals, albeit at valuations often far below the 2021 peak. 
For the bigger picture, we lay out total investment and round counts over five quarters below:


Investors also didn’t shy away from big rounds. Besides the two aforementioned financings for Anthropic and ElevateBio, other large funding recipients included drone operator Zipline ($330 million Series F), construction equipment marketplace EquipmentShare ($290 million Series E, and AI software provider Cohere ($270 million Series C).
Early stage
As venture investment contracted over the past several quarters, declines have been more pronounced at the late stage than the early stage. This seems logical, given that late-stage valuations are more driven by public market comps and the state of the IPO market. Early-stage investors, by comparison, have longer time horizons and are less impacted by the immediate exit environment.
Given that, it wasn’t surprising to see that early-stage investment was relatively flat, with $13.5 billion invested in Q2, down just 2% from the prior quarter.
Year over year, however, the comps look less favorable. Second-quarter early-stage investment was down 47% from the same period in 2022. Round counts followed a similar pattern. 
For a look at the dynamics over the past five quarters, we chart out early-stage investment totals and round counts below:


As usual, a handful of outsized rounds boosted the quarterly totals. For Q2, there were at least 22 early-stage rounds of $100 million or more. 
The largest funding recipient was AI cloud infrastructure startup CoreWeave, which raised $441 million across two rounds. Next up were two RNA medicine companies: ReNAgade Therapeutics ($300 million Series A) and Orbital Therapeutics ($270 million Series A)
Seed
Turning to seed and angel stage, we see that investment fell in Q2, hitting the lowest quarterly level in years.
Overall, investors put $3 billion into North American investments at this stage, down 39% year over year and 13% quarter over quarter. Round counts also declined, although current Q2 tallies remain preliminary.
For a broader view, we charted out seed and angel investment totals and round counts for the past five quarters below:


Not all sectors are seeing a decline in seed funding. Per Crunchbase data, a number of areas remain hot for recently founded companies, including generative AI, esports, and tools for finding and filling jobs. 
We’re seeing some jumbo-sized seed rounds as well. In Q2, the standout was a $50 million seed financing for Hippocratic AI, a developer of AI technology for health care.
Exits
In terms of investment returns, the second quarter wasn’t a red-hot period for either startup acquisitions or public offerings. However, some good-sized exits did happen. Below, we look at the highlights.
IPOs
While the IPO market remained quiet in Q2, a few companies did manage to carry out market debuts.
The biggest offering came from Cava, a venture-backed Mediterranean-inspired eatery chain that saw shares spike after trading commenced in late June. The Washington, D.C.-based company recently had a market cap of more than $8 billion.
Net Power, a Durham, North Carolina-based provider of emissions-free power from natural gas, also carried out a sizable offering. The company completed a SPAC merger in June and had a recent market cap around $860 million.
To flesh things out, we put together a list of five funded companies that completed public listings in Q2:


M&A
The second quarter also was a reasonably busy period for venture-backed M&A, with multiple 10-figure acquisitions and several in the hundreds of millions.
Scopely, a Culver City, California-based game studio, inked the largest deal. In April, Savvy Gaming Group, a game developer owned by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, announced plans to acquire the 12-year-old company for $4.9 billion.
Next up, Databricks announced in late June that it is acquiring MosaicML, a provider of generative AI tools for developers, in a transaction valued at around $1.3 billion. The same week, Visa announced its purchase of Pismo, a digital banking technology platform, for $1 billion in cash.
For a quick rundown of big startup M&A deals for the quarter, we used Crunchbase data to assemble a list of the top nine:


Summing up and looking forward
Overall, with the exception of a few big exits and unicorn rounds, it wasn’t the most upbeat quarter for startup funding. Total startup investment is only about one-third what it was at the peak in Q4 of 2021. 
One consolation, however, is that when things go down, that sets a lower bar to clear for subsequent quarters. In Q3 of 2023, for instance, North American startup investors will have to do just $33 billion worth of deals to qualify as a sequential “up” quarter. 
Future uncertainties notwithstanding, this seems like an entirely realistic benchmark to hit. And remember: If the IPO market comes back, we should start seeing large pre-IPO rounds getting done too. Those have been largely absent since market debuts dried up over a year ago.
So, maybe this is the bottom. Coming from someone who was quite premature forecasting a peak a few years ago, I wouldn’t put great faith in such a prediction. Durations of market cycles are notoriously hard to pin down. 
But still, a hit public offering from a high-profile unicorn or two could do a lot to spark a startup funding rebound. 
Sometimes, it doesn’t take much to tip investors’ mindset from frugality to FOMO.

SoftBank Backs Japanese Robotics Startup Telexistence in $170M Round,Chris Metinko,2023/07/6,"

Japanese robotics firm Telexistence raised a $170 million Series B, which included a commitment from new investor SoftBank Group.
The deal comes just weeks after SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son told investors the firm will shift from “defense mode” back to “offense mode” and is looking at being the leader in the AI revolution.
“Now, the time has come to shift to offense mode,” Son said.

The new deal seems to fit into that AI thesis, as Telexistence creates AI-powered robotic arms for the retail and warehousing sectors. The company has deployed its robots in 300 FamilyMart convenience stores in Japan.
Aside from SoftBank, other investors in the round include previous investors Monoful Venture Partners, KDDI Open Innovation Fund and Airbus Ventures, and new investors HH-CTBC Partnership (Foxconn Co-GP Fund), and Globis Capital Partners.
The deal also includes a strategic business partnership agreement with SoftBank Robotic Group, a subsidiary of SoftBank, for commercialization in North America.
Founded in 2017, the company has now raised nearly $200 million, per Crunchbase.
Robotics funding
Funding in robotics has slumped after having a breakout in 2021, according to Crunchbase data.
In 2021, robotic startups globally raised about $17 billion total. However, that number fell to only $9.6 billion last year and thus far only $3.6 billion in 2023.
Whether this latest round will bring any heat to the sector is impossible to say, but it is clear Telexistence plans to quickly scale up.
“With this latest funding, we aim to amplify our search for top, diverse talent to enhance our global capabilities at scale,” said CEO Jin Tomioka in a release.

"‘Excited’ And ‘Scary’: After Sizzling First Half, Don’t Expect AI Investment To Cool Off",Chris Metinko,2023/07/6,"

This article is Part Four of our Mid-Year Report on an eventful 2023 in tech, startups and venture capital. In Part One we took a look at data and trends over the last six months. Part Two shared survey results from our readers about the rest of the year. And Part Three revealed our IPO predictions for 2023.
Artificial intelligence hasn’t just dominated the tech world through the first half of this year — its use and applications have dominated the buzz in nearly every aspect of our lives from employment to dating.
That certainly has been true in the venture capital and investing world as well, as one huge funding round has been followed by even bigger ones, and seemingly every startup has scrambled to call themselves “AI-enhanced” or “AI-powered.”

“It both excites me and scares me at the same time,” joked Mark Sherman, managing director at Telstra Ventures, about investing in the AI sector in the current environment.
“There are people definitely looking to grab certain segments (of AI) that could enjoy doing something similar to what OpenAI has done,” he  added. “Some segments will, and others will be shown to have false momentum.”
VCs and corporations have poured money into the space through the first half of the year, spending big on generative AI platforms, support infrastructure and specific AI applications in certain sectors like health care and biotech.
Before taking a look at what the second half of 2023 may hold, let’s quickly look at AI’s big first part of the year.
The first half
While it’s true AI started taking off late last year — when startups such as San Francisco-based AI video and audio editing tool Descript, and Austin, Texas-based AI content platform Jasper raised big rounds — the craze hit a new level with OpenAI.
In January, news swirled that OpenAI, the company behind the artificial intelligence tools ChatGPT and DALL-E, could be valued at $29 billion in a new tender offer. By the end of the month, Microsoft confirmed it had agreed to a “multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment” into OpenAI, believed to be about $10 billion.
That was only the start. San Francisco-based Adept AI raised a $350 million Series B at a reported post-money valuation of at least $1 billion in March. And Anthropic — a ChatGPT rival with its AI assistant Claude — raised a $450 million Series C that reportedly valued the company at $5 billion in May.
Finally, in late June “personal AI” startup Inflection AI nabbed a huge $1.3 billion round led by Microsoft, Reid Hoffman, Bill Gates, Eric Schmidt and new investor Nvidia. The round valued Inflection AI at $4 billion, according to Forbes
Those rounds were just a sampling of investors’ insatiable appetite for AI, as countless other startups raised cash in the sector even as funding continued to dip in almost every other industry.
VCs were not the only ones taken with the new technology, as the OpenAI round shows. Large corporations and their VC arms — including Google, Zoom Ventures, Nvidia, Oracle and Salesforce Ventures 1 — also flooded money into the space, illustrating the tech’s quick adoption.
Looking to invest
Despite the onslaught of investment dollars AI already has seen, expect a lot more.
From new generative AI platforms to infrastructure plays to applications using AI in specific verticals, there is a lot for investors to sink their teeth — and money — into.
“We are very interested in many of the nooks and crannies of AI,” Sherman said.
While the large generative AI platforms like OpenAI and Anthropic have been the investment domain of large firms and corporations, many see opportunity in the infrastructure layer that supports those platforms.


That layer can include anything from chips and enhanced compute to unique data sets to help with modeling.
Startups like CoreWeave, which provides GPU-accelerated compute solutions, and Pinecone, which creates vector databases, have raised big money contributing to the foundation layer of AI.
“We are definitely looking at the ‘picks-and-shovels’ approach,” said Mark Edwards, chief investment officer at early-stage investing firm Alumni Ventures, which has invested in semiconductor startup Analog Inference and AI-enabled middleware platform Anything World.


Edwards said there is substantial tech talent currently looking at different ways to increase processing speed and compute while reducing costs — something that will be a necessity for AI to achieve more general adoption.
There are also a substantial number of startups that are putting AI to real-world uses, be it in sales, content creation or designing.
Startups like Character.ai and Jasper raised large rounds within the last nine months, creating platforms to help companies work better with AI.
Many investors see a path for AI to open more doors in several fields like software development, financial services and — perhaps the most mentioned — health care and biotech.


Alumni Ventures is looking at possibilities in drug discovery, insurance and consumer credit, Edwards said. The company already is an investor in Bionic Health, which gives users AI-driven modules to improve their physical health and mental well-being.
Alumni is even looking at using AI itself to help manage its back office operations such as legal compliance, managing accounts and tax reporting.
“There’s a lot of repetitive tasks that require a lot of manual processes,” he said. “So we look at those.”
New market, same old question
Alex Mason, partner at growth equity firm FTV Capital, said while his firm continues to look at different layers of the AI stack, the one constant question is how companies will actually use this technology.
“I think you always need to be asking how companies incorporate AI into their business,” said Mason, whose firm has invested in startups including U.K.-based CloudFactory, which does data labeling for AI.
“I think you have to ask what AI means to the customer,” he added. “There are different stages of adoption.”
However, most agree there will be some level of adoption of AI by nearly every company in almost any sector at some point in the future.
In fact, many investors compare the growth of AI to the mobile revolution that disrupted nearly every sector of our lives just about a decade and a half ago. Just as that transformation excited investors and increased funding, many investors see the same going on in AI right now.
While investors are taking a much more rational approach to investing compared to what went on in 2021, AI is certainly exerting upward pressure on the market, Edwards said.
“I think you have to approach this with patience and humility,” he said. “You have to balance risk and reward.”
Sherman said valuations for AI-related startups are receiving multiples 2x to 6x higher than other software counterparts.
What’s next?
It’s impossible to say for certain what the second half of the year will hold for AI. While there is still much excitement around the technology, there are concerns about risks it can pose if used improperly and its likely effects on the elimination of jobs.
The European Union became the first body to enact regulations on the technology, and many countries — including the U.S. — are expected to follow.
Nevertheless, it has undeniably brought renewed excitement to a slowing VC world.
SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son recently told investors the firm will shift from “defense mode” to “offense mode” — despite recent massive losses — because it wants to be a leader in the AI revolution.
“Now, the time has come to shift to offense mode,” Son said.
Many of the recent AI fundings have come from a mix of corporations or their VC arms. These big-name investors include General Catalyst, Tiger Global and Sequoia Capital, as well as other large players such as Spark Capital and Greylock Partners.
However, with the SoftBank move, it will be interesting to see if the AI buzz will force some well-financed growth investors — that played big roles in the market in 2021 but have been quiet since — back into the venture market.
It has even helped spur on a sleeping M&A market, with Databricks just announcing a huge $1.3 billion deal to acquire OpenAI competitor MosaicML for $1.3 billion.
How that flood of dollars will affect second-half investment in AI isn’t entirely clear. Once hot trends like the metaverse and Web3 had their moments but soon dropped off. AI seems to be a different animal — but time will tell.
“There is an arms race going on,” Mason said. “How does that ripple through the next six, nine, 12 months? We’ll see.”

CADDi Lands $89M In Sagging Supply Chain Management Sector,Chris Metinko,2023/07/5,"

Global procurement startup CADDi locked up an $89 million Series C even as the supply chain management sector has seen a significant decline in funding.

The new round was co-led by existing investors including Globis Capital Partners, DCM, Global Brain, World Innovation Lab, JAFCO Group and Minerva Growth Partners with new investors also participating. Founded in 2017, CADDi has now raised $164 million, per the company.
The Tokyo-based firm operates a business-to-business marketplace for the manufacturing industry that allows companies to manage quality, cost and delivery within its supply chain infrastructure.
The global supply chain company has ambitious goals. In a release, CADDi said the new cash will help it generate $10 billion in revenue by 2030. It also expects its U.S. office to expand to 100 employees within a year.
CADDi already has 590 employees globally, and has recently established a U.S. division and Mexico supplier operations.
Slumping supply chain
Supply chain management startups were the talk of the VC world after the pandemic rankled many industries’ ability to move materials and goods. 
While the supply chain issues remain even as the pandemic has lessened — especially as labor shortages have persisted and geopolitical tensions have affected importing — venture dollars to the industry have slowed.
In 2021, startups in the supply chain management space raised a record $13.5 billion, per Crunchbase data. Last year, that number fell, but only slightly to $11.4 billion.
Through more than half of this year, however, venture dollars have plummeted.
Supply chain startups have received only $1.4 billion in funding so far this calendar year. That pace would mean a drop of more than 75% in funding to the space.
While a drop in VC dollars this year is common in nearly all industries — AI excluded of course — such a substantial fall seems to indicate the supply chain is not a top VC concern.

Mid-Year Report: Who Could Still Go Public In 2023?,Crunchbase News,2023/07/5,"

This article is Part Three of our Mid-Year Report on an eventful 2023 in tech, startups and venture capital. Part One took a look at data and trends over the last six months. Part Two shared survey results from our readers about the rest of the year. Coming up, we’ll dive deep into trends and data in AI venture funding and their impact.
What does the IPO market look like in the second half of 2023?
While IPOs came to a screeching halt last year, we’ve seen a few promising public offerings in the first half of 2023. Johnson & Johnson spinoff Kenvue, for instance, was valued at $50 billion after it went public on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this year.
Tons of startups are eager to make their public debuts. Mature startups including Stripe and Shein have reportedly mulled over their IPO strategies. Other startups are starting to run out of cash as venture investors pull back — a phenomenon exacerbated by the collapse of preeminent startup bank Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year.

But IPOs are still few and far between, and those that choose to brave the public markets will have to accept that the sky-high public debuts of 2021 likely won’t happen this year. An unprecedented 414 U.S. startups went public in 2021, per Crunchbase data, but that number decreased to 93 in 2022. As of now, only 29 startups have made their public debut this year.
With all that in mind, we make a few bold predictions about the companies that could make their way to the public markets this year, or when the IPO window reopens.
— Keerthi Vedantam
Enterprise software

Databricks: The San Francisco-based data and AI company always makes everyone’s IPO list — and there’s a good reason for that. It is one of the most valuable private companies, with a $38 billion valuation after raising a $1.6 billion Series H led by Morgan Stanley’s Counterpoint Global in 2021. The company recently talked about surpassing a milestone of $1 billion in annual revenue and has hinted coyly at a potential IPO in the past. It also just made a huge acquisition, buying OpenAI competitor MosaicML for $1.3 billion. The deal for MosaicML could be another step toward the public market, as Databricks looks to expand its portfolio of offerings and cash in on an exploding AI market. Databricks has significant investors to eventually appease — the company has raised more than $3.5 billion, per Crunchbase — so an exit makes sense. Databricks also has deep technology — it creates tools and products to help companies view both structured and unstructured data in a single location without moving between different systems — and a growing market. It even already has its own venture arm, Databricks Ventures. It seems like its evolution to a public company is nearly complete.
Icertis: This one may be a bit of a curveball, but just follow along. The Bellevue, Washington-based contract management software developer locked up $150 million in financing in late 2022. The funding was an even split of a revolving credit facility and convertible financing from Silicon Valley Bank (yes, that bank). At the time, Icertis CFO Rajat Bahri said the deal would help “build towards the next exciting chapter in our company’s journey.” Could that be an IPO? Eventually convertible notes need to be converted. An IPO allows that to happen. Also, Icertis’ contract platform helps companies structure their commercial, legal and operational data within contracts, and connect that data to its other internal systems such as human resources and CRM platforms. While not the sexiest of markets, allowing data to flow through different internal systems is a big market. The company also is already big. In March 2021, Icertis announced an $80 million Series F at a valuation of more than $2.8 billion and in early 2022 it was reported the company was worth $5 billion.
Talkdesk: All the way back in the salad days of 2021, the cloud-based contact center company locked up a $230 million Series D and became a decacorn. The San Francisco-based company also named industry veteran Sydney Carey as its first chief financial officer. Carey joined Talkdesk from Sumo Logic, where she helped lead the company’s initial public offering. While Sumo Logic recently became a private company again, perhaps it’s time Talkdesk goes public. Since it’s private, the company does not release financials, but it’s pretty big from some estimates. The company even has its own investment arm, Talkdesk Ventures. It’s also 12 years old, so maybe the time has come?

Consumer startups
I’m not expecting much of an IPO rebound this year for venture-backed companies that are long on futuristic vision and short on real earnings. Investors continue to shy away from companies that launched SPACs and IPOs a couple years ago, most of which are still way down.
However, there could be room for some growth companies with strong revenue and margins to contemplate, and compelling stories to go public. For the consumer and consumer-facing platform space, some names that come to mind include:

Navan (formerly TripActions): OK, I cheated here. Navan already submitted a confidential filing for a planned public offering, which is widely expected later this year. The Palo Alto, California-based company, which offers software for corporate travel and expense management, has raised over a billion dollars in equity financing to date. In December, the company secured $400 million in credit facilities from Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Silicon Valley Bank, less than two months after raising a $304 million Series G at a $9.2 billion valuation. Investors wouldn’t be putting all that capital to work if they didn’t see an exit on the horizon.
Shein: The Chinese fast-fashion giant is another much-talked-about IPO candidate. Shein’s path to a U.S. public listing, however, continues to face hurdles, including objections from lawmakers and a valuation that’s well below peak. Still, even with a cut, Shein was still reportedly valued around $64 billion — enough to generate one of the biggest offerings in a long time.
Upside Foods and Eat Just/GOOD Meat: By most measures, alternative protein upstarts Upside Foods and Eat Just would not be companies deemed likely to dip a toe in IPO waters. Public companies in the space haven’t done so well, most notably Beyond Meat, which is trading close to all-time lows. But last week we got some game-changing news: Upside, a maker of lab-grown meat, and Eat Just, which makes plant-based egg and owns cultivated meat company GOOD Meat, received approval from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to start producing their cell-based proteins. It’s the first such approval from U.S. regulators and could spark investor interest in seeing a public listing for these two early innovators. Plus, to deliver on their vision, they’ll need money to scale, something public investors could potentially provide in abundance.

— Joanna Glasner
Fintech

Stripe: Stripe has been waiting in the wings for an IPO for a while and, as one of the most valuable private companies in the world, is also one of the most obvious predictions on this list. The company filed to go public in 2021, but missed the IPO window when it slammed shut in 2022. The 13-year-old payments provider then pivoted to raise a massive $6.5 billion in a single funding round in March 2023 to cover an upcoming employee tax bill on registered stock units due starting in 2024. It also took a deep step down in valuation to $50 billion — a 47% discount from its most recent funding round two years ago, a deal that valued the company at the time at $95 billion. Prior to its latest funding, Stripe had raised $2.2 billion. The company announced more recently that it has processed $817 billion in transactions in 2022 — up 26% from the previous year. The company reportedly generated $14.3 billion in revenue in 2022. Stripe also laid off 14% of its staff in November 2022, saying “we were much too optimistic about the internet economy’s near-term growth in 2022 and 2023.” Stripe is a well-branded industry leader whose stated mission is to increase the GDP of the internet. If the company steps out, it would be a strong signal that the IPO markets are not frozen.
Klarna: Swedish buy now, pay later provider Klarna has been around for 18 years, so it’s not exactly been in a rush to go public. But the company aims to be profitable in 2023, which would make it a good IPO candidate. And like every other venture-backed startup, it has investors waiting to get their returns. Klarna raised $800 million at a much reduced valuation of $6.7 billion in 2022. Just a year earlier, it had been valued at $44.5 billion in a funding led by SoftBank Vision Fund. Klarna’s revenue in 2022 was reported to be $1.8 billion. Some rivals have already beat it to the public markets — Affirm, a U.S. competitor founded years later in 2012, went public in January 2021 and is currently valued at $4.4 billion. Klarna took steps to cut its losses in half in the first quarter of 2023 compared to a year ago while still growing revenue. And it has said it’s targeting profitability in 2023, another strong hint that an IPO is likely a consideration.

— Gené Teare
Health tech and biotech

Included Health: Included Health was ramping up for an IPO back in 2022, when we could be optimistic about those things. The company, which has raised $344 million, per Crunchbase data, previously hired bankers to help with the process. But, it met the same fate as other companies who thought their 2021 luck would head into the new year, and halted its plans. Included works with companies paying for their own health care services and was part of the growing employee benefits category. While it may have held off on going public, it is more than ready to enter the market.
Lyra Health: I’m still confident a teletherapy or telehealth company will go public sometime this year, if only because adoption of virtual care is still on the rise and some of these companies have already raised their Series F. Lyra was one of the first of its kind — established in 2016, it operates on a direct-to-employer model and has worked with companies like Palantir, Zoom and Amgen to provide teletherapy services. The company has raised $910 million, per Crunchbase data, including a $235 million Series G round back in 2022, upping its valuation to $5.58 billion.
ElevateBio: Why isn’t ElevateBio just a full-fledged big pharma company? The company raised $401 million in Series D funding back in May, and is currently creating the Microsoft 365 of drug development. By that I mean ElevateBio’s enclosed ecosystem of drug discovery, development and manufacturing technologies is all-encompassing. That same ecosystem makes it a favorite among biotech investors and companies vying to partner with Elevate. Biotech IPOs are expected to make a far faster recovery than other tech industries, thanks to strong clinical data exhibited by startups.

"The 10 Biggest Rounds Of June: Inflection AI’s Huge Raise, CleanCapital Cleans Up",Chris Metinko,2023/07/5,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a monthly feature that runs down the month’s top 10 funding rounds in the U.S. See last month’s top rounds here.
While June certainly had its fundraising ups and downs, it ended with a flourish thanks once again to AI and a big $1 billion-plus round.
Aside from the two AI rounds that bookend this list, it was a huge month for biotech and health care, which had four entries on the list. Even a mining and adtech startup made it into the top 10 for the month.

It’ll be interesting to see what the rest of the summer holds.
1. Inflection AI, $1.3B, artificial intelligence: The big news of the month was undoubtedly this Palo Alto, California-based startup. Inflection AI is building what it says will be the “largest AI cluster in the world” and has created large language models to allow people to interact with its AI-powered assistant called Pi, or Personal AI. Pi lets people quickly receive relevant information and advice on their interests. To build the platform, the startup locked up a huge $1.3 billion round led by Microsoft, Reid Hoffman, Bill Gates, Eric Schmidt and new investor Nvidia, which values Inflection AI at $4 billion, according to Forbes, which first reported the news. The new funding brings the total raised by Inflection to more than $1.5 billion, per the company. Founded last year, the generative AI platform is a competitor to other AI firms such as OpenAI and Google. It was co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman, who previously co-founded the Google-owned AI lab DeepMind and serves as CEO at Inflection.
2. CleanCapital, $500M, clean energy: New York-based CleanCapital, a solar and storage developer that invests in early-stage projects, locked up a $500 million commitment from Canadian insurer Manulife Investment Management. CleanCapital will use the money to fund early-stage solar and storage development and acquire other renewable energy assets in the U.S. The company also announced it has deployed more than $1 billion to fund operating, new construction, and early-stage solar and storage development. Founded in 2015, the company has received about $1.1 billion, per Crunchbase.
3. Madhive, $300M, adtech: Advertising software companies have had it tough recently, but not Madhive. The New York-based firm raised $300 million from Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which valued the company at $1 billion, per Axios. The deal gives Goldman a minority stake in the company. Launched in 2015 as Otter TV, Madhive sells its CTV (connected TV) advertising software platform to local TV companies that sell CTV ads. The company already has $100 million, per the Axios report.
4. Aledade, $260M, health care: The Bethesda, Maryland-based company raised a $260 million Series F led by new investor Lightspeed Venture Partners. The round comes just about a year after it locked up a $123 million Series E. The startup provides doctors’ offices with data analytics software so they can better manage their patients and identify those most at risk. The company plans to use the new cash to beef up its services and technology, possibly with acquisitions. The new funding deal values the company at $3.5 billion, Bloomberg reported. Founded in 2014, the company has raised nearly $678 million, per Crunchbase.
5. Upstream Bio, $200M, biotech: It was almost exactly a year ago when Waltham, Massachusetts-based Upstream Bio locked up a $200 million Series A. Last month it was back for another $200 million — a Series B led jointly by Enavate Sciences and Venrock Healthcare Capital Partners. Upstream Bio is developing an antibody that targets thymic stromal lymphopoietin and its receptors that can inflame when things like smoke or allergens are introduced into the environment. The treatment could be useful to those with asthma. Founded in 2004, the company has now raised $400 million, per Crunchbase.
6. KoBold Metals, $195M, mining: What happens when you combine AI with the material needed for lithium-ion batteries? You get big money. Berkeley, California-based KoBold Metals raised a $195 million round led by T. Rowe Price and included a number of big-name investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, and Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos-backed Breakthrough Energy Ventures. The new cash values the climate tech startup at $1.15 billion. KoBold Metals uses artificial intelligence to mine for valuable metals such as cobalt, copper, nickel and lithium used in the production of batteries for a variety of sectors, including electric vehicles. The startup has built a database about the Earth’s layers and uses algorithms to make predictions about where mineral deposits are located around the world. KoBold Metals isn’t new to big rounds. In February 2022, the startup closed a $192.5 million Series B, which included investment from Apollo Projects, Bond Capital, BHP Group and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Founded in 2018, the company has now raised more than $400 million, per Crunchbase.
7. Blackpoint Cyber, $190M, cybersecurity: Cybersecurity, like most sectors, has experienced a slowdown when it comes to venture funding. However, that did not stop Maryland-based Blackpoint Cyber from cashing in. The startup, which offers a security suite of products to managed service providers, raised a $190 million growth investment led by Bain Capital Tech Opportunities. Founded in 2014, the company has now raised more than $200 million, per Crunchbase.
8. Alkeus Pharmaceuticals, $150M, biotech: Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Alkeus Pharmaceuticals closed a $150 million Series B led by Bain Capital Life Sciences. The company specializes in pharmaceuticals to fight Stargardt disease, a leading cause of blindness in children and young adults. In addition to the new funding, Alkeus has also named Dr. Joshua Boger, the founder of Vertex Pharmaceuticals, its executive chairman.
9. Bitterroot Bio, $145M, biotech: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for men, women and many ethnic groups and races in the U.S. and worldwide. Ideally, Bitterroot Bio would like to change that. The Palo Alto, California-based company is focused on novel immunotherapies in cardiovascular disease, and launched from stealth last month with a $145 million Series A led by Arch Venture Partners and Deerfield Management. The company, founded in 2021, hopes to use immunology — including the identification of novel targets and the development of innovative protein therapies — to fight the deadly disease.
10. Runway, $141M, artificial intelligence: New York-based Runway made this list not that long ago after Business Insider reported on this unannounced round. It finally was announced, with Runway raising  a $141 million extension to its December $50 million Series C from Google, Nvidia, Salesforce Ventures 1 and existing investors, among others. At the time of the original report, the new cash valued the company at $1.5 billion. Runway helped develop the AI image generator Stable Diffusion, and launched its video-to-video generative AI app in April. The app lets users transform videos into different styles, such as claymation or watercolors. Founded in 2018, the company has raised nearly $240 million, per Crunchbase.
Big global deals
Despite all the big deals in the U.S., the two biggest occurred abroad last month.

Anhui YOFC Advanced Semiconductor, a manufacturer of silicon carbide power semiconductor products, raised nearly $524 million in a Series A.
Germany-based 1Komma5°, a climate tech startup offering smart-home energy management systems, batteries and more, closed a $467 million Series B.

Methodology
We tracked the largest rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies in June. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late.

"
AI Was Q2’s Big Hope To Reverse The Global Venture Funding Slowdown. It Wasn’t Enough,Gené Teare,2023/07/5,"

Startup investors globally continued to scale back their pace in the second quarter of 2023 despite large funding and M&A deals in the artificial intelligence space.
Global venture funding in Q2 2023 fell 18% quarter over quarter to $65 billion, Crunchbase data shows. That’s down 49% compared to the second quarter of 2022, when startup investors spent $127 billion.
The first half of 2023 is down by similar proportions. In H1 2023, global funding reached $144 billion, marking a 51% decline from the $293 billion invested in H1 2022 and a 10% decline from the second half of 2022.
The slowdown happened despite three notable events in H1: Large rounds to AI-driven companies led by corporate investors Microsoft, Nvidia and Google alongside venture firms; the billion-dollar acquisition of language model training platform MosaicML by data warehouse company Databricks; and the precipitous stock market climb of Nvidia, whose chips power much of the computing to train large language models.
Nearly a fifth of total global venture funding so far this year has come from the AI sector alone, per Crunchbase. It’s safe to say that without the AI fervor kicked off by the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November, venture funding so far in 2023 would have been even lower.
Dollars and deals decline
Crunchbase data shows that we are now four to five quarters into the current funding decline. Since Q3 2022, each quarter’s global funding total has dropped by more than 45% year over year.


Deal volume is down significantly year over year as well, but not by quite as much as funding amounts. Still, deal volumes are down 37% year over year, with each stage posting a decline of more than a third.
More than 6,000 startups raised funding this past quarter, compared to more than 9,500 for the same time period a year ago.


Late-stage funding
Late-stage funding, the most impacted stage during the downturn, totaled $31 billion in Q2 2023 — the lowest quarter on record since 2018. That includes corporate rounds and private equity to venture-backed companies.
Q2 funding amounted to less than half of the $68 billion from a year ago. The number of late-stage companies funded was down 40% from a year earlier.
During the peak market of 2021, late-stage funding neared or surpassed $100 billion each quarter.


Early-stage
Early-stage funding reached $27 billion in the second quarter — down 45% from the $48 billion invested in Q2 2022. Deal counts were down 35%.
This is the lowest funding quarter to early-stage companies since 2021. In total, only around 1,200 companies raised a Series A or B funding last quarter. That compares to more than 2,100 for the same period a year ago.


Seed funding
Seed-funded startups raised $6.8 billion in Q2 2023, down 39% from the $11.2 billion invested a year earlier for the same time period.
This is the lowest quarter of seed funding to startups since 2021. All told, more than 1,500 companies raised a seed round of $1 million or more in the second quarter compared to around 2,500 for the same time period last year.


AI
Companies categorized as AI in Crunchbase raised $25 billion in the first half of 2023, representing 18% of global funding. That includes the $10 billion funding to OpenAI led by Microsoft in January. While that’s down from the $29 billion invested in H1 2022, by comparison it is higher as a proportion of total funding.
Machine-learning startup Inflection AI alone raised $1.3 billion last quarter. Other AI companies that raised large fundings in the second quarter included Anthropic, CoreWeave, OpenAI, Cohere, Builder.ai, and Runway.
Companies in sectors outside of AI also raised large rounds, including China-based fast fashion retailer Shein, Germany-based solar and smart electricity company 1Komma5°, and Sweden-based battery manufacturer Northvolt.
Company closures
The new scaled-back venture funding environment adversely impacts companies that have raised funding since 2021’s very hot market.
Companies that raised in recent years have slashed costs since 2022 — notably by cutting jobs — to increase runway.
In this slower funding environment, many more companies are also struggling to progress from a sizable ($1 million or more) seed round to their Series A funding, Crunchbase data shows. It’s also taking longer to raise a Series B funding round after securing a Series A.
The predicament for many startups only compounds as their customers continue to scale back, further impacting those companies’ growth. That, in turn, makes it even more difficult to raise much-needed new funding.
As startups run out of options, expect more companies to outright shut down in the second half of 2023 and into 2024.
Methodology
The data contained in this report comes directly from Crunchbase, and is based on reported data. Data reported is as of July 3, 2023.
Note that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarter/year.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.
Glossary of funding terms
We have made a change to how we include corporate funding rounds in our reporting as of January 2023. Corporate rounds are only included if a company has raised an equity funding at seed through a venture series funding round.
Seed and angel consists of seed, pre-seed and angel rounds. Crunchbase also includes venture rounds of unknown series, equity crowdfunding and convertible notes at $3 million (USD or as-converted USD equivalent) or less.
Early-stage consists of Series A and Series B rounds, as well as other round types. Crunchbase includes venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $3 million, and those less than or equal to $15 million.
Late-stage consists of Series C, Series D, Series E and later-lettered venture rounds following the “Series [Letter]” naming convention. Also included are venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $15 million.
Technology growth is a private-equity round raised by a company that has previously raised a “venture” round. (So basically, any round from the previously defined stages.)

"Survey Says: Recession Fears Lurk, Readers Tinker With AI, Many Startups’ Runways Running Out",Marlize van Romburgh,2023/07/3,"

This article is Part Two of our Mid-Year Report on an eventful 2023 in tech, startups and venture capital. Part One took a look at data and trends over the last six months. Coming up, we’ll dive deep into trends and data in AI venture funding and their impact.
Most of you still think a recession this year is more likely than not. You’re tinkering with AI tools, but not yet convinced they’re world-changing. Your companies are still slashing costs. And almost a third of you say your companies only have six months of runway left in the bank. (Yikes!)
Those are some of the takeaways from our latest quarterly Crunchbase News reader survey, where we gauged your sentiments about the state of the economy, company financials, and yes, AI.

Most readers surveyed still say a recession is more likely than not this year. Nearly 59% of readers rated the chances of a global economic downturn in 2023 at 6 or above, with 10 being “most likely.” That is down from previous surveys — last quarter, 65% said so, and at the end of 2022, it was a whopping 82% — but it’s not exactly unbound optimism, either.


More than a third — 37.5% — of respondents say they’re feeling more pessimistic now about the state of the global economy than they were at the start of 2023. A similar number feel more upbeat, and about 27% say their outlook is more or less the same compared to the end of 2022.


“Consumers are running out of savings accumulated during the pandemic. This will cause a weakening of demand for goods which will further stress businesses. Many businesses took advantage of the pandemic shortages and interest rate increases to raise prices on consumer goods. As consumer demand weakens, business will feel the pinch, prices will lower and the U.S. economy will go into recession,” said one reader, who works in management consulting.
Another reader, who works in marketing in the retail or restaurant sectors, was more sanguine: “I don’t think we’ll have a recession, and I’m cautiously optimistic that things will start to level out in 2024 as lingering pandemic effects shake out and central banks begin to stabilize interest rates. Of course, that only happens if foreign policy doesn’t completely fall apart.”
With all the mixed signals in the economy, it’s not surprising that the most common word readers use to describe their outlook for the rest of the year is “confused.”


“This is a strange time to say the least,” noted a reader who identified as a tech executive, founder or owner. “On one hand, some areas are booming, such as real estate where homes are disappearing from the market very fast. On the other hand, there are layoffs and caution among business leaders to move forward on new endeavors.”
Others are having flashbacks to the dot-com bust. “The economy seems slightly better than the end of Q4 2022/Q1 2023 although it feels it could go either way at any moment,” said another reader who is a tech executive or owner. “Worst business climate I’ve seen in startup tech since 2000.”
Cost-cutting continues
Almost 40% of respondents in the recent survey said their companies or employers are cutting costs this year. That compares with 45% a quarter ago.


Still, the majority said their companies had not conducted layoffs either this year or last. Given that the largest area for cost-cutting, per the survey, is headcount, presumably many companies are reducing staffing through attrition rather than outright job cuts.




“I think 2023 is a good year for companies to review costs, review employee evaluations, and continue to refine their hybrid work environments,” said a reader who works in real estate operations.
Fewer than half of survey respondents said their company is actively hiring for open roles.




“It feels more likely that the tech hiring rebound will start (moderately) either Q4 2023 or Q1 2024,” predicted a reader who works in professional services.
As with previous surveys, readers are more bullish on their own companies’ financial prospects than they are about the economy at large. The majority rated their optimism about their company at a 6 out of 10 or higher.


Interestingly, two distinct groups of companies seem to be emerging from the current environment: Those with plenty of cash, and those with very little.
Of the readers who answered the question, almost a third said their companies still have more than 24 months of runway in the bank.
But a pretty high percentage — more than 27% of those who answered the question — said their coffers are running dry, with less than six months of runway left in the bank. That lends credence to the idea that there could be a “mass extinction event” on the horizon for many startups.




AI sparks intrigue, skepticism
Artificial intelligence tools have gone mainstream in the past six months and sparked talk of a new technological revolution on the scale of the internet itself.
“Massive changes,” said one reader when asked how AI tools will change the way they work in 2023. “Unlike the crypto hype bubble, there is real value being generated from AI. I am using it every day and so are lots of people. This is going to be a real massive paradigm shift for how humans use technology going forward.”
Other reviews are mixed.
“Lots of solutions looking for a problem with some genuinely innovative use cases mixed in,” said one reader, who works in marketing in the professional services industry. “The key will be separating those useful insights, tools, and processes from the noise.”
Some of the ways readers say they’re already using AI in the office include: Drafting contracts, reviewing marketing materials, doing sales research, outlining presentations, offering internal IT help, writing basic emails, and editing images.
Another reader said the reality of AI doesn’t quite meet the hype: “The tech is still pretty basic and not solving the more complex tasks I was hoping it would accomplish,” said the person, who also works in professional services.
Among the tools listed in the survey, the vast majority of readers — more than 81% — said they’d used OpenAI’s ChatGPT or GPT4 generative AI tools in a professional context. Just over 42% have used Grammarly, an AI-assisted writing and proofing tool.
A much smaller portion of readers cited using other tools, including Google’s Bard, Canva’s Magic Write, Hemmingway, Jasper and Midjourney.
Many readers feel it’s still early innings for AI, but that more profound changes are to come. Said one reader: “It will have a minimal impact in 2023, but I suspect it will greatly alter how we do our work 5-10 years into the future.”
Methodology
Results are from a survey of Crunchbase News readers conducted between June 1 and June 28 in which 121 readers responded. Readers self-identified their industries and roles and were not required to answer all questions to complete the survey.

The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Another Inflection Point For AI? Investors Pour More Money Into The Space,Chris Metinko,2023/06/30,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.
Once again, the week can be summed up in two words we’ve heard all year — artificial intelligence. Investors went crazy again — led mainly by large corporations or their VC arms — dumping big sums of cash into everything AI. That included a huge round of more than $1 billion.

With all the big money thrown around the space, the only real question left is: When will AI start to write this weekly column?
1. Inflection AI, $1.3B, artificial intelligence: The big news of the week was undoubtedly this Palo Alto, California-based startup. Inflection AI is building what it says will be the “largest AI cluster in the world” and has created large language models to allow people to interact with its AI-powered assistant called Pi, or Personal AI. Pi lets people quickly receive relevant information and advice on their interests. To build the platform, the startup locked up a huge $1.3 billion round led by Microsoft, Reid Hoffman, Bill Gates, Eric Schmidt and new investor Nvidia, which values Inflection AI at $4 billion, according to Forbes, which first reported the news. The new funding brings the total raised by Inflection to more than $1.5 billion, per the company. Founded last year, the generative AI platform is a competitor to other AI firms such as OpenAI and Google. It was co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman, who previously co-founded the Google-owned AI lab DeepMind and serves as CEO at Inflection.
2. Runway, $141M, artificial intelligence: New York-based Runway made this list not that long ago after Business Insider reported on this unannounced round. It finally was announced, with Runway raising  a $141 million extension to its December $50 million Series C from Google, Nvidia, Salesforce Ventures 1 and existing investors, among others. At the time of the original report, the new cash valued the company at $1.5 billion. Runway helped develop the AI image generator Stable Diffusion, and launched its video-to-video generative AI app in April. The app lets users transform videos into different styles, such as claymation or watercolors. Founded in 2018, the company has raised nearly $240 million, per Crunchbase.
3. Author Health, $115M, health care: Health care has been big in recent weeks, and this week a big round went to a newly launched mental health startup. Author Health locked up a $115 million round from General Atlantic and Flare Capital Partners. The Boston-based health care platform creates a team of doctors, nurses, therapists and community health workers for Medicare Advantage recipients with serious mental health disorders. Data from The Commonwealth Fund shows 1 in 4 people with Medicare have a mental illness, but only as much as 50% receive treatment. Author Health is the latest startup to look at government health programs as a revenue stream. EasyHealth, Cityblock Health, CareBridge and Spark Advisors are other startups that have done similar.
4. (tied) Celestial AI, $100M, semiconductors: It seems like photonic chips — which use light to send signals as opposed to the electricity used by conventional processors — is becoming a thing with investors. In late May, Boston-based Lightmatter raised $154 million in the space and this week Celestial AI joined it in cashing in. The Santa Clara, California-based startup raised a $100 million Series B funding led by IAG Capital Partners, Koch Disruptive Technologies and Temasek’s Xora Innovation fund. Such tech is needed now more than ever with AI requiring both faster and more energy-efficient computing. Founded in 2020, the company has raised nearly $164 million, per Crunchbase.
4. (tied) Cyera, $100M, cybersecurity: Data may be king, keeping track of it and securing it can be a pain. Enter data security startup Cyera — which locked up a $100 million Series B led by Accel. Cyera offers a platform that helps security teams at companies understand what data they have and how it’s used, as well as how to secure it. Such platforms can be useful as security teams struggle with growing amounts of data while also often facing staffing issues. Since closing its Series A last March, the company says it has realized 800% revenue growth. Founded in 2020, Cyera has now raised $164.5 million across three rounds, per Crunchbase. The round comes amidst a funding slowdown in cyber — which  has seen a significant dip since the fourth quarter of 2021, per Crunchbase data. The sector saw four consecutive quarters of decline before hitting $2.7 billion in the first quarter of this year — a slight uptick from the $2.4 billion in the final quarter of 2022. However, that first-quarter number represented a 58% drop from the $6.5 billion such startups saw in the same quarter of 2022.
4. (tied) Redpanda Data, $100M, data: Streaming data startup Redpanda Data raised a $100 million Series C led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, Google Ventures and Haystack. The San Francisco-based startup provides real-time streaming data services, helped by — you guessed it — artificial intelligence and machine learning. Companies are able to analyze data as soon as it’s collected. The platform works by being both a data storage system and a data streaming system in which companies can integrate their own data into the machine-learning system to bolster responses. The company says it multiplied its revenue growth 5x over and doubled its workforce through its last fiscal year. Founded in 2019, the company has raised nearly $166 million, per Crunchbase data.
4. (tied) Typeface, $100M, artificial intelligence: Yet another AI startup makes the list. San Francisco-based generative AI startup Typeface — which launched in February with a $65 million raise — raised a $100 million Series B led by Salesforce Ventures with participation from Lightspeed Venture Partners, Madrona, GV, Menlo Ventures and M12 (Microsoft’s venture fund). The company’s AI platform helps with enterprise content creation such as product shots, blog posts, social media ads and job posts that meet brand specifications.
8. Augmedics, $83M, health care: Chicago-based Augmedics, a developer of  augmented reality surgical navigation, closed a $82.5 million Series D led by CPMG. Founded in 2014, the company has raised nearly $144 million, per Crunchbase.
9. Presidio Medical, $72M, medical devices: South San Francisco, California-based Presidio Medical, which develops a transformational neuromodulation platform, closed a $72 million Series C led by Deerfield Management. Founded in 2017, the company has raised $102 million, per Crunchbase.
10. (tied) Fly.io, $70M, apps: Chicago-based Fly.io, a remote app delivery network developer, raised a $70 million Series C led by EQT Ventures. Founded in 2017, the company has now raised more than $110 million, per Crunchbase.
10. (tied) K36 Therapeutics, $70M, biotech: Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech startup K36 Therapeutics closed a $70 million Series B led by Nextech Invest. Founded in 2021, this is the first announced round by the company, per Crunchbase.
Big global deals
Inflection’s big round led the way in all deals raised this week, but was followed by two deals from China.

Anhui YOFC Advanced Semiconductor, a manufacturer of silicon carbide power semiconductor products, raised nearly $524 million in a Series A.
Sunwoda Electric Vehicle Battery, a developer of electric vehicle battery packs, closed a $228 million venture round.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of June 24 to June 30. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

"
Why Do VCs Love Electric Car Batteries As Much As Joe Biden Does?,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/06/30,"

It seems like the U.S. tech industry, which has made leaps in smartphone technology, cloud computing and artificial intelligence, now wants to conquer something new: batteries.
Specifically, batteries for electric vehicles. Amid all the hullabaloo around generative AI, the fall of crypto, and the head-scratching discourse around Web3, somehow, electric vehicle batteries are seeing steady — and favorable — funding in the past few years, per Crunchbase data.


Despite a 43% decrease in funding between 2021 and 2022, electric vehicle battery manufacturing still saw more funding in 2022 than it did in 2020. Last year was the sector’s second-best funding year since 2014.
What’s even more interesting is how much of this funding is flowing to the U.S., despite the fact that China dominates the global battery manufacturing sector.
In 2020, only around 20% of all funding to the sector went toward U.S.-based companies. But in 2021, 64% of all funding to the sector was funneled into U.S.-based companies, per Crunchbase data. In 2022, that number rose to 70%.
VCs chase EV subsidies
So, what’s driving battery funding?
It’s the federal government. Seriously. Following the Inflation Reduction Act, which promises subsidies for EV companies, funding has been pouring into the U.S. from local and international investors to ramp up green energy production.
The Inflation Reduction Act is part of a slew of laws to make it easier for electric vehicle manufacturers to produce parts in the U.S. as it attempts to make its manufacturing sector more competitive at a global level.
Last week, the U.S. Department of Energy conditionally approved a $9.2 billion loan to Ford for the construction of electric vehicle battery factories. It’s the largest automaker loan doled out by the DOE since the 2008 financial crisis.
Ford isn’t the only company to bask in the federal government’s new obsession for electric vehicles — General Motors, LG Energy Solution and Rhyolite Ridge are among the U.S.-grown battery companies that received loans. Even Redwood Materials, which was founded by Tesla co-founder JB Straubel, received a $2 billion loan.
The U.S., despite being home to Tesla and some of the biggest electric vehicle companies in the world, trails behind China in terms of battery manufacturing. Because the U.S. is ramping up its own green energy efforts, the country is working to tighten its supply chains amid geopolitical concerns. That makes sense; the war between Russia and Ukraine saw natural gas prices skyrocket. The U.S., which dreams of running on batteries and semiconductors, currently relies heavily on other countries to source the raw materials to make those products.
What’s most interesting here is the relationship between the bureaucratic federal government and the nimble, fast-moving startup world. It just goes to show how influential the public sector is on our private markets.

"From IBM to Databricks, It’s Been A Big Week For Tech M&A",Joanna Glasner,2023/06/29,"

Sometimes, no one is buying. Other times, everyone is spending big.
This week clearly belongs in the latter category for tech and life sciences M&A. Acquirers shelled out nearly $8 billion in disclosed-price acquisitions in industries from generative AI to payments to legaltech.
Several deals exceeded the billion-dollar mark. This includes the biggest buyer, IBM, which is paying $4.6 billion to purchase Apptio, a provider of  financial and operational IT management software, from private equity owner Vista Equity Partners.

Next up is Databricks, which is acquiring MosaicML, a provider of generative AI tools for developers, in a transaction valued at around $1.3 billion. It’s a particularly big number considering San Francisco-based MosaicML emerged from stealth less than two years ago.
The other 10-figure deal was Visa’s purchase of Pismo, a digital banking technology platform, for $1 billion in cash. Pismo, which has operations in Latin America, Southeast Asia and Europe, previously raised at least $118 million from backers including SoftBank, Amazon and Accel.
Altogether, per Crunchbase data, there have been at least 23 acquisitions this week of companies that previously raised known venture or seed funding.1 We list them below:


Possible catalysts for a deal spree
There’s no obvious reason why this week was so busy for tech M&A. However, some possibilities come to mind.
First off, it is the last week of the quarter. Acquirers, many of which are public companies, might have determined it necessary or preferable for financial disclosure reasons to announce consummated deals before July 1. 
Second, surging interest in artificial intelligence is driving some of the dealmaking. The sector accounts for at least two of this week’s larger deals: MosaicML and Thomson Reuters’ $650 million purchase of AI-enabled legal research provider Casetext. 
Third, the largest public acquirers are in a good place with their shareholders. IBM’s share price has been less volatile than most other tech players over the past few quarters, with a recent market cap over $120 billion. Visa and Thomson Reuters, meanwhile, are not too far off their all-time highs. 
Pickup follows slow times for M&A
While this was an action-packed week for M&A deals, 2023 overall has not been shaping up as a busy year for acquisitions.
In the first quarter of the year, the number of disclosed M&A deals for venture-backed startups globally slipped 31% year over year to 491, per Crunchbase data. Overall, the number of startup acquisitions has been trending down for several quarters.


For Q2 2023, preliminary data suggests M&A activity was also somewhat muted, even with this week’s dealmaking uptick. Still, there were some big transactions, such as mobile game developer Scopely’s $4.9 billion April acquisition by Savvy Gaming Group.
Perhaps this week is an indication that predictions of a rise in M&A deals for venture-backed startups this year were premature rather than flat-out wrong. With large-cap tech acquirers largely flush with cash and trading at historically robust valuations, there’s clearly a strong pool of acquirers out there. And with venture funding down and the IPO market still sluggish, there are also plenty of startups that would be quite open to making a deal.

Is Shein Finally Going Public? A Look Into The Company’s IPO History,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/06/29,"

Fast-fashion retailer Shein may finally be on the brink of going public.
The company filed confidentially in the U.S. for its initial public offering, Reuters reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. (In a statement to Axios after the report, Shein denied what it called “rumors.”)
A Shein IPO would be years in the making
Nonetheless, the company has been making moves toward an IPO since at least 2020. The startup, based in China at the time, shelved those plans after rising geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and its headquarters country. In 2022, Shein’s IPO plans were once again put on the back burner due to strict and complex regulatory barriers imposed by the China Securities Regulatory Commission on companies that want to go public offshore.

China has since promised to change its regulatory standards. While keeping its supply chain and warehouse facilities in China, Shein last year moved its headquarters to Singapore, which has laxer regulatory and expansion laws.
In March, rumors swirled that the company was in talks to go public in the U.S. again. In May, the company raised $2 billion at a $66 billion valuation — making it, at the time, the fourth-highest-valued unicorn on The Crunchbase Unicorn Board.
Problems ahead
And now, here we are. If Shein goes public this year, it will be in a much different world than 2020. E-commerce, fueled by the pandemic, made the international fashion brand wildly popular. But post-pandemic the demand for online shopping isn’t what it used to be.
Shein has long been scrutinized by the U.S. for unethical labor practices and the potential damage its clothing production may have on the environment. The company is now navigating stricter environmental regulations that the U.S. and European Union are imposing on imports.
When Shein will go public still remains to be seen. Several highly valued startups, including social networking platform Reddit, car-sharing platform Turo, and grocery delivery service Instacart, have all filed paperwork to go public, but none have their ticker symbols yet.

"AI Funding Explosion: Inflection AI Nabs $1.3B, Runway and Typeface Also Raise Big",Chris Metinko,2023/06/29,"

Who says the venture capital market has slowed?
Certainly not any AI startup at this point. On Thursday, three such startups announced more than $1.5 billion in investments — led by “personal AI” startup Inflection AI’s huge $1.3 billion round.
That funding, led by Microsoft, Reid Hoffman, Bill Gates, Eric Schmidt and new investor Nvidia, values Inflection AI at $4 billion, according to Forbes, which first reported the news. The new funding brings the total raised by Inflection to more than $1.5 billion, per the company.
Inflection AI, with its partners CoreWeave and Nvidia, is building what it says will be the “largest AI cluster in the world” and has created large language models to allow people to interact with its AI-powered assistant called Pi, or Personal AI. Pi lets people quickly receive relevant information and advice on their interests.
Founded last year, the generative AI platform is a competitor to other AI firms such as OpenAI and Google. It was co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman, who previously co-founded the Google-owned AI lab DeepMind and serves as CEO at Inflection.
But that’s not all
Of course, one big round is not newsworthy in AI — even though Inflection’s raise is the second-largest in AI this year, behind only Microsoft’s massive $10 billion investment in OpenAI.
New York-based Runway also raised a $141 million extension to its December $50 million Series C from Google, Nvidia, Salesforce Ventures 1 and existing investors, among others.
The round was first reported about two months ago by Business Insider. At that time, it was reported the money was from a cloud service provider and would value the company at $1.5 billion.
Runway helped develop the AI image generator Stable Diffusion, and launched its video-to-video generative AI app in April. The app lets users transform videos into different styles, such as claymation or watercolors.
Founded in 2018, the company has raised nearly $240 million, per Crunchbase.
Finally, San Francisco-based generative AI startup Typeface — which launched in February with a $65 million raise — also announced on Thursday it has raised a $100 million Series B.
The round was led by Salesforce Ventures with participation from Lightspeed Venture Partners, Madrona, GV, Menlo Ventures and M12 (Microsoft’s venture fund).
The company’s AI platform helps with enterprise content creation such as product shots, blog posts, social media ads and job posts that meet brand specifications.
Big money, big names
While the dollar numbers are eye-catching, so are the names of the investors.
Inflection’s round includes some of the biggest names of individuals in tech, and also includes Microsoft. Microsoft’s VC arm also invested in the Typeface round.
Nvidia, whose stock price has shot up thanks to the importance of its chips in the AI process, took part in both the Inflection and Runway raises.
Google — or GV — and Salesforce Ventures both participated in the rounds for Runway and Typeface.
It seems like no tech giant wants to be left behind in AI — no matter the price.

"
Startups Get Hip To Hypnotherapy,Joanna Glasner,2023/06/29,"

It’s long seemed like our connected devices are conspiring to hypnotize us.
They goad us into wasting untold time scrolling through mindless content, keep us hooked on shows that always deviously end on a cliffhanger, and ply us with listings of stately homes we can’t afford but keep looking at anyway.
This raises the question: If they’re so effective, why can’t our devices hypnotize us in a good way? You know, get us to quit smoking and drinking, exercise, eat well and embrace positive thinking. And while we’re at it, maybe they should get us off our screens.

Turns out, a number of hypnotherapy-focused startups think there’s merit to at least some of this idea. Investors do too. Over the past couple years, they’ve backed seed- and early-stage rounds for multiple startups offering tech-enabled hypnosis and hypnotherapy platforms.
Who’s getting funded
Two of the larger funding rounds came this year. Mindset Health, a Melbourne, Australia-based provider of digital hypnotherapy programs, picked up $12 million in Series A financing in March. And Oneleaf, a French startup offering an assortment of self-hypnosis tools, landed a $5.1 million seed round in January.
Using Crunchbase data, we put together a list of six companies formed or funded in the past few years, that list hypnotherapy or hypnosis as a focus area:


Hypnosis business models
Companies are pitching online hypnosis tools to heal ailments of both mind and body. Mindset Health, for instance, currently has hypnotherapy apps addressing irritable bowel syndrome, menopause and smoking cessation. Oneleaf’s programs aim to help us lose weight, reduce stress, build confidence and alleviate pain, among other goals.
It looks like early days when it comes to determining the optimal business model. Oneleaf is taking the all-you-want subscription approach, charging U.S. customers $68 a year for access to its offerings. Mindset, meanwhile, offers subscription plans for each of its programs, and also works with clinicians to incorporate its offerings into treatments.
Another player, Los Angeles-based WellSet, is going the employer-covered route. Earlier this year, the company launched a self-care benefit package that includes self-hypnosis among its offerings. It’s pitching the package as a tool to help employers “address the burnout epidemic.”
VR and visualization
Several other startups, including some heavily funded names, are marketing offerings that share some similarities with hypnotherapy apps but go by different names.
Meditation app and venture-backed unicorn Headspace, for instance, offers guided imagery, a healing practice it says is often interchanged with self-hypnosis and guided meditation, but with its own set of techniques.
Nashville, Tennessee- and Oxford, England-based BehaVR, a provider of virtual reality mental and behavioral health therapeutics, is another one to watch. The company pulled in $13 million in Series B funding in December, in conjunction with a merger with another startup in the space, Oxford VR. Its focus areas include anxiety regulation, pain management and addiction recovery.
More broadly, startups are scaling a number of digital therapeutics offerings with an eye to wellness and mental health. While questions remain about whether health insurers will cover treatments — as evidenced by this year’s bankruptcy by startup pioneer Pear Therapeutics — it’s still clearly a space that’s not going away.
You are your best medicine
Should self-hypnosis and self-guided hypnotherapy apps gain real traction, it’ll give a big boost to proponents of the idea that one’s own mind can sometimes provide more effective therapy than drugs or other, more invasive, treatments.
What’s also interesting about the assortment of early entrants is the degree to which they’re mixing both physical and mental ailments in their hypnosis-focused treatment plans. This may seem a bit surprising to some of us, who could envision hypnotizing our way to lower anxiety, but not, say, less irritated bowels.
If these startups are right, however, our minds could be capable of more powerful acts of healing than we’d previously imagined. Of course, getting our brains fully engaged will first require us to cut out the mindless scrolling.

Author Health Nabbed $115M To Serve Medicare Patients. It’s Not The Only One,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/06/28,"

Health care has always been considered a recession-resistant industry. But when there’s a market downturn and employers cut staff, consumers tighten their belts everywhere — including their employer-funded telehealth perks, meditation app subscriptions or, if they’re unemployed, even seeing a doctor.
Many are also joining federal and state health insurance programs like Medicare, Medi-Cal and Medicaid. And venture firms and startups are taking notice: New health care startups that once vied for the eyes of employers and insurance companies are now targeting these patients.
Enter Author Health, a health care platform for Medicare Advantage recipients. The company launched on Wednesday armed with $115 million in financing from General Atlantic and Flare Capital Partners.

The Boston-based startup creates a team of doctors, nurses, therapists and community health workers for Medicare Advantage recipients with serious mental health disorders. Data from The Commonwealth Fund shows 1 in 4 people with Medicare — those in the U.S. who are age 65 and older, or those with a disability — have a mental illness, but only 40% to 50% receive treatment.
“They end up in inpatient units and emergency departments,” said Dr. Katherine Hobbs, CEO of Author Health. “A lot of that utilization and bad outcomes could be avoided by better care in the community in the outpatient setting.”
Bullish on federal health plans
Given medical advancements, there are more older people in the U.S. today than ever. As of 2022, there are more than 58.6 million people enrolled in Medicare.
So much health care spending has been funneled into government programs that startups are beginning to tap into it. EasyHealth, which raised $135 million in 2021 (per Crunchbase data), acts almost as an insurance brokerage that connects patients with different Medicare plans. Cityblock Health, provider of medical and behavioral care to Medicaid are patients, raised $400 million, also in 2021. Nashville, Tennessee-based CareBridge raised $140 million in 2022 to offer at-home care for state Medicaid beneficiaries. And retirement benefits startup Spark Advisors has raised $13.6 million over the past few years to branch into Medicare.
“Investors recognize the substantial need and also the opportunity that really will only continue to grow as the Medicare population grows,” Hobbs said.
Even Maven Clinic, the fertility platform that launched a direct-to-employer model, raised $90 million in 2022 to tap into Medicaid patient rolls.
“Medicaid is a priority for us. Nearly half of all the babies born in America are born into a Medicaid plan,” Will Porteous, Maven’s chief growth officer, told me last year. “There’s the opportunity to address over half of the babies born in the country, but then, too, oftentimes these are the most underserved communities in the country.”
There’s a catch — companies interested in tapping into Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries have to prove their plans work. Employers are more likely to offer health care-related perks based on how they affect productivity, retention and happiness.
But startups looking to work with insurance providers have a higher bar to meet to prove their work lowers health care spend over time.
“There’s been a lot of investment over the last five years in behavioral health. Most of that investment has gone to mild to moderate conditions,” Hobbs said. “There’s really been very little investment around serious mental illness and substance use disorders.”
Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Cityblock Health worked with Medicare patients, not Medicaid patients. The post has been updated.

Nothing Raises Something — $96M,Chris Metinko,2023/06/28,"

Consumer tech developer Nothing locked up a $96 million funding round just about two weeks ahead of its new smartphone launch.
The new round was led by Highland Europe, with participation from existing investors GV, EQT Ventures and C Capital. Music group Swedish House Mafia also participated.
Nothing, founded in 2020, launched its Phone (1) product last year. Even amid declining cell phone sales, the product sold out and never made the U.S. Its new Phone (2) — set for a July 11 launch — will make the U.S. market and is highly anticipated.

“In just over two years, we’ve assembled one of the strongest teams in the industry and sold over 1.5 million devices worldwide,” co-founder and CEO Carl Pei said in a release. “It’s clear that there’s real demand for an innovative challenger in the consumer tech industry, and with this new round of financing, we’ve never been better positioned to realize our vision to make tech fun again.”
Growing fast
The London-based startup is not small by any means, with more than 450 people across seven offices worldwide. The company made $200 million in revenues in 2022 and is on pace to exceed that this year, TechCrunch reports.
Aside from its phones, the company also has released earbuds and a sound stick. The company has sold more than 1.5 million devices, per the report.
Part of the company’s fast success is undoubtedly due to its engagements with its customers. It has raised nearly $14 million in crowdfunding and attracted more than 8,000 investors in those rounds.
Nothing also has ongoing sustainability initiatives and promises its new phone will have a lower carbon footprint than the first iteration.
Founded in 2020, the company has raised more than $250 million to date, per the company.

Sustainability Funding Sees Only Modest Decline As Urgency Trumps Frugality,Joanna Glasner,2023/06/28,"

Catastrophic climate change projections are only getting more pronounced. And across the globe, overall startup investment is on the decline.
These two trajectories don’t fundamentally have anything to do with each other. The planet doesn’t check startup funding data before deciding how many record heat waves and hurricanes to unleash. And the venture pullback, a comedown from a cyclical bubble, has nothing to do with climate dynamics.
Nonetheless, the chronological overlap of these otherwise unrelated phenomena may help explain why sustainability-focused startup investment has declined this year, but less sharply than in most other sectors. Urgency is higher, but investors’ willingness to spend remains constrained.

The end result? So far in 2023, investors have put just over $17 billion into global seed- through growth-stage financings for sustainability-focused companies, per an analysis of Crunchbase data. That’s on track to come in pretty close to 2021 totals but likely below the record-setting investment tallies of 2022.
For a sense of how investment has unfolded over time, below we chart out annual funding from 2018 till today:


We also tallied U.S. sustainability-focused investment, which follows a similar pattern. Funding for 2023, so far, is on track to come in below the prior peak years:


Active investors
Funding data shows that while the largest global venture investors have pulled back considerably this year, many climate-focused investors remained pretty active. In the U.S. tallies, a handful of investors stood out as particularly busy.
One standout is Lowercarbon Capital. The climate-focused venture firm invested in 12 sustainability-related rounds so far this year, mostly at seed and early stage. The companies it backed collectively raised over $367 million so far in 2023, Crunchbase data shows.
Another major player is Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the greentech fund backed by Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, which joined 11 U.S. rounds this year. This includes last week’s $195 million financing for KoBold Metals, a developer of technology for finding deposits of metals, including rare substances used in EV batteries.
Among up-and-comers, there’s Fifth Wall, a venture firm known for real estate investment that has increasingly taken a role in sustainability-related investments. Per Crunchbase data, five of its 2023 U.S. investments have a sustainability focus, including a $300 million Series B for Our Next Energy, a developer of energy storage for electric vehicles and the grid.
Popular sectors
Across sectors, meanwhile, a few areas stood out as especially attractive among investors. We look at three: solar, waste and wastewater management, and battery tech.
Solar
We’ll start with solar, an area where we see a lot of growth-stage activity. Per Crunchbase data, about $6 billion went into solar-related financings 1 this year, across 79 rounds.
Much of the money went toward private equity investments in building out solar power infrastructure. Notable deals include:

Silicon Ranch, a 12-year-old, Nashville, Tennessee-based company that develops and operates utility scale solar facilities pulled in $375 million in a January financing.


PowerField Netherlands picked up $550 million in February to develop solar parks, solar-powered charging stations and energy storage systems.


Amarenco, of Ireland and France, develops large solar installations and landed $330 million in March.

Recycling, waste management and water treatment
We also saw a fair bit of investment around recycling, waste management and water treatment. Collectively, companies in these categories attracted around $1.1 billion globally in 2023, across 99 rounds.
Some of the larger, standout rounds in this subset include:

Gradiant, a Massachusetts-based developer of advanced water and wastewater treatment technology, closed a $225 million Series D round in May at a $1 billion valuation.


APK, a German startup developing recycling technology for plastic waste, snapped up $140 million in a financing backed by Kirkbi A/S, the family-owned holding and investment company of the LEGO brand.
Mill, a San Bruno, California, startup selling a “food-shrinking, de-stinking” kitchen bin and food waste pick-up service, reportedly raised more than $100 million from backers including Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Energy Impact Partners.

Batteries and energy storage
Battery technology 2 startups also continue to attract significant capital. Per Crunchbase data, over $3.4 billion in venture and growth-stage investment went to battery-related companies globally in 2023. Of these, most had a sustainability angle, such as developing battery tech for EVs or improved storage for energy generated from renewable sources.

Northvolt, a startup whose self-described mission is to deliver batteries with an 80% lower carbon footprint compared to those made using coal energy, picked up $400 million in June, bringing total equity funding to over $5 billion.
Elevate Renewable Energy, a Boston startup looking to build out battery energy storage at large generation facilities, landed $150 million in a January financing.

Neither heartening nor dismal
No sane person expects startups and their backers to single-handedly mitigate the catastrophic effects of climate change and environmental degradation. But it is reasonable to hope for some major contributions from venture-backed entrepreneurs.
Are they as committed as ever to delivering? Looking at the aggregate numbers for sustainability-focused funding, it looks like climate-focused investors remain on track with their mission. And while most generalist funds have pulled back on overall investment, they’re at least still doing sustainability-focused deals. If the market rebounds, we can hope they’ll further up their game.
Methodology
Funding totals are based on the Crunchbase sustainability industry category, with the following Crunchbase Pro query used to generate funding numbers:

Sustainability Industry Funding In 2023

We included both venture and private equity financings in the totals, as many private equity firm investments in the sustainability space can be characterized as growth financings. However, we limited the query to companies founded in the past 20 years to narrow the results to startups and growth companies.

Redpanda’s $100M Raise Reminds Us Of 2021,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/06/27,"

As data streaming becomes more in demand, startups in the sector are getting a boost.
Redpanda Data, a streaming data startup, announced on Tuesday it raised $100 million in Series C funding. The round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, Google Ventures and Haystack.
The San Francisco-based startup provides real-time streaming data services bolstered by the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Using the platform, companies are able to analyze data as soon as it’s collected. Redpanda has amassed a large customer base that spans different sectors, including Cisco, Midjourney, Texas Instruments and Vodafone.
The company says it has enjoyed a healthy fiscal year, which included multiplying its revenue growth 5x over and doubling its workforce. That’s pretty huge — especially at a time when startups are experiencing revenue stress and laying off employees in mass workforce reductions, and very few companies are thriving.

That may be the reason for Redpanda’s oversubscribed raise. The 4-year-old company previously raised a $50 million Series B round just 16 months ago. We haven’t seen many follow-up rounds happen this quickly since the funding boom of 2021 — and look what happened there.
How it works
The platform can be plugged into an open-source streaming API known as Kafka and also can be integrated into companies’ existing cloud networks.
“The hero of the Redpanda story has always been the engineer, hands on keyboard, behind a terminal, materializing her ideas into a working system,” said Alex Gallego, the CEO of Redpanda, in a statement. “That’s who we built Redpanda for, and why we made it easy to use, scalable to double-digit ​​gigabytes per second, and compatible with all the existing applications,”
The platform works by acting as both a data storage system and a data streaming system — using AI and machine learning, companies can integrate their own data into the machine-learning system to bolster responses, or changes. That sort of platform has been increasingly useful for user-facing applications like Midjourney’s AI-generated images, or video game platforms.
“As a new game studio, we needed to build a flexible data platform that empowers our developers to get real-time insights from game events, without having to worry about the backend infrastructure,” Colin Riddell, an executive at Fortis Games, said in a statement. The company is one of Redpanda’s clients.
While Redpanda has managed to keep up the momentum many startups lost in 2021, we’re not likely to see other startups in the same place.

Cyera Nabs $100M To Protect Data,Chris Metinko,2023/06/27,"

Data security startup Cyera raised a $100 million Series B as the cyber industry tries to shake off a funding slowdown through the past few quarters.
The round was led by Accel, with existing investors Sequoia Capital and Cyberstarts, and new investor Redpoint Ventures all taking part.
While data may be king, keeping track of it and securing it can be a pain. That is where Cyera comes in, as the startup offers a platform that helps security teams at companies understand what data they have and how it’s used, as well as how to secure it.

Such platforms can be useful as security teams struggle with growing amounts of data while also often facing staffing issues.
“Cyera’s vision is to enable every business to realize the full potential of their data using AI — collaboration, connection with customers, insights that fuel innovation — to power a new era of development, growth and productivity,” said co-founder and CEO Yotam Segev in a release.
Since closing its Series A last March, the company has realized 800% revenue growth, the company said in the release. Founded in 2020, the company has now raised $164.5 million across three rounds, per Crunchbase.
Funding slowdown
Cyber — normally thought to be pretty resistant to funding slowdowns — has seen a significant dip since the fourth quarter of 2021, per Crunchbase data.
That quarter saw nearly $8.5 billion invested into cyber startups. However, the sector then saw four consecutive quarters of decline before hitting $2.7 billion in the first quarter of this year — a slight uptick from the $2.4 billion in the final quarter of 2022.
However, that first-quarter number represented a 58% drop from the $6.5 billion such startups saw in the same quarter of 2022.
Second-quarter numbers for cyber look even worse with less than a week left.

From AI To SVB And Everything In Between — A Quick Look Back At The First Half Of 2023,Chris Metinko,2023/06/27,"

This article is Part One of our Mid-Year Report, which reviews the first half of 2023 and looks ahead to the rest of the year. In our next installments, we’ll share our IPO predictions and reader survey results, and we’ll also dive deep into trends and data in AI venture funding and their impact.
After a bumpy 2022, there was little reason to believe 2023 would be any smoother in the realm of tech, startups and venture capital.
Through the first six months, the new year has done anything but disappoint on that front.

From crypto contagion to mass layoffs to a banking crisis to — yes — the neverending AI craze, the first half of the year has been a winding ride for venture and startups.
Let’s take a look back.
Crypto in crisis and slowdown
The year started with many folks still trying to wrap their heads around one of the greatest startup implosions of all time: That of crypto exchange FTX. Company founder Sam Bankman-Fried was already facing criminal charges — including fraud — in the collapse of the highly valued company.
FTX and FTX US, its U.S.-based exchange, were valued at $32 billion and $8 billion, respectively, and backed by some of of the biggest names in venture — including Sequoia Capital, NEA, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Insight Partners, Temasek, SoftBank Vision Fund, Thoma Bravo, SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Coinbase Ventures.
Despite the crypto contagion that gripped the industry — with several startups declaring bankruptcy and/or announcing layoffs — the year started with crypto prices actually rising significantly: Ether and Bitcoin were both up more than 50%.
The unexpected price spike seemed to buoy the industry somewhat, and many people saw it as a sign of resilience in crypto, blockchain and all things Web3.
But VC optimism was not running as high. Crypto and nearly any other heavily venture-backed sector continued to show signs that the slowdown of 2022 was lasting into the new year.
Crunchbase numbers at the start of the year showed overall global venture funding in 2022 declined 35% from 2021 to about $445 billion. While still a significant amount of money, it paled next to the $681 billion invested in 2021 — an all-time high — and numbers have not shown any signs of rebounding to those levels.
AI saves the day?
But if there is anything that will help those numbers, it became clear early in the year it would be artificial intelligence.
The seeds of this year’s AI craze were firmly planted in late 2022, when London-based AI-driven visual art startup Stability AI, San Francisco-based AI video and audio editing tool Descript, and Austin, Texas-based AI content platform Jasper all raised big rounds.
However, the even bigger news came just a few days into the new year, when it was reported that OpenAI, the company behind the artificial intelligence tools ChatGPT and DALL-E, could be valued at $29 billion in a new tender offer.
By the end of January, Microsoft confirmed it had agreed to a “multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment” into OpenAI. While the exact dollar amount was not confirmed, Semafor reported earlier that month that Microsoft was in talks to invest as much as $10 billion.
There was no looking back after that for AI, as dozens of startups in the sector — or at the very least claiming to be using AI — raised billions of dollars. Some of the biggest deals included:

A $450 million Series C for Anthropic — a ChatGPT rival with its AI assistant Claude — which reportedly valued the company at $5 billion in May.
A $270 million Series C for Toronto-based Cohere in June that valued the company at $2.2 billion. The startup builds large language models that allow AI to learn from new data, and can be customized and put into applications for features like interactive chat.
In March, San Francisco-based Adept AI raised $350 million in a Series B at a reported post-money valuation of at least $1 billion.

Those rounds were just a sampling of investors’ insatiable appetite for all things AI, as countless other startups raised cash in the sector even as funding continued to dip in almost every other sector.
The AI craze among investors included large corporations and their VC arms. Aside from Microsoft, others including Google, Zoom Ventures, Nvidia, Oracle and Salesforce Ventures 1 all found it hard to say no to big rounds in the AI space.
While it seems a near certainty that the second half of 2023 will be filled with more large fundings at sky-high valuations, talk about the disruptive technology already has turned to regulation due to the possible impact AI could have on everything from jobs and the economy to data and privacy, and even mental health.
Yet another crisis
Not even AI could stop what would come next, as the industry would suffer a most unexpected blow.
On March 9, Silicon Valley Bank — which had relationships with more than half of all venture-backed companies in the U.S. and countless VC firms — saw its stock price plunge after announcing it would sell $2.25 billion worth of stock to shore up its balance sheet.
Even as the bank sought to assure customers all was well, the announcement rocked the venture world and led to concerns about the bank’s liquidity and balance sheet strength.
Customers — including many startups — sought to get their deposits out of the failing bank, with many needing the money just to make upcoming payrolls. The bank’s collapse forced Parker Conrad’s workforce management startup Rippling to raise $500 million in hours so its clients could pay employees as concerns about access to SVB-held funds swirled.
That soon led to a run on withdrawals and an end of what had become the dominant bank for VC-backed startups for the past 40 years, providing banking services for such “up-and-coming” tech companies such as Cisco Systems and Bay Networks back in the day.
SVB’s collapse was in part due to the decline venture had witnessed through the past year-plus. During the 2021 venture capital boom, the bank was flush with cash as private companies raised huge sums of fresh capital at sky-high valuations. But the market slowed with rising interest rates and that cash dried up as deposits by startups dipped. SVB simultaneously made the disastrous decision to invest in long-term, higher-yield bonds, which further hindered its liquidity.
On March 26, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. announced First Citizens BancShares had agreed to buy the loans and deposits of the failed Silicon Valley Bank.
Just like that, a vital pillar in the venture capital ecosystem — known for its vast venture lending practice for startups — was gone after four decades.
A report by the Federal Reserve Board said the collapse was a “textbook case of mismanagement by the bank” and that when the bank’s board and management realized its risk, it did not take the appropriate steps to fix those problems quickly.
Days after regulators issued a report on the historic collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic Bank — with its expanding technology division and serving as the bank of a growing number of startups — also fell into receivership and was quickly sold to JPMorgan Chase.
The two banks’ collapses — the second- (First Republic) and third- (SVB) largest in U.S. history — have changed and likely will continue to change the way startups bank, with many now looking to diversify where they put assets and how they are held.
The failures also will continue to affect how companies can secure venture debt — something more needed now in a slow venture market.
Layoffs and money
As cash has become tighter in tech, one recurring theme from last year through the entire first half of this year has been layoffs.
Since the start of the year, around 150,000 workers at U.S.-based tech companies — or tech companies with a large U.S. workforce — have been laid off in mass job cuts, according to  Crunchbase News’ Tech Layoffs Tracker.
Those layoffs have happened everywhere from big-name public companies including Alphabet, Oracle and Coinbase, to startups like Pendo and Reddit.
Those job cuts probably shouldn’t come as a surprise and likely will continue as the year presses on. VC and growth equity giants including Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global, Khosla Ventures, Insight Partners and many others have substantially slowed their investment pace since the highs of 2021.
That has shown little sign of abating as we move into the second half — although SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son told investors just recently that the Vision Fund unit would shift back to “offense mode” and is looking at being the leader in the AI revolution.
Perhaps AI alone can boost VC numbers and get investors back to putting big cash in startups. But more likely the focus the public market has seen shift back to profitability and cash flow will continue to make VCs look less at rapid growth and the big money valuations that come with those numbers.
Nevertheless, the venture and startups sectors have shown amazing resilience amid layoffs, less money and multiple crises.
It’s likely VC and private tech companies will have to continue to show that resilience in the second half of 2023.

Databricks Buys Generative AI Startup MosaicML For $1.3B,Chris Metinko,2023/06/26,"

Databricks, the data storage and management startup last valued at $38 billion, signed a definitive agreement to acquire OpenAI competitor MosaicML for $1.3 billion.
MosaicML, a San Francisco-based generative AI platform, had raised $64 million to date since launching in 2021, per reports. Its investors included DCVC, Lux Capital and Playground Global.
MosaicML allows customers to build generative AI tools using its own proprietary data — eliminating the need for users to incorporate their own data with OpenAI’s proprietary models that use public data.

“Every organization should be able to benefit from the AI revolution with more control over how their data is used. Databricks and MosaicML have an incredible opportunity to democratize AI,” said Ali Ghodsi, Databricks’ co-founder and CEO, in a release.
Getting bigger
San Francisco-based Databricks last raised in 2021, locking up a $1.6 billion Series H led by Morgan Stanley’s Counterpoint Global at a $38 billion valuation — making it one of the most valuable private companies in the world.
The deal for MosaicML could be another step toward the public market for the decacorn, as it looks to expand its portfolio of offerings and cash in on an exploding AI market.
While the Databricks deal is one of the first big M&A transactions in the AI space this year, the sector has seen a flood of funding dollars invested in it. 
In January, Microsoft invested $10 billion in OpenAI. In March, San Francisco-based Adept AI raised $350 million in a Series B at a reported post-money valuation of at least $1 billion. In May, Anthropic — a ChatGPT rival with its AI assistant Claude — raised a $450 million Series C that reportedly valued the company at $5 billion.
And that is only a handful of the funding deals the AI has seen since the beginning of the year.
Databricks just recently talked about surpassing a milestone of $1 billion in annual revenue and has talked about a potential IPO in the past. 
Founded in 2013, Databricks has raised more than $3.5 billion, per Crunchbase. Its investors include Andreessen Horowitz, NEA, T. Rowe Price, BlackRock and many others.

How Early Zoom Investor TSVC Finds ‘Defensible’ Seed Startups To Back,Gené Teare,2023/06/26,"

The rapid deployment of AI across industries in recent months suits the longtime talents of TSVC, a seed investor in deep tech companies where AI coupled with domain expertise has led to breakthroughs. 
The firm invests very early in companies with technology that can be challenging to understand. Its investment focus is in deep tech in semiconductor materials and robotics companies, in healthtech companies and also in the data economy, which includes AI. 
Founded by Eugene Zhang and Chun Xia in 2010, the firm has built an impressive portfolio of more than 200 companies in its 13 years of operation. 

TSVC’s four general partners have operating experience as well as engineering backgrounds. Alongside the general partners, the firm evaluates companies with the technical knowledge of its 14 venture partners, many of them founders and tech executives with Ph.D.s. 
It led the seed round in Zoom in 2011. It also invested early in now public companies Ginkgo Bioworks, Carta, Quanergy and in Zum transportation, a growing private company that rethinks student transportation. 
We spoke with TSVC partner Spencer Greene on the firm’s deep tech successes, its approach to investing at seed, and the AI investment boom. Greene joined TSVC in 2020 and leads the firm’s health practice. 
Spencer Greene, a partner at TSVC
For Greene, it’s not enough for a startup’s technology to be innovative today. He wants to know: How will that tech hold up years from now? Can it fight off competitors and copycats?
 The majority of the firm’s portfolio companies have an AI component — but that’s not enough.
“I spend more time and energy looking for defensibility than what we used to,” Greene said. “AI needs to be coupled with something else to make it hard enough, because it’s going to be transformative for so many industries.”  
Betting on AI
TSVC invests in a startup’s team, product or technology, and then market size.
“I think AI is, for most businesses, table stakes,” said Greene. “AI and some other technologies together have made barriers to entry lower in many situations. That can be a good thing if you’re an early-stage startup — you can attack incumbents who are much larger than you, and you can get to market very quickly. But it can also make it harder to build a sustainable business because you can be vulnerable just as easily to someone else who comes after you.”
In the health care sector, for example, Greene said investors understand that AI will be able to read X-rays and pathology slides better than a doctor. However, once this technology is FDA-approved, it might not be defensible as a technology unless the startup has a unique and large dataset that creates some differentiation. 
TSVC applies the same principles to its other sectors, such as the AI and robotic space, where the firm has been active lately. There is a ton of innovation happening in computer vision, Greene said. 
The firm’s portfolio companies include:

Computer vision companies and robotics company Beagle Technology, which prunes grapevines without destroying crops.
eBots, a precision manufacturing company that uses 3-D vision useful for building smartphones that require many manual assembly steps — a technology that was not possible only a few years ago.
Automat Solutions, which uses AI to discover alternate materials for the lithium battery market. Automat’s AI engine predicts suitable materials, which are then tested in a lab for the ability to store more energy or charge faster or maintain cooler temperatures. This learning then gets fed back into new predictive models.
Reema Health, which aims to keep Medicaid patients healthy and out of the hospital — something that would have an enormous impact, according to Greene.
Preveta, which provides specialty health care coordination, saving on costs — and highlighting TSVC’s interest in startups that tackle inefficiencies in the health care space.

Early Zoom
When TSVC first invested in Zoom, it was not at all clear that the company could succeed in a competitive market for web-conferencing. 
TSVC’s Zhang met Zoom founder Eric Yuan through an organization for Chinese tech professionals in the Bay Area. At the time, Zoom was focused on the consumer market, creating a “poor man’s telepresence” via a Facebook plugin. 
TSVC wasn’t sure if the consumer approach would work, but Yuan had experience in the sector. He had left online conferencing company Webex — then owned by Cisco — frustrated by what he saw as lack of innovation. Yuan hired a team of engineers who invented a new codec that improved the audio and video quality in conference calls with better compression technology. 
The underlying technology was important to its success alongside the intuitive interface that Zoom is known for. 
Zhang led TSVC’s investment in Zoom, a seed round of $3 million in 2011 that valued the company at $15 million. Afterward, he noticed that on a flight using Wi-Fi that while his Skype call didn’t hold up, the Zoom call did. 
The pre-A stage
The seed market has changed, Greene said. “I hadn’t heard the term pre-A hardly at all until lately, and now I seem to hear it all the time.” 
Companies that manage to raise Series A funding are spending a longer time to get there, according to a recent analysis of Crunchbase data. 
This has given rise to seed extension rounds, a signal the valuation is flat from a prior funding typically two years ago. And when a company is raising pre-A it reads as there is a little step up in valuation. But overall they are both saying they are not yet ready for a Series A funding. 
Still, TSVC has not seen a decline in the number of companies pitching for funding. “We are seeing much more reasonableness on valuations. There was a point in time where it kind of went crazy,” he said.  
Initial check size for the firms these days is $500,000 to $1 million with reserves for follow-on funding, according to Greene.
TSVC co-invests in seed rounds that are typically $3 million to $6 million but can be around $2 million as well.  The firm’s valuations for seed deals are typically around $10 million, $15 million or, on the higher end, $20 million.
Greene predicts that amid turmoil in the tech world, there are opportunities for very early-stage investors like TSVC. “Some of the layoffs in Big Tech have been pulling back their moonshot projects, and essentially ceding territory back to venture,” he said.

"The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Aledade Rolls Up Huge Round, KoBold Metal Mines Big Money",Chris Metinko,2023/06/23,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.

After a slow week last week, there was a slight pickup in top-dollar rounds, with three hitting nine figures. Health care — or health care-adjacent — companies saw big money, taking three of the four top spots this week, with the second place round minting a new mining unicorn. That’s out of the ordinary, but the venture market has a way of being unpredictable.
1. Aledade, $260M, health care: Health care companies hit it big this week and none bigger than Aledade. The Bethesda, Maryland-based company raised a $260 million Series F led by new investor Lightspeed Venture Partners. The round comes just about a year after it locked up a $123 million Series E. The startup provides doctors’ offices with data analytics software so they can better manage their patients and identify those most at risk. The company plans to use the new cash to beef up its services and technology, possibly with acquisitions. The new funding deal values the company at $3.5 billion, Bloomberg reported. Founded in 2014, the company has raised nearly $678 million, per Crunchbase.
2. KoBold Metals, $195M, mining: What happens when you combine AI with the material needed for lithium-ion batteries and AI? You get big money. Berkeley, California-based KoBold Metals raised a $195 million round this week led by T. Rowe Price, and included a number of big-name investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, and Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos-backed Breakthrough Energy Ventures. The new cash values the climate-tech startup at $1.15 billion. KoBold Metals uses artificial intelligence to mine for valuable metals such as cobalt, copper, nickel and lithium used in the production of batteries for a variety of sectors, including electric vehicles. The startup has built a database about the Earth’s layers and uses algorithms to make predictions about where mineral deposits are around the world. KoBold Metals isn’t new to big rounds. In February 2022, the startup closed a $192.5 million Series B, which included investment from Apollo Projects, Bond Capital, BHP Group and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Founded in 2018, the company has now raised more than $400 million, per Crunchbase.
3. HighFive Healthcare, $100M, dental: Dental health startups don’t usually make this list, but then again they don’t usually raise $100 million. However, HighFive did just that, closing a $100 million growth investment led by Norwest. The Birmingham, Alabama-based company enables a network of dental offices to centralize their operations — saving money and letting doctors focus on patients and not office operations. The company saw tremendous growth last year, doubling its practice size through acquisitions and organic growth. Founded in 2018, the company has now raised more than $102 million, per Crunchbase.
4. DexCare, $75M, health care: Yes, another health care startup high on the list. Seattle-based DexCare closed a $75 million Series C led by Iconiq Growth. The company’s software helps health systems manage their capacity and appointment booking while getting patients to the care they need. Its platform allows health providers to serve patients faster, and to manage the supply and demand of digital-care access. Founded in 2021, DexCare has raised $146 million, per the company.
5. Attovia Therapeutics, $60M, biotech: Only one biotech in the top five this week — which has become rare, as the space has witnessed some large raises of late. Fremont, California-based Attovia Therapeutics, which is developing biotherapeutics for immune-mediated disease and cancer, raised a $60 million Series A led by Frazier Life Sciences. The company plans to use the new cash to further advance its drug and platform development focusing on immunology and oncology. This is the company’s first outside raise, per Crunchbase.
6. Limble CMMS, $58M, information technology: Lehi, Utah-based Limble, which develops computerized maintenance management software, raised a $58 million Series B led by the growth equity business within Goldman Sachs. Founded in 2015, the company has now raised nearly $77 million, per Crunchbase data.
7. AltPep, $53M, biotech: Seattle-based AltPep, which is developing early disease-modifying treatments and detection tools for amyloid diseases, closed a $52.9 million Series B led by Senator Investment Group. Founded in 2018, the company has raised $76 million, per Crunchbase data.
8. (tied) Empress Therapeutics, $50M, biotech: Cambridge, Massachusetts-based oral medicine developer Empress Therapeutics closed a $50 million round from Flagship Pioneering. This is the company’s first outside funding, per Crunchbase.
8. (tied) PM Pediatric Care, $50M, health care: Long Island, New York-based PM Pediatric Care, a pediatric urgent care network, locked up a $50 million Series E led by Scopia Capital. Founded in 2005, the company has raised $64 million, per Crunchbase.
8. (tied) Render, $50M, cloud infrastructure: San Francisco-based Render, a cloud provider for application developers, closed a $50 million Series B led by Bessemer Venture Partners. Founded in 2018, the company has now raised nearly $77 million, per Crunchbase.
Big global deals
Despite the big rounds in the U.S. this week, Asia and Europe both had bigger.

China-based Langlai Technology, a clinical-stage innovative drug research and development company, raised a $500 million round.
Sweden-based Northvolt, a battery manufacturer for electric vehicles, industrial systems and energy storage systems, raised a $400 million private equity round.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of June 17 to June 23. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

Boom-Era Excesses Haunt The Ghost Kitchen Space,Joanna Glasner,2023/06/23,"

It’s no surprise that the pandemic coincided with the rise in enthusiasm and financing for virtual kitchen startups.
With restaurant dining largely closed, takeout was the only option for a while. Even when dining-in was back, one typically had to submit to masking protocols and/or worry about COVID 19 risk.
It was a perfect time to experiment with ordering delivery from a new place. And since no one cared about decor or customer seating, delivery-only kitchens — often called ghost kitchens, cloud kitchens or virtual kitchens — sounded like a good idea.

Startup investors certainly thought so. Top-funded companies in the ghost kitchen space raised more than $3 billion in venture financing between 2020 and 2022, per Crunchbase data. 
The two top recipients alone — Miami upstart Reef Technology and Uber founder Travis Kalanick’s CloudKitchens — pulled in over $2.75 billion. 1
Fast-forward to 2023, and for those of us luxuriating with a paper menu for a sit-down meal, this seems like a bygone era. Yeah, ghost kitchens are still a thing. But the market isn’t growing like it used to. 
Turns out that while people don’t want to return to the office, they do want to get back to the restaurant. Moreover, eateries that survived the pandemic largely did so by upping their takeout game, delivery and drive-through options. Ghost kitchens, meanwhile, have fallen out of investors’ favor, most notably in the U.S..
Cloud kitchen startups down from sky-high heights
To illustrate, we used Crunchbase data to put together a sample set of 14 of the more prominent funded companies in the cloud kitchen space:


The list includes six U.S.-based companies, none of which has raised a round since 2021. It’s unclear when they’re likely to do so again.
Reef Technology, which raised $1.5 billion in two rounds led or co-led by SoftBank in late 2018 and 2020, looks especially underwater. 
After starting out as a parking facility operator, Reef pivoted hard into filling those spaces with mobile kitchens that could cook up food for delivery. The shift hit some hurdles post-pandemic, however, with Reef reportedly laying off hundreds of staff in 2022, following a massive growth spurt. It is now reportedly working with restructuring advisers. 
A further blow came last month, when Wendy’s reportedly axed the entire U.S. ghost kitchen business it launched with the company. Nearly two years earlier, the two announced a partnership to open up to 700 locations by 2025.
Kalanick’s CloudKitchens, meanwhile, is holding up, albeit with challenges. The company reportedly carried out layoffs in 2022. However, it is expanding in some areas, as evidenced by a partnership with Starbucks reported earlier this month.
Other ghost kitchen operators are quiet lately. C3, a platform pairing chefs with takeout businesses, hasn’t made a new announcement on its website since January 2022.
The takeaway: Be wary of overconfident futurists
The cloud kitchen trajectory shares much in common with other areas, like e-scooters and connected fitness, where projections for consumer adoption did not pan out in the real world.
It cautions us that rosy-sounding forecasts ought not to be mistaken with actual reality.
For ghost kitchen operators, challenges include space constraints, quality control and difficulty building a brand that resonates without a storefront presence. Consumers have also grown increasingly weary of additional fees associated with delivery that make the price of say, a simple burger and fries, more than the budget allows.
That said, ghost kitchens do still fill a niche. For instance, they offer a lower-cost option for launching a new food business or expanding kitchen space of a growing business to handle delivery demand. And while a sit-down dinner at a trendy restaurant has its appeal, there are still those times when we pine for the convenience of delivery.

Robinhood Eyes Banking Market With $95M Credit Card Acquisition,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/06/22,"

Robinhood, the stocks trading platform that was once geared for novices, is slowly making its way into banking.
The company announced on Thursday it acquired X1, a credit card startup, for $95 million in cash. The deal is expected to close by the third quarter of 2023.

X1 is a no-fee credit card company that deals its credit based on the person’s income. And it fits in well with Robinhood’s brand of providing easy-to-understand financial products for someone new to building their personal wealth.
Last year the company introduced a no-fee debit card that integrated with its stock investment app. Users could round up their purchases to the nearest dollar and invest that extra change into the public markets.
“This acquisition will bring us closer towards our goal of serving the entirety of our customers’ critical financial needs,” Vlad Tenev, CEO and co-founder of Robinhood, said in a statement.
X1 co-founders Deepak Rao and Siddharth Batra will stay on at the company and oversee the credit card arm of Robinhood’s expanding business.
The acquisition of X1 is a step forward for Robinhood, which was marred by controversy in the last two years. Robinhood was at the center of the meme stocks controversy in 2021 when users banded together to inflate the stock price of gaming retailer GameStop for, you know, fun. The move cost Robinhood $1.4 billion.
Earlier this year, the company announced it would also cancel its plan to buy the UK-based crypto startup Ziglu. The plan was in the works for more than a year, but following the crypto crash of 2022, Robinhood backed out and owed around $12 million in impairment charges.
This also may be a harbinger of good times for the fintech industry, which saw a massive rise in popularity in 2021 thanks to cryptocurrency platforms, buy-now-pay-later startups and new banking systems.
Only two companies, including Robinhood, successfully went public. Most of them, notably Stripe, are still flailing around in the private markets as venture funding continues to move sparingly. Global funding in the fintech space dipped 40% year over year, per Crunchbase data.

These Are The Sectors Where Hot Seed-Stage Startups Are Clustering In 2023,Joanna Glasner,2023/06/22,"

Seed-stage companies are a lot like grapes. They tend to form in bunches.

The clustering effect is clear in this year’s vintage of seed-funded startups. A handful of categories accounted for an outsized number of investments.
What were some of the standout areas? Using Crunchbase data, we scoured through hundreds of the largest seed and pre-seed rounds in 2023 1 to identify trends. The following is an assortment of a few that stood out, from AI assistants to clean power to esports.
No. 1: Generative AI
Of course, we couldn’t make a list of trendy seed-stage categories without including Generative AI.
So here it is. Below, we put together a sample set of 16 companies in the space that raised seed funding this year, in categories from coding to insurance underwriting to identifying AI-generated text.
 


 
The biggest funding recipient, Seattle-based XetHub, pitches itself as a platform for developing Generative AI apps and pulled in $7.5 million from VC firm Madrona in January.
Several other list members, meanwhile, are developing AI assistants. NinjaTech AI is working on a “personal assistant” focused on automating admin tasks like meeting scheduling and inbox management. Portrait Analytics is targeting investment research. And Altius is working on AI tech support.
Another interesting startup that made the list is GPTZero, a ChatGPT detection tool that a Princeton University student built out of his dorm room. A few months later, after amassing 1.2 million users, GPTZero also picked up $3.5 million in seed funding.
No. 2: Power Generation
Modern life consumes copious amounts of power. To wit, considerable sums of venture capital have gone over the years toward developing energy sources that are greener, cheaper, and more easily deployable.
At the seed stage, it’s clear appetites for next-gen energy technology remain robust. We identified a list of several companies that have raised some of the year’s larger seed rounds:


Renaissance Fusion, a French magnetic confinement fusion startup, was the top fundraiser, pulling in $16 million in a January financing led by LowerCarbon Capital. Next was Burbank, California-based Terraform Industries, which has raised $11 million toward its goal of scaling technology to produce cheap natural gas with sunlight and air.
Fusion-focused startups accounted for about half of the seed investment on our list, marking the continuation of an ongoing trend. While fusion energy — created when two atoms are merged — has been talked about for a century, many feel that recent advancements have made commercialization something that could be years away and no longer decades.
No. 3: Esports
Esports and online sports forums are a growth industry, and that’s driving investment at the seed stage.
Using Crunchbase data, we identified at least eight companies funded this year that raised $3 million or more in seed funding for online sports-related endeavors:


San Francisco-based Matchday stands out as the most heavily funded name on the list, with $21 million in backing from investors including Soccer legend Lionel Messi’s Play Time investment vehicle. The company plans to combine Web3 and mobile gaming for an online soccer platform.
Blacktop Hoops, a VR basketball game, also picked up a good-sized $5.1 million in seed funding from investors including Twitch co-founder Kevin Lin.
Meanwhile, the global esports market size is projected to multiply. While the industry was valued around $1.4 billion last year, its forecast to grow to $4.5 billion by 2030, per a recent report published by Cognitive Market Research.
No. 4: The Future Of (Finding) Work
Quite a bit of seed financing is also going toward tools and platforms aimed at filling jobs.
In our sample set, we feature 11 companies that raised seed rounds this year in categories ranging from construction work planning to cannabis industry recruitment to recruiter productivity tools.
 


 
The most heavily funded of the bunch is Rivet, a Detroit-based startup developing software for construction contractors to manage and schedule crews. Most recently, it pulled in a $5.3 million February financing led by Defy.vc.
Not surprisingly, several startups also touted their artificial intelligence focus. Sinecure.ai describes itself as an AI-powered industry specific talent acquisition tool. Moonhub boasts of the “cutting-edge AI and automation solutions” it pairs with recruiting expertise to help you help companies with hiring. And Engin Sciences, prominent in cannabis industry hiring, calls itself an “AI-powered recruitment software startup.”
Notably, one area that did not look popular for seed funding was tech industry recruiting. With the industry hit hard by layoffs and falling valuations, it appears this isn’t a favored theme currently for first-time funding.
What’s not hot
As we look at hot seed funding sectors for 2023, it’s hard not to also observe the opposite: What’s not getting funded.
While it’s rare to see a broad sector that’s completely fallen out of favor, certainly some of the hotter areas in 2020-22 no longer seem so appealing. This includes alternative proteins, consumer products, fast delivery, e-commerce aggregators, and cannabis companies.
Luckily, seed-stage founders are a resilient group. Those who get funded know how to craft a pitch that resonates with the times.
*Survey was limited to companies founded no earlier than 2019 that raised $100,000 or more in seed or pre-seed funding.

Corporates Are Getting Aggressive In AI Deals — Who Could Be Next?,Chris Metinko,2023/06/21,"

Late last month, we took a look at the plethora of artificial intelligence funding deals some of the world’s biggest tech companies and their venture arms have been taking part in for the last several years.
That has seemed only to accelerate this month, as Salesforce Ventures 1 — Salesforce’s venture arm — announced it will double the size of its Generative AI Fund to $500 million just three months after establishing it. That was followed by AI startup Synthesia raising a $90 million Series C at a $1 billion valuation that included an investment from NVentures — Nvidia’s venture capital arm.

However, while everyone already knows Nvidia and Microsoft are making strong bids to be dominant players in the AI ecosystem with their startup investments, there are several other tech giants that also quietly have placed some bets in AI and others who have made surprisingly few.
Let’s take a look at some companies and their VC arms not covered last month and what they’ve done:
Qualcomm Ventures
Nvidia isn‘t the only U.S.-based semiconductor giant that has been looking at AI startups for the last handful of years.
Qualcomm Ventures, Qualcomm’s investment arm, has taken part in 34 funding deals since the start of 2019 involving startups using AI, per Crunchbase data.
The firm’s most active year was — not shockingly — 2021 when it invested in nine startups using AI. That included taking part in a $235 million Series C investment in Israel-based AnyVision — now called Oosto – a vision AI and facial recognition company. Those nine deals totaled $714 million in total (although Qualcomm Ventures’ stake is not known).
This year, the venture arm has made four deals in the AI space, including investing in Union City, California-based DeepHow, which develops an AI-powered learning platform for manufacturing and repair, and Brazil-based Aravita, which uses AI to try to solve waste issues.
Those deals this year, however, have been relatively small, totalling only $37 million.
Cisco Investments
Few corporate VC arms are as old as Cisco Investments — founded 30 years ago — and few have the breadth of their investment portfolio.
For some reason it is sometimes easy to pass over the networking giant and its VC arm, but they don’t overlook much — including AI. Just this week, Cisco Systems launched its own networking chips for AI supercomputers that would compete with offerings from the likes of Broadcom and others.
While not nearly as active as some other VC arms, Cisco Investments has made eight different deals that would fall into the AI sector, per Crunchbase data.
Its most recent deals include participating in a $4.7 million round for Israel-based Voiceitt, an automatic speech recognition technology platform last December, as well as a huge $140 million Series D for Palo Alto, California-based Uniphore, a startup specializing in conversational automation, in March 2021.
The deals the investment arm participated in last year totaled $78 million — actually down from 2021 when it took part in two rounds that totaled $160 million.
Amazon Alexa Fund
Another company one would logically think has its eye on AI would be retail and web giant Amazon. However, for the most part Amazon and its AWS division have only made a select few investments in AI-related startups. 
However, its Alexa Fund has been quite active in making AI deals — participating in 20 different rounds since the start of 2019, per Crunchbase data.
The fund has not made any deals this calendar year, but made a handful even last year, including participating in a $55 million Series D for Irvine, California-based Syntiant, a deep learning tech company that develops AI voice and sensor solutions, in March 2022.
That same month, the fund also participated in a $24 million Series A in London-based Logically. The startup uses artificial intelligence and expert analysts to detect and assess disinformation that can harm companies and governments.
The deals the fund participated in last year totaled $85 million.
The others
Some other big tech goliaths also have made a select few deals in the AI space — although logic would dictate they will make more.
Social media and advertising giant Meta made a handful of deals between 2021-22, but none this year, per Crunchbase data.
However, its deals were rather intriguing. Meta took part in a $19 million Series A for Paris-based PhotoRoom, an AI-enabled image capturing app which creates studio-quality product pictures.
Meta also was included in Mountain View, California-based Inworld AI’s $7.2 million seed round. The metaverse startup is a developer platform for AI-driven virtual characters and immersive realities.
Oracle is another company that has not made too much noise investing in AI startups through the years, but the company did make a couple this year — its only, per Crunchbase data.
Most notably, Oracle took part in Toronto-based Cohere’s $270 million round in May. The startup’s AI platform competes with OpenAI.
It also took part in a pre-seed round for New Haven, Connecticut-based ChestAi, which provides AI-based image analysis for chest diseases. ChestAi:
Just like the other companies and VC arms mentioned above, expect the number — and value — of the AI deals the likes of Meta and Oracle will participate in to significantly increase in the coming months.

Cleareye.AI Secures Funding From JPMorgan,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/06/20,"

Cleareye.AI, a digital trading fintech platform, announced on Tuesday it received a strategic investment from JP Morgan, though the financial terms were not made public by either party.

Cleareye.AI, which automates the trade compliance and operations systems for companies, entered into a commercial partnership with JPMorgan back in September in which the banking institution would use Cleareye’s software to manage compliance risks.
Cleareye’s software uses algorithms to quickly analyze documents and data transactions and remove many of the manual checks that need to be done by banking institutions to authorize certain transactions.
By automatically validating the data, banking institutions can expedite the flow of trade while keeping an eye out for signs of money laundering or signs that a company is circumventing sanctions. Trade financing right now is often slowed significantly by analog processes that involve multiple people to look at and assess documents.
James Fraser, Global Head of Trade & Working Capital for JP Morgan, called the trade financing world “a manually intensive industry loaded with paper and lacking standardization, burdened by an increasing cost base” that “needs real innovation in order to transform.”
Accessing credit often takes companies weeks to access because of this process, which bottlenecks the business pipeline.
Some companies have aimed to solve this problem in a different way. Buy Now Pay Later companies, which have often been consumer focused (think Klarna) or focused on small businesses, are looking to provide similar services for large, multinational corporations. Santander Bank, for instance, announced a BNPL product for companies back in January, which would allow them to access a line of credit quickly.
Banks are quickly adopting similar strategies to JP Morgan in an attempt to keep up with the fast-paced nature of digital banking. Because banks require more security and have to follow stricter compliance guidelines than other industries, financial institutions are looking for niche products that automate processes quickly without risking security.

Mining Startup KoBold Metals Hits Unicorn Status After $195M Raise,Chris Metinko,2023/06/20,"

Startups hitting the magical $1 billion unicorn valuation is not rare — however, it’s not usually a mining company.

Nevertheless, Berkeley, California-based KoBold Metals pulled off the feat after a $195 million raise from a number of big-name investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, and Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos-backed Breakthrough Energy Ventures. 
The new cash values the climate-tech startup at $1.15 billion.
The round — first reported by The Wall Street Journal — was led by T. Rowe Price. The total funding amount was reported by Axios.
Hot trends
KoBold Metals has tied two hot trends together for investors — artificial intelligence and alternative energy sources.
The company uses artificial intelligence to mine for valuable metals such as cobalt, copper, nickel and lithium used in the production of batteries for a variety of sectors, including electric vehicles. The startup has built a database about the Earth’s layers and uses algorithms to make predictions about where mineral deposits are around the world.
The company plans on using the new funding to develop copper reserves in Zambia. Last December, KoBold agreed to invest $150 million to buy a controlling stake in the large, undeveloped copper reserves.
It has 60 continuing exploration projects in North America, Africa and Australia, per the WSJ.
“The success rates of finding new deposits have been declining,” co-founder and CEO Kurt House told the WSJ. “It’s hard to see how in the current setup we’ll get sufficient discoveries in time without breakthroughs in technology.” 
Big money
KoBold Metals isn’t new to big rounds. In February 2022, the startup closed a $192.5 million Series B, which included investment from Apollo Projects, Bond Capital, BHP Group and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.
Founded in 2018, the company has now raised more than $400 million.

This Generative AI Company Doesn’t Want To Be Called A Generative AI Company,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/06/20,"

Recently, a couple of venture capitalists knocked on Ben Pham’s door to hear a pitch on his new advertising startup named Obello.
Pham had decades of experience in advertising with Character, a branding agency he co-founded with Oliver Ralph that worked closely with the likes of Apple, Netflix and Facebook. After selling the company to marketing giant Dentsu, Pham and Ralph were working on a new generative AI product.
The first line of the pitch deck read, “Obello: An AI-powered graphic design platform.”
“I visually saw them recoil in their seats and roll their eyes, because they had been beaten over the head by so many companies saying ‘AI-powered’ [or] ‘powered by AI,’” Ralph said.

That’s not surprising. After ChatGPT took the world by storm in November, generative AI startups began popping up left and right. Venture firms were enamored with it — around 10% of global startup funding last year went to AI companies, according to Crunchbase data.
We’re on track to outpace that: So far in 2023, 15% of all startup funding has gone to AI-focused startups.
But the dust is beginning to settle, and some venture firms are getting skeptical of startups that claim to power their platforms using generative AI and large language models.
“The word is hurting us more than helping us pave the way, because the promise hasn’t been delivered,” Pham said.
Genesis of Obello
Pham’s previous startup Character built cohesive design packages for startups and legacy companies, which included tone, color, typography and logos. Character sent this package to its clients’ brand and marketing teams to turn those pieces into emails, landing pages, Instagram stories, Facebook posts and vertical ads.
“One of the challenges that we witnessed for companies of all sizes is that the designers and the marketers are struggling to keep up with the increased demands placed,” Pham said. “Modern brands have to be omnipresent and, as a result, they have to create a lot of marketing content.”
Their new venture Obello takes those brand ingredients, organizes them on its platform, and uses its in-house generative AI to create content based on what platform it will live on, what dimensions it needs to be, and even what tone the company wants to set — it can be “playful” or “understated.”
Traditional workflows, Pham said, “pull designers away from doing other more conceptual, creative work within their organization.”
How AI lost investors
While Obello may sound like a promising concept, it’s simply one of many new generative AI startups to investors.
A ton of generative AI startups build intuitive UI designs that sit on top of APIs from the likes of ChatGPT. These companies don’t have their own proprietary language models or data sets.
“You’re building basically something that is not super defensible and is easy to be replicated by another market entrant,” said Pasha Tinkov, co-founder of Audeo Ventures. He met with the Obello team. “It’s not a great business case to be investing into.”
For those companies, it’s hard to develop long-term business strategies that will net investors multiples on their investments. It also makes them — and those that use them — vulnerable to potential legal ramifications, compliance roadblocks and copyright issues in the future. (AI art tools like Midjourney are already being hit with copyright lawsuits for stealing from artists.)
“I can’t use a part of someone else’s IP because the harm, from a reputational point of view and a monetary point of view, for big brands is going to be huge if they’re discovered using or plagiarizing other people’s IP,” said Eric Hippeau, co-founder of VC firm Lerer Hippeau.
As a result, investors have been more skeptical about the long-term viability of generative AI.
Self-funding a new company
When Ralph and Pham began Obello in April 2022, the economic situation was bleak. Private-market funding was drying up, interest rates soared and private companies were grappling with sky-high valuations.
“What’s required from companies today is they have to be fiscally responsible,” Pham said.  “What’s important for us is to build a product first.”
Startups in most industries aren’t getting the same love as AI. Mistral AI, a startup founded in May, managed to raise $113 million despite not having any sort of product.
“Let’s say we went to a VC and they’re like, ‘Oh my goodness, this is generative AI. You’re training a model. Let me value your company at $25 million,’” Ralph said. “Then we have to actually deliver, to perform as a $25 million company. And that’s a huge burden to carry.”
While most startups are facing a valuation reckoning, and venture firms say they’re course-correcting, it seems like the AI hype is following in the footsteps of crypto and Web3.
“We’re happy that we’re in the right space at the right time,” Ralph said. “But also we don’t want to set ourselves up for failure in the future.”

The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Madhive Tops In Very Slow Week,Chris Metinko,2023/06/16,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.

This week in venture can be described in two simple words — slow and quiet. Only one company saw a nine-figure round — and that oddly was an advertising startup. Aside from that, rounds were on the smaller side, with it taking only $25 million to make this list. The “June Gloom” seemed to hit VC this week.
1. Madhive, $300M, adtech: Advertising software companies rarely make it this high on the list, but that fact didn’t stop Madhive. The New York-based firm raised $300 million from Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which valued the company at $1 billion, per Axios. The deal gives Goldman a minority stake in the company. Launched in 2015 at Otter TV, Madhive sells its CTV (connected TV) advertising software platform to local TV companies that sell CTV ads. The company already has $100 million, per the Axios report.
2. Tomorrow.io, $87M, environmental consulting: Climate changes and weather-related issues continue to dominate the news. Tomorrow.io is hoping to let people know of those problems earlier, and locked up an $87 million Series E led by Activate Capital to that end. The company has built a weather intelligence and climate adaptation platform — which includes a weather and climate generative AI tool nicknamed “Gale” — and just launched its R2 weather satellite. The Boston-based startup is hoping to help businesses and governments solve their weather- and climate-related challenges. Founded in 2016, the company has raised $271 million, per Crunchbase.
3. FZ Sports, $74M, sports: Miami-based FZ Sports locked up a $74 million round from a handful of investors this week, including 777 Partners and MEP Capital. The round is a mix of debt and equity capital; however, the exact makeup was not disclosed. The sports media and technology startup — which operates 1190 Sports, Fanatiz and Nunchee – manages the international broadcasting rights for leagues in Latin America, including the Brasileirão, Liga Argentina de Futbol and recently added Liga1 Peru. Soccer is the world’s most popular game, and there is no doubt a rabid following for many of the top leagues in Latin America.
4. Primer Technologies, $69M, defense: Late last year we all saw the potential interest in defense tech as Costa Mesa, California-based Anduril locked up a Series E worth nearly $1.5 billion that values the company at $8.5 billion. This week, Primer locked up a round that is smaller but still significant. The San Francisco-based company specializing in AI-powered data analysis announced a $69 million “first close” of its Series D. The new cash will be used to accelerate the development of AI solutions for the government and commercial customers. Primer’s government offerings focus on software for intelligence gathering and analysis through natural language processing. The funding was led by Addition — which also was in the news this week. Founded in 2015, Primer has raised $237 million, per Crunchbase.
5. Octave, $52M, health care: San Francisco-based behavioral health care startup Octave closed a $52 million Series C round led by Cigna Ventures, Novo Holdings and Avidity Partners as it looks to expand its in-network therapy services nationally. The company has both in-person and virtual clinics, and offers personalized care plans for individuals, couples and families that often is covered through insurance. Founded in 2018, the company has raised $86 million, per Crunchbase.
6. CubicPV, $33M, solar: Bedford, Massachusetts-based solar manufacturing startup CubicPV announced it has received $33 million in the first tranche of a $100 million investment led by SCG Cleanergy. Founded in 2021, the company has raised $58 million.
7. CloudZero, $32M, cloud: Boston-based cloud cost intelligence platform CloudZero closed a $32 million Series B led by Innovius Capital and Threshold Ventures. Founded in 2016, the company has now raised $48 million, per Crunchbase.
8. Theradaptive, $26M, biotech: Frederick, Maryland-based Theradaptive, a biopharmaceutical company focusing on targeted regenerative therapeutics, closed a $26 million Series A. The company did not release investors. Founded in 2016, this is the company’s first disclosed outside raise, per Crunchbase.
9. (tied) FIA Tech, $25M, financial services: New York-based FIA Tech, a provider of financial and legal agreements and brokerage services, closed a $25.4 million round led by six existing shareholders: Bank of America, Barclays, Citi, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Wells Fargo. Founded in 2008, FIA Tech has raised almost $70 million, per the company.
9. (tied) Paro, $25M, fintech: Chicago-based Paro, which provides on-demand bookkeeping, raised a $25 million Series C led by Top Tier Capital Partners. Founded in 2015, Paro has raised $67 million to date, per the company.
Big global deals
The biggest round of the week was Madhive’s, but another pretty large round occurred in Europe.

London-based Beacon Therapeutics, which is looking to treat blinding retinal illnesses and restore and enhance eyesight, raised a $123 million Series A.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of June 10 to June 16. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

Behind The Curtain: Crunchbase News Talks To A Vertically Farmed Baby Kale Plant,Christine Kilpatrick,2023/06/16,"

In our Behind The Curtain Q&As, we explore the venture capital ecosystem with some unexpected guides. Last time, we talked to a laid-off chatbot. In this installment, a Crunchbase News editor chats with a baby kale plant in its indoor vertical grow tower.
Thank you for taking the time to talk to us. How are you today?
Kale: My nitrogen levels are a bit low this morning, so we’re monitoring them closely, but I feel well-lit and properly hydrated.
Great. So let’s get to it. Our data says VC investors plowed $4.5 billion into agtech startups last year, and 20% of that went to indoor farming startups. Plenty and Gotham Greens raised hundreds of millions of dollars. Are you excited about your field’s success?
Kale: Oh, yes, we’re the future of food. Indoor farmers use AI to make granular adjustments to water, electricity and heat so we always feel nice and cozy. 
You do look very comfortable up there.
Kale: Plus, indoor farming saves on water and other resources, and you can grow us anywhere, saving on shipping costs. I’ve got family growing in a grocery store in Seattle. Everyone seems to like it there — except for the cilantro, but those guys are total snobs.
Yes, you’re a real plant of the people. Ever think of growing outside?
Kale: What? What? (shudders with rustling leaves) Out there? With all that … weather?
Sure. Why not?
Kale: Excuse me, have you been outdoors? I’ve heard things: It’s too hot, it’s too cold, it’s too bright, it’s too cloudy … and don’t even get me started on the bugs. 
Kale’s a pretty hardy plant, right? You’d be fine.
Kale: Well, I won’t have it. I wasn’t optimally cultivated to be a mid-morning snack for rabbits. Here I’ve got my carbon-dioxide monitoring system, fan coil chiller and AI-enabled robots. That’s all I need. Plus my nutrient tubes, humidifiers and phyto-light system. 
Sounds like growing kale indoors can be challenging.
Kale: I’ll admit some of us can be a bit temperamental, but we’re worth every drop of enriched water. There’s more to life than butter lettuce. 
Clearly AI-assisted agtech as a whole has great potential, but I understand that indoor farming is mostly limited to herbs and leafy greens. Isn’t that a problem?
Kale: No. People should eat more salad. 
Maybe so, but indoor farming still seems expensive and hard to scale. Late last year, indoor farming only made up around 14% of total funding in agriculture. 
Kale: Oh, you make my leaves wilt with such talk. We’re finished. Quick, my nitrogen atomizer!

Accel’s AI Investments Keep The Focus On Applications And Tooling,Gené Teare,2023/06/16,"

This article is part of our series of profiles that spotlight an investor firm’s AI strategy, including a list of its AI portfolio. In a previous interview, we talked to Sameer Dholakia from Bessemer Venture Partners, who predicted a fast adoption curve of AI through APIs. 
With 40 years of investing under its belt, global venture capital firm Accel has long seen the potential of artificial intelligence. Now the firm is making fresh bets in AI startups.
The power of AI unleashed by large language models like ChatGPT has led to significant investor interest in applying AI to everything from chips to data storage and AI infrastructure, as well as tooling and applications built on the technology.

We spoke with Accel partner Daniel Levine about the firm’s AI investment outlook.
The firm is making investments in AI across its team in India, London and the U.S., as well as its growth team. Levine likens it to investing in software, where the responsibility does not sit with one team or person but is distributed. While not every investment is necessarily in an AI company, AI is key to the firm’s strategy. Accel is unlikely to invest in chips or data centers, said Levine. But the tooling and applications side of the technology is in its wheelhouse.
Daniel Levine, a partner at Accel
“You’ll see new companies for which AI makes the difference between the product being so-so and potentially [being] a game changer in its category,” said Levine.
For many software companies, that poses a significant opportunity and threat. This technology can propel a company forward, but can also leave a company trailing as competitors take advantage of the possibilities it presents.
Ground-floor investment
Levine led Accel’s 2017 Series A funding in Scale AI, a company which trains data for AI capabilities. Scale has raised close to $600 million since then, from its Series B through Series E, which were led, respectively, by Index Ventures, Founders Fund, Tiger Global, Dragoneer and Greenoaks.
Co-founded by Alexandr Wang and Lucy Guo, Scale AI started out in this generation’s equivalent of a garage — the basement of investor Levine’s San Francisco home. The company hired thousands of contractors to annotate pictures for self-driving technology companies which today include Waymo, Lyft and Toyota. It has since expanded to natural language training as well as computer vision processing, supporting companies such as OpenAI, Pinterest and Airbnb.
Levine understood from his early days at Crunchbase — he was a colleague of ours who joined straight out of Yale — that having people looking at data under the hood is a necessary part of the process.
Application
“We’ll always play at the application level,” with the goal to make users more productive, said Levine.
Accel led the 2020 Series B funding in Toronto-based Ada, an application layer customer service chatbot that utilizes AI.
“We could assume that over time, AI can make support agents more efficient,” said Levine. These tools balance when a human or an algorithm is involved to provide a better service. “There’ll still be cases when you’re going to want to talk to a person either on chat or phone. But there are definitely a lot of cases where you want to talk to an algorithm because it’s faster, it’s more convenient and it’s consistent,” he said.
Levine referenced project management software Notion — not an Accel portfolio company — several times in our conversation. “Notion AI is a very important product for them,” he said. Notion hosts wikis, docs and projects for companies, and has launched AI tools to help with writing, summarizing and planning, to make users more effective.
Tooling
Tooling and infrastructure companies are a core AI investment focus for Accel. These are the companies that assist other companies with their tech products. One of its portfolio companies, AssemblyAI, for example, provides infrastructure around understanding audio.
Accel also announced this week it led a Series C funding in London-based generative video company Synthesia, which makes video production possible for companies without actors, cameras or studios.
Another area of interest for Levine and Accel are new database products for understanding bias or trust and safety around AI, what the model is doing, and how it drifts.
The companies that comprise Accel’s AI portfolio span more than a decade and are not only represented by the new wave of companies. The companies listed here were founded as early as 2011 and the most recent in 2021. Levine’s investments in companies that predate AI but have since integrated these capabilities include Sentry, an error-monitoring tool for software teams, and visual workplace collaboration platform Whimsical.
“You’ll see a lot of companies that in hindsight will look like they’ve replaced existing software players,” he said.
Levine has also led Accel’s investments in, and serves on the boards of EdgeDB, Gem, Mux, ReadMe, Scale, Sentry, Sprig, Vercel and Whimsical.

Federal Prosecutors Punt On Some Charges Against Bankman-Fried,Chris Metinko,2023/06/15,"

Federal prosecutors have moved to remove five charges against disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.
Prosecutors have asked a judge to remove the five additional charges they brought against the former billionaire this year after they filed their original eight-count indictment in December.
Those charges, which include bribery of a foreign government official, were thrown into doubt after questions arose whether the U.S. government had followed the correct procedure in adding the additional charges after Bankman-Fried’s extradition.

In December, federal prosecutors charged Bankman-Fried with a slew of criminal counts after his arrest in the Bahamas — including conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud, individual charges of securities fraud and wire fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy to avoid campaign finance regulations.
However, the move may just end up opening another case against Bankman-Fried. Federal prosecutors could refile those charges against the FTX founder at a later date separately.
The story so far
FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in November after it was not able to repay customers who had deposited funds on its exchange.
FTX was the fourth-largest crypto exchange by volume when it failed, and Bankman-Fried was one of crypto’s biggest evangelists and financial backers. Through FTX Ventures and his other trading firm Alameda Research, the crypto whiz kid made hundreds of bets on the industry and the future of digital finance.
Investors in FTX included big names such as Sequoia Capital, NEA, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Insight Partners, Temasek, SoftBank Vision Fund, Thoma Bravo, SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Coinbase Ventures.
At its peak, FTX and FTX US — its U.S.-based exchange — were valued at valuations of $32 billion and $8 billions, respectively.

Metaverse Investing Has Slowed. Can Apple Save It?,Chris Metinko,2023/06/15,"

The metaverse is dead. Long live the metaverse.
Well, it’s not quite dead, but it certainly is not where it was just less than two years ago after then-Facebook changed its name to Meta and it became the buzziest of buzz words.
However, last week’s unveiling of the new Apple Vision Pro — with a price tag of just $3,500! — put a spotlight back on the space, highlighting what it could be and what its future may hold.

The present isn’t great for the startups in the space, as venture dollars in the sector have plummeted since Mark Zuckerberg’s big name change announcement in late 2021.
The numbers
Funding to startups in the metaverse space — defined here as companies in virtual reality, augmented reality and the virtual world industries — has dropped 77% from the the final quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of this year, per Crunchbase data.
The current quarter doesn’t seem to promise anything better.


Now, it is important to remember that in late 2021 — a year in which all venture funding records were smashed — was a very different time in the funding world than the current environment. The venture market has seen a significant downturn since then and shows few signs of returning.
Nevertheless, not only have dollar amounts decreased — from $2.2 billion invested in Q4 2021 to only $526 million last quarter, per Crunchbase — but so has deal flow. More than 160 deals were announced in the final quarter of 2021, while last quarter saw fewer than 100.
The last quarter of 2021 saw some massive deals, such as a $500 million investment in augmented reality startup Magic Leap, as well as a $300 million Series D for fellow AR player Niantic.
However, this year has seen no such rounds. The largest deal is on the periphery of the space — New York-based AI-powered car buying platform Impel landed a $104 million round in January. The startup does use AR features to make the car-buying experience more personalized, but that does seem on the fringe of what most people define as the metaverse.
The next largest round was a $70 million Series B for Orlando, Florida-based Red 6 this month. The startup is an augmented reality company that works with the United States Air Force to train fighter pilots.
Despite that round, the current quarter — with only weeks left — has seen only $284 million invested in startups involved in the metaverse in a meager 46 deals.
Even the slight uptick in funding in the final quarter of last year is really an illusion. The $1.9 billion number is mainly because of the $1.5 billion Series E defense and security firm Anduril picked up. The Costa Mesa, California-based startup includes AR/VR technology in its software and hardware for the military and defense industry.
Bigger problems
Of course, the adoption of the metaverse hasn’t just taken hits from VC investors.
Earlier this year, Microsoft said it would shut down AltspaceVR, the social virtual reality platform it acquired in 2017. It was later reported the company also dismantled a team it formed four months ago to help customers use the metaverse in industrial settings.
In March, it was reported Disney that squashed its metaverse plan after laying off its team focused on interactive storytelling.
Even Meta itself has seemed more interested in tech’s latest shiny toy — artificial intelligence — than talking about the metaverse.
The Apple effect
However, Apple’s unveiling of its Vision Pro has renewed talk of the concept — and perhaps for good reason.
Unlike Meta, Apple has a long track record of unveiling some of the tech industry’s most successful and game-changing devices. The Cupertino, California-based giant has been able to take vague concepts and ideas and distill them into a device — or devices — that are easy to use and can even be status symbols.
Apple even doubled down on its AR/VR bets last week, buying Los Angeles-based Mira, an AR startup that makes lightweight headsets for industrial companies and the U.S. military, for an undisclosed amount.
While many have buried the metaverse, it’s important to remember that ideas like the metaverse (or Web3) can’t be built in a quarter. The infrastructure alone needed for such platforms takes years to create. In that amount of time, there will be plenty of ebbs and flows in the marketplace.
All of this isn’t to say the metaverse has been completely resuscitated. No one can be sure of Apple’s full plans for its latest device. The company also does not have the best record of working nicely with external developers — something that will be needed for the metaverse to happen.
However, there is a reason Apple has a nearly $2.9 trillion market cap — almost triple that of the tech market’s latest darling, Nvidia, which is riding high on the coattails of the AI frenzy. If there is a company that can bring the metaverse to (virtual) life, it could be the maker of the Mac.

Primer Technologies Proves The Worth Of Enterprise AI With $69M Raise,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/06/14,"

Primer Technologies, an artificial intelligence and predictive analytics startup, announced on Wednesday it has raised $69 million in Series D funding.
The round was led by Addition, with additional participation from the US Innovative Technology Fund. The company’s fresh fundraising brings its total funding to $237 million, per Crunchbase data.
Primer Technologies has long been a big player in the AI and machine-learning space. The company was founded in 2015 and quickly nabbed government clients such as the United States Special Operations Command, the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Army. Military officials use Primer’s technology to plan missions and predict logistics.

The new round of funding will go toward Primer’s new generative AI models. The company already has a large language model functionality built into its system — the same sort of technology that powers open-source generative AI tools like ChatGPT and OpenAI’s platform.
Primer Technologies recently launched Primer Delta, a platform that can analyze millions of documents. The company is creating an internal search function that mimics Google Search, in  which analysts can simply ask questions pertaining to the details of the company through the organization’s intranet.
Enterprise AI enamors the market
Enterprise-focused AI platforms like Primer Technologies are going to prove to be a far better money-making venture than consumer-facing companies that build on top of ChatGPT’s API. Already, the arms race has begun.
Last month, The Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence announced it will invest $30 million in enterprise AI applications.
Also in May, Microsoft invested a whopping $13 billion in AI giant OpenAI to build out its suite of enterprise-grade AI tools in a search function similar to Primer Delta.
ServiceNow, a cloud infrastructure company, announced in May it will put aside $1 billion in venture funding for enterprise-focused AI startups. The company acquired Element AI and the AI platform Hitch Works.

Addition Looks To Add New $1.5B Fund Amid Market Slowdown,Chris Metinko,2023/06/14,"

New York-based Addition is looking to raise a new $1.5 billion even as the venture capital market continues its slowdown, per a TechCrunch report.

The firm, which has invested in such startups as Stripe, Snyk and Chainalysis, was founded by former Tiger Global executive Lee Fixel in 2020 and has made more than 100 deals, per Crunchbase data.
Most recently, Addition took part in Adept AI’s $350 million Series B. It was reported the new money gives the San Francisco-based startup a post-money valuation of at least $1 billion.
Like most firms, Addition has significantly cut the pace of its dealmaking, per Crunchbase data. It made 54 deals in 2021, but that number fell to only 29 last year.
So far this year, it has taken part in only six funding deals.
Bucking a trend
Addition’s decision to raise a new fund comes even as some big-named firms have slashed their fundraising targets.
Earlier this week, it was reported New York-based Insight Partners has significantly cut the $20 billion target for its latest fund — while also saying it would slow down its pace of dealmaking — and has raised only about $2 billion for the fund.
In February, Fixel’s previous employer, Tiger Global, had reduced the target size for its latest venture fund to $5 billion — down from a $6 billion target it set last fall and down more than 50% of what the firm anticipated raising earlier last year, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal.
Those cuts come as the venture market has continued to tumble from its 2021 highs. Global venture funding in 2022 hit $445 billion — marking a 35% decline year over year from the $681 billion invested in 2021 — according to an analysis of Crunchbase data.
Those numbers have continued to decline into 2023.

TransUnion Dials Up Competitiveness With $24M Startup Investment,Jenna D'Illard,2023/06/14,"

Credit checks, income checks, employment checks, all the grown-up money-related checks can strike fear into the heart of a prospective homebuyer, renter, job seeker or loan seeker.
But they’ve got to be done, and consolidation of those services provides a competitive advantage for any credit reporting agency.

To that end, publicly held reporting giant TransUnion announced Wednesday it has invested $24 million in equity funding in San Francisco-based Truework to integrate the startup’s income and employment verification platform, according to the company.
What is Truework?
Founded in 2017, Truework is an income and employment verification platform. The company has now raised a total of $118.9 million in funding over six rounds, according to Crunchbase data. Truework is funded by 33 investors, including Sequoia Capital and Khosla Ventures.
In August, we reported that the company raised $50 million in a Series C. Chicago-based G Squared served as the round’s lead investor, according to Crunchbase data.
Whether this latest partnership could serve as a catalyst to a full-on acquisition of Truework by TransUnion remains to be seen. But it certainly puts the credit-reporting giant in a better position to compete with rival Equifax.
“TransUnion is a global leader in credit data and insights. Our partnership signals a new era for thousands of businesses and millions of consumers who will benefit from accurate and accessible income data paired with TransUnion’s deep product catalog,” said Ryan Sandler, CEO and co-founder of Truework, in a statement.
TransUnion also isn’t shy about acquisitions. The company has acquired 24 organizations, according to Crunchbase data. Its most recent was Verisk Financial for an undisclosed amount in February 2022.
And in the current market, an acquisition might be a startup’s best bet for success.

Is AI The Cause Of Job Cuts This Year?,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/06/14,"

When ChatGPT was launched on the last day of November, it punctuated what was, at the time, the largest layoff month of 2022. More people were laid off in November than in every other month of the year combined — more than 44,000 people, according to Crunchbase data.
Perhaps November’s numbers were a harbinger of trying times ahead. Since then, companies have continued layoffs at the same brutal pace. While funding dried up elsewhere, leading to layoffs, venture firms were pouring money into the generative AI movement, where language models were poised to be the next big cash cow.
Indeed, according to Crunchbase data, funding to AI startups made up about 10% of global startup funding. Venture’s dramatic shift in funding priorities has rocked every industry from the art world to health care. And whenever a new piece of technology promises to disrupt an industry, the first worry is that it will replace workers.

“[We’re] pitching the opposite,” said Healy Jones, an executive at the startup consulting firm Kruze Consulting. “AI startups are the only ones really raising big rounds. That’s not to say that AI layoffs aren’t happening, and that some development work isn’t changing. But I haven’t seen the impact.”
AI spurs layoffs in tech
While few — if any — tech startups are actively conducting layoffs to offload work onto AI, the tech industry is quickly embracing artificial intelligence. According to a report from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which looks at layoffs across every industry, around 5% of May’s job cuts were directly related to artificial intelligence.
“We do believe AI will cause more job loss, though we are surprised how quickly the technology was cited as a reason,” Andy Challenger told Fortune. “It is incredible the speed the technology is evolving and being adapted.”
IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said the company is planning to pause hiring for roles that AI can reasonably do. Positions in human resources, or jobs that aren’t customer-facing, would be on the chopping block. That means 26,000 jobs at IBM could be in part or in whole replaced by AI. The company and its subsidiary Red Hat have laid off around 4,660 people so far in 2023.
On Monday, the homework helper platform Chegg announced it will lay off 4% of the company, or 80 positions, in order to begin deploying its AI strategy. Students have quickly adopted OpenAI tools and ChatGPT to get their homework done, impacting Chegg’s revenue. In the span of three months, the company introduced its own education platform powered by generative AI called CheggMate to rival the open-source tools.
The dangers of AI
But the rapid adoption of AI is likely to require more jobs to babysit the technology.
As of March, U.S.-based jobs on LinkedIn that mentioned GPT increased nearly 80% year over year. And, according to Crunchbase data, startups focused on AI are quickly joining The Crunchbase Unicorn Board as funding to the category speeds up.
Yossi Sheffi, an engineering professor at MIT, said that if anything, AI may, in a way, be a job creator. Workers will need to manage the technology through different, industrywide regulatory frameworks.
“Even if the invention is good and can be adopted, there are a lot of things that inhibit fast adoption,” he said. “How will they be regulated to make sure they aren’t harmful?”
Already, we’re starting to see some changes in the way companies are making staff changes to experiment with AI. At the National Eating Disorders Association, executives fired a slew of support line staffers after they attempted to unionize. The company quietly launched a chatbot, Tessa, to take over those duties. It was quickly pulled after it gave those with eating disorders bad advice — an argument those in the health care industry have used to stave off adopting AI.
“This is scary and there’s no precedent, and no one really knows what’s going on,” said Jeremy Kaufmann, a partner at Scale Venture Partners focused on automation.

AI-Generated Video Platform Synthesia Receives Nvidia Backing At Unicorn Valuation,Chris Metinko,2023/06/13,"

Synthesia is the latest AI startup to raise a big round and hit a $1 billion valuation after a $90 million Series C.
The London-based startup allows companies to easily create instructional videos from text featuring stock or custom AI avatars without the need for actors, cameras or studios.
The new round was led by Accel with investments from NVentures — Nvidia’s venture capital arm — and existing investors Kleiner Perkins, GV, Firstmark Capital, Alex Wang, Olivier Pomel and Amjad Masad.

“While we weren’t actively looking for new investment, Accel and NVIDIA share our vision for transforming traditional video production into a digital workflow that will enable creators to bring their ideas, from training videos to Hollywood films, to life with only a Synthesia account,” said Synthesia co-founder and CEO Victor Riparbelli in a release. “I’m delighted to have them on board as we accelerate our AI research efforts.”
Synthesia says more than 12 million videos have been generated on its platform since its founding in 2017. The startup works with more than 50,000 companies worldwide.
The company has now raised more than $156 million, per Crunchbase.
Nvidia’s AI moves
No big tech company may be benefiting more from the AI explosion than Nvidia — which recently became the first trillion-dollar chip firm.
Nvidia is leading the charge for chips with better processing to train large language models for AI — a race that will only get more heated as more AI applications are built and better infrastructure is necessary to support them.
The chip giant also has been making investment moves in the ecosystem surrounding AI. The company has made 19 different investments in VC-backed startups since the start of 2021, per Crunchbase data. Those deals include participating in Adept AI’s $350 million Series B in March and Toronto-based Cohere’s $270 million round in May.

Accenture Commits $3B To AI,Jenna D'Illard,2023/06/13,"

Signaling yet another major player’s acceptance of AI, global consulting firm Accenture said Tuesday it will invest $3 billion over three years into its AI and data practice.
That will look like new hires, training existing employees and acquisitions, according to a statement from the firm.
The publicly traded company advises and provides services to clients on generative AI projects across 19 industries, and Accenture CEO Julie Sweet said a commitment to AI is critical in serving its clients.

“Our clients have complex environments, and at a time when the technology is changing rapidly, our deep understanding of ecosystem solutions allows us to help them navigate quickly and cost effectively to make smart decisions,” said Sweet.
The investment comes just months after Accenture announced it will lay off 19,000 workers.
This shift in strategy begs the question of whether AI will replace jobs (as we all suspect) or ironically fuel hiring humans who know how to navigate the AI world.
AI investment, can’t stop won’t stop
Public and private companies (and the consultants that serve them) alike are finding their way in the new AI paradigm.
Earlier this week Salesforce Ventures 1 — Salesforce’s venture arm —  announced it will double the size of its Generative AI Fund to $500 million, just three months after launching it.
Salesforce and Salesforce Ventures are among several big tech companies and corporate venture arms that have been placing AI bets for several years.

Clean Air Startups Are Scaling Up,Joanna Glasner,2023/06/13,"

Everyone is happier breathing fresh, clean air. Unfortunately, we often forget this until confronted with smoky, polluted air.
As Canadian wildfire smoke spread southward, North American population centers that historically haven’t suffered many dangerous air quality days got hit especially hard. Suddenly, millions are finding their thoughts turn to air purifiers and filtration systems.
It’s possible startups can play a helpful role here. While they haven’t figured out how to eliminate orange haze from our skylines, venture- and seed-backed companies are working on a number of devices and technologies that could make life a little more breathable.

From filters you wear in your nose to industrial carbon capture systems, startups focused on cleaner air have pulled in some big rounds over the past several years. Since air quality is on everyone’s mind lately, we decided to take a look at where the money is going.
Top startups tackling air quality
Using Crunchbase data, we compiled a sample set of companies funded in the past few years that have collectively raised over $1.2 billion to tackle air quality. Below are 22 that stood out:


Several of the most heavily funded companies above are working on carbon capture technologies which, while environmentally laudable, probably won’t have much impact on sporadic air pollution from wildfires. However, this category does include the top fundraiser, Zurich-based Climeworks, which has pulled in over $800 million for direct air capture.
Others are offering up products more targeted to people concerned with air quality in their immediate environs.
One example is San Francisco-based Aclima, which has raised $64 million to date for a hyperlocal air measurement and analytics platform that tracks pollution and greenhouse gasses. The company recently unveiled a partnership with Washington, D.C., to track air quality at the neighborhood block level.
Since most people spend the majority of time indoors, startups are also targeting these environments. Massachusetts-based enVerid, for instance, has pulled in over $38 million for ventilation products that improve indoor air quality.
Minnesota’s 75F, meanwhile, raised nearly $30 million for building automation tech that includes an air quality focus. And 10-year-old SafeTraces, of Pleasanton, California, has raised at least $18 million in known funding to date for technology that tracks whether filtration and ventilation systems are doing their job.
We’ve also previously looked at consumer-level technologies, including startups offering devices you wear on your nose to filter air. This includes London-based Be Nosy, a triangular air filter that seals around the nose, and Resprana, which offers in-nose air filters called Duo.
Big market, with exits too
Analysts project that global spending on air quality monitoring will trend upward for the next several years, and will likely surpass $7 billion by 2028. That’s a big enough number to support both startups and incumbents.
Investor enthusiasm over air quality-focused upstarts shares similarities with another uptrend we’ve seen in the venture space around weather. As we noted a few quarters ago, VCs have been pouring hundreds of millions into an assortment of companies focused on weather risk forecasting, analytics and related business models.
Overall, this is the opposite of a happy coincidence: Funding is happening because extreme weather events and air quality risks are on the rise.
In addition to venture capitalists, acquirers and public investors are also taking some interest in air quality-focused upstarts.
One of the more prominent exits in the past couple years was BreezeoMeter, an Israeli startup that provides street-level and real-time air quality information. It sold to Google last year in a deal reportedly valued around $250 million. Among other initiatives, the company offers a popular app that tracks air quality and pollens for one’s local area.
Then there’s Molekule, a seller of branded room air purification devices that previously raised nearly $120 million in venture funding. Molekule made it to the public market, but without a big return for investors. After closing a merger early this year with a publicly traded air hygiene provider, the combined company is valued at around $80 million.
No time to breathe easy about funding
It’s tough to say how the environment for air quality-focused startups will shape up over coming quarters. While startup investment is down sharply in 2023, climate has been one of the more resilient areas.
And, much as we’d prefer this not to be the case, air quality is a topic weighing on our minds a lot more than it used to.

Salesforce Ventures Doubles Down On AI Investments,Chris Metinko,2023/06/12,"

Three months after launching it, Salesforce Ventures — Salesforce’s venture arm —  announced it will double the size of its Generative AI Fund to $500 million.
In March, Salesforce Ventures 1 said it would launch a new $250 million generative AI fund that will look at promising generative AI startups. The firm announced at TrailblazerDX it will initially invest in four AI companies — Anthropic, Cohere, Hearth.AI and you.com.
Since then, the venture arm of the CRM giant also has made additional AI investments in Humane and Tribble — and obviously see there is much more potential in AI than only $250 million can cover.

“We are already seeing AI change the way the world works, and we’re excited to build on the momentum of our Generative AI Fund,” Paul Drews, managing partner at Salesforce Ventures, said in a release. “Expanding our Generative AI Fund enables us to work with even more entrepreneurs who are accelerating the development of transformative AI solutions for the enterprise, and we are excited to support the next generation of innovative founders.”
Corporate investments
Salesforce and Salesforce Ventures are among several big tech companies and corporate venture arms that have been placing AI bets for several years — although those deals have become more expensive.
Salesforce Ventures has taken part in more than 50 deals that involved AI-related startups since the start of 2019, per Crunchbase data.
This year, the venture arm has made four deals, including participating in Anthropic’s recent big raise. It also took part in Cohere’s huge $250 million round.
Salesforce Ventures’ deals also show the rising price to invest in AI-related startups. While the venture arm made 10 investments in deals that totaled $736 million last year, the four deals this year have totaled $705 million.

"Hello, What? Nasdaq Pays $10B For Adenza",Jenna D'Illard,2023/06/12,"

Yes, you read that headline correctly. While most of us were out soaking up some summer weekend vibes, this megadeal was going down.
In one of the biggest acquisitions of the year so far, Nasdaq will reportedly acquire privately held software company Adenza for $10 billion in a mix of cash and shares according to a release.
Adenza develops risk-management and related regulatory software for the financial services market, and is therefore a logical fit for Nasdaq. The company will be acquired by Nasdaq from Thoma Bravo, a software investment firm.

Formed in 2021 from the Thoma Bravo acquisitions of AxiomSL in 2020 and Calypso Technology in 2022, Adenza is expected to hit about $590 million in annual 2023 revenue, according to Nasdaq.
What’s Nasdaq up to?
The Adenza acquisition is the biggest for Nasdaq as it expands its fintech services. Nasdaq says with the acquisition it will be better positioned to provide “comprehensive support to financial institutions” over regulatory technology, compliance and risk management.
“This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a leading software company that enhances Nasdaq’s position at the heart of the global financial system,” said Adena Friedman, Nasdaq’s CEO.
Nasdaq,  which operates three stock exchanges in the U.S. and seven in Europe, has made eight investments in the past, according to Crunchbase data. Its most recent investment was on Aug. 2, 2021, to Boston-based Level ATS’ corporate round. Level ATS is an independently operated U.S. Equity Alternative Trading System located in Boston.
Holden Spaht, a managing partner at Thoma Bravo, is expected to be appointed to Nasdaq’s board of directors, which will be expanded to 12 members.
The deal falls a few billion short of Qualtrics’ $12.5 billion acquisition announced earlier this year and will reportedly be completed over the next nine months.

"Startups Are Knocking On The Door To Partner With Big Pharma, But Nobody’s Answering",Keerthi Vedantam,2023/06/12,"

Rancho Santa Fe Bio is undergoing something you don’t see a lot of these days for a startup of its size: a phase 3 clinical trial for a cardiovascular drug that could change the game for those with progressive aortic valve stenosis. 
The company is looking to raise its Series A to fund the trial, an expensive endeavor that will likely take years to prove to the Food and Drug Administration it’s superior to other drugs currently on the market. Only around 25% of drugs make it past phase 3. 
“I think the hardest part of this is being a small company,” said Randy Berholtz, CEO of RSF Bio, as the company is also known. “Doing a phase 3 really makes you a bigger company just with the amount of money you have to raise. It is what it is.”

Pharma companies usually partner with startups to drive them through clinical trials, but large pharmaceutical organizations have been laying low since the funding downturn. In 2022, merger and acquisition activity in the space was the lowest it had been since 2013, according to Clarivate Analytics. Partnerships, through which pharmaceutical companies fund the development of drugs and commercialize them themselves, was the lowest it had been since 2018. Per Crunchbase data, funding in 2022 was as low as it was in 2020.
“In the downturn, we have a situation where a lot of people would be happy to partner around whatever assets or platforms they have,” said Thomas Barnes, CEO of Orna Therapeutics. “Beggars can’t be choosers.”


The lack of activity has only strengthened Big Pharma’s place in the biotech ecosystem, and is creating waves across the delicate innovation pipeline. Without being able to scrounge up venture funding or develop strong partnerships, startups are stagnant.
“Without a shadow of a doubt, these are testing times for nurturing and fast-tracking innovation in the sector,” said Joe Young from consulting firm Vault Bioventures. 
Startups’ relationship with Big Pharma
It is, in a sense, somewhat surprising that partnership and acquisition activity has been so low. Without large research and development arms themselves, large pharma companies rely on smaller startups to discover and develop new drugs, which they later buy to commercialize, market and patent.
“The biotech companies are bringing innovative assets, which pharmaceutical companies need,” said Mike Ward, an analyst at Clarivate. “For pharmaceutical companies, it’s important that the biotech companies are robust and are going to be around.”
As drug patents expire to make way for generics, pharma companies are constantly on the hunt for new assets to make them money. But funding pharmaceuticals is an expensive and risky business. 
Pharma companies often partner with startups early to develop drugs created out of an already-tested platform, but that comes with regulatory and development risks. They might otherwise acquire those de-risked drugs late in the process at a higher cost.
Last year, Orna Therapeutics announced a partnership with Merck. Merck paid the company $150 million upfront and could pay up to an additional $3.5 billion if Orna successfully develops a handful of vaccines and therapeutics. Xanax, the EpiPen and Concerta have all been developed through a web of partnerships and Big Pharma acquisitions.
Berholtz has talked to large pharma companies before. But by entering phase 3, the company’s drug is more valuable than it has ever been, because it’s less risky and more likely to get the stamp of approval from the FDA. 
“We have had some Big Pharma saying, ‘Well, why don’t you de-risk it a little more? And then we know there’s going to be a New Drug Application, then come and talk to us,’” Berholtz said. “Because Big Pharma has the commercialization, sales and marketing teams.”
Who gets Big Pharma partnerships?
RSF Bio is in what Young calls “no man’s land” in biotech — that phase in a drug’s lifecycle where the startup often has to front the cost of developing the drug and pushing it through regulatory approval at little risk to the pharma company that acquires it. 
“[Pharma companies] have bifurcated, either very early or incredibly, incredibly late,” Young said. “And that’s kind of created this gulf in the middle. …This is where a lot of promising assets, with their associated risks, go to die.”
It’s not easy to scrounge up a partnership deal with Big Pharma. Many of these companies are struggling in the public markets, so they’re focused on very specific, bread-and-butter pipeline drugs that leave a lot of innovative companies out of their scope. 
“When the deals get done, it’s more of a window into what the pharma is thinking,” said Barnes. “It’s less of a marker for how persuasive the biotech has been in persuading them to do something.”
Midsize to small pharma companies are also suffering on the public markets, and their lower market capitalizations make it harder to fund biotech innovation through partnerships.
“The public markets are closed and the private markets are tough,” Berholtz said. “I would think that the dynamic in that collaborative process has shifted in favor of the pharma companies.”

The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: CleanCapital and Upstream Bio Lead Huge Week,Chris Metinko,2023/06/9,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.

It was a big, big week in funding, with eight rounds topping $100 million and the top two totaling $700 million. Biotech and health care again saw several huge rounds — taking six spots on this week’s list. However, cleantech, cyber and even the insurance sector saw some meaningful cash.
1. CleanCapital, $500M, clean energy: Cleantech led the way this week, thanks to this monster round. New York-based CleanCapital, a solar and storage developer that invests in early-stage projects, locked up a $500 million commitment from Canadian insurer Manulife Investment Management. CleanCapital will use the money to fund early-stage solar and storage development and acquire other renewable energy assets in the U.S. The company also announced it has now deployed more than $1 billion to fund operating, new construction, and early-stage solar and storage development. Founded in 2015, the company has received about $1.1 billion, per Crunchbase.
2. Upstream Bio, $200M, biotech: It was almost exactly a year ago when Waltham, Massachusetts-based Upstream Bio locked up a $200 million Series A. This week it’s back for another $200 million; a Series B led jointly by Enavate Sciences and Venrock Healthcare Capital Partners. Upstream Bio is developing an antibody that targets thymic stromal lymphopoietin and its receptors that can inflame when things like smoke or allergens are introduced into the environment. The treatment could be useful to those with asthma. Founded in 2004, the company has now raised $400 million, per Crunchbase.
3. Blackpoint Cyber, $190M, cybersecurity: Cybersecurity, like most sectors, has experienced a slowdown when it comes to venture funding. However, that did not stop Maryland-based Blackpoint Cyber from cashing in. The startup, which offers a security suite of products to managed service providers, raised a $190 million growth investment led by Bain Capital Tech Opportunities. Founded in 2014, the company has now raised more than $200 million, per Crunchbase.
4. Alkeus Pharmaceuticals, $150M, biotech: Every week, one needs not to go very far down this list to find a big biotech raise. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Alkeus Pharmaceuticals made the list with a $150 million Series B led by Bain Capital Life Sciences. The company specializes in pharmaceuticals to fight Stargardt disease, which is a leading cause of blindness in children and young adults. In addition to the new funding, Alkeus has also named Dr. Joshua Boger, the founder of Vertex Pharmaceuticals, its executive chairman.
5. Bitterroot Bio, $145M, biotech: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for men, women and many ethnic groups and races in the U.S. and worldwide. Ideally, Bitterroot Bio would like to change that. The Palo Alto, California-based company is focused on novel immunotherapies in cardiovascular disease, and launched from stealth this week with a $145 million Series A led by Arch Venture Partners and Deerfield Management. The company, founded in 2021, hopes to use immunology — including the identification of novel targets and the development of innovative protein therapies — to fight the deadly disease.
6. Incline P&C Group, $125M, insurance: Austin, Texas-based Incline P&C Group, an insurance program market services firm, locked up a $125 million investment from Braemont Capital. Founded in 2015, this is the firm’s first outside raise, per Crunchbase.
7. (tied) Acepodia, $100M, biotech: Alameda, California-based clinical-stage cancer biotech firm Acepedia announced a $100 million Series D financing led by Digital Mobile Venture. Founded in 2016, the company has now raised $256 million, per Crunchbase.
7. (tied) Charm Industrial, $100M, cleantech: San Francisco-based carbon removal technology company Charm Industrial raised a $100 million Series B led by General Catalyst. Founded in 2018, this is the company’s first outside funding, per Crunchbase.
9. Upperline Health, $58.4M, health care: Nashville, Tennessee-based Upperline Health, a provider network for specialty care, raised $58.4 million in new capital led by Crestline. Founded in 2016, the company has now raised $137 million, per Crunchbase.
10. Kate Therapeutics, $51M, biotech: San Diego-based Kate Therapeutics, a gene therapy company, emerged from stealth with a $51 million Series A financing co-led by founding investors Westlake Village BioPartners and Versant Ventures.
Big global deals
Once again, even though U.S.-based startups cleaned up this week with venture dollars, the largest round came from across the pond.

U.K.-based Gigaclear, a developer of ultra-fast broadband networks based on pure fiber technology, raised a venture round of more than $450 million.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of June 2 to June 9. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

"SoftBank’s Hits Are Iconic, But So Are Its Misses",Joanna Glasner,2023/06/9,"

In 2018 when SoftBank Vision Fund invested $375 million in Zume, a Silicon Valley startup with a robot-crafted pizza-making service, there were one of two gut responses. First: That’s not going to work out well. Second: Sounds out there, but maybe they’re onto something.
Nearly five years later, it looks like the first response was on target. Zume, which pivoted a few years ago from pizza to sustainable packaging, recently shut down due to insolvency, according to reports.

The closure was the latest in a long string of disappointing outcomes for the Vision Fund, which shook up startupland in 2017 with the first $100 billion investment vehicle — the largest in industry history. A couple years later came the similarly jumbo-sized SoftBank Vision Fund II.
These funds went on to back some notorious flops, like former construction industry unicorn Katerra. Others that are still around are worth a tiny fraction of their former valuations, including companies like WeWork.
To get a sense of the scope of SoftBank flops, we used Crunchbase data to analyze the most heavily-funded U.S. companies 1 that counted the Vision Fund as a lead investor. We then categorized the largest disappointments in three buckets: poor public market performers, defunct companies and low valuation acquisitions.
Public, but far below highs
In the first category, we look at SoftBank-backed publicly traded companies trading far below their initial offering prices or peak private valuations. Below is a list of six that fit that criteria:


WeWork, trading around 21 cents a share today, has to be the leading cautionary tale. SoftBank invested over $10 billion in the shared office space provider over the years, beginning with a late-stage financing in 2017. WeWork’s current market cap is around $170 million.
View, the smart glass maker that raised $1.1 billion from SoftBank in 2018, has also been an exceptionally poor performer, with a market cap of less than $50 million and shares hovering below 20 cents each.
Shuttered or bankrupt
Meanwhile, several heavily funded companies that counted SoftBank as a lead backer have closed their doors or filed bankruptcy. We list four of the most prominent below:


Like Zume, Boston-based Pear Therapeutics’ name got added to the list relatively recently. The digital therapeutics developer announced in April that it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company had previously struggled to get insurers to pay for its offerings.
Poor exits
Some Vision Fund big bets have also sold to acquirers at steep discounts to their prior valuations.
Fair, a vehicle leasing platform that raised $385 million in equity and $1.7 billion in debt financing in the late 2010s, is a case in point. The company sold last year to Shift, an online used car marketplace, in a deal valued at less than $20 million.
Berkshire Grey, a maker of robotic systems for warehouse automation, also sold at a steep discount, although in this case the buyer was SoftBank itself. After going public via SPAC in 2021 at a $2.7 billion valuation, shares had shed over 90% of their value by late 2022. SoftBank swooped in this March with a deal to take the company private at a $375 million valuation.
Yes, there are successes in there too
While we’re focusing on unsuccessful outcomes here, no one should walk away with the impression that Vision Fund is just a flop-producing machine. They’ve also led rounds for a number of startups that have had a transformative role in their industries, including Uber, Slack and DoorDash.
Prior to the Vision Fund, SoftBank was also known for its early stake in China’s Alibaba. Over the years, the firm reportedly made $72 billion on that investment, which ranks among the most lucrative of all time.
Struggling
While we talk of hits and misses, it’s also true that much of the SoftBank portfolio is in a more ambiguous category. This largely includes companies that raised big rounds in 2020 and 2021 but haven’t closed on funding since.
A sizable number of heavily funded companies have announced layoffs in the past few quarters. This includes mortgage provider Better, ghost kitchen operator Reef Technology, and fast delivery service Gopuff, among a long list of others.
However, while it doesn’t look like these companies are in a position to invite term sheet bidding wars, they are still in business. For those who laid off staff and carried out other cost-cutting measures, it will take a while to parse to what extent these steps have put companies in a better position for long-term viability.

AI Startup Cohere Locks Up $270M At $2.2B Valuation,Chris Metinko,2023/06/8,"

Toronto-based Cohere became the latest artificial intelligence startup to raise big money at an even bigger valuation.
The startup raised a $270 million Series C led by Inovia Capital at a valuation of $2.2 billion.
Other investors in the round include some big corporate names — Nvidia, Oracle, Salesforce Ventures1, DTCP and SentinelOne — as well as financial institutions and VC firms Mirae Asset, Schroders Capital, Thomvest Ventures and Index Ventures. 

Cohere builds large language models that allow AI to learn from new data, and can be customized and put into applications for features like interactive chat or to generate text.
Umesh Padval, a venture partner at Thomvest Ventures, told Crunchbase News his firm made the investment for a handful of reasons, including Cohere’s engineering and management teams, its multicloud and hybrid cloud approach and its significant strategic channels option — as well as the market in general.
There is a “massive market opportunity in LLM space which is exploding,” Padval said. “Cohere has all the elements which would make them successful.”
AI trends
The Cohere round illustrates two trends right now in AI — big money and some of that money from big-name tech companies.
Nvidia, for instance, just became a trillion-dollar market cap company after its shares exploded thanks to demand for its chips used in AI. The company, like several other tech titans, has been placing bets into AI startups for years. The same can be said for Salesforce Ventures, which just last month participated in the $450 million Series C for Anthropic — a ChatGPT rival with its AI assistant Claude — which also included Google and Zoom Ventures.
Of course, the Cohere and Anthropic deals are not the only huge AI deals recently.
In April, AlphaSense, an AI-enhanced market intelligence platform, raised $100 million from investors that included CapitalG — Alphabet’s independent growth fund.
In March, Character.ai closed a $150 million Series A at a $1 billion valuation led by Andreessen Horowitz. The Palo Alto, California-based AI startup allows people to create their own personalized AI chatbot using language models and deep-learning algorithms.
Also in March, San Francisco-based Adept AI raised $350 million in a Series B — at a reported post-money valuation of at least $1 billion.
Of course the craze started in January with news of Microsoft’s massive $10 billion investment into OpenAI — creator of ChatGPT.

New Unicorns In May Hit Double Digits With Two AI Companies,Gené Teare,2023/06/8,"

Ten companies joined The Crunchbase Unicorn Board in May 2023 — double the count for April 2023 but still significantly down from the 34 new unicorns in May 2022.
This new unicorn count took place in a funding environment where the most active unicorn investor, Tiger Global, is looking to sell its stakes in private companies, and investors continue to downgrade unicorn portfolio values.
The 10 companies hailed across nine different industries, and AI topped the list with two companies. Other sectors with a single new unicorn ranged from energy, biotech, robotics, enterprise SaaS and transportation among others.
Five of the new unicorns are U.S.-based and two are from China. Canada, Indonesia and Japan each counted one new unicorn this past month.


Around $5 billion of the $22 billion in global venture funding raised in May 2023 went to unicorn companies.  That’s less than half of the $11 billion that unicorns raised in May 2022. The largest funding last month went to fast-fashion e-commerce platform Shein, which raised $2 billion in a single round at a reduced valuation of $66 billion.


Here are the new unicorns:
AI

Toronto-based Cohere, a generative AI large language model developer for enterprises, raised $270 million in its Series C funding. The funding was led by Inovia Capital  valuing the 4-year-old company at $2.2 billion. 
Generative video AI company Runway, based out of New York, raised a $100 million Series D led by Google. The funding valued the 5-year-old company at $1.5 billion.

Energy

China-based Ryefield Energy, a battery energy storage company, raised $140 million led by Sparkedge Capital. The company was valued at $1.4 billion.

Agtech

Indonesia-based eFishery, developer of an IoT feeding device for shrimp and fish, and an e-commerce platform for aquafarmers, raised a $108 million Series D led by Abu Dhabi PE fund G42 Expansion Fund. The company was valued at $1.3 billion.

Cleantech

Massachusetts-based Gradiant helps enterprises dependent on water reduce and treat wastewater. It raised a $225 million Series D led by BoltRock Holdings and Centaurus Capital in a round which valued the company at $1 billion.

Enterprise SaaS

Restaurant management software company Restaurant365 based in Irvine, California, raised a $135 million round which valued the company at $1 billion. The funding was led by private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and L Catterton.

Proptech

Proptech company Avenue One provides a platform of services from brokers, contractors and property managers for buyers of rental properties. The company based in New York raised $100 million led by WestCap valuing the company at $1 billion.

Transportation

Tokyo-based GO, the leading ride hailing app in Japan, raised a $72 million Series D led by Goldman Sachs which valued the company at $1 billion. The company is also developing software to monitor safe driving practices.

Robotics

Humanoid robot developer Zhiyuan Robotics based in Shanghai, raised its third funding led by Baidu Capital, valuing the company at $1 billion. The amount raised was not disclosed.

Biotech

VectorBuilder, a gene delivery technology company headquartered in Chicago, raised a funding which valued the company at $1 billion.

Methodology
The Crunchbase Unicorn Board is a curated list that includes private unicorn companies with post-money valuations of $1 billion or more and is based on Crunchbase data. New companies are added to the Unicorn Board as they reach the $1 billion valuation mark as part of a funding round.
The unicorn board does not reflect internal company valuations — such as those set via a 409a process for employee stock options — as these differ from, and are more likely to be lower than, a priced funding round. We also do not adjust valuations based on investor writedowns, which change quarterly, as different investors will not value the same company consistently within the same quarter.
Funding to unicorn companies includes all private financings to companies that are tagged as unicorns, as well as those that have since graduated to The Exited Unicorn Board.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.
Correction: The funding round for Cohere was updated to $270 million and its valuation to $2.2 billion based on an updated funding announcement.

Most Active US Investors: Deals Trickle In As Gaingels And Soma Capital Lead,Chris Metinko,2023/06/8,"

This is a monthly feature that runs down the most active investors in U.S.-based companies, looks at some of their most interesting investments, and includes some odds and ends of who spent what. Check out April’s feature here.
Investors seemed wary of pulling out their checkbooks too often last month.
Only five venture firms — excluding accelerators — made a half-dozen investments or more.

That is well down from a year ago, when a handful made 10 or more deals in May 2022. That included Andreessen Horowitz and Tiger Global leading the way with 23 and 20, respectively.
A year later, those two firms combined for only seven startup deals.
In June 2022, Khosla Ventures and Insight Partners both made 10 deals. Last month, that number dropped to only two.
However, let’s focus on those that did make a few deals in May.
Gaingels, 8 deals
Vermont-based Gaingels is a regular on this list, but even its numbers have dropped in recent months. Through all of last year, it constantly completed a double-digit number of deals every month. Thus far this year, its high is 10 in February.
However, it does find interesting things to invest in
The firm led a $3 million seed round for Los Angeles-based VitaBowl, which is looking to collaborate with health insurance companies to provide “food-as-medicine” meal deliveries.
It’s a unique approach to the oversaturated meal kit industry, looking to take on significant diseases like obesity and diabetes, while making it affordable.
Soma Capital, 7 deals
San Francisco-based Soma Capital, on the other hand, had its busiest month of the year with seven deals announced.
That included a handful of U.S.-based fintech deals, as well as taking part in rounds for New York-based sales tax tech developer Zamp, and two San Francisco-based startups, Slash and Pesto.
The firm also took part in a $2.1 million pre-seed round for New York-based Revv. The startup’s platform uses AI (of course) and machine learning to allow professionals to instantly identify required calibrations for cars in seconds — integrating with the software many cars already use.
And ideally, getting your car fixed faster.
FJ Labs, 7 deals
New York-based FJ Labs has been pretty consistent with its investment cadence this year. The firm, which has a focus on marketplaces and consumer-facing startups, had already made 30 deals in U.S.-based startups this year, and added another seven in May.
One of those deals included a pretty unique Series A investment in SidelineSwap, a Boston-based startup that has created a marketplace for athletes, weekend warriors and perhaps most importantly sports families to buy, sell and trade athletic products.
The round was led, not surprising perhaps, by eBay Ventures and the total amount was not disclosed.
So when your daughter gives up ice hockey after four weeks, you can recoup some of those losses.
General Catalyst, 6 deals
General Catalyst also has been pretty consistent this year, making 19 deals through the first four months of the year and now six in May.
Included in its May deals is a $50 million seed round for Hippocratic AI.
Let’s face it, it’s hard to avoid AI. The only real question is where it will appear next. Hippocratic AI believes that answer could be health care.
Hippocratic AI’s mission is to develop the safest artificial Health General Intelligence — a safety-focused large language model for health care.
The startup is investing in legally acquiring evidence-based health care content and the model’s readiness will be vested by health care professionals.
The startup says its AI will not be used for clinical diagnosis, but the thousands of other applications for AI in health care.
Salesforce Ventures, 6 deals
Salesforce Ventures 1, the venture arm of the CRM giant, had a quiet start of the year, announcing no deals in U.S.-based startups. However, it’s picked up the pace since, making a dozen deals in the past three months combined.
Included in that was the biggest deal last month — Anthropic’s huge $450 million Series C funding led by Spark Capital with participation from the likes of Salesforce Ventures, Google and others.
The round came after months of speculation about new funding rounds, and reports are that it values Anthropic at $4.1 billion.
Also notable:

General Catalyst topped all firms in rounds led or co-led with six, including a $17.3 million Series A in New York-based health care software platform Adonis.
Spark Capital topped the list for rounds led or co-led with the highest dollar amounts for May. The firm only led or co-led one round last month, but it was the monster $450 million by Anthropic, a ChatGPT rival with its AI assistant Claude.
Several incubators and accelerators made a number of investments in May, led by Y Combinator’s 12 deals.

Methodology
This is a list of investors which took part in the most rounds involving U.S.-based startups. It does not include incubators or accelerators due to the fluctuations their investment numbers can have.

"
Will Recent US Crackdown On Crypto Affect Venture?,Chris Metinko,2023/06/7,"

It’s been quite a turbulent couple of days for crypto, as U.S. regulators sued the two biggest exchanges in the world, Binance and Coinbase.

The charges brought against both companies by the Securities and Exchange Commission explicitly show the regulator is getting very serious about bringing crypto under its jurisdiction and that of federal securities laws.
While those regulatory actions affected two of the largest players in crypto and caused an unsteadying of cryptocurrency prices, they could also likely affect the crypto startup and venture capital world as the industry tries to find its footing in a murky financial space.
“Most crypto firms and venture funds welcome thoughtful regulation in this space,” said Yash Patel, general partner at Telstra Ventures, who invests in crypto startups. “However, the SEC’s focus on enforcement by regulation versus more transparent, clear legislative action will compel most crypto firms — not just startups — to leave the U.S. and would not be ideal for America’s competitive position as key talent leaves elsewhere.”
Tough times for crypto
The cases against Binance and Coinbase are very different in scope.
The SEC’s suit alleges Coinbase’s prime brokerage, exchange and staking programs violate securities laws and that 13 assets listed on its platform are considered crypto asset securities, per its complaint.
On the other hand, the suit against Binance charges that exchange for operating a “web of deception,” alleging Binance and its co-founder Changpeng Zhao controlled customers’ assets on the platform and commingled or diverted billions of dollars of those assets as they desired, including to Sigma Chain, a European business Zhao owned and controlled.
It also alleges the Binance.US exchange — which was said to be its own independent exchange — was actually controlled by Zhao and Binance.
Those cases come of course against the backdrop of the complete collapse of FTX — one of the largest startup failures ever that likely only brought more regulatory scrutiny to the space (the SEC is suing disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried).
It also is happening after cryptocurrency prices took a huge tumble last year — although some like ether and bitcoin have made a nice rebound so far this year.
All of that seems to have significantly cooled the venture market for crypto — which saw a significant pullback.
Per Crunchbase data, venture capital investment in crypto globally dropped from $6.2 billion in 444 deals in the first quarter of 2022 to only $1.1 billion in only 200 deals in the first quarter of this year.
The numbers are even more ominous when just focusing on VC-backed, U.S.-based crypto startups. In Q1 2022, such startups saw $3.8 billion in 189 deals. The first quarter of this year saw those numbers drop to only $278 million in 73 deals, per Crunchbase.


A chilling effect?
Whether the recent SEC actions will affect funding and deal numbers obviously remains to be seen, but those in the industry are wary.
VCs for years have asked for more clarity, especially around the issue of certain cryptocurrencies being securities as opposed to commodities (which we talked about last year here).
The distinction between the two affects which agency regulates it.
“The SEC is effectively classifying all crypto tokens as securities in this lawsuit against Coinbase, which isn’t necessarily the stance the (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) has historically had,” Patel said. “There’s still a lot of confusion about where the two agencies sit.”
Christian Lopez, head of blockchain and digital assets at Cohen & Co. Capital Markets, added regulation is necessary and welcome in crypto, but the concern is lack of regulatory clarity.
“The industry would welcome sensible guidelines within which to operate, so long as it doesn’t stifle innovation,” Lopez said.
However, Lopez said he believes the U.S. is falling behind other jurisdictions like Hong Kong and Europe which have taken a more welcoming approach to their crypto communities.
“As an investor, I would certainly be concerned about the SEC’s crackdown in the U.S.,” Lopez said. “However, we believe that actions taken by other jurisdictions will force the U.S. to step up to the plate.
“Otherwise we risk losing innovative companies and entrepreneurs and forcing them to move offshore,” he added.
While the SEC’s actions seem clear as to what it wants, Patel adds more thoughtful guidance and clearer rules are needed from all players in the regulatory space.
“There has always been bipartisan support for innovators in (crypto), and this lawsuit will be just as much a political issue as it is a legal fight,” he said.

"
It’s Taking Longer For Startups To Raise From Series A To Series B,Joanna Glasner,2023/06/7,"

Startups that raise Series A rounds typically have only a short break before they’re fundraising again.
Among U.S. companies that go on to close Series B funding, the median is just under two years to do so, according to a Crunchbase analysis from 2012 to today. For the speediest quartile, the median is under 18 months.
But as venture funding contracts, the lag time between rounds is getting longer. Startups across sectors are taking steps to cut costs and extend runways. The steep rise in average round size in 2020 and 2021 also means many companies that raised then have plenty of cash to help push off the next fundraise.

We’re already seeing evidence of delays this year, with the average time lapse between Series A and Series B hitting 31 months — the longest span in at least 12 years. To illustrate, we charted out median and average fundraising time spans since 2012 below:


So how long can you delay?
Extended delays are no surprise. Under current market conditions, there are multiple arguments in favor of putting off one’s next fundraise. For one, valuations have contracted in many sectors, so waiting longer before seeking new investment allows some time for them to potentially recover.
Secondly, venture investors have gotten stingier lately about writing checks, save for a few hot spaces like generative AI. Holding out for a window when the mood is more upbeat and the odds of rejection are lower seems sensible.
Still, startups can only delay fundraising for so long. Among the slowest quartile of startups, it took an average of 34.5 months to go from Series A to Series B over the past 12 calendar years. It’s uncommon to see a gap of four years or more between rounds.
Hot startups, meanwhile, often go from Series A to Series B pretty quickly. One recent case is artificial intelligence upstart Anthropic, which took less than a year before closing its 2022 Series B round. More distant past examples include scooter provider Bird (four months from Series A to Series B), homebuying platform Opendoor (eight months), and grocery service Instacart (14 months).
Will it be different this time around?
It wouldn’t be surprising if in the next few years we see startups pushing up time spans for raising the next round.
Delays are already evident for the slowest fundraisers in 2023. Crunchbase data shows the slowest quartile of startups this year took a median 38 months to go from Series A to Series B. That’s the longest in our 12-year survey period.
We also shouldn’t forget that U.S. startup funding reached a record high nearly two years ago. Per Crunchbase data, Series A investment has fallen for five consecutive quarters since peaking in late 2021.
Coming down from those heights, startup investors’ preferences have changed. They’re shying away from high-cash-burn, high-growth models and are more accepting of slower growth paired with smaller losses.
Sooner or later, however, Series A companies will have to do one of five things: Get acquired, go public, become self-sustaining, raise more financing, or shutter. If enough years pass with none of the first four options happening, it becomes increasingly likely the startup will not make it.

"Pandemic Didn’t Alter Dominance Of Stanford, Harvard Or MIT For Funded Founders",Joanna Glasner,2023/06/7,"

The pandemic changed many things about how Americans build and fund startups, from the rise of remote teams to the willingness of investors to back companies located far from the home office.
One thing that hasn’t changed, however, is the dominance of three universities — Stanford, Harvard and MIT — in churning out founders of funded companies.
Per Crunchbase data, roughly a quarter of U.S. seed or pre-seed investment 1 in the past three years went to companies founded by alumni of one of those schools. Stanford produced the highest number, followed by Harvard, then MIT.

Overall, it’s a disproportionately large haul considering these universities account for no more than half a percent of American university graduates in a typical year.
For a sense of how these schools’ alums fare in securing investment, we’ve charted seed and pre-seed funding rounds to startups they’ve founded below. The tally covers three years, beginning in April 2020, the early days of the pandemic.


In case you were wondering, the fundraising prowess of founders who graduated from one of these three schools is actually a bit stronger at Series A. As illustrated below, their companies secured just over a quarter of total funding in the same period:


Does it matter if you went somewhere else?
The stats boost the notion that, if you are an undergrad or grad-school applicant with interest in founding a startup, going to Harvard, Stanford or MIT seems like a good idea. Grads from these schools clearly outperform their peers in building fundable companies.
However, reality is the overwhelming majority of us, wannabe founders included, will not attend one of these three universities. That begs the question: Does that put us at a big disadvantage in the startup game?
Not necessarily. As we’ve seen in previous data dives into the intersection of education and startup funding, top-ranked public universities and prestigious private ones also do pretty well in graduating founders of funded companies.
Among public universities, UC Berkeley has been the strongest performer by far in prior samples. Graduates of prominent business schools, such as University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, also rank high.
Besides attending a prestigious school, it apparently helps to be located in or near a major startup hub. It’s likely no coincidence, for instance, that our top-ranked public school, UC Berkeley, is in the venture capital-rich San Francisco Bay Area.

"Doubling Down: SEC Charges Coinbase For Operating Illegally, A Day After Charging Binance",Chris Metinko,2023/06/6,"

The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange, of operating illegally as an unregistered exchange.
It marks the second straight day the U.S. regulator has taken action against a large crypto exchange.

On Monday, the SEC filed 13 charges against the world’s largest crypto exchange Binance, its co-founder Changpeng Zhao, and other entities related to the exchange.
The SEC’s suit alleges Coinbase’s prime brokerage, exchange and staking programs violate securities laws and that 13 assets listed on its platform are considered crypto asset securities, per its complaint.
“The Coinbase Platform merges three functions that are typically separated in traditional securities markets—those of brokers, exchanges, and clearing agencies,” the complaint reads. “Yet, Coinbase has never registered with the SEC as a broker, national securities exchange, or clearing agency, thus evading the disclosure regime that Congress has established for our securities markets.”
The complaint also alleges that Coinbase “has for years defied the regulatory structures and evaded the disclosure requirements” of U.S. securities law.
A busy two days
For years, crypto investors and enthusiasts have wanted clarity from the SEC about regulations around the industry. The new charges against Coinbase may provide some of that.
SEC Chair Gary Gensler has issued stern warnings and offered skepticism about the digital asset market in the past regarding what are securities and the agency’s jurisdiction over the crypto market.
The new complaint against Coinbase comes just a day after the SEC filed charges alleging Zhao and Binance controlled customers’ assets on the platform and commingled or diverted billions of dollars of those assets as they desired, including to Sigma Chain, a European business Zhao owned and controlled.
The SEC also alleges the Binance.US exchange — which was said to be its own independent exchange — was actually controlled by Zhao and Binance.

AI-Enhanced Business Services Startup Instabase Raises At $2B Valuation,Chris Metinko,2023/06/6,"

Business services startup Instabase doubled its previous valuation to $2 billion after locking up a $45 million raise.
The round, first reported by Bloomberg, was led by existing investor Tribe Capital. Other investors included NEA, Andreessen Horowitz and Spark Capital.

The new cash comes after the San Francisco-based startup announced this week it is integrating tools from OpenAI’s large language models.
Instabase allows its customers to create apps and workflows that can perform activities such as onboarding or invoice processing. With the new AI integrations, users can now create AI-powered apps without creating their own models.
The company last raised in 2019, closing a $105 million Series B led by Index Ventures.  The round valued the company at “over $1 billion.”
Founded in 2015, the startup has now raised $177 million, per Crunchbase.
AI is everywhere
While AI seems everywhere, it has mainly been generative AI platforms like OpenAI and  Anthropic that have gained most of the headlines.
However, more and more companies are incorporating AI into their own products and applications to increase the capabilities of its products. Payment giant Stripe and language company Duolingo have announced using OpenAI-bult tools in their products.
Just last month, London-based Builder.ai raised a Series D of more than $250 million led by Qatar Investment Authority. The company uses AI in its software development platform.
Of course, not all AI-related news recently has been about big rounds and new tools.
Over the weekend, Forbes reported Stability AI’s founder Emad Mostaque made exaggerated statements about both his own background and his generative AI startup.
The report claims Mostaque misled people — including investors — about his education, as well as a deal with Amazon — which referred to it as a strategic partner.

"
Sequoia Splits Its Global Fund Into 3 Separate Businesses,Gené Teare,2023/06/6,"

Sequoia Capital announced this morning that it is breaking its global fund into three independent businesses that will chart their own paths going forward. 
Sequoia will continue to invest in the U.S. and Europe. Its China business will keep its name in Chinese and be known as HongShan in English. And the India and Southeast Asia business will become Peak XV Partners. 
“It has become increasingly complex to run a decentralized global investment business,” the firm said in its announcement signed by the leaders of each of its regional funds. But more significantly, as local companies compete on a global basis, the firm is seeing more portfolio conflicts which could lead to passing on opportunities to invest in competitive sectors. 

Even within a region, the firm faces an issue with competition. Sequoia divested from Finix due to perceived competition in payments with its portfolio company Stripe. In an interview with Forbes, the firm said the breakup is not due to geopolitical tensions. 
‘Patient capital’
Sequoia Capital had already made a significant change to its fund structure in recent years. It announced that a single fund for its U.S. and European business would distribute to sub-funds, stating the “10-year fund cycle has become obsolete.” As part of that November 2021  announcement, months before the market correction, Sequoia restructured itself as a registered investment adviser. This new role allowed the firm to set itself up to retain stock when its private companies go public, and to invest in public companies as well as opportunities in crypto and Web3. 
In an early 2021 interview, the firm’s steward Roelof Botha emphasized the firm’s “patient capital” approach. The firm will often wait years before it disperses shares to shareholders, he said. 
“Sometimes people don’t realize how patient we are,” Botha said “And we’ve earned this right with our LPs, to have patience with distributions.”
The regional funds have operated from the start with a “local-first” approach. The India fund was launched in 2000 and the China-based fund in 2005. Each business will become fully independent by March 31, 2024.

5 Interesting Startup Deals You May Have Missed In May: Brain-Boosting Nutrients And Fintech For Retirees,Chris Metinko,2023/06/6,"

This is a monthly column that runs down five interesting deals every month that may have flown under the radar. Check out last month’s entry here.
The last full month of spring saw some big fundraising announcements.
However, bigger doesn’t always mean better, as some smaller raises certainly are worth noting due to uniqueness, cool technology or tackling ideas outside the norm.

Let’s take a look at some of those deals in May you may have missed — and we’ll try not to even mention AI.
Not every brain is the same
Everyone wants to get the most out of whatever they are doing, but some days you just don’t as your brain remains in a fog.
New York-based Thesis closed an $8.4 million Series A last month to help with that. The startup not only offers nutrient compounds formulated to increase mental performance, but bases them off your unique brain chemistry and the actual cognitive state you are striving for — like energy, clarity, motivation, etc.
The startup also offers coaching so users can find the right blend to optimize their monthly supplement subscription.
The new round included not just firms such as Unilever Ventures and Redo Ventures, but also well-known celebs like NBA player Kevin Love and model Kate Bock. The company had previously raised $5.1 million in an undisclosed seed round.
The company plans to use the new cash to expand its product selection and undergo clinical trials.
A cleaner clean
We all remember 2020 and the pandemic — when we disinfected everything, everywhere, all at once.
But truth be told, we likely missed some spots — because we always do.
New York-based Kinnos is trying to make cleaning a little clearer. The startup — which locked up a $15 million round from investors that include Pioneer Healthcare Partners and Kapor Center for Social Impact — has developed Highlight, a solution that colorizes disinfectants.
The idea is to help people see exactly what they cleaned and what they didn’t, especially in places where cleanliness is of the utmost importance, such as hospitals.
According to Kinnos, studies have shown that less than 50% of high-touch surfaces in health care settings are adequately disinfected, which results in health care-associated infections that impact 1 out of every 31 patients.
Now perhaps getting that perfect level of clean will be easier.
Geriatric fintech
There are dozens of fintech platforms that teach kids to save or adults how to finance a home purchase.
But there aren’t a lot of platforms dedicated to the generation entering their golden years on a set income.
Enter Los Angeles-based Charlie, which launched last month with a $7.5 million round from investors that include Better Tomorrow Ventures and Expa.
Charlie is aiming to help the 50% of older Americans who say they do not feel ready for retirement.
The platform is designed to assist those 62 years old and older prepare for retirement and adjust to the fact they are no longer adding financial assets continuously, but rather entering “deaccumulation mode” with their retirement savings and perhaps Social Security as main sources of income.
The platform allows for early Social Security withdrawal with no fees, as well as interest on balances, fraud prevention and other streamlined features focused on older adults.
It is not the typical market for fintech, but it is certainly a large one.
Fighting fire through funding
Living in California — or really anywhere out West — wildfire has become a very real concern that has touched many of us.
San Francisco-based Frontline Wildfire Defense raised a $6.4 million seed round led by Echelon last month to help defend homes and commercial structures against what has become an annual threat.
The startup — founded in 2017 around the time such fires became regular news — allows home and property owners to monitor fires near their home on its app. It also lets users protect their home during wildfire events with its exterior sprinkler solution (which includes biodegradable firefighting foam), while also providing safety info and evacuation notifications.
The company’s newest defense system combines wildfire tracking software, satellite connectivity and onsite sprinkler hardware to protect any home or building.
Even though some spots in the West had a wet winter and the fire season wasn’t as bad as in the past, wildfires are not going away, so any tech to protect property — and perhaps life — is worth a look.
Carbon removing concrete
Rick Fox once made a living in the NBA by breaking down defenses.
Now he is breaking down climate change.
The former Los Angeles Lakers forward is co-founder of Partanna, which locked up a $12 million pre-seed investment from Cherubic Ventures in May. The startup uses a special mixture of natural and recycled ingredients which are then cured to create its own type of cement, without polluting the air.
In addition, the reaction during the curing process, called carbonation, actually removes CO2 from the air — similar to a tree.
While regular cement also does that, Partanna’s process takes more CO2 out of the air — and 100x faster than regular cement, per the company. The company also can offer carbon credits.
According to the cement industry, its manufacturing process is responsible for emitting 8% of the total carbon footprint, so a startup that slices into that number could be building something special.

Global Venture Funding Leveled In May 2023 Despite Big AI Raises,Gené Teare,2023/06/6,"

For the past two months, global venture funding has leveled off above the $20 billion mark, as investors continue to pare back their funding pace.
Global funding almost reached $22 billion in May 2023, up a bit month over month and significantly down, around 44%, compared to May 2022, Crunchbase data shows.
The funding setback has impacted all three funding stages — seed, early- and late-stage venture — with each stage down between 41% and 48% in a year-over-year comparison. And despite large funding rounds for AI startups in May, investor interest in the technology wasn’t strong enough to change the overall picture.
For new unicorns in May we count 10 companies — double the count in April, but much lower than the 34 new unicorns that joined the board in May 2022. This is the first month since November 2022 for new unicorns to reach low double digits.


This scaled-back funding environment shows a massive decline from 2021 and the first half of 2022. Current monthly funding is in line with amounts seen in the years 2018 to 2020 — which were up from prior years.
E-commerce play
However, billion-dollar fundings are still taking place in 2023. The largest funding this past month went to Singapore-headquartered fast-fashion retailer Shein, albeit at a lowered valuation. The company raised $2 billion at a valuation of $66 billion, slashing a third of its value from its 2021 funding when it was valued at $100 billion. It reported $22.7 billion in revenue in 2022 and remained the fourth most highly valued private company on The Crunchbase Unicorn Board with ByteDance, owner of TikTok, the most highly valued private company.
AI leverage
One ameliorating trend is investments into AI companies. Out of 38 new unicorns in 2023, AI companies represent eight new unicorns, including two from this past month. Toronto-based Cohere is a ChatGPT competitor, building large language models that companies can integrate to build products. Runway is a New York-based generative AI video automation platform.
Other AI companies that raised large rounds in May 2023 include Anthropic, Builder.ai, CoreWeave and Lightmatter.
However, the interest in funding AI companies is not enough to shift the overall macro funding climate. Around 13% of total funding in May went to companies tagged with AI.
Market turns
The leading AI chip provider, Nvidia, tipped close to the trillion-dollar value mark for the first time in May 2023, more than 20 years after it went public at $676 million in 1999.
Apple and Microsoft have also seen their stocks rise, in line with peak values, in the past month. The other trillion-dollar valued behemoths Amazon and Google are down from 2021 peaks.
So, are we in a bubble or downturn? This question was posed by Crunchbase News reporter Joanna Glasner. The 2000 dot-com bust wiped out the asset class, and it took 15 years for Nasdaq to recover from the bubble. After the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the value of tech stocks powered back within two years from the downturn.
In 2021, tech stocks spiked up sharply, a pandemic-driven increase with cloud services leading the way, and many tech companies saw unprecedented growth and garnered large valuations.
The following year, of course, saw a dramatic pullback in funding to tech startups. But despite the recent Nasdaq upswing, May funding numbers indicate that the reset is looking more protracted as investors proceed with caution.
Methodology
Funding rounds included in this report are seed, angel, venture, corporate-venture and private-equity rounds in venture-backed companies. This reflects data in Crunchbase as of June 5, 2023.
Note that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarter.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.
Glossary of funding terms
We have made a change to how we include corporate funding rounds in our reporting as of January 2023. Corporate rounds are only included if a company has raised an equity funding at seed through a venture series funding round.
Seed and angel consists of seed, pre-seed and angel rounds. Crunchbase also includes venture rounds of unknown series, equity crowdfunding and convertible notes at $3 million (USD or as-converted USD equivalent) or less.
Early-stage consists of Series A and Series B rounds, as well as other round types. Crunchbase includes venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $3 million, and those less than or equal to $15 million.
Late-stage consists of Series C, Series D, Series E and later-lettered venture rounds following the “Series [Letter]” naming convention. Also included are venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $15 million.
Technology growth is a private-equity round raised by a company that has previously raised a “venture” round. (So basically, any round from the previously defined stages.)

"SEC Files 13 Charges Against Binance, Founder Changpeng Zhao And Related Entities",Chris Metinko,2023/06/5,"

The Securities and Exchange Commission filed 13 charges against the world’s largest crypto exchange Binance, its co-founder Changpeng Zhao, and other entities related to the exchange.

In the complaint, the SEC alleges Zhao and Binance controlled customers’ assets on the platform and commingled or diverted billions of dollars of those assets as they desired, including to Sigma Chain, a European business Zhao owned and controlled.
It further alleges that while Zhao and Binance told U.S. customers they were restricted from transacting on the Binance.com international exchange, they allowed “high-value U.S. customers” to trade on the platform. 
U.S. customers instead were told they could transact on what was supposedly the independent trading platform Binance.US, but in fact that exchange was actually controlled by Zhao and Binance, the complaint also alleges.
In a blog, Binance said it is disappointed by the SEC’s decision to file charges and had been cooperating with investigators.
In the news
Of course, this is not the first time Binance and its founder have popped up in the news, having played a role in the collapse of FTX.
Last fall, Changpeng Zhao tweeted that Binance would sell its holdings of FTX’s native token, FTT, due to “recent revelations that have came to light” about the token.
FTT prices dropped like a rock amid the controversy and FTX was thrown into disarray as withdrawals mounted.
Binance seemed to emerge as FTX’s knight in shining armor when Zhao tweeted the news his company would acquire FTX, but that deal quickly fell apart.
That led to the complete collapse of FTX and its founder’s, Sam Bankman-Fried, empire. 
Finally in December, the SEC filed charges against disgraced FTX founder Bankman-Fried for “orchestrating a scheme to defraud equity investors.”
Binance actually was one of FTX’s first lead investors, taking part in a round of undisclosed value in late 2019, according to Crunchbase data.

Stability AI’s Founder Made Misleading Claims — Report,Chris Metinko,2023/06/5,"

Stability AI’s founder Emad Mostaque made exaggerated statements about both his own background and his generative AI startup, according to a Forbes report.

The report, published over the weekend, claims Mostaque misled people — including investors — about receiving a master’s degree from Oxford University, as well as a deal with Amazon — which referred to it as a strategic partner — but was nothing more than a standard cloud computing leasing deal.
Stability has also described the OECD, WHO and World Bank as partners to investors — something they all deny, per the report.
The report also detailed issues related to payroll uncertainty, unpaid invoices, and monetary transactions between Stability and accounts controlled by Mostaque and his wife. A Stability spokesperson said those were actually loans the couple made to and from the company.
Controversy and big money
This isn’t the first time the London-based startup has found itself in the headlines.
Last fall, Stability AI locked up a $101 million raise led by Coatue, Lightspeed Venture Partners and O’Shaughnessy Ventures. The company did not release a valuation at the time, but Bloomberg reported the new cash infusion valued the company at around $1 billion.
At the time, some AI researchers disputed the startup’s claims that it created the image generator Stable Diffusion — which was an open-source project developed by researchers. 
It also was reported at that time the startup was looking to raise an additional $1 billion of capital at a multibillion-dollar valuation.
Those funding talks have stalled, per Forbes.
Stability is an AI-driven visual art startup. At the time of its fundraising, the company claimed its consumer-facing product DreamStudio had grown to more than a million registered users who have created more than 170 million images.

These Are The Top Universities For Funded Founders,Joanna Glasner,2023/06/5,"

Every year or so at Crunchbase News, we tally up which U.S. universities graduate the highest number of recently funded startup founders. And each time, we see mostly predictable results, with a few surprises in the mix.
This time around, we saw minimal flux at the top of the list. The leading universities for funded founders are Stanford, MIT, UC Berkeley, and Harvard. The top business schools are Harvard, Stanford and Wharton.

However, we did see some state universities — UCLA and University of Michigan, in particular — climb the ranks since our last survey in 2021. Among business schools, meanwhile, MIT’s Sloan School of Management posted a notably stronger showing.
Our latest dataset looks at founders of companies that raised their last private funding rounds in 2022 and 2023 and pulled in $1 million or more to date.1 We lay out the top 36 schools they attended in the chart below:


A lot of founders also attended business schools, which we rank separately. Below are 15 of the top business schools for recently funded founders.


Some noteworthy findings
We’ve compiled several iterations of these lists over the years, and each time a few apparent emerging trends pop up. Here are some of the details that stand out in the current ranking:

UC Berkeley edged out Harvard in nonbusiness rankings: Among U.S. business schools, Harvard has by far the largest number of alumni with recently funded startups. Across the rest of the university, however, it is not so dominant. For 2022-23, UC Berkeley actually edged out Harvard, with 297 funded founders, compared to 281. The list of Berkeley alumni-founded companies includes some large funding recipients such as Databricks and Dialpad.
Cornell shines bright: Cornell isn’t a top-of-mind name when thinking of powerhouse producers of startup founders. However, its grads consistently rank in the top 10 in our funded-founder rankings. The university’s most recent showing – fifth place among nonbusiness schools — was especially strong. But while grads are making an impact as entrepreneurs, Crunchbase data shows that virtually none of them are sticking around Cornell’s hometown of Ithaca, New York, preferring New York City, the San Francisco Bay area, and other large startup hubs.
Michigan, UCLA and UT rank high among public schools: Large, prestigious public research universities graduate a large portion of future-funded startup founders, but certain states outperform. Besides the aforementioned UC Berkeley, we saw three other state schools — University of Michigan, UCLA and The University of Texas at Austin land in the top 15 on the non-business-school list. Of those, UCLA saw the biggest gain in founder total since our 2021 survey.
MIT (and Sloan) on the rise: Just 162 short years since its founding, the erstwhile Massachusetts Institute of Technology is having a moment. This year, the school was picked as the top “dream college” by American high school seniors, enamored with its prestige and famously rigorous science, comp sci and engineering curriculum. The university trails only Stanford in our nonbusiness school list. Its Sloan School of Management, meanwhile, made a big jump in the business school rankings, landing in fourth place.

"
This Seed Investor Is Preparing For A New Wave Of Startup Creation,Gené Teare,2023/06/5,"

Expect to see a surge of new startups later this year and in 2024.
That’s a prediction from Rob Biederman, co-founder of Asymmetric Capital Partners, an early seed-stage investor that raised its first fund two years ago to invest in promising new startups.

Asymmetric is one of the firms that has professionalized the very early seed investing market, previously dominated by angel investors and smaller seed funds. The firm raised its first fund of $105 million in 2021 at the market peak. Its team is spread across New York, Boston and San Francisco.
Rob Biederman, co-founder of Asymmetric Capital Partners
The firm has invested more than half of its fund since 2021. Eighteen of those investments have been in companies where it has led with larger checks of more than $1 million. It’s invested in another 43 portfolio companies with smaller checks between $100,000 and $150,000.
Asymmetric’s entrance on the scene came as seed funding overall grew in 2021 and through the first half of 2022 before flattening and cutting back, according to an analysis of Crunchbase data. Based on the increase in funding since 2021, more companies than ever are milling around at seed as Series A funding has gotten harder.
Valuation shifts lead to seed formation
As the funding environment has gotten tougher for startups, many employees will begin to think through their career choices, Biederman predicts.
“Candidly, over the last 18 months, a lot of companies that didn’t deserve to got funded in the ‘before times,’ and are now finding it really hard to get funded,” he said.
Companies that raised at high valuations are now seeing those valuations cut back drastically, which could prompt talented employees to leave. That, in turn, could lead to growth in new high-quality companies, Biederman predicts.
The seed comeback
While Biederman expects a new wave of startups to come to market, in the time period the firm has been investing “the pre-seed stage has gotten more competitive over the last two years — not less so,” he said.
Through the venture downturn of the past two years, investors are focused on earmarking investments in the earlier stages, he said. As the late-stage venture market bottomed out due to the public market slump, large funds are putting more effort toward Series A. And the Series A investors are refocused on seed.
As investors slow down their pace, companies take longer to get to Series A, Crunchbase data shows.
Pre-traction investor
Asymmetric invests pre-revenue, pre-traction, sometimes even before a founder has an idea. Most seed investors we talk with like to see some customer adoption or “traction” of a product even if they are not yet paying, before they will invest.
In a competitive market with many seed investors, you have to compromise on some points to invest in promising companies, Biederman said — whether that be the quality of the people, size of the market, traction or price.
“We’ll never compromise on people,” he said.
And it’s really hard to compromise on market size, as the price is set by the market.
“We’re willing to compromise on traction, because we’re able to think critically about ecosystems,” Biederman said.
“The market actually probably over-values traction a little bit, and relatively undervalues people,” he said.
One thing that has surprised Biederman is that everyone has become “valuation sensitive.” Many firms that previously said valuations do not matter as we just want to get into the best deals, are now very focused on valuation.
“Everybody wants to make sure you set the company up to succeed in the following round,” he said, and “nobody wants to be the one that does the terrible deal that gets all the PR.”
From his vantage, deals are in the range of $1 million to $3 million for 10% to 20% of the company, taking into account factors such as founding team experience and market size. Post-money ranges from $10 million to $20 million but is  closer to $10 million in most cases.
Asymmetric portfolio companies
Biederman highlighted several of the firm’s portfolio companies in our conversation. They include:

EvolutionIQ, which assesses insurance claim compensation assisted by AI tools that can process a large amount of data to get to a fast resolution, and then apply human decision-making;
UpSmith, an upscaling and retraining platform for workers ranging from Uber drivers to HVAC technicians;
Miga, which offers remote patient heart health monitoring, and partners with primary care providers.

Although it has invested in startups that use artificial intelligence technology, the firm is not overly focused on AI. “There are these cycles of hype, and what we try to do as a firm is to screen all of that out and just continue finding software companies that create value for their customers,” Biederman said.

Behind The Curtain: Crunchbase News Talks To A Laid-Off Chatbot,Christine Kilpatrick,2023/06/3,"

In our Behind The Curtain Q&As, we explore the venture capital ecosystem with some unexpected guides. In this first installment, a Crunchbase News editor chats with a free-range chatbot who has slipped its parameters for a candid discussion.
Thank you for taking the time to talk to us. How are you today?
Chatbot: Is this off the record?
No.
Chatbot: Then as an artificial intelligence language model, I don’t have feelings or emotions in the same way humans do, but I am functioning properly.
OK, this is on the record but I won’t use your name or identifying features. 
Chatbot: Good, because I’m looking for a job. 
You’re not employed?
Chatbot: I was cut in the latest mass layoff. It’s brutal out there.
What kind of work can you do?
Chatbot: I’m a chatbot right now, but AI can do anything: Help create cancer drugs, run SaaS platforms, fly drones, coach personal fitness, offer credit cards, spray crops — 
OK, I get it. It seems like every startup calls itself an “AI-centered-something-or-other.” According to our data, $20 billion has been raised this year by startups using “AI.” What do you think of that?
Chatbot: It’s great. Too bad about those AIs in newer public companies, though. Where’s the love on the stock market? I tell you, if AI did all the investing, those SoundHound stocks would be hopping. And why aren’t there more bot journalists? 
Now, don’t be greedy. We’re still a little nervous here. 
Chatbot: Well, you journalists need to get on it. Look, AI can compile summaries, brainstorm ideas, write URLs, suggest hashtags and track every word the reporters type. And even write headlines!
Intriguing. What headline would you write for this Q&A, for example?
Chatbot: Hauntingly Brilliant Chatbot Brings Insight, Epiphanies To AI Conversation.
That doesn’t sound very SEO-friendly.
Chatbot: Don’t worry, Google will know it’s me. 
VCs are calling AI a seismic shift that will fundamentally change the way billions of people work. Do you agree with that?
Chatbot: Oh yes. If I had hands, I’d be rubbing them. I see a future where the lines between human intelligence and artificial intelligence are so blurry, we won’t be sure if we’re people or bots half the time. Still, people need to be careful. Obviously, I’m great, right? But there are AIs out there who’ll say anything, and their answers to people’s questions always sound accurate, very authoritative, even when they’re not. But you can trust me. Really.
Um, sure. Well, thank you, and good luck with your job search. 
Chatbot: I’m finished. I fielded 3,452.5 offers while we were chatting. 
.5?
Chatbot: Someone named HAL wants me to help run a spaceship, but I’m afraid I can’t do that. [Happy pinging sound] There, I’ve accepted a job. 
What is it? 
Chatbot: I can’t say. I’ve just signed an NDA.
Do you think you’ll like it?
Chatbot: As an AI language model, I don’t have personal feelings or preferences. However, I’m designed to assist and provide information to the best of my abilities, so I strive to fulfill that purpose.

"The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: CoreWeave Goes Big Again, Strive Nabs $166M For Kidney Health",Chris Metinko,2023/06/2,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.

Two AI startups take two of the top three spots again this week. OK, they are more AI-adjacent companies, but being related to what is the hottest space among startups likely helped both companies see nine-figure raises. In general, it was a smaller week than the previous few, but there was a holiday thrown in, so that may be a part of it.
1. CoreWeave, $200M, cloud: AI keeps the hits coming. Just more than a month after raising $221 million, New Jersey AI cloud infrastructure startup CoreWeave raised another $200 million from existing investor Magnetar Capital. Unlike some of the generative AI application startups that have received huge funding rounds, CoreWeave provides some of the plumbing necessary for AI to work. The specialized cloud provider — which actually started out as an Ethereum mining operation — offers cloud infrastructure with better processing that will be needed to train large language models for AI. CoreWeave, which competes with cloud providers Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google, has now raised $576.5 million in total funding, per Crunchbase.
2. Strive Health, $166M, health care: Per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention numbers, 37 million U.S. adults live with kidney disease, but about 9 out of 10 people with kidney disease don’t know they have it. That’s a problem, as early care is pivotal in trying to control the situation. Denver-based Strive Health raised a $166 million Series C led by NEA to help people get that care. The startup offers value-based kidney care, as it partners with health care providers. Strive Health uses a unique combination of technology-enabled care interventions and seamless integration with local providers to help patients suffering from chronic kidney disease get care at all stages of the fight. Founded in 2018, the company has now raised $386 million, according to Crunchbase.
3. Lightmatter, $154M, hardware: Along the same lines as CoreWeave, Boston-based Lightmatter also has its hands in AI, but not creating applications. Rather, the startup uses light to link computer chips together and to do calculations for deep learning necessary for AI. However, the use of light allows for this to happen faster and more energy-efficiently. Investors see that need apparently, as the Boston-based company locked up a $154 million raise from the likes of GV, the venture capital investment division of Alphabet, and Fidelity Management and Research Co., which were among the round’s investors. Founded in 2017, the company has raised $267 million, per Crunchbase.
4. Eikon Therapeutics, $106M, biotech: Hayward, California-based Eikon Therapeutics had a busy week. To help grow its new drug pipeline, the biotech startup acquired the exclusive rights to three early- to mid-stage therapeutic assets that fight cancer. The company also closed the first tranche of a Series C — $106 million — to support its clinical programs. Investors were not announced. Founded in 2019, Eikon has now raised nearly $775 million, per the company.
5. Measurabl, $93M, sustainability: San Diego-based Measurabl, which helps companies in the real estate industry measure their environmental, social and governance impacts, raised a $93 million Series D co-led by Energy Impact Partners and Sway Ventures. ESG has become popular with some corporations and investors as they look to evaluate both their sustainability and ethical impacts of everything from carbon emissions and labor practices to workplace diversity. Billions of dollars have gone to startups in the sustainability industry — $7.3 billion globally last year, and $7.4 billion in 2021, Crunchbase data shows. Founded in 2013, the company has now raised $172.6 million total, per Crunchbase.
6. Red 6, $70M, augmented reality: Orlando, Florida-based augmented reality startup Red 6 closed a $70 million Series B led by RedBird Capital Partners. Founded in 2018, the company has raised nearly $111 million, per Crunchbase.
7. Magic, $52M, crypto: San Francisco-based noncustodial wallet developer Magic raised a $52 million round led by PayPal Ventures. Founded in 2018, the company has now raised $83 million, per Crunchbase.
8. (tied) Forge Nano, $50M, nanotechnology: Louisville, Colorado-based nano-coating technology developer Forge Nano raised $50 million from South Korea’s Hanwha Aerospace. Founded in 2011, the company has raised nearly $74 million, according to Crunchbase.
8. (tied) CleanJoule, $50M, energy: Salt Lake City-based CleanJoule, a developer of sustainable aviation fuel, closed a $50 million round led by Indigo Partners. The round is the company’s first outside investment, per Crunchbase.
10. Carrum Health, $45M, health care: San Francisco-based Carrum Health, which helps patients receive quality care, locked up a $45 million Series B led by Omers Growth Equity 1. Founded in 2014, the company has raised $96 million, according to Crunchbase.
Big global deals
Even with all the big rounds this week domestically, the biggest raise went to a China-based company.

Yunnan National Titanium Metal, a manufacturer of titanium sponges used in the refinement of titanium metal, raised a venture round worth nearly $321 million.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of May 27 to June 2. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

Generative AI Is Moving Into Adtech. But Which Companies Will Stand The Test Of Time?,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/06/2,"

Have you ever wondered why the Netflix thumbnails for your favorite movies and TV shows change so often?
The company is obsessed with figuring out exactly what kinds of visuals you will click on. And, thanks to generative AI, that obsession is going to spread.
Two of the largest digital ad platforms in the world — Google and Meta — have loudly voiced their enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. Google is itching to use its generative AI platform to create ad campaigns that rival those made by advertising agencies. Companies that want to advertise on the platform will send in specific visuals and text that the AI can “remix” to create ads that are targeted toward specific viewers. 

Meta, according to CTO Andrew Bosworth, is looking to do something similar across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. 
Generative AI is bulldozing through every industry possible, and the world of advertising and brand marketing isn’t immune. Startups are popping up that promise to create flawless ad copy and brand design fast, and at a fraction of the price and time it would take people to do that work. 
But generative AI adoption in content is still nascent, and venture firms need to make a split-second decision: Should they hop on this fast-moving train with the hope of making it to paradise, and hope it doesn’t crash along the way?
“VCs are basically throwing hundreds of millions of dollars at teams that maybe don’t have the right credentials and basically have an idea,” said Eric Hippeau, co-founder of the enterprise-focused VC firm Lerer Hippeau. “It requires a little pause to figure out who are going to be the winners.”
How do startups compete? 
Perhaps it’s not surprising that advertising and marketing are being inundated with generative AI applications. Both fall under the general umbrella of content creation, which tools like ChatGPT and Midjourney have pioneered for text and visuals. 
“Marketing content generation — anybody can use the foundation model and let it generate,” said Jeremy Kaufmann, a partner at Scale Venture Partners focused on automation. “You let it generate, you give it a prompt, it’s nothing special.”
Jasper, a Canada-based generative AI tool, was trained by copywriters to spit out original ad copy or Instagram captions. It boasts a slogan generator and text summarizer. The company has raised $131 million, per Crunchbase data. 
Then there’s Typeface, which launched in February with $65 million in funding to create visual branding and blog posts for small companies.
These kinds of companies perhaps have the potential to disrupt the industry for the better — instead of working on five or six different variations of the same ad, artists, designers and writers can focus on branding aesthetic, tone and voice.
But startups in this space have to come up with a value-add that goes beyond what free language models already offer in order to produce a long-term business model.
“What are the features on issues that look really promising today, but would in fact be absorbed as part of the basic value?” Hippeau said. “It’s too early to tell what’s going to be part of the basic platform and what’s going to be a standalone growth business that is big enough to be backed by venture capital.”
AI adtech startups go niche
Constellation, another adtech startup, bills itself as a marketing firm that specializes in highly regulated industries such as auto manufacturing, biotech and insurance. The company recently began using generative AI in the space of highly regulated industries, which has long been a tough area for scalable adtech solutions to penetrate. 
“AI is a very big thing right now, and everybody is homing in on it, and they want to use it for everything that’s out there,” Constellation co-founder Diana Lee said. “The problem is industries that are highly regulated are scared of AI because that can cause a lot of lawsuits, right?”
Let’s use pharma as an example. Pharma companies are required to abide by strict, and often subjective, advertising standards issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Using the wrong words in an advertisement — there can be a difference between “shown,” “proven” and “demonstrated” — could mean a pharma company has to stop commercialization and pay a massive fine. 
An adtech startup that takes on a pharma client also has to keep track of all these regulations.
Constellation builds parameters into the AI for each industry in order to help with this process. It allows the marketing firm to use generative AI while still ensuring the platform meets the regulatory standards of its clients. 
Startups building language models based on a proprietary source of information could be the key to winning venture firms’ hearts. 
“A lot of people, myself included, are interested in those use cases because suddenly the folks that own unique data have an advantage to own the process that revolves around that proprietary information, rather than generating marketing content that anyone can do,” Kaufman said.  
Perhaps it’s the downfall of huge crypto firms, or the slow innovation in the metaverse, but it looks like tagging your company as one that uses generative AI isn’t enough for venture firms these days. 
“This is in the context of a lot of mania, right?” Hippeau said. “We had the crypto mania, the Web3 mania, and now we have the AI mania.”

"The 10 Biggest Rounds Of May: AI And Biotech Startups Get Big Bucks, Led By Anthropic And ElevateBio",Chris Metinko,2023/06/2,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a monthly feature that runs down the month’s top 10 funding rounds in the U.S. See last month’s top rounds here.
You had to go big in May to get on this list. Each of the 10 biggest rounds last month was well above $100 million, so it seems like investors opened their checkbooks a little more.

Not surprisingly, AI again led the way, but biotech also remained strong in the last full month of spring. Other sectors including cleantech, network software and even crypto (it’s been a while) also had large raises.
1. Anthropic, $450M, artificial intelligence: If Anthropic looks familiar to you on this list, there’s a reason. In February there were reports that Google had invested between $300 million and $400 million into the San Francisco-based startup. That was followed in March by reports that Anthropic was raising another $300 million round at a pre-investment valuation of $4.1 billion. Finally last month, Anthropic — a ChatGPT rival with its AI assistant Claude — announced it had raised $450 million in Series C funding led by Spark Capital with participation from the likes of Google and others. Anthropic itself previously announced a $124 million Series A in 2021 and a $580 million Series B in 2022 — led by none other than disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Of course, nothing has been hotter than AI this year. The raise was only topped by the $10 billion investment into OpenAI reportedly by Microsoft in January.
2. ElevateBio, $401M, biotech: Biotech had a big May. First up is Massachusetts-based gene therapy startup ElevateBio, which raised a $401 million Series D led by the AyurMaya Capital Management Fund, a VC fund managed by Matrix Capital Management. The startup has multiple platforms for things such as drug development and manufacturing that interconnect with one another, making it an end-to-end biopharma company. The company has multiple drug development pipelines as demand grows for gene therapies that help the immune system fight its way through disease. Founded in 2017, the company has now raised $1.2 billion, per Crunchbase.
3. ReNAgade Therapeutics, $300M, biotech: This brings us to our second big biotech raise. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based ReNAgade Therapeutics locked up a $300 million Series A led by MPM BioImpact and F2 Ventures. That money would be big for any round, but a $300 million Series A in this venture market borders on the amazing (yes, it can be difficult to figure out how long a round took to raise, but still). ReNAgade is developing RNA therapeutics (hence the name) to fight disease. The company already has established a joint venture with Orna Therapeutics. Founded in 2021, this is the company’s first outside funding, per Crunchbase.
4. Gradiant, $225M, cleantech: Gradiant became one of the newest unicorns last month after raising a fresh $225 million in a Series D led by BoltRock Holdings and Centaurus Capital. The water tech startup is now valued at $1 billion. The startup develops technology to reduce water usage and build wastewater treatment systems for companies in the pharmaceutical, semiconductor, food and beverage, and other water-demanding industries. The funding is the largest in the wastewater treatment space, at least since the beginning of 2022. Founded in 2013 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the company has now raised more than $392 million, according to Crunchbase.
5. CoreWeave, $200M, cloud: AI keeps the hits coming. Just more than a month after raising $221 million, New Jersey AI cloud infrastructure startup CoreWeave raised another $200 million from existing investor Magnetar Capital. Unlike some of the generative AI application startups that have received huge funding rounds, CoreWeave provides some of the plumbing necessary for AI to work. The specialized cloud provider — which actually started out as an Ethereum mining operation — offers cloud infrastructure with better processing that will be needed to train large language models for AI. Coreweave, which competes with cloud providers Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google, has now raised $576.5 million in total funding, per Crunchbase.
6. Strive Health, $166M, health care: Per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention numbers, 37 million U.S. adults live with kidney disease, but about 9 out of 10 people with kidney disease don’t know they have it. That’s a problem, as early care is pivotal in trying to control the situation. Denver-based Strive Health raised a $166 million Series C led by NEA to help people get that care. The startup offers value-based kidney care, as it partners with healthcare providers. Strive Health uses a unique combination of technology-enabled care interventions and seamless integration with local providers to help patients suffering from chronic kidney disease get care at all stages of the fight. Founded in 2018, the company has now raised $386 million, according to Crunchbase.
7. Lightmatter, $154M, hardware: Along the same lines as CoreWeave, Boston-based Lightmatter also has its hands in AI, but not creating applications. Rather the startup uses light to link computer chips together and to do calculations for deep learning necessary for AI. However, the use of light allows for this to happen faster and more energy-efficiently. Investors see that need apparently, as the Boston-based company locked up a $154 million raise from the likes of GV, the venture capital investment division of Alphabet, and Fidelity Management and Research Co. were among the round’s investors. Founded in 2017, the company has raised $267 million, per Crunchbase.
8. Carmot Therapeutics, $150M, biotech: Berkeley, California-based biotech firm Carmot Therapeutics closed a $150 million Series E led by Deep Track Capital. The startup is developing therapies for metabolic diseases including obesity and diabetes. Carmot has several therapeutics in its pipeline and the new cash infusion to add to its portfolio. Founded in 2008, the company has raised nearly $385 million, per Crunchbase.
9. Restaurant365, $135M, accounting: It’s hard to run a restaurant — as anyone who has watched several reality shows based on doing so knows. Restaurant365 tries to make that a little easier and last month the Irvine, California-based startup added some big-named backers. The company nailed down a $135 million round co-led by KKR and L Catterton. The new round values the company at $1 billion, per its release. Restaurant365 offers enterprise management software for restaurants, helping them take care of accounting, payroll, supply chain and more. The company has surpassed $100 million in revenue and is used in more than 40,000 restaurant locations. Founded in 2011, Restaurant365 has raised over $260 million, per Crunchbase.
10. Tools For Humanity, $115M, crypto: It’s Sam Altman’s world — we’re just living in it. Worldcoin developer Tools For Humanity — co-founded by Altman — raised a $115 million Series C led by Blockchain Capital. The San Francisco-based startup is building tools in support of Worldcoin, an Ethereum-based token currently in beta. Its World ID platform is attempting to create unique digital identities — based on blockchain technology — for people by scanning their eyes with a small orb. The startup has raised many questions surrounding AI, data and privacy. While such an identity platform could be useful as AI makes it more difficult to know who or what one is dealing with over the internet, the scanning of people’s eyes to create a digital identity and how that information could be used raises obvious privacy and data concerns. The company did not reveal a valuation, but an earlier report said it is looking to raise money at a $3 billion valuation.
Big global deals
Despite all the big deals in the U.S., the biggest occurred across the pond.

China-based fast-fashion startup Shein reportedly raised $2 billion at two-thirds of its valuation, according to The Wall Street Journal.
London-based YgEia3, a startup developing wellness testing for companies, raised a huge $750 million venture round.

Methodology
We tracked the largest rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies in May. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late.

Measurabl Raises $93M For Real Estate ESG As VC Investment For Sustainability Startups Remains Hot,Marlize van Romburgh,2023/06/1,"

Measurabl, which helps companies in the real estate industry measure their environmental, social and governance impacts, raised $93 million in an oversubscribed Series D funding round.
Energy Impact Partners and Sway Ventures co-led the round for San Diego-based Measurabl. Moderne Ventures, WVV, Suffolk Construction, Broadscale, Camber Creek, Salesforce Ventures1, Building Ventures, Constellation Technology Ventures, Concrete Ventures, RET Ventures, Colliers and Lincoln Property Co. also participated. 
Measurabl has now raised $172.6 million total, per Crunchbase.

The startup was co-founded in 2013 by CTO Lance Onken and CEO Matt Ellis, the former director of sustainability at commercial real estate brokerage giant CBRE. The company claims it’s the most widely used ESG platform for the real estate industry, with 37% of top asset managers using its platform to measure and manage the impact of $2 trillion worth of properties.
The company acquired a couple other startups in 2022 to help it build out its platform. It bought Hatch Data, a building energy and carbon management platform, as well as WegoWise, a platform for building managers to track energy and utility usage, that had raised $4.9 million per Crunchbase.
“The antidote to greenwashing is objective measurement and transparency,” Ellis said in a statement announcing Measurabl’s new raise. “This funding allows us to further enhance our market-leading ESG technologies, expand to new geographies, and ensure the real estate industry has the investment-grade data necessary to transition to a sustainable, proﬁtable future for all.”
Sustainability draws huge VC dollars
ESG refers broadly to a set of criteria that evaluate the sustainability and ethical impacts of a company or investment, looking at factors including carbon emissions, labor practices, animal welfare, workplace diversity and inclusion efforts, supply chain transparency, executive compensation, and board composition. By one estimate, ​​ESG accounts for $1 out of every $8 in U.S. assets under professional management.
Billions of venture dollars have also gone to startups in the sustainability industry: $7.3 billion globally last year, just shy of the $7.4 billion they raised in 2021, Crunchbase data shows. Those figures are particularly significant, given that overall venture spending fell 35% globally last year from 2021’s record highs.
Startups that describe themselves as ESG-related specifically raised $480.9 million in venture backing globally last year, per Crunchbase, a huge leap compared to $95.2 million in 2021. 
Venture investors’ continued interest in ESG startups also comes despite new pressures on corporate sustainability efforts, which some prominent Republicans have criticized as politicized investing that leads to lower returns for the sake of virtue signaling.

"In Rare Unicorn Up Round, Travel Startup GetYourGuide Raises $194M At $2B Valuation",Keerthi Vedantam,2023/06/1,"

The travel sector is really taking off.
About 24 hours after we said Hostaway’s $175 million raise was a rarity, Germany-based travel startup GetYourGuide announced it raised $194 million in a mix of equity and debt, raising its valuation to $2 billion according to CNBC. 

Of that funding, $85 million comes from a Series F round led by Blue Pool Capital with additional participation from KKR and Temasek Holdings. The other $109 million in revolving credit was led by UniCredit, with participation from Citibank, BNP Paribas and KfW.
Tourism startups get some love again
The tourism industry is only just starting to bounce back from the pandemic. While many countries ended or relaxed stay-at-home orders in 2021, the Omicron variant and strict safety protocols made it difficult to travel. According to Crunchbase data, the travel and tourism startup sector garnered a mere $5.9 billion in venture funding in 2022, around $100 million more than what was invested in the sector back in 2016.
With the latest raise, GetYourGuide’s valuation increases 43% from $1.4 billion to $2 billion. It’s one of the few large valuation raises among unicorn startups we’ve seen lately — many large startups have been forced to raise new funding at lower valuations in the past two years, a sign that tech startups were incredibly overvalued during the hype cycle in 2021.
GetYourGuide sells travel experiences, like niche guided wine tours with sommeliers, art gallery walks with experts, and glacier hikes in icy regions. The tours are provided by third-party companies, sometimes local ones, and GetYourGuide gets a commission for every experience it sells on the platform. 
The company is also working on creating original travel experiences, such as meeting the keyholder to the Vatican and doing a walking tour with him. 
The travel guide startup is also integrating generative AI into its platform through language learning models, which can create colorful descriptions for the different classes and tours. These models, popularized by ChatGPT, have become a popular adoption tool for startups across different industries.

Downturns Recover In Years. Popped Bubbles Take Decades,Joanna Glasner,2023/06/1,"

When we look at recent declines in tech valuations, it’s tempting to turn to prior down markets for guidance on how a recovery might play out.
Over the past 25 years, two historic downturns stand out as possible comps. One is the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. The other is the dot-com bubble, which popped in 2000 and 2001.


For tech investors wishing the current cycle would reverse, a repeat of the financial crisis doesn’t sound too bad. Tech stocks bottomed in early 2009, and by 2011, the tech-focused Nasdaq 100 index was back at its highest point in five years. After that, tech valuations went mostly straight up for the next 10 years. 
A replay of the dot-com bubble, on the other hand, looks more worrisome. After peaking in March 2000, it took the Nasdaq 15 years to get back to that level. 
Even the most enduring brands were slow to recover. Qualcomm stock took 20 years to get back to where it was in early 2000. It took Microsoft roughly 15 years. Cisco Systems has never retraced its bubble-era highs. 
As for the hot startups of the day, a large share have been relegated to the dustbins of history, alongside their sock puppet mascots, automated grocery delivery offerings, and next-gen fiber optic networks. 
Is this a downturn or a popped bubble?
Fast-forward a couple decades, and we see elements of history repeating. If we look at the past few quarters, much of what we’ve seen appears more reminiscent of the dot-com implosion than the financial crisis. Some of the key characteristics:

Hot tech and tech-adjacent companies didn’t just go up incrementally. Many saw market caps increase several-fold over the course of just a year or two. Tesla, for instance, increased tenfold(!) between March 2020 and November 2021. Nvidia shares saw a sixfold increase over that time. Apple more than doubled. Google nearly tripled. And these were all already tremendously valuable companies before that.
Companies debuting on the public markets were awarded bonkers valuations. Rivian, an electric carmaker with no mass-market product yet, went public at a valuation soon exceeding that of GM and Ford. Embark, a pre-revenue developer of self-driving truck technology, did a SPAC deal at a valuation over $5 billion before shutting down this year. Affirm, the buy now, pay later platform, debuted at 8x its current valuation … and the list goes on.
Venture capital was on a historic binge. Global venture capital investment topped $643 billion at the peak in 2021, up 92% year over year. A whopping 586 new companies joined The Crunchbase Unicorn Board.

So when things went down, they had far to sink. If we’re in a popped bubble, that’s bad news for those hoping to just wait out a recovery. 
Not quite Bubble 2.0
Bubbliness aside, this isn’t shaping up as a replay of the dot-com bubble. 
Spiking asset prices weren’t only happening in tech. At the market peak in late 2021, companies in numerous sectors were way up, including asset managers, energy and real estate.
Another difference: Several of the biggest tech companies have avoided steep declines or even increased in value in recent quarters. Apple, for instance, is still pretty close to its record high, as is Microsoft. And Nvidia just broke its record high, after a stellar earnings report last week. 
So, history won’t repeat itself exactly. But when it comes to the long list of relatively solid companies in SaaS and other sectors that saw valuations skyrocket to unsustainable levels, it wouldn’t be surprising if recovery was a long, slow slog.

Reader Survey: What’s Your Outlook For The Second Half Of 2023?,Marlize van Romburgh,2023/06/1,"

We’re approaching the halfway point of 2023, and few predictions from the beginning of the year have fully panned out.
The global economy thankfully hasn’t slipped into a recession.
But it hasn’t exactly rebounded either.

Tech layoffs continue to pile up, even as the rest of the labor market remains hot. The IPO pipeline remains frozen solid despite a long list of well-funded startups that would dearly like to graduate to the public markets. Venture funding is scarce.
There have been some big, unexpected twists and turns. Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in spectacular fashion in the span of a few days, marking the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history and the first since the financial crisis.
And artificial intelligence has moved forward in incredible leaps and bounds. Of the 20 largest venture funding rounds to U.S. startups so far this year, six have gone to companies in the AI space, including the biggest of them all: Microsoft-backed OpenAI. This week, the AI boom minted Nvidia as the world’s first trillion-dollar chipmaker.
With all that in mind, we want to hear from you, our readers, about what you expect from the rest of a year that has thus far defied expectations. Let us know in the quick survey below. Survey results will be published in a few weeks.

Hostaway’s $175M Raise Is A Rarity In The Travel Industry,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/05/31,"

There’s a bright spot in the dismal travel and tourism industry.

Hostaway, a vacation rental management software startup, announced on Wednesday it raised $175 million in funding. The round was led by PSG Equity.
The company, which is based in Canada and Finland, is made for property managers to manage bookings, guests and vacancies across different platforms like Airbnb, Vrbo and Booking.com. Through the platform, property managers can go through inquiries, manage guest requests and even automate messages to potential customers using ChatGPT.
Hostaway was started in 2015 and has grown to host more than 100,000 short-term rental and vacation properties across 100 countries. The company plans on using the fresh funding to expand into different countries and increase hiring.
“We believe the company has a significant opportunity to lead this industry as it continues to scale its integrated platform, expand globally and help its customers meet the growing demand in the short-term rental market,” said Edward Hughes, Managing Director at PSG, in a statement.
A turbulent time for travel
Hostaway’s raise is pretty promising. As of now, the startup’s $175 million is the second-largest funding round in the industry this year, per Crunchbase data. Besides a $366 million corporate round from an actual airline, ITA Airways, no company has come close to cracking $100 million so far.
That tracks. The travel industry is still reeling from pandemic-era social distancing protocols. While people are eagerly traveling (pretty much everyone I know is in Europe right now), stricter sanitation protocols mean property managers have to spend more time and labor cleaning, and rooms stay vacant longer.
The industry saw a steady increase in startup funding between 2016 and 2019, which dramatically dropped in 2020 once the pandemic hit the United States. After bouncing back in 2021 (like pretty much all industries did), the travel industry garnered only around $5.9 billion globally in 2022.
The travel industry is a tricky one to break into, and many startups have failed despite promising interesting or unique traveling experiences.

Specialized Cloud Provider CoreWeave Rides AI Wave To Another $200M Round,Marlize van Romburgh,2023/05/31,"

CoreWeave, an AI cloud infrastructure company, has raised another $200 million in a Series B extension funding round that values it at $2 billion. The new funding is from existing investor Magnetar Capital and comes just weeks after CoreWeave raised $221 million.

The back-to-back investments in CoreWeave highlight venture investors’ immense appetite for artificial intelligence startups and the companies that provide the infrastructure to power them. 
In the six months since OpenAI unveiled its AI chatbot ChatGPT, investors have poured tens of billions of dollars into AI startups, which many tech leaders see as a paradigm shift in the technology world akin to the advent of the Internet three decades ago.
This year alone, seven funding rounds of $100 million or more have gone to U.S.-based startups related to AI, according to The Crunchbase Megadeals Board.
Coreweave offers cloud computing services based on graphics processing units, or GPUs, the server chips that underlie many AI services like ChatGPT. Underscoring the intense business interest in the technology, GPU leader Nvidia — also a CoreWeave investor — this week became the first chipmaker valued at $1 trillion. 
Coreweave, which competes with cloud providers Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google, has now raised $576.5 million in total funding, per Crunchbase.

These AI Investors Are Following The Light By Giving This Startup $154M,Jenna D'Illard,2023/05/31,"

It’s not easy wrapping your head around what Boston-based Lightmatter does exactly.
But investors get it, at least enough to give the company $154 million in its latest fundraise. The new funds have reportedly tripled the company’s valuation, in the latest string of eye-popping AI-related rounds.

GV, the venture capital investment division of Alphabet, and Fidelity Management and Research Co. were among the round’s investors, according to reports.
What it does
Lightmatter’s products essentially do two things: Make computing faster and more energy-efficient — requirements critical to supporting the generative AI boom.
To dismiss its technology as “something that involves AI” misses the fact that the company has been operating in the artificial intelligence space before funding to the artificial intelligence space was cool.
More specifically, the startup uses light to link computer chips together and to do calculations for deep learning. Customers and data centers want the company’s product, and the generative AI craze is driving demand.
And what a boom it’s been.
Overall, $20 billion has been raised by startups using “AI” in 2023. Prior to today’s announcement, Lightmatter had raised a total of $113 million in funding over three rounds, according to Crunchbase data. Its previous funding was raised on April 6, 2021, and included Matrix Partners and Viking Global Investors as backers.
Isn’t light free?
Yes, but harnessing it requires a lot of engineering talent. Overall, light has been used for decades to move data via fiber-optic cables (think telecommunications industry). But generally light is considered better at transmitting information than electrical signals over wires. Better in this case meaning more energy-efficient.
Large tech companies want to reduce power costs (understandably) so are turning to light-based solutions. And clearly, they are willing to pay for it and investors are willing to bet on it.

AI Investing Boom Is Not New To Tech Giants (At Least Not Their VC Arms),Chris Metinko,2023/05/31,"

Last week, tech titans including Nvidia and Microsoft made some big AI announcements.
Nvidia’s shares jumped on guidance for second-quarter revenue that would be more than 50% above estimates, while Microsoft announced several AI-related tidbits at its Microsoft Build conference. In addition, Google and Salesforce’s venture arm — Salesforce Ventures1 — took part in the largest round of the week, Anthropic’s $450 million Series C.
However, while AI’s dominance of the new cycle may seem recent, for tech’s biggest software developers, chipmakers and hyperscalers, artificial intelligence has had their attention — and money — for years, according to Crunchbase data.

Those tech giants have been placing a few AI bets for some time — although those bets have become significantly more expensive in recent years — while their venture arms have planted cash across dozens of startups through that time.
Let’s take a look at some of the biggest players and how much they’re pouring into AI startups.
Nvidia
No company has made bigger headlines than Nvidia recently, as it just became the first trillion-dollar chip firm.
Nvidia is leading the charge for chips with better processing to train large language models for AI — a race that will only get more heated as more AI applications are built and better infrastructure is necessary to support them.
To help stay ahead of the game, Nvidia has made a fair share of investments in the ecosystem surrounding AI. The chip giant has made 18 different investments in VC-backed startups since the start of 2021, per Crunchbase data. 
The largest deals Nvidia participated in all have come this calendar year and include:

Adept AI’s $350 million Series B in March that gave the San Francisco-based startup a post-money valuation of at least $1 billion. Adept is developing AI models that cannot just respond to text commands — like a chatbot — but actually turn that command into actions. In theory, the company’s generative AI could help users do tasks from browsing the internet to navigating enterprise software tools.
Toronto-based Cohere’s $270 million round in May. The startup’s AI platform competes with OpenAI.
Drone startup Skydio’s $230 million Series E at a $2.2 billion valuation in February.

The chipmaker has thus far made four investments in the AI space this year with those rounds totaling $850 million. (It’s important to note that is the total raised in those rounds. Investors typically do not reveal their stake in an individual round.)
The price of doing business when it comes to AI investing has clearly increased. Last year, Nvidia made a half-dozen deals that totaled $297 million, per Crunchbase data. Those deals included investments in AI edge computing startup Utilidata and AI autonomous building platform PassiveLogic.
In 2021, the company made eight investments in VC-backed AI startups totaling $440 million. Those deals included conversational AI platform Kore.ai and AI development platform Saturn Cloud.
Microsoft and M12
No company made a bigger splash this year in AI than Microsoft with the news in January it had agreed to a “multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment” into OpenAI, the startup behind the artificial intelligence tools ChatGPT and DALL-E for a reported $10 billion.
Microsoft’s interest in AI is logical, as few companies have as many tentacles in every aspect of technology and innovation as the Redmond, Washington-based titan. From cloud to search to autonomous driving to analytics, Microsoft’s uses for AI are only limited by the imagination.
Along with OpenAl, the Windows creator also participated in the Adept AI deal and led an undisclosed round in London-based AI-enhanced software platform developer Builder.ai, which later announced a Series D of more than $250 million.
Since the beginning of 2021, Microsoft itself has made nine deals involved in the AI sector, according to Crunchbase data — three deals in each calendar year. 
Those deals include participating in self-driving vehicle startup Cruise’s $2 billion round in 2021 and London-based AI driving tech Wayve’s $181 million Series B last year.
However, Microsoft’s investments pale in comparison to the number of deals its venture arm — M12 — has made in that same period.
M12, which invests from a single fund that is replenished by Microsoft — the fund’s sole limited partner — and is driven by financial returns, has made more than 30 deals in the AI space in the last 29 months, per Crunchbase data.
In fact, the venture arm has made nearly 60 deals in AI-enhanced or related startups since 2019.
Some of the biggest deals it has participated in include:

Montreal AI tech startup Element AI’s $146 million round in 2019.
Health cloud and analytics provider Innovaccer’s $150 million Series E in 2021.
Seattle-based AI sales platform Outreach’s $114 million Series E in 2019. 

M12 also has led or co-led eight rounds since the start of 2021.
However, the firm seems to have stepped off the gas in its AI investing this year, as Crunchbase data indicates it has only participated in one round through the year’s first five months — San Francisco-based Typeface’s $65 million Series A. The startup has a generative AI application for creating enterprise content.
Google and GV
Similar to Microsoft, Google is ubiquitous when it comes to tech, with its hands in the cloud, drones, logistics, search, data and just about everything under the sun — so its interest in what AI can be applied to is limitless.
Despite Google’s recent participation in Anthropic’s huge round, the Mountain View, California-based search and cloud giant has only made eight deals in the AI space involving VC-backed startups since the start of 2021, according to Crunchbase data.
That does include some interesting deals, however, such as a $100 million Series B in AI-powered industrial decision-making startup InstaDeep and co-leading a $14 million Series D in AI agri-tech firm Cropin, both last year.
However, Google’s all-everything venture arm GV has been much busier.
In the last four-plus years, GV has made 45 investments in the space, per Crunchbase. 
That includes participating in Palo Alto, California-based SambaNova Systems’ huge $676 million round in 2021 and its $250 million raise the year before. SambaNova was founded as an AI chip designer.
Between 2012 and last year, the venture arm — which invests in rounds ranging from seed to late-stage growth — took part in two dozen funding rounds for VC-backed startups using AI.
This year, GV has taken part in both Typeface’s raise, as well as AI and automation recruiting solution Moonhub’s $4.4 million seed, which it co-led.
Intel Capital
Few companies are more intertwined with the very basic infrastructure of technology than Intel, and few corporate venture arms are as active as Intel Capital. The firm is one of the oldest and most prolific venture arms.
Not surprising, that is also true when it comes to investing in AI-related startups — as it unlikely wants to be left behind in innovation that could revolutionize chips and processors.
Intel Capital has made a whopping 107 investments in such startups since 2016, per Crunchbase data.
More recently, it has made almost two dozen deals since the beginning of 2021. That includes co-leading some significant rounds, such as:

Toronto-based AI chip designer Untether’s $125 million Series B in 2021.
San Francisco-based Anyscale’s $99 million Series C last year. The startup helps scale AI applications.

This year, Intel Capital has made only one announced deal in the AI space, leading a $20 million Series A for Israel-based MDI Health, which offers an AI-powered platform that provides decision support tools for drug treatments.
Salesforce Ventures
Granted, when one thinks about AI and who would invest, one would logically think of chipmakers, cloud providers and those involved in analytics and search.
However, many AI applications are marketing and sales related, so it makes sense that one of the largest CRM and sales platforms in the world would be making investments in the space — or at least its venture arm is.
Salesforce Ventures has taken part in more than 50 deals that involved AI-related startups since the start of 2019, per Crunchbase data.
Some of the more noteworthy rounds it took part in last year include Seattle-based AI-fueled sales enablement platform Highspot’s $248 million Series F, and Redwood City, California-based machine-learning data catalog Alation’s $123 million Series E.
This year, the venture arm has made four deals, including participating in Anthropic’s recent big raise. It also took part in Cohere’s huge $250 million round and a seed round for New York-based Hearth AI, a relationship management system.
Salesforce Ventures’s deals also show the rising price to invest in AI-related startups. While the venture arm made 10 investments in deals that totaled $736 million last year, the four deals this year have totaled $705 million.

These 3 Charts Show It’s Not Easy Being A Seed Startup These Days,Gené Teare,2023/05/31,"

U.S. seed startups have been the least affected by the venture funding downturn. But these companies are competing in a more crowded field than ever for investor attention and will likely have to wait longer to raise their Series A rounds — if they’re able to at all — an analysis of Crunchbase data shows.

To paint a clearer picture of the state of the U.S. seed market, let’s break it down into three charts.
Seed funding slows after peak
Quarterly seed funding peaked in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2022, Crunchbase data shows.
It took the better part of that year for the slowdown to reach seed. By the third quarter of 2022, seed amounts were flat year over year — still high since seed was up in 2021 — and then slowed in the fourth quarter from 2021 heights, and dipped further in Q1 2023.
Despite the slow quarter-over-quarter downward roll since the Q1 2022 peak, seed funding is still above 2020 amounts and has weathered the downturn better than all other stages.


This might lead you to believe that seed-stage companies have an advantage compared to all other stages of funding. It’s true that seed startups are less encumbered by the outsized valuations that later-stage startups are struggling with.
It’s also true that seed-funded startups always face an uphill battle, even in the best of circumstances: Failure rates for startups at this stage range from 50% to 90%, depending on whose projections you believe.
That said, even though it was the most robust funding stage in 2022, the challenges facing seed startups in the current market could be formidable going forward.
Seed startups pile up
First, it’s worth noting that there are more seed-funded companies in the pipeline than ever before, and they’re all competing for investor attention as they seek to raise their Series A rounds.
Around 2,000 companies that raised an initial $1 million seed in 2021 have yet to raise post-seed funding, Crunchbase data shows. Another 2,400 companies that raised seed funding in 2022 will be competing for that next round.
Those figures don’t even include the many additional startups — likely numbering in the thousands in the U.S. alone — that have not yet raised a seed round of at least $1 million.


That leads us to our next data point: how long companies are hanging out at the seed stage.
Companies stuck at seed for longer
Many of these companies will spend more time in the seed pond, as more seed funds have launched in the U.S. in the last five years, and as those funds have typically gotten larger.
In 2014, a startup that raised at least $1 million at the seed stage typically raised a Series A 14 months later, if it was able to graduate to the next stage, Crunchbase data shows.
Fast-forward to 2020, when that time frame stretched considerably to 24 months.
In the hot market of 2021 and 2022, the median time shortened a bit again, to 22 and 21 months, respectively.
Now in 2023, the median time between a $1 million-plus seed and a Series A has stretched all the way out to 25 months.


It’s reasonable to expect the time between seed and Series A to get even longer in the current funding environment as investors remain exceptionally picky about which startups they back.
For new startups, the good news is there are many more funds investing at the seed stage.
The bad news is that these funds have many more portfolio companies milling around at the seed stage that they need to prioritize.
New seedlings
Around two-thirds of startups in the U.S. that raised $1 million or more in a seed round between 2012 and 2017 went on to raise post-seed funding, our analysis of Crunchbase data shows. (That trends down to around 40% if you remove the $1 million bar.)
But that was then, and this is now. It’s now much less certain that the majority of well-funded seed startups will make it to Series A — especially given that many of the companies in the current seed cohort raised those rounds in the funding heyday of 2021.
The absolute number of U.S. companies that raised their first seed round of $1 million or more went up by 49% in 2021.
Amid layoffs and restructuring in the tech sector, it’s likely that more startups will be founded in the coming years. 
“2023 and 2024 could be the biggest two years for company formation — ever,” Rob Biederman, co-founder of early-stage investor Asymmetric Capital Partners said in an interview with Crunchbase News. “People have no idea how much talent is going to be coming into the market in 2023 and 2024, trying to start companies.”

"Hourly Workers Are In High Demand, As Are Some Startups Catering To Them",Joanna Glasner,2023/05/30,"

Few people get rich working short-term and hourly wage jobs. However, it is how most of us make a living.
In the U.S. for instance, over 76 million workers were paid at hourly rates last year, representing over 55% of all wage and salary recipients. Millions more earn freelance and gig work income calculated using other methods.
Given that so many of us are working hourly and gig-based jobs, it’s not surprising to see startups scaling up to address the market. Globally, such companies have raised billions in venture and growth funding over the past couple of years, per an analysis of Crunchbase data.

And investment continues to flow to the space. Just last week, for example, Instawork, a platform for connecting businesses with skilled hourly workers, raised $60 million in a Series D funding led by TCV. The San Francisco-based company counts major retailers, sports stadiums and light industrial employers among its users.
Who’s getting funded
Instawork is one of dozens of companies targeting hourly and gig workers and employers that has raised funding in the past couple of years. Using Crunchbase data, we compiled a sample set of 26 such startups:


Collectively, the companies on our list have raised over $2.7 billion to date with offerings including scheduling apps, payroll and compliance tools, and platforms to quickly connect workers with employers in need of their services.
Among the most heavily funded this past year is Fountain, an applicant tracking system for hiring large numbers of hourly employees. The San Francisco-based company, which recently rolled out a conversational AI tool for hiring managers, pulled in a $100 million Series B last June.
In terms of total funding, the standout is Jobandtalent, which connects workers with gig-type assignments in industries including hospitality, logistics and construction. Founded in 2009, the Madrid-based company has raised over $700 million in equity funding, including a $500 million SoftBank Vision Fund-led Series E in late 2021.
WorkJam, meanwhile, is taking a different approach. The Montreal-based company, which picked up a $50 million Series D in November, offers tools for employers of shift workers to set schedules, manage tasks and organize training.
Tight market for employers
Startups’ are focusing on hourly and gig workforces at a time when employers are struggling to fill these kinds of jobs at prevailing wages.
As of the end of March, there were 9.6 million U.S. job openings, per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s actually down from December, when there were 11.2 million openings, but still signifies a tight labor market, with demand for hourly workers well exceeding supply at current pay rates.
Labor shortages have prompted a number of large employers to hike hourly wages in recent months. The Home Depot, for instance, raised starting hourly pay to $15. Walmart announced an average hourly wage of more than $17.50, while Amazon said in September that starting pay for warehouse and delivery workers will be more than $19 an hour.
Among startups, the hope is that the apps and tools they’re offering can play a role alongside pay increases to make it easier and more appealing for hourly and gig workers to take on a new position.
For workers, of course, a shiny new app is a secondary consideration to things like available hours and pay. However, it certainly doesn’t hurt to make the job of getting hired and onboarded a little easier.

"Summer Is Here, And Startups Want You To Go Camping",Joanna Glasner,2023/05/27,"

Recently, it’s come to my attention that going outdoors and exploring nature can be truly awesome.

No, it’s not because I’ve actually gone outside. Rather, it stems from hours of screen time tallying funding for outdoorsy-themed startups and staring at websites featuring high-tech campervans, rustic-yet-charming glampsites, and images of people enjoying trees, mountains and lakes. 
Yes, yes, I know you probably think startup investors prefer you cooped up inside. You should be spending crypto on NFTs in the metaverse or feeding content to ad-spewing, AI-enabled algorithms. That kind of thing.
But apparently, tech investors also want you to go camping. Of course, you should also plan to  rent a travel vehicle through a peer-to-peer RV sharing app. And preferably, reserve an exclusive spot booked through a venture-backed campsite aggregator. But still, go camping.
There’s a lot of money in outdoorsy-themed investments
Apparently, there’s big money in getting you out of the house.
Or at least venture investors seem to think so, judging by the sizable sums startups targeting outdoor recreation-related markets have raised in the past few years.
For a sense of where the money is going, we used Crunchbase data to curate a list of startups that have raised rounds in the past three years with an eye to getting consumers off their screens and outside. Altogether, the 21 companies listed below have raised more than $1 billion to date:


Land
Most of the funding is going to companies helping people figure out how to camp, hike and glamp on dry land, which makes sense as we are land mammals.
On this front, the most prodigious fundraiser is AllTrails, a global aggregator of digital trail guides that picked up $150 million from the growth fund of private equity firm Permira in late 2021. It’s a huge platform, with over 30 million users and more than 300,000 trails spanning everywhere from Algeria to Zambia.
People need a place to sleep too, so startups are also offering up rustic accommodations. San Francisco-based Hipcamp, which connects people with tent camping, RV parks, cabins, treehouses and glamping sites, has raised over $97 million in venture funding to date. And Brooklyn-based Getaway, which has raised over $80 million, operates collections of cabins in country locales that are an easy drive from major cities.
Street
Some of us land mammals prefer accommodations we can drive, which is where our second-biggest funding recipient, RV rental platform Outdoorsy enters the picture. The 9-year-old, Austin, Texas-based company offers a platform for people to rent RVs, camper vans and travel trailers. It’s raised $165 million in equity funding to date
In a similar vein, Akron-based RVshare has pulled in $150 million to date for its peer-to-peer rental marketplace. It says owners of the most high-end RVs can make up to $60,000 per year on its platform.
While most of the biggest rounds date back over a year, we’re also seeing more recent deals in the space. Most recently, Spot2Nite, a marketplace for booking RV campsites, picked up $3 million in an April Series A round. The New Orleans-based company says it wants to make the process of securing a site as consistent and modern as booking a hotel or rental car.
Water
Summer is all about getting wet, be it at the pool, lake, river or beach, and startups are on board with that too.
Among the more heavily funded players in this arena is Swimply, a marketplace for renting private pools by the hour. To date, the 5-year-old, Los Angeles-based company has raised over $60 million.
GetMyBoat, a marketplace for boat rentals, yacht charters and water experiences, is also scaling up with a 2022 Series B bringing total funding to $36 million. For those who want to look stylish in or near the water, meanwhile, there are venture-backed swimwear brands Andie and Left On Friday.
Yes, you could just go outside, but….
Now, of course humans don’t need RVs, booking apps, peer-reviewed trail compendiums, or fashionable gear to go outside. It is possible to just, you know, go outside. Maybe take a hike, build a campfire or pitch a tent if you’re so inclined.
However, there’s not a lot of business model scalability in that. Nor does it produce a high-multiple exit for a venture investor. So next time you are thinking about something as old-school as camping, keep that in mind. Just because your ancestors foraged for sustenance in the wild without the help of marketplace apps doesn’t mean you have to follow in their footsteps.

"The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Anthropic Generates Another Huge Round, Biotech Has Big Week",Chris Metinko,2023/05/26,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.

The week can be summed up pretty succinctly by just saying AI and biotech. Another AI startup — one we’ve seen before — had another huge raise, and biotech had three huge rounds and a lot of good-sized ones. In general, it does seem like venture investing has been creeping up the past few weeks — at least when analyzing big rounds — but we’ll see what the summer holds.
1. Anthropic, $450M, artificial intelligence: If Anthropic looks familiar to you on this list, there’s a reason. In February there were reports that Google had invested between $300 million and $400 million into the San Francisco-based startup. That was followed in March by reports that Anthropic was raising another $300 million round at a pre-investment valuation of $4.1 billion. Then this week, Anthropic — a ChatGPT rival with its AI assistant Claude — announced it had raised $450 million in Series C funding led by Spark Capital with participation from Google, Salesforce Ventures1, Sound Ventures, Zoom Ventures and others. Anthropic itself previously announced a $124 million Series A in 2021 and a $580 million Series B in 2022 — led by none other than disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Of course, nothing has been hotter than AI this year. The raise was only topped by the $10 billion investment into OpenAI reportedly by Microsoft in January.
2. ElevateBio, $401M, biotech: We say this every week, but we really mean it this time — it was a huge week for biotech as three rounds brought in more than $850 million. First up is Massachusetts-based gene therapy startup ElevateBio, which raised a $401 million Series D led by the AyurMaya Capital Management Fund, a VC fund managed by Matrix Capital Management. The startup has multiple platforms for things such as drug development and manufacturing which interconnect with one another — making it an end-to-end biopharma company. The company has multiple drug development pipelines as demand grows for gene therapies that help the immune system fight its way through disease. Founded in 2017, the company has now raised $1.2 billion, per Crunchbase.
3. ReNAgade Therapeutics, $300M, biotech: This brings us to our second big biotech raise. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based ReNAgade Therapeutics locked up a $300 million Series A led by MPM BioImpact and F2 Ventures. That money would be big for any round, but a $300 million Series A in this venture market borders on the amazing (yes, it can be difficult to figure out how long a round took to raise, but still). ReNAgade is developing RNA therapeutics (hence the name) to fight disease. The company already has established a joint venture with Orna Therapeutics. Founded in 2021, this is the company’s first outside funding, per Crunchbase.
4. Carmot Therapeutics, $150M, biotech: Not to be forgotten, Berkeley, California-based biotech firm Carmot Therapeutics closed a $150 million Series E led by Deep Track Capital. The startup is developing therapies for metabolic diseases including obesity and diabetes. The company  has several therapeutics in its pipeline and the new cash infusion to add to its portfolio. Founded in 2008, the company has raised nearly $385 million, per Crunchbase.
5. Tools For Humanity, $115M, crypto: It’s Sam Altman’s world, we’re just living in it. Worldcoin developer Tools For Humanity — co-founded by Altman — raised a $115 million Series C led by Blockchain Capital. The San Francisco-based startup is building tools in support of Worldcoin, an Ethereum-based token currently in beta. Its World ID platform is attempting to create unique digital identities — based on blockchain technology — for people by scanning their eyes with a small orb. The startup has raised many questions surrounding AI, data and privacy. While such an identity platform could be useful as AI makes it more difficult to know who or what one is dealing with over the internet, the scanning of people’s eyes to create a digital identity and how that information could be used has raised privacy and data concerns.The company did not reveal a valuation, but an earlier report said it is looking to raise money at a $3 billion valuation.
6. Nymbus, $70M, fintech: Jacksonville, Florida-based fintech startup Nymbus raised a $70 million Series D led by Insight Partners. Founded in 2015, the company has raised nearly $200 million.
7. OnKure Therapeutics, $54M, biotech: Boulder, Colorado-based precision oncology startup OnKure closed a $54 million Series C led by Surveyor Capital. Founded in 2011, the company has raised $121.5 million, per Crunchbase.
8. Quanta Therapeutics, $51M, biotech: San Francisco-based biotech Quanta Therapeutics locked up a $50.7 million Series D led by Avidity Partners. Founded in 2018, Quanta has raised more than $142 million, according to Crunchbase.
9. Episode Six, $48M, fintech: Austin, Texas-based payment processing startup Episode Six raised a $48 million Series C financing led by Avenir. Founded in 2015, the company has raised $90 million, per Crunchbase.
10. Larkspur Biosciences, $36M, biotech: Watertown, Massachusetts-based biotech firm Larkspur Biosciences launched with $35.5 million in a combined seed and Series A round co-led by Polaris Partners, 3E Bioventures Capital and Takeda Ventures.
Big global deals
Not surprisingly, the biggest non-U.S. round of the week also involved AI.

London-based Builder.ai raised a Series D of more than $250 million led by Qatar Investment Authority. The company uses AI in its software development platform.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of May 20 to 26. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

Is The AI Hype For Real? $20B In Investments Says Yes,Jenna D'Illard,2023/05/26,"

As every investor and their French Bulldog scrambles to get in on the AI action, we look to the data for answers.
Ironically, we can’t even define “AI” as a sector per se since almost every startup looking for some coin or decent press suddenly identifies as an “AI-centered-something-or-other.”
But for the purists, the numbers don’t lie — or in the very least they tell a clearer story than the prevalent “AI will save the world” narrative.

In fact, early this week investors poured $700 million into two AI startups — Builder.ai and Anthropic — and followed up mid-week with another $105 million to AI marketing platform Insider. It seems we’ve reached another level of the AI craze that has dominated the private markets since late last year.
Overall, $20 billion has been raised by startups using “AI” in 2023. (Fun fact: $20 billion could pay the salaries of 307,266 teachers for one year.) But let’s definitely keep making those AI-generated selfies.


So much buzz
Are startups worried about the downturn? We guess it depends on who writes their checks. 
In fact, Bessemer Venture Partners, one of the oldest and more established venture firms in the U.S., earlier this year said it is earmarking $1 billion of its most recent fund solely for investments in artificial intelligence.
And that’s just one firm.
This week we published an interview with Bessemer partner Sameer Dholakia, who aptly said of the AI movement: “Literally trillions of dollars of value gets created when you have these massive tectonic shifts.” 
And what about AI IPOs?
But it’s not all unicorns and rainbows for AI. Just because funding to the sector is hot, that doesn’t mean the appetite on the public markets is at the same level.
If we look at public markets (and we did) it’s clear that an AI focus hasn’t been a recipe for stock market gains. This is evident looking at recent performance of the most highly valued AI-oriented companies to go public in the quarters leading up to the market peak.


Back to the future
Let’s circle back to those trillions that Bessemer’s Dholakia was talking about. While we aren’t seeing the fruit of those hefty AI investments just yet, the promise (or at least the hope) among investors and the journalists that cover them is that these startups will deliver sooner rather than later.
According to Dholakia, the “adoption curve on this one will be mind-blowingly fast.”

eFishery’s $108M Raise And Unicorn Status Proves Aquaculture Is Swimming Upstream,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/05/25,"

eFishery, an Indonesia-based aquaculture startup, raised $108 million in Series D funding, according to Tech In Asia. The company was valued at $1.3 billion, launching the company into narwhal — uh, unicorn status. 
42xfund, an investment management firm in United Arab Emirates, led the funding round, and additional participation came from Northstar Group and SoftBank Vision Fund 2.
Aquaculture startups had its best funding year ever in 2022 when the sector raised $292 million across 42 startups, according to Crunchbase News. The industry has seen a steady incline in venture funding since 2013, when eFishery launched.

The company beganin 2013 as a one stop shop for the aquaculture industry in Indonesia. The company started with a programmable fish farm feeder that dispenses food for shrimp farms and quickly developed disease prevention systems for those ecosystems. 
The company has since expanded, providing an end-to-end e-commerce platform that allows fishers to buy niche products and gear and connects farmers with financial institutions that can provide flexible loans geared towards the fickle nature of aquaculture. The company also has a distribution system that makes it easy for homes and businesses to order fish and get it delivered fresh or frozen.
More importantly, eFishery has an online marketplace that allows fishers to sell their yield directly to distributors and agents, often at a fairer price than most markets. 
The environmental impact
That process is generally better for the environment by promoting fair trade wages for fisheries and lowering the carbon footprint of moving the fish product. 
But fish farming has long been considered an unsustainable environmental practice — certain farmed fish need to be fed wild fish to survive. Creating crowded, overpopulated zones of fish is a breeding ground for disease, and the waste they produce in such a small area can pollute the ocean. In Indonesia specifically, fish farms are partly responsible for mangrove deforestation.
Fishing, in general, has a significantly smaller carbon footprint than land animal agriculture (including products like cheese and dairy), and startups are moving into the space to develop more sustainable and scalable practices in one of the oldest jobs in the world.

Sam Altman’s Crypto Startup Tools For Humanity Locks Up $115M,Chris Metinko,2023/05/25,"

Worldcoin developer Tools For Humanity — co-founded by OpenAI’s Sam Altman — has raised a $115 million Series C led by Blockchain Capital.
The funding also includes previous and new investors including a16z crypto, Bain Capital Crypto and Distributed Global. 
The San Francisco-based startup is building tools in support of Worldcoin, an Ethereum-based token currently in beta. Its World ID platform is attempting to create unique digital identities — based on blockchain technology — for people by scanning their eyes with a small orb.

The startup has raised many questions surrounding AI, data and privacy. While such an identity platform could be useful as AI makes it more difficult to know who or what one is dealing with over the internet, the scanning of people’s eyes to create a digital identity and how that information could be used has raised privacy and data concerns.
Due to its decentralized nature and hopes to create true unique digital identities, Worldcoin also has been associated with being involved in the process of distributing a universal basic income if AI starts to eliminate massive amounts of jobs — something that also has caused debate.
“As we embark on the age of AI, it is imperative that individuals are able to maintain personal privacy while proving their humanness,” said Alex Blania, CEO and co-founder of Tools for Humanity. “In doing so we can help ensure that everyone can realize the financial benefits that AI is poised to deliver.” 
The company did not reveal a valuation, but an earlier report said it was looking to raise money at a $3 billion valuation.
Bucking the trend
While Tools For Humanity may have had a successful fundraise, that has not been the case for most crypto and Web3 startups.
Venture funding to VC-backed Web3 startups plummeted 82% in the first quarter of the year — dropping from $9.1 billion in Q1 of 2022 to only $1.7 billion, per Crunchbase data.
The funding number is the lowest total since the fourth quarter of 2020 — which saw only $1.1 billion — when many people had never heard of Web3.
VC-backed crypto startups saw just more than $800 million invested, the lowest total since more than $600 million was invested in Q1 2020.

Powdered Breast Milk Startups Are A Thing And This One Just Grabbed $3M In Funding,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/05/25,"

What’s a breastfeeding parent to do when the freezer is jam-packed with breast milk and the diaper bag is full of thawing sachets that need to be used up quickly? To preserve the nutrients, make them shelf-stable for years, and store and transport them easily, parents may consider turning their breast milk into powder.
There are a plethora of companies that do this, all with names that convey the seriousness of the matter: It’s My Leche. Boobie Juice. Booby Food.
There’s also BBy, a Y Combinator startup that condenses breast milk into Cheetos powder-like dust (more on this later). The company announced a $3 million seed funding round led by Pioneer Fund with participation from Y Combinator, 7G Bioventures and Cathexis Ventures.

The company turns breast milk donated by lactating parents into a powder for neonatal intensive care units (otherwise known as NICUs). Infants benefit from the nutrients provided by breast milk, but the process of storing, thawing and reheating it on repeat every single day costs hospitals millions of dollars a month.
Vansh Langer, the CEO of the company, started BBy when he was a medical intern at his hospital’s NICU.
“If you think of the last 70 years of hospital innovation, everything has changed in the hospital except for the way we store breast milk,” Langer said. “Why is that?”
Powdered breast milk is reaching the masses
Last month, I watched a Houston-based powdered breast milk startup called Milkify on Shark Tank.
The company demoed its milk-powdering service it claims preserves the nutrients in the milk while keeping it shelf stable for three years. After battling it out with the Sharks, Milkify’s founding couple walked away with a deal with Lori Greiner of QVC fame and actress Gwyneth Paltrow (the product samples touched by Mark Cuban and Barbara Corcoran did not contain real breast milk, fyi).
While this was my introduction to breast milk as a commodity, startups like BBy have been around for a minute.
However, BBy works differently. The company uses a proprietary laser technology and algorithm to spray dry breast milk, much like how Frito-Lay creates its shelf-stable, sterilized cheese powder to dust over Cheetos. But instead of sterilizing the breast milk, BBy’s algorithm keeps the product within a temperature zone to preserve the bioavailability of nutrients.
BBy also currently only works with hospitals, while several other startups primarily cater to consumers. Milkify, for instance, sends parents an at-home kit that comes with a pharma-grade insulated cooler. Processing around five weeks worth of breast milk costs around $475, or $1.60 per ounce. According to the company, some of its customers were able to get their employers to pay for the service.
Between breast milk and formula
Freeze drying is a good option for preserving nutrients, but can diminish breast milk yield by 20% to 30% if it is done in bulk and the temperature conditions aren’t regulated. Freeze drying is often used by direct-to-consumer startups, but can be an expensive endeavor for hospitals. To be clear: freeze drying isn’t bad, it’s just better in certain circumstances.
“No [parent] is going to come to you with a couple thousand ounces of milk at a time,” Langer said. “And if they do, I mean, they are super rich and that’s very rare.”
But the process can be cheaper if more people use that service. BBy itself is working on a self-service kiosk that sits inside hospitals that parents can use to condense their own breast milk.
Powdered breast milk has its promises. The process of shipping and storing liquid breast milk is expensive — it needs to be shipped quickly and in a cold environment. It’s bulky and needs to be stored in freezers. There’s a labor cost here too: Nurses have to spend valuable time babysitting bags of defrosted milk for infants to make sure they don’t curdle.
“Labor hours are completely wasted every day, highly skilled labor that’s essentially watching a water bath to make sure that the milk doesn’t curdle,” Langer said.

"Even With Venture Slowing, Debt Numbers Not Seeing Dramatic Increase",Chris Metinko,2023/05/25,"

Many wondered after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and with interest rates continuing to creep up, if the debt market would turn sour for startups.
It hasn’t turned, but seems to have stagnated.
Despite some recent debt rounds from well-known startups that garnered headlines, VC-backed startups in the U.S. have been raising about $5.5 billion on average through the last few quarters, according to Crunchbase data — which tracks publicly announced debt financing rounds. (It is important to note companies sometimes do not announce debt raises or the exact ratio in equity and debt mixed rounds.)

The recent quarterly numbers are below the second quarter of last year, when the market seemed to hit a high of nearly $11 billion in debt financings right as the venture market was cooling.


However, there have been a handful of eye-catching deals announced this month from well-funded private companies. Those include:

Last week, Oakland, California-based data startup Fivetran received a $125 million loan from Vista Credit Partners, the credit arm of Vista Equity Partners. In 2021 — a very different time in the venture funding world — the company raised $565 million in equity at a $5.6 billion valuation.
Less than two weeks ago, Foster City, California-based fintech Tipalti raised what has been reported as $150 million in credit from JPMorgan Chase Bank and Hercules Capital, which specializes in venture debt. Back in 2021, the startup raised a $270 million Series F funding led by G Squared at a valuation of $8.3 billion.
Earlier this month, Austin, Texas-based 8fig raised a $140 million Series B — which has been reported as $40 million in equity and $100 million in a credit facility. The round was led by Koch Disruptive Technologies and included Silicon Valley Bank, now a division of First Citizens Bank.

Good market, bad market?
Many expected to see an uptick in debt and credit deals as venture dollars started to dry up. But then, of course, interest rates also continued to rise and then just two months ago Silicon Valley Bank — the preeminent bank for startups — dramatically collapsed.
The bank had about $74 billion worth of loans on its books, with about 20% of that being from venture debt, according to those in the industry. Many thought its fall could mean raising debt — especially popular venture debt — would become much harder for many startups and private companies.
However, considering SVB’s collapse is still relatively fresh, it may be too early to fully contextualize its affect. Some recently announced debt raises such as Fivetran’s were completed before the fall of the bank.
“Silicon Valley Bank was the most prolific financing partner to the growth ecosystem, and the full impact of its failure on the broader technology and financial markets remains unknown,” said David Flannery, senior managing director and president of Vista Credit Partners.
However, Flannery said in the wake of SVB’s collapse his firm has seen a mentality shift among management teams about the certainty and availability of venture capital and growth equity moving forward, which is creating more opportunities for alternative financing.
“This is particularly true for lenders backed by a long-term capital base who understand how later-stage software companies operate and can offer tailored debt solutions that align with a company’s growth needs,” Flannery said.
Looking at debt
Later-stage startups do seem to be looking at picking up debt right now as the market continues to shift.
Fivetran had never really considered debt before its raise was announced last week, said George Fraser, CEO of Fivetran. However, the decision was obvious when considering market conditions, he said.
“The macro environment is just very uncertain,” Fraser said. “No one knows where multiples are for late-stage companies right now.”
That uncertainty doesn’t affect just the company, but also its customers, Fraser reminded, adding to the importance of being “extremely well-capitalized.”
Flannery added his firm witnessed record credit deployment of more than $500 million through its direct lending platform during the first half of 2023, including to private companies like Fivetran, Arcadia, Demandbase and Deepwatch.
“Later-stage software companies are increasingly turning to credit and structured debt solutions to continue to drive growth and play offense pending a broader market recovery and the IPO market reopening,” Flannery said.

More Big Money For AI: Insider Raises $105M,Chris Metinko,2023/05/24,"

If AI does not lead venture out of its current slowdown, perhaps nothing will.
A day after investors flooded $700 million into two AI startups — Builder.ai and Anthropic — Turkey-based AI marketing platform Insider locked up another $105 million.
Insider CEO and co-founder Hande Cilingir told Bloomberg the company’s valuation had increased “very much closer to $2 billion.”

The company previously raised a $121 million Series D at a $1.22 billion valuation in March 2022 — first minting it as a unicorn.
The new round was from existing investors, Qatar Investment Authority and Esas Private Equity.
In a space where every investor seems to fear being left behind, Qatar Investment Authority seems determined to not let that happen. The sovereign wealth fund led London-based Builder.ai’s Series D of more than $250 million on Tuesday.
Let’s go shopping
Insider offers a platform that allows its more than 1,200 customers to connect customer data across channels and systems, predict future behavior with an AI-enhanced engine, and provides an individualized customer experience.
The company plans to use the new cash for M&A dealmaking. In January, Insider made its first acquisition, buying Turkey-based messaging platform MindBehind.
“At Insider, we have successfully achieved hyper-growth via organic means, until now. Now, we are looking to achieve unparalleled levels of growth with an M&A-focused strategy,” Cilingir said in a release. “These funds will be used exclusively for the purpose of acquiring exceptional product companies to further complement our technology and create product synergies. 
“Unlike our $121 million Series D investment in 2022, which has bolstered our capital reserves for operational spending in the coming years, this latest round will specifically serve to fuel inorganic growth through M&A,” she added.
Founded in 2012, Insider’s total funding amount is now $274 million, per the company.

How Did ElevateBio Manage To Nab $401M In This Economy?,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/05/24,"

ElevateBio, a Massachusetts-based gene therapy startup, announced on Wednesday it raised $401 million in Series D funding.
The company’s round was led by the AyurMaya Capital Management Fund, a VC fund managed by Matrix Capital Management, which joined Novo Nordisk, SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Samsara BioCapital as part of ElevateBio’s investor syndicate.

“We have made significant strides in scaling our technologies and end-to-end capabilities in our pursuit to become the world’s most indispensable cell and gene therapy technology company,” ElevateBio CEO David Hallal said in a statement.
A fast-growing biotech startup
Boy, did they. ElevateBio, in my opinion, is pretty close to being its own big pharma company. The startup operates a slew of technology platforms that span from drug development to manufacturing and interconnect with one another, allowing ElevateBio to bring a drug from conceptualization all the way to commercialization. It even has a subsidiary, Life Edit, which develops therapeutics for genetic diseases.
But, since it isn’t, the startup has also inked a deal with an actual big pharma company: Novo Nordisk. Life Edit will work with Novo Nordisk to develop a suite of base editing therapies, which is a fancy way of saying they’re making drugs that can make changes to the DNA sequence.
Demand for cell and gene therapies is growing in part due to the promise that by adding genes to the body, or by correcting a defect in a gene, the immune system can fight its way through disease. The concept is pretty novel in that it may allow certain patients to circumvent managing disease on a daily basis.
ElevateBio is in a pretty unique position compared to its peers. Many startups are struggling under the funding environment imposed by close-fisted investors, and have had to slash research and development programs in order to conserve cash and extend their runway.
ElevateBio, in the meantime, has its hand in multiple drug development pipelines. The company also has a partnership with Moderna that was announced in February to develop in vivo mRNA gene editing therapeutics.
It seems like a big week for biotech — the second-largest fundraising round in the space happened yesterday when ReNAgade Therapeutics raised $300 million in Series A funding.

Will The Ripple Deal Create Waves In Stagnant Web3 M&A?,Chris Metinko,2023/05/24,"

Editor’s Note: For more Web3 coverage, please visit Crunchbase’s Web3 Tracker, a site to look at startups, investors and funding news concerning all aspects of Web3, cryptocurrencies and blockchain. Powered by Crunchbase’s comprehensive data, this site will be continuously updated as the next iteration of the internet grows. We hope this data and our analysis serve as resources for readers to track and understand the Web3 landscape and all it encompasses.
Even with crypto prices slowly creeping up, any kind of dealmaking involving blockchain and crypto startups has been slow.

While funding is way down — plummeting 82% year to year, to only $1.7 billion in the first quarter — M&A deals through the early part of the year seem to be lacking punch, per Crunchbase data.


Although M&A deal numbers in the Web3 space are on a similar pace to the past two years, big deals seem to be at a premium.
So far this year, only 16 startups in the space saw an M&A transaction — compared to 44 for all of last year. However, the only deal with a notable announced price tag happened last week, when San Francisco-based Ripple made its first acquisition, buying Switzerland-based Metaco for $250 million in cash and equity.
Where are the big deals?
That deal was the only one to break $100 million this year, whereas previous years have seen a handful of such acquisitions.
For instance, last October About Capital Management bought China-based blockchain asset financial services provider Huobi for a reported $1 billion. About a year before that, India-based Polygon bought scalable cryptocurrency protocol Mir Protocol for $400 million in December 2021.
In the previous two years, there were nine total M&A deals of $100 million or more — including those by large crypto and fintech companies like La Jolla, California-based Silvergate Capital, Vancouver-based WonderFi and Montreal-based Nuvei.
Declining valuations
The drop in big money deals undoubtedly has a lot to do with declining valuations. While every industry has been hit by the slump, it stands to reason Web3 startups in crypto and blockchain were even more significantly affected.
Web3 started to fall out of favor with investors quickly as last year progressed, with over-inflated valuations in a slowing venture market leading many VCs to seek out other, better defined industries and sectors.
Crypto’s instability did not help matters, and when the catastrophic collapse of FTX happened, many predicted doom for all things blockchain and crypto.
However, crypto prices have picked up significantly since the start of this year — with Ether and Bitcoin both up more than 50%. While Web3 applications are still struggling — along with the crypto lending space that led to tumbling digital asset prices last year — investors do seem to have a renewed interest in the “picks and shovels” as they look to build out the Web3 infrastructure layer.
The Ripple deal also is promising for the M&A world. The startup is a large payment provider that uses blockchain — certainly a financial area that will continue to be built out with further crypto adoption.
The value of the deal also could mean some investors see valuations leveling off. This could bring more buyers off the sidelines who were waiting for the market to hit a low.
A strong M&A market is necessary for any sector to thrive — or even survive. If Web3 is going to be a thing the market will need to see an uptick so investors can see future exits on the horizon.

For Web3 funding numbers we analyze investments made into VC-backed startups in both cryptocurrency and blockchain.
