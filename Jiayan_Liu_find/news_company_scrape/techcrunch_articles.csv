Deal Dive: Startups can still raise capital — even if it’s for a good cause,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/07/08,"
When venture funding started to slow in 2022, many feared that investors would retreat to where they were comfortable: SaaS companies founded by folks in their network. And any company that wasn’t posting top growth metrics would struggle to secure funding. While this has largely been true, there have been bright spots. Everytable’s recent round is one of them.
The mission-driven food tech startup looks to make healthy prepared food, including wraps and salads, as accessible and affordable as fast-food chains. The startup prices its menu based on where each individual store is located in addition to distributing through a variety of other channels, including branded vending machines and delivery.
On June 27, the startup announced a $25 million Series C-2 round led by Dohmen Impact Investment Fund, which backs for-profit companies building food solutions to enhance human health, in addition to existing investors. This round will help the company expand its retail footprint; Everytable hopes to open up 25 stores in the latter half of 2023.
This deal is notable for a few reasons — none of which being that it got announced amid the mass VC summer exodus at the end of June. Someone is still working!

"So, how are Europe’s startups doing?",Haje Jan Kamps,2023/07/07,"
Welcome to Startups Weekly. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday afternoon.
I’ve been keeping an eye on the European startup ecosystem since well before I moved to the U.S., and today’s report from Creandum about the state of venture investing in Europe gave me pause. This, along with PitchBook’s report of what happened across the pond last year, adds up to a complex picture.
As far as I can see — and as I discussed in my column this week — the ecosystem in Europe continues to be pretty fragmented and immature, and investment across the pond took a 16% dip in 2022 compared to 2021. That isn’t unique to Europe, of course; 2022 was hard across the board, and compared to the years before, there were very few liquidity events across the startup world:
Data from PitchBook shows that exit values in 2022 were dismal. Image Credits: PitchBook
All around, 2022 was a dismal year: We haven’t seen this little M&A and IPO activity since 2016. The total value of exits in 2022 was $71 billion. The year before, it was more than ten times that.
Bad years happen, but I’m going to keep a very close eye on how quickly the VC markets bounce back. My suspicion is that the U.S. venture industry is more resilient in the face of a slow year or two and that LPs are less easily spooked. In other words, it’s going to be telling to see who raises new funds, where, and with what investment theses over the next three to five years.

Spotify co-creator Daniel Ek’s new company raised a $65 million round of funding for his preventative healthcare startup Neko Health — all the more impressive given that this is reportedly the first external round of financing for the Stockholm-based company.
Lightspeed Ventures made its first investment in Africa, backing Berry Health, which aims to bring judgment-free healthcare to a continent where stigma cuts deep and is affecting many.
News of the fresh rounds comes on the heels of a healthy amount of activity in health tech — Public Ventures launched a $100 million impact fund focusing on nascent life science and clean tech startups, particularly in Canada.

It’s handbags at dawn for social media

If you’ve stumbled across the TechCrunch homepage in the past week, then you’ve seen our wall of coverage on the utter drama-fest that is the social media landscape at the moment. Investment giant Fidelity already adjusted down its Reddit valuation a month ago, but Manish reports that it further deepened its valuation cuts for Reddit this week, after the Reddit protest plunges user engagement.
If you look beyond the Reddit dumpster fire for a fraction of a second, the rest of social media is aflame as well. Twitter competitors soar after Musk makes another boneheaded move, and Paul argues that its competitors need to get their act together in order to become a true competitor.
Apropos competitors, Meta’s Twitter competitor Threads went live and quickly passed 2 million downloads in just two hours, and more than 30 million in a day. I know, I didn’t really see it coming either, but TechCrunch compiled an all-your-questions-answered article about Threads. My first impression? The app isn’t great, but Instagram’s network effect is formidable, and Twitter has been screwing up so monumentally since Musk’s acquisition that it may just be all it takes to put the bird app in its grave.
That’s a pass from us, mon frère: Natasha L points out that Meta’s Threads app is a privacy nightmare and that it won’t launch in the EU yet. This follows a report that a bunch of tech giants are having to figure out how to respond to the EU’s rebooted antitrust regime.
Money didn’t bring API-ness: Ivan ponders what’s happening over at Reddit as the social media site braces for life after API changes.
Lawsuits from a parallel universe: Devin reports that a Louisiana judge silenced White House social media talks in a lawsuit that seems pretty wild. He writes, “It’s almost pitiable how desperately the lawsuit peddles its conspiracy theories, making out routine emails to be collusion and [the] removal of rule-violating content as censorship.” So . . . that’s fun.
Take down those tweets: While we’re on the topic of wild court cases, Twitter was trying to wriggle out of a case in India, but the judge didn’t mince words: “Punishment for non-compliance is 7 years imprisonment and unlimited fine.” Needless to say, Twitter’s plea against India’s government was dismissed, although the core of the case is still curious: Twitter has been asked to take down hundreds of accounts and tweets, often for denouncing the Indian government.
Skynet awakens

AI is everywhere, but never has it been so confusingly head scratching as in the case of Humane’s first product: The Ai Pin. The secretive startup has been around since 2018 and has reportedly raised more than $230 million since then — and I can’t for the life of me figure out why this is better than just saying, “Hey, [voice assistant],” into your nearest smart device. Someone, please, explain it to me.
Did I mention that AI is hot? In the past couple of weeks, I had two founders reach out to me for fundraising advice, only to get back to me a couple weeks later with an “lol, I guess we don’t need help; we just got several term sheets.” The right teams are raising formidable amounts of funds as the FOMO sets in among investors. One example is Typeface, which is building generative AI for brands and just announced a $100 million raise at a $1 billion valuation.
On top of that, one of the wilder stories we’ve seen so far was a founder selling its four-month-old “OpenAI for China” play for $234 million. That means the startup gained about $2 million of valuation per day from starting to acquisition. Yowzers.
Incidentally, if someone wants to share some AI-related decks for my Pitch Deck Teardown series, I wouldn’t be mad.
Yes, this is definitely Bobby’s mother. He cannot come to school today: Ingrid reports that Voice.ai raises $6 million as its real-time voice changer approaches 500,000 users.
Hey, robot, you grab the crayons, I’ll make the coffee: Kyle reports that Runway raised $141 million as it builds generative AI tools for content creators.
We can’t measure this, but it’s definitely 10x better: Over on TC+, Software.com co-founders Geoff Stevens and Brett Stevens argue that the productivity boosts developers see by using AI are a bit of smoke and mirrors — not least because nobody seems to agree on how to measure productivity among software developers in the first place.

Go to the site from one of the blocked states, and you’re met with a video where adult performer Cherie DeVille explains why age verification systems are a bad idea.

"How to identify, interview and hire a head of growth for an early-stage startup",Jonathan Martinez,2023/07/07,"
The waters are never calm when scaling a startup. In fact, they are typically quite choppy. However, by making the correct hire in the head of growth position, you can navigate to shore much more smoothly.
The individual you’re looking for will create and execute growth strategies, manage marketing initiatives and, ultimately, drive revenue. My more informal take on this role is that it’s someone who deeply understands growth fundamentals, has significant expertise in one to two growth pillars and knows how to build an effective team.
I’ll walk you through when and how to hire your head of growth, their archetypes, how this role stands apart from other marketing executive positions, and what to expect from this hire during their first few quarters.
Head of growth archetypes
In my decade of growth marketing, I’ve seen quite a few growth leaders who began at various startups, all possessing varying levels of experience. To make it easier, I’ve grouped these candidates into three major categories, or archetypes:

Generalists: Experience across numerous growth pillars.
Specialists: Deep expertise in one pillar.
Tertiaries: Data, finance/VC, VC or product background.

While I’ve seen members of each category become successful as heads of growth, I strongly advise hiring from either category one or category two for seed to Series B startups.
When building a growth function from zero, it’s vital to have someone who can drive the execution for your early channels and campaigns. When it comes to category three, I’ve only witnessed success after a growth team was already in place, with their efforts centered around optimizing efforts across data analytics and product.
Outside of these three major archetypes, there are two important flavors that are consistent across the groups:

B2B or B2C
Mobile or web

These two flavors can make or break the success of your growth efforts, as their type of marketing is so distinct. Someone coming from an extensive background of web acquisition at a B2B company like Rippling would not be well-suited to run growth at a B2C consumer startup such as Spotify.
Most growth marketers will heavily index in B2B or B2C, as their careers typically stay on that path. However, it’s quite common to see growth marketers who have experience in both mobile and web acquisition, and it’s absolutely acceptable to hire them.
You’ll occasionally find a unicorn who’s a generalist and has experience in B2B, B2C, mobile and web. If you do, recruit them immediately.
Heads of growth come in many flavors. Image Credits: Jonathan Martinez
How to interview
I’m fortunate to have been on both sides of the interview table for head of growth positions, largely at tech B2C startups, so I have a good sense of what makes for amazing interviewees.
Below are example questions to ask and a few case studies I’ve seen work well:
Interview questions:

What are the most important growth metrics for our startup to track?
How would you measure success in our growth efforts?
We’re having issues in our funnel — how would you analyze and optimize?
What do you think our largest growth levers are and why? "
Pitch Deck Teardown: Nokod Security’s $8M seed deck,Haje Jan Kamps,2023/07/07,"
Gone are the days when you needed a developer to build an app for a relatively easy task. No-code and low-code development let you dramatically increase the speed of building and bringing simple (and, sometimes, not-so-simple) apps to market. I swear, half my life is being run by Zapier at the moment: Book a meeting with me, and all sorts of things happen automatically in the background to ensure that our meeting is on the right calendars, is transcribed and the video of the call is stored away and tagged with your company’s name.
The ease of creating apps that low-code and no-code offer has trade-offs, though: In order to work, they need access to some pretty sensitive data. If someone wants access to my data, they could try to hack my email, or they could hack one of the many automations tied to my email accounts. When more and more apps are essentially running on the same underlying architecture and code, they become a very tempting target for hackers and others with nefarious intentions.
Enter Nokod Security, which offers to monitor no-code and low-code apps for security vulnerabilities and mitigate breaches.
The company recently raised $8 million from Acrew Capital, Meron Capital and Flint Capital, and the team was gracious enough to share the (lightly edited) deck they used so we could take a sneaky peek under the hood.

We’re looking for more unique pitch decks to tear down, so if you want to submit your own, here’s how you can do that.

Three things to love
Nokod’s deck has a lot of cool things going on, as well as some stuff that had me pretty confused. As always, I’ll get to my misgivings and OldManYellsAtCloud.gif feedback in just a moment. For now, let’s look at the slides that got me excited.
Give me a T! Give me an E!
Okay, I’m not gonna spell out T-E-A-M in the subhead, but this is an example of a company that knows its strengths. In an early-stage company, a founding team that has an unfair advantage is a straight-up superpower. Nokod has all bases covered on that front:
[Slide 2] Extraordinary founding team. Image Credits: NokodThe two co-founders have both started and exited companies in the cybersecurity space before. That’s a hell of a way to catch an investor’s attention. Relevant experience and successful exits screams “unfair advantage.” Even after just reading this one slide, I was pretty unsurprised that this company successfully raised money.
Apart from the obvious, this slide shows that the founding team understands what’s important in a pitch deck: If you’ve got incredible traction, lead with that. If you don’t, highlight your experienced team.
Well-articulated problem
[Slide 9] An elegant outline of the problem at hand. Image Credits: Nokod.A good fundraising story will have a good explanation of what the problem is and why it might be worth solving. Not everything on this list is well explained. To wit: Do you, without googling, know what PII is, or, indeed, why collection and storage of PII might be a bad thing?
The company could have taken the effort to explain the impact of some of these issues and why low- and no-code apps are particularly vulnerable in these situations, but I get the message in broad strokes: The cost of embracing no-code and low-code is that people might not always know exactly what’s going on, and if something does happen, it can be hard to figure out exactly where the ne’er-do-wells gained entry to a system.
A better go-to-market slide than most
[Slide 16] Let’s sell this thing. Image Credits: Nokod 

			This go-to-market slide has a clear profile of the customer: how they can be reached, what the business model is and where they are geographically. 					


Building a coherent go-to-market strategy can be surprisingly hard. It’s what I end up arguing about with my pitch coaching clients most often. Having some vague, hand-wavy “build it and they will come” theory works when you are focusing on the product, but if you are raising money to acquire customers, you don’t get to shrug and say, “We will figure it out when we get there.” You aren’t getting there. You are raising money to execute, so you are there.
This go-to-market slide has a clear profile of the customer: how they can be reached, what the business model is, where they are geographically and even who the decision-maker is within the business. I’m not sure how many medium-sized companies have a CISO or director of application security. I suspect a lot of the time, these decisions fall to a CTO rather than a dedicated, clearly defined security role.
Still, as an investor, I can look at this and see the outline of a plan. My next question would be: “Okay, talk me through your process. How do you actually land a sale?” The story should be consistent and outline a good sales funnel — something like, “The leads come from X, we reach the decision maker through A, B and C, and then we close the deal 25% of the time. But we suspect we can increase that percentage if we do Y and Z.” An answer like that will pass muster for me, and doubly so if the company already has paying customers and can point to the sales process it used.
In the rest of this teardown, we’ll take a look at three things Nokod could have improved or done differently, along with its full pitch deck!

"TechCrunch+ roundup: J-1 visa details, how to close a Series B in 2023, moving for tax savings",Walter Thompson,2023/07/07,"
Remote-work startups were a hot commodity when the pandemic began, but in the post-vaccine era, many investors and founders are reconsidering their enthusiasm, Rebecca Szkutak reports.
“If I looked at all the companies that are actually categorized as remote work, you’d see this little tip of the iceberg,” said Kevin Spain, a general partner at Emergence Capital. “Below that there are a lot of other companies effectively following and benefiting from that trend.”

Some companies working on hybrid workplace solutions “have pivoted out of the category,” others have reduced staff, and “one virtual office startup recently sold off its IP and transitioned to AI,” wrote Rebecca.
“It’s hard to pin the exact numbers on it,” writes Rebecca, “but there are signs that things aren’t going well for many remote work startups.”

I just found out that I’ve been selected as a trainee in the J-1 exchange program.
I’m currently in the U.S. on a B-1/B-2 visitor visa. The sponsoring company would like me to start in August. I heard it can take several months to change my status to a J-1. Is there a way to get a J-1 faster?
Is there anything I should know about the J-1, particularly if I later decide to stay in the U.S. once the J-1 program ends?

Should you move to a new state for tax savings before selling your startup?
Image Credits: Catherine Falls Commercial (opens in a new window) / Getty Images
Once an acquisition is in the works, it’s natural for founders to start safeguarding their newfound wealth.
“On a $30 million exit, a founder could save approximately $4.3 million by moving from California to Florida or approximately $4.4 million by moving from New York City to Florida,” writes Peyton Carr, managing director of Keystone Global Partners.
“That’s a lot of incentive to pull up the stakes and head to Miami,” but unless you follow state-level guidelines about where you spend time and generate income, “your move is likely to trigger an audit.”

If I were a tech investor, there’s no way I’d sign a non-disclosure agreement.
Presumably, I’d be meeting with hundreds of founders each year. Signing an NDA might preclude me from doing another deal with someone else working in a similar space: why would I ever agree to that?
According to Haje Jan Kamps, entrepreneurs should only ask for an NDA when disclosing “the details of your tech with anyone outside your company.”

“We are not taken seriously.”
“It’s impossible that you can be their equal.”
Dominic-Madori Davis interviewed several Black founders in France to learn more about how they’re working around racism and cultural stereotypes to obtain the same opportunities as their white counterparts.

VC Office Hours: Fabrice do Rego on building one of the few Black-led funds in the EU,Dominic-Madori Davis,2023/07/07,"
Before he became one of the few Black fund managers in the EU, Fabrice do Rego had quite a long career in finance. He started off with Lehman Brothers, before moving to stints at Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, and eventually founding M&A advisory firm Valmeon Corporate Finance.
But during all his years analyzing M&A deals and corporations, do Rego rarely saw people who looked like him in that industry. That realization, he tells me, inspired him to start The Blueprint VC with Ibrahim Ouassari to back founders from under-represented backgrounds in France and Belgium.
For do Rego, the logic behind launching The Blueprint is simple: Mixed teams with diverse backgrounds are known to perform well, yet capital allocation to such teams is still low. “There’s a lot of money being left on the table,” he said. So, he decided, literally, to go get that money.
Launched in December 2021, The Blueprint started raising a €25 million fund last January, which the founders hope to invest in 30 companies within the next four years. They’ve already backed two.
The firm likes to invest in mixed teams of diverse origins, mostly focused on gender and ethnicity. The Blueprint focuses on seed and pre-seed rounds, writes checks ranging from €100,000 to €400,000, and has a reserve for follow-on investments. It’s sector-agnostic but does not invest in deep tech or biotech at the moment.
I recently caught up with do Rego to talk about his work with The Blueprint, surviving the venture downturn and the best way to cultivate the next generation of talent in the EU.
(Note: The following interview has been edited lightly for length and clarity.)
TechCrunch: You’ve been raising this €25 million fund for about a year, with a diversity-focused investment thesis on a continent with noted issues regarding equity and inclusion for marginalized groups. What has the process of approaching limited partners been like?
Fabrice do Rego: It has been much more difficult than what I expected.
We have a great team, and I thought with such a team, it would be easy. But we faced some odd times raising the fund, especially with institutions. Their first question was the “pipeline problem” [asking if there was enough diverse talent to fund in France and Belgium].
Another thing that was difficult is the difference between continental Europe and the U.S. or maybe even the U.K. — we don’t yet have a super strong and wealthy community of Black people who are connected to each other. That is something we lack, and when you want to raise the first fund [for something like The Blueprint], that’s the type of LP you need to have for your first millions.
The minimum target size of our fund is €25 million. Anything below that threshold, it’s super hard to have a professional fund. We wanted our first close to be €12 million, and we will probably reduce it to €10 million because we want to deploy as much as possible, fast. "
Web3 games don’t need to highlight blockchain elements to succeed,Jacquelyn Melinek,2023/07/07,"

Blockchain-based games want to go mainstream, but the million-dollar question is: What’s the best way to do it?
According to some web3 game developers, there might not be just one right answer.
To win Web 2.0 audiences over, it appears the industry will have to meet them where they are. To do that, web3 game devs should move web3 components to the back end and avoid promoting games as being based on web3, according to Sumeet Patel, founder of NFT-based algorithmic prediction game Exiled Racers.
That makes sense to me. When using applications, people don’t really care about what’s going on behind the scenes. They just want something that’s easy to use and does what they want it to. While some people may want to understand the technology and dive deep, the majority don’t really care.
“It doesn’t sound good, but gaming doesn’t need blockchain today, but blockchain does need gaming,” said Nicholas Douzinas, business development and growth lead at decentralized gaming platform Ajuna Network.
The global gaming industry is expected to grow from $282 billion in 2023 to $666 billion by 2030, as more people increasingly choose video games as their primary form of entertainment, and 4G-enabled smartphones enable people everywhere to indulge in mobile games, according to a report by Fortune Business Insights.
But blockchain gaming wasn’t even mentioned as a trend or driving factor for gaming growth. I think that’s fair because it’s such a small fraction of the market and has a long way to go before it can even make a dent in the industry.
“NFTs mean nothing to gaming; some people don’t care about ownership,” said Douzinas. But on the other side of the spectrum, some people want to engage deeply with web3 technology, he noted.
Ajuna Network aims to attract people who are interested in web3 technology and blockchains but are comfortable with owning a token and the possibilities that come with it, Douzinas said.
Not all gaming companies are taking that route. "

Hello and welcome back to Equity, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.
We’re switching things up and bringing you two interviews this week (the first being Alex’s interview with the GPCA’s Cate Ambrose). Now, let’s niche down to another entrepreneur, think about their work and unpack the rest.
Mary Ann took the lead this time, and she sat down (virtually) with Immad Akhund, the CEO and co-founder of Mercury. For those who are unfamiliar, the fintech made headlines earlier this year for how it stepped in to help fill the business banking void left in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse. 
Here’s what the pair caught up on:

SVB’s collapse drove 26K customers to Mercury in 4 months,Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/07/07,"
When Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March, a flurry of startups rushed to step in to help fill a gap in the startup and venture capital community.
One of those startups, Mercury, in particular found itself in the position of trying to meet a sudden surge of demand amidst the panic.
“The craziest time was the first five days,” recalls CEO and co-founder Immad Akhund. “It started Wednesday night — where it was very stressful and not just from Mercury’s perspective, but all of Silicon Valley was holding their breath. People were worried about what was going to happen next.”
Akhund says he spent most of his time those first few days on calls and responding to direct messages from existing and potentially new customers.
“People were very stressed and saying ‘I need a bank account now,’” he says. “Every question had this urgency.”
In response, Mercury — working with partner banks Choice Financial Group and Evolve Bank & Trust — upped its FDIC insurance, first from $1 million to $3 million and then to $5 million. It also released a new product called Vault, so people could park their cash beyond those amounts into U.S. government treasury bills.
Still, one of the questions that kept coming up, according to Akhund, was, “If SVB is failing, why is Mercury safe?” The question was fair, in his view, considering that Mercury itself is a startup.
In the first few days after the collapse, the company saw more than $2 billion in deposits. And in all of March, Mercury saw nearly 8,700 new customers depositing funds into its accounts.
“It was by far our biggest month we’ve had at Mercury, a huge inflow,” Akhund recalls. “We tried to prioritize people coming from SVB and even built some tools so they could connect to SVB accounts.”
But it wasn’t a short-term boom, something that Akhund was worried about.
The company claims that 95% of its net new customers have stayed with Mercury nearly 90 days out from the SVB crisis and that those deposits have held steady. Also, that new customer growth has continued even after the SVB crisis has settled, with the company having doubled new signups per month since April — leading to 17,000 total new customers depositing funds from April to June, a figure that Akhund shared with TechCrunch exclusively. Its total customer base includes businesses such as including Deel, On Deck, Linear, Sprig and Forage. The company says it crossed the 100,000 customer mark in 2022.
That recent surge of customers has contributed to the company’s annualized revenue run rate growing 4x year-over-year from May 2022 to May 2023, Akhund told TechCrunch. Overall, in 2022, Mercury processed $50 billion in transactions. In the first half of 2023 alone, the company has processed more than $42 billion in transactions. Mercury also, he said, has been profitable for the last 12 months. He declined to say how many customers the company specifically has today, saying only that it is “over 100,000.”
Further, according to data obtained from Kruze Consulting, more than 30% of Kruze’s clients now have a Mercury account, up from 17% at the end of February — the highest share of any neobank or bank, according to Mercury.
While Mercury is open to any U.S. business, its focus is on startups and e-commerce companies, which make up 70% of its customer base. Startups in particular, Mercury touts, have unique needs that many claim big banks are unable to adequately meet.
“We were already growing and we saw an approximately 20% jump because of what happened with SVB,” Akhund said. “It’s obviously kind of been an inflection point, and we’ve kind of sped up after this.”
Since its 2017 inception, Mercury has raised over $163 million in funding from investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, Coatue and CRV as well as angel investors, athletes, entertainers and customers. Its last round was a $120 million Series B that was announced in July of 2021.
I dug into all these details and much more with Akhund on Equity Podcast, which you can listen to here.

Reporter’s note: The story was updated post-publication to correct the number of customers that Mercury has.

Google’s Gradient Ventures backs Weflow to bring greater hygiene to Salesforce data,Paul Sawers,2023/07/07,"
Google’s venture capital arm Gradient Ventures has made another foray into Europe, investing as part of a $3.2 million seed round in two-year-old German startup Weflow.
Weflow is the latest in a line of ecosystem startups to emerge from frustrations with using the omnipresent CRM (customer relationship management) software that is Salesforce. These venture-backed upstarts focus on things like providing data backups or improving lead generation, while just last week a new company called Unaric emerged out of stealth with $35 million for the express purpose of buying and consolidating Salesforce-ecosystem startups.
Yes, Salesforce-focused tools are big business, with some estimates pegging the market value at four times that of Salesforce itself.
Weflow, for its part, is setting out to improve sales teams’ efficiency, pipeline visibility and general “Salesforce data hygiene,” according to Weflow co-founder and CEO Janis Zech, who likens his platform to something akin to “Notion for revenue teams.”
“[The main problem we solve is] helping companies to forecast their pipeline accurately — this typically requires capturing sales data, both structured and unstructured, surfacing deal insights and pipeline analytics to run forecast predictions,” Zech explained to TechCrunch.
Show me the data
The ultimate problem that Weflow seeks to fix is that of the sheer spread of data across the B2B sales sphere, spanning the countless meetings, emails and calls leading to a deal’s conclusion. Weflow promises to bring this data together within a coherent structure to deliver insights.
To do this, Weflow has developed what it calls a “revenue workspace,” pitched as an all-encompassing platform that allows companies to capture CRM data while serving up deal insights and tools for managing their sales pipeline. More recently, the company introduced collaborative forecasting and pipeline analytics, too.
Under the hood, Weflow uses AI to allocate what it calls a “deal score,” which is effectively a prediction that considers things like buying signals, sales activities and historical data to forecast the likelihood of a deal closing. In the future, Zech says the platform will also lean on AI to forecast future revenues, as well as leverage unstructured email data and even video/call transcripts to uncover hidden deal insights.

‘Salesforce fatigue’
Although Zech and his two co-founders, Henrik Basten and Philipp Stelzer, launched Weflow in 2021, the Berlin-based startup has been years in the making, built on frustrations Zech experienced at an adtech startup he founded in 2009 called Fyber (then known as SponsorPay).
“Experiencing severe ‘Salesforce fatigue’ at Fyber, we realized CRMs have become clunky infrastructure, not places to effectively work on deals and drive sales performance,” Zech said. “It’s a problem that affects most companies’ top lines.”
Zech eventually sold Fyber for €150 million in 2014, and in the intervening years he invested both as an angel and partner at Point Nine Capital. More recently, he co-founded a startup studio that birthed a company called Back, which Gradient Ventures also invested in before it was acquired by Personio last May.
As for Weflow, there are clear similarities to other tools on the market already, including venture-backed Salesforce ecosystem company Scratchpad, and revenue forecasting unicorn Clari. According to Zech, Weflow’s main selling point over incumbents in the space include per-user pricing transparency (e.g. Clari seemingly only offers a “get quote” button, while Scratchpad invites would-be customers to “schedule a demo”). Additionally, Weflow offers workflow tools such as a task manager, notepad and a Chrome extension to easily integrate with Gmail and Google Calendar.
The Google factor
Securing Google’s VC off-shoot as a lead backer is a major coup for any young startup, opening doors to potential new partners and customers, among other commercial benefits.
While the lion’s share of Gradient’s investments hail from the U.S., it’s no stranger to the European startup scene. Last month, we learned it had invested in Versed, a Dutch startup developing tools to help anyone create video games using generative AI. And last year it backed U.K. insurance tech startup Penny, as well as Germany’s Gigs, which wants to make it easier to launch a mobile network.
Prior to all this, Gradient has also invested in Denmark’s Contractbook, Kaizo from the Netherlands, Finland’s Oura and, as noted, Germany’s Back Technologies.
Prior to now, Weflow had raised $2.7 million in pre-seed funding back in 2021; with its fresh cash injection it said that it’s looking to further invest in its AI efforts, bringing it to other areas of its platform.
Aside from lead investor Gradient Ventures, Weflow’s seed round included contributions from existing investor Cherry Ventures, Hello World and several angel investors.

SpeedyBrand uses generative AI to create SEO-optimized content,Kyle Wiggers,2023/07/07,"
While working at Vetan, a startup helping small- and medium-sized (SMBs) businesses manage employee payroll, Ranti Dev Sharma realized that SMBs often lack the tools to thrive online with organic sales. The cost to hire an agency is beyond their budget, and generating content is costly — both in terms of time and money.
“Having a great online presence is critical for e-commerce stores like Shopify and Woo, as online traffic is the bread and butter of their business,” Sharma told TechCrunch in an email interview. “But existing content marketing solutions are not complete and require search engine optimization (SEO) expertise. Businesses need multiple SEO tools and to hire content strategists, writers and agencies to outsource their content marketing work.”
So along with Jatin Mehta and Ayush Jasuja, Sharma co-founded SpeedyBrand, which aims to bring “high-quality,” affordable SEO content to SMBs using generative AI. SpeedyBrand today announced that it raised $2.5 million in a funding round led by GV (Google’s venture arm) and Y Combinator that values the company at $15 million post-money.
SpeedyBrand’s platform, powered by generative AI, can create custom SEO-optimized content — including websites and social media posts — for brands. Brands first choose a topic. Then they have the platform generate text and suggest images that might be appropriate for the type of content they’re generating.
From SpeedyBrand’s dashboard, generated content can be edited and further customized before being published to various channels. An analytics component allows brands to track the performance of the content once it’s live.
“The economic slowdown requires cost-effective marketing solutions,” Sharma said. “Speedy is well-positioned to help businesses with an affordable solution.”
But there’s reason to be wary of the tech.
For one, generative AI, no matter how good, can — and does — run amok. Thanks to a phenomenon known as “hallucination,” AI models sometimes confidently make up facts. And, as a result of biases and other imbalances in their training data, text-generating AI can spew toxic, wildly offensive remarks.
In another potential problem for brands, generative AI has been shown to plagiarize copyrighted work. One study found that an indirect predecessor to ChatGPT, GPT-2, can be prompted to “copy and paste” entire paragraphs from its training data.
Then there’s the matter of generative AI spamming up the internet. As The Verge’s James Vincent wrote in a recent piece, generative AI models are changing the economy of the web — making it cheaper and easier to generate lower-quality content. Newsguard, a company that provides tools for vetting news sources, has exposed hundreds of ad-supported sites with generic-sounding names featuring misinformation created with generative AI.
Sharma asserts that SpeedyBrand isn’t a content mill — and that it takes steps to mitigate any toxic content that the platform’s AI might generate. SpeedyBrand’s AI can be personalized to brand tone and generates provably “plagiarism-free” content, he claims, incorporating feedback from content edits to improve future output.
To what extent is all this true? It’s tough to say without a third-party audit. But brands, no doubt eager to jump on the generative AI train, appear to be embracing SpeedyBrand.
The company, which has a six-person team, has around 50 paying customers and over 1,000 users. Annual recurring revenue stands at $100,000, and Sharma anticipates that it’ll reach $1 million in the next year.
That’s impressive considering the competition. SpeedyBrand faces off against Typeface, which recently emerged from stealth with $65 million in venture capital. Startups like Movio, Copysmith, Copy.ai, Sellscale, Jasper, Omneky and Regie.ai, too, are using generative AI to create (ostensibly) better marketing copy, imagery and even video for ads, websites and emails.
It’s a large and growing market. Statista reports that 87% of current AI adopters are already using, or considering using, AI for improving their email marketing. Another report projects that the market for generative AI will be worth more than $110 billion by 2030.
Given that almost half of SMB owners handle content marketing themselves, there’s even stronger incentive within that cohort to adopt tools that could — at least on the surface — save time, money and massive headache.
“Speedy saves a company’s marketing workforce hours of marketing hustle — from strategy to content generation and then posting,” Sharma said. “Speedy gives them and their team hours back every day so they can focus on the core of their business.”
With the proceeds from the funding round, SpeedyBrand plans to roll out additional tools for text and image generation.

Indonesian aquaculture startup eFishery nets $200M at unicorn valuation,Catherine Shu,2023/07/07,"
After reports that it is raising new funding, Indonesian aquaculture startup eFishery announced today that it has netted $200 million in a Series D. The company, which makes a smart feeding system for fisheries, says this makes it the first startup in the global aquaculture industry to pass a $1 billion valuation. Its goal is to reach one million aquaculture ponds in Indonesia by 2025 and expand overseas.
The funding was led by Abu Dhabi-based 42XFund and included participation from Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan), Malaysia’s largest public sector pension fund, Swiss asset manager responsibility and 500 Global. Existing investors Northstar, Temasek and SoftBank also returned for the round, with Goldman Sachs acting as an exclusive financial advisor to eFishery. TechCrunch last covered the startup when it announced its $90 million Series C in January 2022.
eFishery cites a study by the Demographic Institute of the University of Indonesia (LDUI) that showed in 2022, eFishery contributed 1.55% to Indonesia’s gross domestic product in the aquaculture sector. This is significant because Indonesia has the second largest fishing and aquaculture industry in the world, ranking only behind China. According to the World Atlas, the country produces 5.8 million tons of fish each year.
Founded in Bandung, West Java in 2013 by CEO Gibran Huzaifah (pictured above), the fishery currently serves 70,000 fish and shrimp farmers in 280 cities across Indonesia. In addition to its IoT auto feeding system, eFishery’s platform includes marketplaces for selling fish and shrimp feed to farmers, fresh fish and shrimp products to B2B consumers and financial products for fish farmers.
Huzaifah started a catfish farming business when he was still in college. He told TechCrunch that during that time, he learned that feed management is crucial because 80% of total cost production is allocated to feeding. But many farmers still do hand feeding, resulting in uneven sizes of fish because not all get the same amount of food.
This is a problem because buyers have specific sizes of fish they want to purchase. Underfeeding isn’t the only problem, however — overfeeding results in nutrient runoff that pollutes water.
Huzaifah saw how tech was disrupting sectors like commerce, financial services and media, but “fish farming practice never changed in the last 30 years. I found it quite ironic that many innovations are developed to solve issues for urban citizens, like online shopping and food deliveries, but the essential sectors, such as agriculture and aquaculture, see almost zero digital innovation.”
After developing eFishery’s smart feeding system, however, Huzaifah faced resistance from fish farmers. After months of convincing them, “they finally wanted to try, not because they believed in the technology but because they pitied me.” One reason was that many farmers were not regular internet users. “I remember we had this Internet 101 with the farmers,” Huzaifah said. “We showed them how to create an email, use Facebook, get information from YouTube and other stuff.”
Even though Indonesia’s aquaculture is already very large, Huzaifah said it has only reached 7% to 9% of its total potential. Some challenges it faces includes fragmentation. Huzaifah explains that Indonesia has 34 provinces with different business practices, so it has to localize for each one.
“I learned the hard way that we have to respect the local players, including using local dialect and building relationships with the middlemen,” he said. “In one case, some middlemen poisoned our ponds. After having a discussion with them, we understood that they just want to do business, that they’re also entrepreneurs. So we found a way to turn them into our local partners because they have the local wisdom, connections assets and so on.”
At farms, feeding accounts for 70% to 90% of total production cost and much of it is still done manually, just as when Huzaifah was running his catfish farm. eFisheryFeeder automatically distributes feed to fish and shrimp and helps farmers control feed by sensing fish appetite through vibrations, which increase as they get hungry. The system allows farmers to manage ponds from their smartphones and collects data like daily fish usage, the type and brand of feed, how many fish have been produced, fish behavior and appetite, stock density and mortality rate.
With aquaculture so important to Indonesia’s economy, other tech startups are addressing different aspects of the industry. In addition to eFishery, startups that have recently raised funding include Aruna, Delos and FishLog.
In order to improve Indonesia’s aquaculture industry and increase the amount of fish it exports, Hazaifah said communities, the government and institutions have to work together to improve fishery operation infrastructure so they can handle larger volumes of fish and improve product quality.
The country should encourage sustainable aquaculture practices, like training, promoting advanced techniques and ensuring access to quality fish seed, to increase fish production, and also engage in trade negotiations to get more buyers. efishery plans to expand overseas by exporting fully traceable, antibiotic-free shrimp.
In a statement about the funding, 42XFund principal Iman Adiwibowo said, “The technology and comprehensive aquaculture solutions provided by eFishery have made a significant impact on the aquatech industry and have benefited small farmers in Indonesia. We are confident that eFishery will continue to promote a sustainable and inclusive economy, as well as contribute to environmental preservation goals not only in Indonesia but beyond.”

"Deel under fire for alleged questionable hiring practices, advice to other companies",Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/07/06,"
A California Senator is urging the state’s Labor and Workforce Development Agency to conduct an investigation into the business practices of fintech turned HR startup Deel.
Last week, Senator Steve Padilla (D-San Diego) sent a letter to Stewart Knox, California Secretary of Labor, alleging that Deel has hired hundreds of employees but classified them as independent contractors. By doing so, Senator Padilla charged, Deel is “effectively denying them the full suite of employment and social safety net benefits and labor protections they are entitled to, including healthcare, retirement, unemployment insurance, worker’s compensation, collective bargaining, and overtime pay.”
Further, Senator Padilla claimed that Deel “appears” to be advising its own customers (which include the likes of Nike, Subway, Reebok, Forever 21 and Klarna) “to misclassify their own employees and evade taxes in California,” as well as avoid paying employee benefits. Earlier this month, according to Padilla, Deel CEO Alex Bouaziz encouraged companies to leverage “the different ways of employing someone or assigning them as an independent contractor…..and therefore don’t put as much tax liability into your company.” He also encouraged companies to “spend some time on this topic” and offered to provide this as a service, stating “we can do that for you.” 
TechCrunch reached out to Deel for comment and Elisabeth Diana, a company spokesperson, provided the following statement:
“These allegations are completely made up and regurgitated from old news, most likely based on competitor hearsay. Compliance is literally what we do, in over 120 countries. We have to understand it for our customers, and we certainly practice it ourselves. Today we have over 50 compliance experts in house and an external network of country advisors. To advise clients on how to misclassify their workers would be at complete odds with our business model. We’ve also created a consortium with external academics called the Deel Lab for Global Employment to study and help prevent misclassification practices. In California we engage a handful of contractors for services, and in the US, contractors represent less than 1% of our workforce. Claims of misclassification there are ridiculous. Unfortunately Senator Padilla did not reach out to us for comment or facts prior to publishing his letter. We welcome speaking with him directly to provide factual information.”
The spotlight on Deel’s hiring practices came to light earlier this year when Insider published an article revealing, among other things, that even CEO and co-founder Alex Bouaziz was classified as an independent contractor. According to Senator Padilla, several employees “have reported being shocked to learn they had been hired as long–term contractors despite originally applying as full-time employees, and without the ability to choose.” Senator Padilla’s office told TechCrunch that the politician has asked for an investigation to determine if the practices mentioned in the article are accurate.
Many of the company’s employees, he said, have access to a range of benefits, including unlimited paid-time off, wellness stipends and reimbursements for gym memberships and doctor’s appointments. But, Senator Padilla alleged, they “continue to be denied the full suite of employment and social safety net benefits and labor protections they are entitled to, including healthcare, retirement, unemployment insurance, worker’s compensation, collective bargaining, and overtime pay, among others.”
“No company is above the law. Deel has been openly flaunting their violation of California labor laws, intentionally misclassifying their employees as independent contractors and denying them critical benefits,” said Senator Padilla in a press release. “California is clear on this issue; employees are entitled to benefits and protections. Corporations engaging in malicious employment schemes like this need to be held accountable and these employees need to see their rights restored.”
In January, TechCrunch reported that Deel had reached $295 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) by the end of 2022 and that it was profitable, according to Bouaziz. The startup, which offers global payroll and other services to companies around the world, was valued at $12 billion at the time of its last raise, although its current valuation is not known. It operates with a SaaS business model, meaning that it charges a subscription fee for its software.
Bouaziz and Shuo Wang started remote-first, San Francisco-based Deel in 2019 as an employer of record (EOR) — with the mission of allowing businesses to hire employees and contractors in other countries “in less than five minutes.” Deel also says that it gives companies the ability to pay teams in more than 150 currencies with “just a click.” It has since evolved its strictly fintech model to what it describes as a “full-stack,” “truly global HR platform” designed “to compliantly manage your entire workforce in just one system—from direct employees to international workers and everything in between.” It has more than 2,000 employees in 90 countries. 
Senator Dave Cortese (D-San Jose), chair of the Senate Labor, Public Employment and Retirement Committee, stated that an independent contractor is “a specific designation for self-employed people or businesses engaged in contract work.”
He added: “It’s not a gimmick for organizations to avoid paying for employee healthcare and other benefits or reducing their tax liability…Any company found breaking the law will be brought to justice, and they would certainly have no business advising other companies on labor law.”
Reporter’s note: TechCrunch was informed after this article was published that  Stewart Knox, California Secretary of Labor, had responded to Senator Pedilla’s letter with his own letter saying: “I take seriously the responsibility to ensure that workers receive their earned pay and benefits and that law-abiding employers compete on a level playing field. We are looking into the information that you provided and will follow up with our findings.”

So, how are Europe’s startups doing?
Pitch Deck Teardown: Nokod Security’s $8M seed deck



Whenever I spend time in the European startup world, a lot of the conversation is focused on how it can differentiate itself. One of the recurring questions is: How do we build a startup ecosystem? That’s an excellent question.
The beginnings of an ecosystem are there, but unlike in the U.S., where there are a handful of major hubs attracting the bulk of the talent and investment, in Europe, there is an appetite for experimentation that fails to fully settle into a coherent whole.
Looking to Silicon Valley might be a trope, but the San Francisco Bay Area is by far the most mature ecosystem around. California attracted more than $100 billion of venture investment in 2022. New York is in a distant second place with around $30 billion, followed by Massachusetts (or more specifically, Boston), with around $20 billion. Europe, in comparison, saw around $100 billion of investment in 2022. That sounds like a big number, but compare the size of the economy of Europe versus that of California.
Europe may be in a state of rapid growth, but as an asset class, VC is lagging behind. For every person living in Europe, $134 dollars are invested in the local ecosystem. For California, the same number is $2,650. Image Credit: Haje Kamps / TechCrunch
You can find office buildings and fast internet in most places, so how did a sprawling area around San Francisco become a working ecosystem? The history is long and complex, and hard to replicate: Stanford University engineering professor Frederick Terman was focusing on radio engineering in the 1940s. Fueled by the Cold War and a lot of defense money, he built a department and taught a bunch of the people who would found the first wave of tech startups in the area.
Stanford created a business park to go along with its research activities, and it kept evolving with the times. The region found itself in an upward spiral: More money invested meant that more engineering talent flocked to Silicon Valley, which sparked more innovation, which led to more tech companies, which in turn meant more defense money and the first few private investors looking to Silicon Valley for opportunities. Lockheed opened a plant in Sunnyvale, mostly because that’s where it could find engineers. Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard founded HP in 1939, and Shockley Semiconductors was founded in 1956 — the same year its namesake, William Shockley, was awarded the Nobel Prize for co-inventing the transistor. Early employees at Shockley left to found AMD and Intel, and from there, the rest is history: Silicon Valley had such a concentration of funds, talent and tech, that it was almost unstoppable.
Fast-forward some 70 years and Silicon Valley has only continued to grow. For startups, the way this shows up is that a lot of people got very wealthy from tech, and they further accelerated the ecosystem by founding new companies. But — crucially — they also became angel investors and advisers to others in the ecosystem. And because those acquiring other businesses are also often based in Silicon Valley, integrating the tech and the staff becomes a lot easier.
So how does this relate to Europe? Well, according to top European VC Creandum’s recent report, there are 65 cities hosting 514 “tech hubs” on the continent. Of course, it’s positive that the European startup scene is evolving and growing, but even after a couple decades of trying to make ecosystems thrive, Europe appears to be spinning its wheels. According to the report, “Europe finally has the pieces in place to challenge the US as the world’s leading tech ecosystem.” It sounds good, but there’s still a lot of work to be done before there’s a fully functioning, self-sustaining startup ecosystem in place. The truth is, every locale is trying to do it differently. That means there can’t be a single, force-of-nature strength ecosystem; instead, the result is a smattering of promising ecosystems that don’t truly get the job done.

15 investors lift the lid on the biggest surprises of H1 2023,Karan Bhasin,2023/07/06,"
The first half of 2023 hasn’t been kind to startups, but venture capital investors weren’t spared migraines either. Some VCs had a tough time of it, with their portfolio companies finding it hard to fundraise, while others dialed back their investment cadence to match the current investment climate. But what would they have done differently if they had a crystal ball? To find out, we asked 15 investors what they found to be the most unexpected trends of the year so far.
Rather unsurprisingly, the biggest surprises all seem to be related to AI in one way or another. Several investors said while they were caught unawares by how quickly generative AI took off, the real eyebrow-raiser was VC funds going from a conservative stance to jumping headfirst into AI-related companies’ cap tables seemingly overnight.
“The No. 1 surprise has been the speed of financings and valuations in the generative AI space. Probably no surprise there. But it really is a tale of ‘haves and have-nots’ in fundraising right now,” said Matt Murphy, partner at Menlo Ventures.

We’re looking for founders to participate in a TechCrunch+ survey about the usefulness of various founder-focused events.
If you’re a founder and have something to share about your experiences at such events, fill out this form.

Jenny He, founder and general partner at Position Ventures, had a similar take: “I was surprised at how quickly the AI boom happened in 2023 and how many top tier firms went from a wait and see approach at the end of 2022 to becoming very active in 2023. Some of our portfolio companies went from quiet insider rounds to very hot competitive rounds at a rapid markup at the beginning of 2023, spurred by the AI boom.”
Not all AI-related surprises were positive, though. John Tough, managing partner at Energize Ventures, was baffled by how readily some firms cannibalized their climate funds to buy into AI. “We knew generalist investor interest in climate was fleeting, but it has still been surprising to see how many household names planned to launch a climate focus area and then moved along to LLMs and AI instead,” he said.
For Rajeev Dham, partner at Sapphire Ventures, this rapid increase in AI investment also brought some worries. “There’s no question that advancements in AI will spawn an incredible set of companies, disrupt industries and be the transformative technology that drives far more productivity within existing companies, but my concern is that we’re still in the very first inning, which will lead to a lot of lost capital,” he said.
It wasn’t all about AI, though. Mark Grace, an investor at M13, was surprised by the range of early-stage valuations: “Valuation ranges are all over the place, especially at the Series A stage. We all know how quiet the later stages have been, and the seed market has seemed strangely resilient. However it has been interesting to see the wide variance in Series A pricing.”
As for what investors wish they’d done differently, several felt they should have been faster on the uptake and more active than they were. “In macro environments like this one you always regret not being more active while everyone else was fearful,” said Logan Allin, managing partner and founder at Fin Capital. “These cycles only come around so often and are a boon for net-new investments in portfolios.”
Jason Lemkin, CEO and founder of SaaStr, wishes he had taken the time to meet with more founders. “I slowed down in 2022 as did many, and should have picked it up more. Multiples are still relatively low in SaaS but great companies are being formed as often as ever.”
But our favorite answer to this question by far came from Howie Diamond, managing director and general partner at Pure Ventures: “Not have personally invested in First Republic Bank stock!”

We’re curious if you’ve run into any surprises in the startup investing world thus far in 2023.

The No. 1 surprise has been the speed of financings and valuations in the generative AI space. Probably no surprise there. But, it really is a tale of “haves” and “have-nots” in fundraising right now.
The No. 2 surprise is the scarcity of later-stage companies raising. It’s not that surprising, but behind the scenes, companies are still getting their houses in order, and it’s really difficult to sell right now, so companies are grinding through things until they find more predictability.
No. 3 would be the amount of M&A and companies trying to be acquired. We’re only going to see that accelerate.
In hindsight, what do you wish you had done differently in the first six months of 2023?
We mobilized the entire firm around GenAI and it paid off. We’ve got a strong portfolio and continue to invest. We’ve even got a handful of investors who are attending hackathons and coding in their free time. I only wish we’d started building that pipeline more purposefully in 2022. So many of these businesses are being started by founders leaving companies with pockets of AI talent, so you really need to be focused upstream on founders before there is even a full twinkle in the eye. We have been doing a great job of this so far, and really doubled down on Menlo’s Future Founders program this year.

We’re curious if you’ve run into any surprises in the startup investing world thus far in 2023.
Startup investing in 2023 has been defined by difficult macroeconomic headwinds on one hand and accelerating AI tailwinds on the other. The dichotomy has created a startup investing environment of haves and have-nots that has been quite interesting and, to some extent, surprising.
I’m surprised that the AI conversation is not centered more on the potential of AI for good. There are intractable problems that society has yet to solve where AI could offer a breakthrough. Technology has a history of presenting these types of breakthroughs and thus has been a harbinger of optimism.
AI is no different, and I see education as a prime example of where AI could offer every child individualized instruction that addresses their style of learning, pacing needs, and adaptive modalities. This could advance education practices for all learners and provide the inalienable right to education for all offered by a good society.
I’m obsessed with thinking through these types of scenarios and working on them, as AI will offer many breakthroughs for the world.
In hindsight, what do you wish you had done differently in the first six months of 2023?
While we spent time on it, we wish we had spent even more time with academics and researchers at top-tier institutions focused on AI. We believe a good subset of the AI generation’s decacorns will originate from deep technical research, much of which is in academic research labs today.

Should you move to a new state for tax savings before selling your startup?,Peyton Carr,2023/07/06,"

How much tax will you owe when you sell your company?
With a Section 1045 rollover, founders can salvage QSBS before 5 years



For company founders and shareholders with an exit on the horizon, this isn’t a myth — a move for tax reasons can make a lot of financial sense.
In tech hubs like the Bay Area and New York City, the highest tax brackets are at 14.4% (as of January 1, 2024) and 14.8%, respectively. In contrast, states like Florida and Texas have no state income tax, meaning there’s no capital gains tax at the state level.
Let’s consider the numbers: On a $30 million exit, a founder could save approximately $4.3 million by moving from California to Florida or approximately $4.4 million by moving from New York City to Florida. That’s a lot of incentive to pull up the stakes and head to Miami.
However, many times it’s not that simple. We all know that moving can be a tough decision, especially for those with strong roots in their community. Leaving behind your favorite golf course, local ski mountain, and your friend group can have a serious impact on your quality of life. And it can be heart-wrenching to pull your kids away from the home, friends, and school they know and love.
This is where some people can get into trouble.
What you need to know about moving to save on taxes
Paying less in taxes isn’t as simple as packing up, skipping town, and resurfacing with a new address in a tax-friendlier state.
As tempting as it may be, you can’t keep a foothold in Silicon Valley while dipping your toe in the Gulf Coast — and still save on taxes. The kids may be unable to stay in their Manhattan private school while you relocate to Miami.
 

			As tempting as it may be, you can’t keep a foothold in Silicon Valley while dipping your toe in the Gulf Coast — and still save on taxes.					


Living in both states won’t save you here; when it comes to taxes, you must be all-in at your new address, or you’ll likely owe taxes at your old address.  Unfortunately, some may not realize this until after they have spent a lot of time, money, and emotional investment.
Every state has its own rules for determining your residency for tax purposes, and you will not be able to fly under the radar if you’re a high-net-worth individual or top earner. High-tax states like New York or California pay especially close attention to those in the highest tax bracket. If you stop paying taxes at the state level, chances are the state will notice and challenge your new residency claim.
In other words, your move is likely to trigger an audit.
In particular, California’s Franchise Tax Board is known to be vigilant in monitoring individuals who attempt to terminate their California residence, making it all the more crucial to thoroughly plan and document your move.
Additionally, it’s important to consider the complexities of community property laws, which may impact your tax exposure if you have a spouse residing in California, even if you move to a lower-tax state. Proper legal and tax advice is essential to navigate these complexities and ensure a smooth transition.
Many people mistakenly think that splitting time between states and claiming the more favorable tax jurisdiction is easy. But when you have the means to travel and maintain more than one home, this doesn’t mean you get to choose the domicile that works most favorably for you when tax time comes. Simply spending 183 days of the year outside your high-tax state isn’t likely going to shrink your tax obligation.
Even after leaving high-tax states like New York or California, it’s important to be aware of potential tax obligations tied to passive income sources within those states. For example, if you continue to have passive income from partnerships, investment properties, or other sources within New York or California, you’ll need to file a nonresident return and pay taxes on that income in those states.
Additionally, having passive income sources in your former state can increase the likelihood of a residency audit. As a result, it’s important to carefully consider whether retaining those investments producing state-specific income aligns with your overall financial and tax planning goals.
Preparing to move
If you’re considering a move to a lower-tax state, it’s crucial to plan ahead and be prepared. The more time you give yourself before your company’s exit, the better off you’ll be. We recommend making a clean break from your high-tax state several years in advance to ensure a smooth transition. It’s also wise to assume that you may be subject to a state tax audit, so keep meticulous records and be prepared. "
Is political unrest taking a toll on Israeli startups?,Anna Heim,2023/07/06,"
Now that the first half of 2023 is officially behind us, we are going to get a flurry of data on VC investment around the world. This will allow us to paint a global picture and zoom in on countries where specific factors might be at play.
Today, we are looking at Israel by way of a new report from Israeli VC firm Viola. It offers data on how much capital Israeli startups raised in H1 and how that compares to previous years. But its authors also venture a few hypotheses on the reasons behind this decline.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

Both on my mind and on Viola’s, of course, is the political crisis Israel finds itself in since the beginning of 2023.
After the Netanyahu government announced its intent to overhaul the country’s judicial system and balance of powers, a series of anti-government protests have continued across the country.
Israel’s tech ecosystem didn’t stay out of the political unrest; entrepreneurs and investors have become key players behind anti-government protests. And more generally, concerns have emerged on the damage that could be done to the country’s economy, of which the tech sector accounts for a significant part.
With this in mind, let’s look at the data compiled by Viola to see how VC investment into Israel fared this year so far — unfavorably — and what might explain its decline.
It’s not looking good
With a provisional tally of $3.2 billion for the first half of the year, funding activity in Israel dropped by 73% compared to the same period in 2022, IVC data shows.
PitchBook data interpreted by Viola reveals a 50% year-on-year decline globally, meaning that Israel fared worse than the rest of the world. And $3.2 billion is also less than Israeli tallies in years prior to 2022.
Unsurprisingly, Israeli startups raised less in the first six months of this year than in the same period of 2021 ($13 billion). In the country, like elsewhere, 2021 was an outlier. But H1 2023 also falls short of H1 2020’s $5.7 billion total. It also fails to meet pre-pandemic levels; in H1 2018 and H1 2019, Israeli startups collectively raised $3.7 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively.
Breaking down the data by stage reveals that the latest and largest rounds are the most affected. The amount of capital that Israeli startups raised through mega-rounds fell by 80% compared to the first half of 2022; growth rounds amounted to 71% less year-on-year; and early-stage rounds saw a 56% decline.

DigitalOcean acquires cloud computing startup Paperspace for $111M in cash,Kyle Wiggers,2023/07/06,"
DigitalOcean, the cloud hosting business, today announced that it’s agreed to acquire Paperspace, a New York-based cloud computing and AI development startup, for $111 million in cash.
DigitalOcean CEO Yancey Spruill says that Paperspace’s infrastructure and tooling, once integrated with DigitalOcean’s products, will enable customers to more easily test, develop and deploy AI applications. As for Paperspace customers, they’ll benefit from DigitalOcean’s cloud services, he says — including databases, storage, app hosting, documentation, tutorials and a robust support system.
For now, Paperspace will remain a standalone business unit within DigitalOcean, and Paperspace customers won’t see immediate changes to their service.
“We’re excited to expand our portfolio tailored to the world’s small- and medium-sized (SMBs) businesses and startups with simplified AI and machine learning offerings,” Spruill said in a press release. “The combined offerings allow customers to focus more on building applications and growing their businesses and less on the infrastructure powering them.”
Paperspace was co-founded in 2014 by Daniel Kobran and Dillon Erb, graduates of the University of Michigan. Backed by Y Combinator and Jeff Carr, one of the co-founders of DigitalOcean, the company runs its own datacenters with custom-configured GPUs.
Paperspace initially focused on low-cost virtual machines, providing high-performance workstations for design, visualization and gaming in the cloud. But as AI entered the mainstream, Paperspace leaned hard into its AI offerings, launching a suite of tools designed for developing, training, deploying and hosting AI models in the cloud.
Prior to the acquisition, Paperspace raised $35 million from investors including Battery Ventures, Intel Capital, SineWave Ventures and Sorenson Capital.
Erb sees the acquisition as a step toward a comprehensive offering of cloud CPU and GPU compute to rival other vendors in the public cloud market. The combined power of DigitalOcean and Paperspace, he asserts, will let a new class of customer — particularly those on a tight budget — delve into AI- and machine learning-driven apps like generative media (e.g. OpenAI’s DALL-E 2), large language models (e.g. ChatGPT), recommendation engines and image classifiers.
“DigitalOcean is renowned for simplifying complex cloud technologies and making them more accessible to developers and business alike,” Erb said in a canned statement. “We’re thrilled to join forces with DigitalOcean, as we believe there’s no better company to unlock the endless possibilities of AI and machine learning for developers and businesses alike.”
The Paperspace acquisition is DigitalOcean’s first since 2022, when it bought Pakistani cloud hosting service provider Cloudways for $350 million, and its fourth since its public stock listing in 2021.
From the outside looking in, it’s a wise move for DigitalOcean, which risks being left behind in the surge for cloud AI and machine learning solutions. While the company’s revenue increased in Q1 2023, growing 29.7% to $165.13 million, earnings per share, return on equity and net margin fell short of expectations.
Increasingly, Big Tech cloud providers like Microsoft, Amazon and Google are turning to generative AI to boost revenues — with some success. A recent CNBC poll found that AI is now the biggest spend for nearly 50% of top executives across the economy, indicating it’s a wise place to invest resources.
Driven by the enthusiasm for AI, Gartner predicts that cloud spending will grow 21.7% in 2023, coming in just under $600 billion this year versus $491 billion last year.

SoftBank backs Japanese robotics startup Telexistence in $170M funding round,Kate Park,2023/07/06,"
SoftBank is backing Japanese robotics startup Telexistence, making good on the tech giant’s recent pledge to go back on the investment offensive in light of the current AI hype.
Tokyo-based Telexistence said Thursday that it has raised $170 million (23 billion yen) in a Series B round of funding from SoftBank, Airbus Ventures, Monoful Partners, KDDI Open Innovation Fund, a fund set up by Foxconn and CTBC Financial Holdings, and Globis Capital Partners. With the latest round, Telexistence has raised a total of approximately $193.5 million (27.5 billion yen) since its inception.
Founded in 2017, Telexistence develops AI-powered robotic arms for the retail and logistics industry. Last year, the company said it would deploy its robots in 300 FamilyMart convenience stores across Japan.
The company will use its fresh capital to bolster its workforce globally, CEO Jin Tomioka said in a statement. But aside from the funding, Telexistence is also announcing a strategic partnership with SoftBank Robotics Group, a unit of SoftBank Group, to ramp up its commercialization in North America. Telexistence is currently in talks with major convenience store chains in North America to conduct proof of concept in the near future, according to the company. Moreover, the startup said it will work with Foxconn to produce its next-generation robot, called “Ghost.”
SoftBank Robotics Group’s Kenichi Kent Yoshida, and Globis Capital Partners’ Ryohei Nomoto will join Telexistence’s board of directors as a result of their investment.
SoftBank has been more than a little bullish about investments in the robotics realm, having backed California-based Bear Robotics back in 2020. Via the SoftBank Vision Fund 2, it has also made investments in Shanghai-based Keenon Robotics, which specializes in developing service robots, and Opentrons, a medical testing robot developer.

A comprehensive list of 2023 tech layoffs,Alyssa Stringer,2023/07/06,"
Last year’s techwide reckoning continues. In 2023, layoffs have yet again cost tens of thousands of tech workers their jobs; this time, the workforce reductions have been driven by the biggest names in tech like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo, Meta and Zoom. Startups, too, have announced cuts across all sectors, from crypto to enterprise SaaS. 
The reasoning behind these workforce reductions follows a common script, citing the macroeconomic environment and a need to find discipline on a tumultuous path to profitability. Still, tracking the layoffs helps us to understand the impact on innovation, which companies are facing tough pressures and who is available to hire for the businesses lucky to be growing right now. It also, unfortunately, serves as a reminder of the human impact of layoffs and how risk profiles may be changing from here. 
Below you’ll find a comprehensive list of all the known layoffs in tech that have occurred in 2023, to be updated monthly. If you have a tip on a layoff, contact us here. If you prefer to remain anonymous, you can contact us here.
The running total of layoffs for 2023 based on full months to date is 201,860, according to Layoffs.fyi. Tech layoffs conducted to date this year currently exceed the total number of tech layoffs in 2022, according to the data in the tracker.

Big Tech corporate venture capital 🤝 generative AI startups,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/29,"
As the race to build generative AI tools for the enterprise devolves into a battle royale, Big Tech companies are busy wielding their most powerful weapons: checkbooks.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

Earlier today, Typeface raised $100 million at a $1 billion valuation, mere months after a $65 million round in February. It’s something to think about considering the company was founded in 2022. But even though we are once again seeing rapid-fire venture rounds at unicorn valuations, the investor list in Typeface’s round is worth noting.
Salesforce Ventures led the round. The CRM and cloud giant recently launched a $500 million fund to invest in generative AI startups, so its presence in this deal is not a complete shock, but the SaaS pioneer had company: Both Alphabet (through its GV investing arm) and Microsoft (through its M12 investing effort) invested in Typeface.
That’s a strange set of bedfellows: Salesforce and Microsoft have competing CRM products, and Microsoft and Alphabet compete in, to pick a few areas, search, productivity software, and public cloud infrastructure.
The Typeface cap table engenders a simple question: Where else are major corporate venture capital (CVC) investors putting their money to work?
To get a feel for the situation, I listed deals from a number of historically active CVC arms of major tech companies. Turns out, the Typeface round is funny for its internally competitive investor list, but it isn’t an outlier at all when it comes to Big Tech dollars flowing into startup accounts. The majors are busy these days. "
Speakeasy is using AI to automate API creation and distribution,Ron Miller,2023/06/29,"
Just about every developer wants to create APIs to help other companies connect to their services more easily, but creating and documenting an API is a time-consuming process. Speakeasy, an early-stage startup, wants to make that an easier and more automated set of activities.
Today, the company emerged from stealth with a $7.6 million seed investment.
Speakeasy co-founder and CEO Sagar Batchu describes his startup as an API infrastructure company, and that means it’s building tools to make it easier to create and distribute APIs, something that is near and dear to him as a developer himself. “We’ve started by working on an important problem to me, one that I’ve faced a lot myself as a developer, which is really dramatically simplifying how developers are able to ship APIs to end users,” Batchu told TechCrunch.
He sees APIs giving developers a kind of superpower. “As developers, APIs allow us to take advantage of another company’s capabilities. And so making it really easy to ship those APIs to developers means that we can really help companies accelerate how their products are adopted, as well as we reduce the burden on developers when they integrate with those APIs,” he said.
While the goal is to build a platform of features eventually to help with that mission, the company is starting with two tools, one to help developers create the APIs, and one to help their users implement them more easily.
The first piece is called Managed SDKs. Developers provide an Open API spec, and Speakeasy uses AI to help build a complete API for you along with the necessary documentation, reducing the amount of time it takes to complete a task like this to minutes.
“Speakeasy uses AI to validate and enhance the spec, creates SDKs in the most popular languages, and publishes automatically to package managers. It takes minutes to set up, and SDKs are updated every time the spec changes – saving developers significant time,” the company explained.
The second piece is designed to help the developer end user implement that API without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure, creating a package using HashiCorp’s popular Terraform tool.
“With Speakeasy, API producers can, for the first time, easily create and maintain Terraform providers from an OpenAPI specification – dramatically reducing engineering burden, while unlocking an entirely new developer community,” the company said.
The startup currently has nine employees, but is hiring engineers to help build out the platform further. As he builds the company, Batchu believes being remote will help him find a more diverse workforce. “So first of all, I think about how adopting a remote-friendly hiring philosophy means that we’ll be able to access more places, more diverse communities. It’s definitely something really important to us. And as we move forward, we will be looking to hire great talent from everywhere,” he said.
Today’s round was led by GV with participation from Quiet Capital, Flex Capital, StoryHouse Ventures and Firestreak Ventures. Last year the company raised an additional $3.3 million in a pre-seed round led by Quiet Capital with participation from a host of prominent industry angel investors.
The Managed SDK piece is generally available starting today. The Terraform piece is available in beta.
"
Level wants to back your fund — and your portfolio companies too,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/06/29,"
In 2023, funds of funds (FoFs) are on track to raise the smallest amount of money in more than a decade. At the same time, muted venture deal activity has many firms ditching their follow-on funds. Despite these twin trends, a new emerging manager is looking to find success with a fund that targets both.
Level Ventures has raised $104 million for its debut fund, a data-driven, three-pronged investing strategy that uses in-house algorithms to back other emerging managers, invest in promising companies from those managers’ portfolios and source deals of its own.
Albert Azout, the co-founder and managing partner at Level, told TechCrunch that the fund is based on an opportunity in the market he noticed when working as a partner at Cota Capital.
He said that many family offices — his own included — were seeing strong returns by backing small and emerging VC funds and enjoying further success by co-investing alongside those firms in their portfolio companies. He decided to launch Level to see if that strategy could prove successful as an institutional investing approach when driven by data.
“We wanted to disrupt the LP side of the equation,” Azout said. “Most LPs, even fund of funds and institutions, tend to underutilize technology. We wanted to build something that was tech-enabled that allowed us to better understand the ecosystem.”
The first key to getting the strategy to work, Azout said, was finding the right fund managers. Level is targeting emerging managers focused on sectors including enterprise automation, deep tech and life sciences. Within those categories, the firm taps its in-house data model that scores firms based on areas like how many board seats a firms’ investors are on, who they are connected with online and where they are investing.
“We spent a lot of time really making sure that our fund manager selection is optimal,” Azout said. “A lot of the early iterations of the technology was building a model and approach that would yield the top quartile of managers. But the dispersion of performance across early-stage managers is very large. Trying to find the best funds is a moving target.”
The firm looks to back funds that are less than $150 million in size that are either pretty institutional — maybe on fund two or three — or are a solo GP who brings more than just capital to the table. So far, Level has backed firms including Air Street Capital, Emergent Ventures and Work-Bench.
From there, the firm looks to use its data capabilities to keep tabs on underlying portfolio companies to unearth which startups make sense for Level to invest in when they raise their next round. Level also gives its portfolio of funds access to the data it uses.
Level’s approach to build data solutions to source and find companies puts it squarely in line with trends that have begun to gain steam in venture. An increasing number of firms are looking to build algorithms to uncover deals they would have missed otherwise or that wouldn’t have crossed their radar.
“We are seeing more and more firms adding automation and data to their sourcing process. It gives you alpha,” he said. “If you don’t have data capabilities, you will be disadvantaged from a sourcing perspective.”
But the firm doesn’t 100% leave it up to the data. Azout said that while the data is great to narrow down the field, there is always a human in the loop, proving how much people drive this industry.
What makes Level distinct from the other firms looking to add data is that for the majority of its direct strategy, the data isn’t helping it cast a wider net to find a better set of companies. Rather it mainly helps it find the most successful startups from the investors they are already backing. While this does set the firm up to potentially get a double homerun if a company ends up as a notable success, it also means failures will be two-fold, at least for the companies it backs with its own funds.
The firm currently has an even mix of investments in both funds and companies, but for its second fund will skew that ratio 75% toward funds and 25% toward companies. For now, it hopes this strategy helps unlock the best of both fund and direct investing.

"After aperitif ambitions sour, Haus is back on virtual shelves via The Naked Market",Christine Hall,2023/06/29,"
Haus, an aperitif company that tried to find a buyer last year after investor funding dried up, now has one.
The Naked Market, founded by Harrison Fugman and Alex Kost, has acquired certain assets of the low-ABV (alcohol by volume) beverage company from CPG Holding Co. and is now relaunching a few of Haus’ customer favorites, including Citrus Flower, Pomegranate Rosemary and Grapefruit Jalapeño.
Helena Price Hambrecht and then-husband Woody Hambrecht, launched Haus in 2019, and it quickly grew a following with millennials looking for beverages with all-natural ingredients, fun flavors and direct-to-consumer delivery.
When asked about the sale, Price Hambrecht told TechCrunch via email, “I am very glad to see the brand live on. I will always be incredibly proud of what we built, and look forward to seeing what the new owners will do with it in this next chapter.”
Fugman and Kost told TechCrunch that they did not know the Hambrechts prior to the purchase. The opportunity to grab select consumer-facing assets of Haus, including the brand and the intellectual property, stemmed from their experience in the space owning brands like Rob’s Backstage Popcorn and Flock Foods, and their own history as Haus customers.
“Given our background as foodies and operators in the food and beverage world, we were admirers of the brand and business that Helena and Woody created,” Fugman said. “We viewed Haus as one of the most iconic brands that’s been built in the industry over the past decade. Very few brands had an impact on the industry and consumers.”
Though the global beverage market is huge, it’s also kind of a small world. Both Haus and The Naked Market share a mutual investor, Great Oaks Venture Capital, though Fugman noted the VC firm was not involved in the acquisition.

Haus, a VC-backed aperitif startup, is up for sale after Series A falls through

How Haus lost its buzz
By 2022, the company was seeing $10 million in revenue and had a national distribution deal. It also attracted venture investors, raising $17 million on rolling SAFE notes from a group that included Homebrew, Haystack Ventures, Coatue, Shrug Capital and Worklife Ventures.
However, Haus was not immune to pandemic-related challenges, including supply chain woes and word-of-mouth not growing as intended.
“It was difficult to build the business that I wanted to build during the pandemic considering we were building a social product,” Price Hambrecht told TechCrunch at the time. “We didn’t have people gathering, we didn’t have natural word of mouth. We were a purely digital growth brand during that time, great for acquisition but not good for monitoring long-term behavior.”
Price Hambrecht chronicled the company’s journey on Twitter, and in August, after additional investor capital didn’t come through, told followers that Haus would go through a process called Assignment for Benefit of Creditors, an alternative to bankruptcy, which is where assets are put into a trust for the purpose of liquidation or distribution to pay off debts. Any assets left over go back to the debtor.
In November, Price Hambrecht updated that the sale did not lead to a buyer, tweeting, “Today the banker running Haus’ sale process informed me that the auction has concluded, and the company did not sell. Candidly, I did not expect this. He said this was a surprise to him as much as it was to me.”

“Haus 2.0”
Meanwhile, financial terms of the Haus asset acquisition were not disclosed, however, an interesting part of the deal includes plans by The Naked Market to give 5% of the company back to previous Haus employees, founders and investors through a structured program. Usually it is investors that are prioritized, and Fugman and Kost said this move is meant to show appreciation to those who worked hard to build Haus.
“The Haus community was really one of the main pillars of the brand, and this is our homage to continuing that community,” Kost said in an interview. “We thought this was a gesture to help continue that spirit as we look into Haus 2.0.”
As part of that new chapter, Fugman and Kost brought in Sonoma winemaker Micah Wirth, whose LinkedIn profile said he had been Haus’ general manager since January, to continue leading winemaking and R&D efforts. The aperitifs will continue to be sold online, and future plans include taking Haus into new categories within the food and beverage space by the end of the year.
Fugman and Kost say they ultimately want to continue the community, product quality and transparency aspects that Haus began four years ago.
“We plan to take these core principles and build on them while continuing to scale Haus’ key hero SKUs and expanding them into a new category,” Fugman said. “We have unbelievable respect and admiration for the product that Helena created and have decided to bring that back to the market.”

Halo.Car launches remotely piloted rental car deliveries in Las Vegas,Rebecca Bellan,2023/06/29,"
Halo.Car, a startup that uses remote operators to deliver rental cars to a customer’s door, has launched driverless operations in Las Vegas.
Driverless operations mean something different for Halo than they do for autonomous vehicle companies like Cruise or Waymo because Halo’s vehicles aren’t capable of self-driving.
The startup’s fleet is kitted out with a suite of six cameras, modems, antennas and other components to send data back to remote pilots at a Halo operations center. Those pilots then use the video and sensor data that’s streamed in to remotely drive the vehicles. Once a remote driver completes a car delivery, they hand over control of the vehicle to the customer and move on to the next vehicle awaiting remote delivery or collection.
Halo has been delivering vehicles to customers in Las Vegas using teleoperations for around a year, but a human driver has always been present in the front seat for safety reasons. Now Halo cars will be delivered to customers with no drivers in the vehicle.
This is an important step toward achieving Halo’s vision of on-demand vehicles being economically viable, according to Anand Nandakumar, founder and CEO of Halo.
That said, Halo isn’t at the stage where it’s hitting positive unit economics just yet. The company will still use a remote chase car that tails behind the remotely piloted vehicles initially. The driver of the tail car can stop the remotely piloted vehicle and take over if needed.
The tail car also acts as a buffer vehicle in case the Halo car needs to stop, thus preventing a potential rear-end accident with other road users. Halo’s cars will come to a stop if the system detects an anomaly, which means they meet Nevada’s minimal risk condition for AVs that says vehicles must be able to stop if there is a malfunction in the system.
Halo says it will ditch the tail car over the next year based on how the current operations perform. That’ll happen in phases across operation zones and depending on the times of day, according to Nandakumar.
While Halo might be the first company to successfully deliver remote-piloted EVs to customers in Las Vegas, it’s not the only one attempting such a feat. In December 2022, Arcimoto, the maker of the three-wheeled electric Fun Utility Vehicles, teamed up with Faction to develop EVs that can be delivered to a customer’s hotel through a combination of low-level autonomy and tele-assist technology.
Halo’s announcement Thursday comes after six months of intensive testing and training internally, says Nandakumar. The startup had originally targeted the end of 2022 for its driverless launch, but delayed in order to ensure the system’s safety.
“As we’ve seen in the rollout of AVs, there are a lot of scenarios to solve for when the vehicles don’t have a driver inside,” said Nandakumar, perhaps nodding to the many incidents of Cruise and Waymo robotaxis stopping in the middle of traffic and impeding traffic. “We want to make sure that our deployment causes minimal public disruption, and of course, is absolutely safe for all road users.”
That’s why connectivity is so important to Halo.Car’s business model. The vehicles are remotely piloted over T-Mobile’s 5G network, with AT&T and Verizon used for backup. Halo developed an algorithm that allows the data streams to use whichever network connection is strongest at any given time in order to ensure reliable, high-quality streaming and low latency.
Starting Thursday, Halo’s driverless vehicle deliveries are available in downtown Las Vegas between the hours of 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., and will expand to more areas of the city in the coming months. The startup’s fleet of 20 vehicles is made up of Chevy Bolt EVs and Kia Niro EVs, according to the company.
Halo says it plans to grow its fleet in Vegas to hundreds of vehicles before expanding to new cities in 2024.
“Our transition to driverless deliveries marks a significant milestone for us as a company. It proves that our remote-piloting technology is not just innovative, but commercially viable and ready to be scaled up,” said Nandakumar in a statement. “As we prepare to expand and launch new markets, our mission remains unchanged: to provide affordable, accessible, efficient EV transportation.”

Why Halo is betting on a remote-operated car-sharing service

Why does it seem like every startup is a SaaS company?,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/29,"
If you read enough startup coverage, you’ve noticed that no matter the part of the economy that an upstart tech company is attacking, there’s a pretty darn good chance that it is doing so through software. Software that the startup hosts and charges a recurring fee for customers to access or lever. Software as a service, in other words, or SaaS.
The reasons for this are manifold, but important to grok. First, software empowers. Workers can do more and more quickly with software than they could with pre-digital tools. Second, software is nearly impossibly flexible. It can fit everywhere all at once, solving myriad issues and improving output more generally wherever it lands. And third, software tends to have very attractive economics. This is doubly true for SaaS companies, which not only feature software-styled gross margins, but have recurring revenue to boot.

Enterprise SaaS companies continue to navigate a complex economic environment

That makes SaaS startups valuable in the abstract, as their core output — recurring revenue — is very valuable. Naturally, then, investors that want the most bang for their buck, and founders that want to dent the world with as much gusto as possible, tend to gravitate towards funding and building SaaS startups.
It’s not boring, we promise! To prove that to you, here is a smattering of recent coverage of the wide world of SaaS from TechCrunch+ from the last few weeks. (You can snag TechCrunch+ access here if you still need it!)

Snowflake and Databricks are massive SaaS business, one private and one public. Sure, they do not fit precisely into the Salesforce-style SaaS model of yore, but they offer software as a service and are also battling it out today to build the most fit-for-market enterprise LLM stack. And they are growing at a nearly bonkers clip as well. A great pairing to watch if you care about super-late startups in general.
SaaS startups are not all multi-billion dollar behemoths. Some are quite small. One such startup is Rubber Ducky Labs, which is building tech to help other companies improve their recommender systems. This isn’t tech that you would purchase as a consumer, but Rubber Ducky really does want to affect consumer purchases.
Broadening our lens a bit, let’s talk about vertical SaaS. The idea is simple: Find a particular business category, and build a tailored software solution for those companies. By picking a particular market segment, startups can go deep and build something that resonates. Some folks think that vertical AI is the “next logical iteration of vertical SaaS,” which is both an interesting hypothesis, and one that we agree with.

There’s so much more. Gusto is now doing more than a half-billion dollars in annual revenue while the HRtech space is itself maturing into a massive market. And all the while, the value of software revenue is slowly rebounding, rebuilding confidence in the SaaS model for startups once again.
It’s not all sunshine and roses, mind. During the 2021 tech and venture boom, a number of private-market investors overpaid for startup equity leading to some tough decisions in recent weeks. If it’s tough time for some venture players, it’s a tougher time for certain founders.
But one thing is clear: Even if SaaS evolves into a more on-demand model of selling, managed software services are going nowhere but into more places of our economy. And onto more venture capital betting books.

Social trading app Shares receives EU stock trading license,Romain Dillet,2023/06/29,"
Fintech startup Shares has raised $90 million for its stock trading app. And yet, the service is only available to people who live in the U.K. But that’s about to change as the company has received a couple of authorizations from French regulators. With EU passporting rules, Shares could also expand to other European countries.
As a reminder, Shares lets you trade stocks with no minimum trade size. The company offers fractional shares, which means that you can start investing with as little as £2. It competes with other neobrokers that try to make stock investment more accessible, such as Freetrade in the U.K., Bitpanda and Trade Republic in Europe.
But what makes Shares different from other mobile trading apps is that there’s a social twist. Shares lets you follow your friends and comment on their trades. Users can also create private chats and subscribe to communities of more experienced investors. So far, Shares has managed to attract 150,000 users in the U.K.
Shares just received the accreditation to operate an investment service in France from the ACPR (Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution), France’s financial regulator. And the company plans to take advantage of this license sooner rather than later as it plans to launch Shares in France starting next month. At first, you’ll need an invitation to create an account though.
France’s financial markets regulator (Autorité des marchés financiers) also recently granted the PSAN status to Shares — the startup is now officially a digital assets service provider in France, meaning that it will be able to handle crypto trades as well.
“We are very pleased to receive these authorizations: PSAN registration for cryptocurrencies, and PSI license for trading in stocks and ETFs. This is the reward of an extremely rigorous team effort, of which we are extremely proud. Shares is now regulated by the French regulator and this marks a decisive step in our journey, and allows us to announce our EU launch in July by invitation to our first members,” co-founder and CEO Benjamin Chemla said in a statement.
As you can see, today’s news is going to pave the way for future market expansions in the European Union.

Cyware lands $30M to modernize cybersecurity operations,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/29,"
Cyware, a startup developing products to help enterprises modernize their security operations, today announced that it raised $30 million in a Series C funding round led by Ten Eleven Ventures. Advent International, Zscaler, Emerald Development Managers, Prelude and Great Road Holdings also participated, bringing Cyware’s total raised to $73 million.
Cyware was founded in 2016 by Anuj Goel and Akshat Jain. Goel previously led efforts to research and implement ways to overcome silos within large security teams at companies including Citi. Jain came from Big Tech companies like Oracle and Adobe, where he specialized in building distributed systems.
With Cyware, Goel and Jain say they saw an opportunity to integrate threat intelligence with threat hunting, vulnerability and incident data through prebuilt workflows.
“An effective and proactive security posture relies on a multidimensional approach,” Goel told TechCrunch in an email interview. “When it comes to proactive threat response, it’s critical to connect the dots and quickly respond to a suspicious attack. The more accurate and faster the response to a threat, the less of an impact it has on an organization.”
So where does Cyware come in?
As Goel describes it, Cyware’s platform offers both no-code and low-code capabilities designed to help security teams automate their various threat-combating applications. Via collaboration components, teams can share threat intelligence in real time — with any luck, heading off attacks before they wreak havoc.
Extending the collaborative element, Cyware hosts a network that connects enterprise security teams with each other and with third-party threat data providers. This, Goel says, allows teams to receive threat intel, such as information about vulnerabilities, directly from security vendors, software providers and vetted tech companies.
On trend, Cyware uses AI to extract information from threat intelligence data, score the severity of threats and cluster similar threats together — ultimately combining all the data to generate a report with key insights. Cyware’s AI also provides code suggestions for security orchestration and generates detection rules and signatures that can be dropped into existing threat detection systems.
“Our solutions are built to handle volume and scale, enabling large security teams to effectively operationalize actionable threat intelligence while automating response actions without compromising on performance and speed,” Goel said.
Cyware, which has over 200 employees, doesn’t plan to grow its headcount anytime soon. Goel stressed that this isn’t cause for alarm, pointing to a growing customer base that spans Fortune 1000 companies, government agencies and regulatory bodies.
The fundraising is a testament to Cyware’s strength in a relatively weak market. According to Crunchbase, in the first quarter of 2023, cybersecurity venture capital funding dropped 58% year-over-year while deal flow dropped to 149 deals — the lowest total in years and a 45% drop from Q1 2022.
“Cyware’s platform is designed to reduce repetitive tasks for threat intel and security operations analysts, automate taking intelligent actions to proactively prevent attacks and deliver the right information to the right people at the right time,” he said. “CISOs and other C-suite managers benefit from consolidated dashboards and reports of threats, incidents and response actions, as well as the ability to action information quickly.”
Goel says that the proceeds from the Series C will be put toward expanding Cyware’s go-to-market efforts, market presence, channel business and strategic partnerships.

B Garage raises $20M for its warehouse inventory drones ,Kate Park,2023/06/29,"
B Garage, a San Jose-based startup building autonomous drones along with software to track warehouse inventory, said today that it has picked up $20 million in a Series A round of funding. 
New investor LB Investment led the Series A funding with participation from Ignite Innovation Fund, Krossroad Partners and existing backer SoftBank Ventures Asia. The proceeds, which bring the total amount raised by B Garage to $30 million, will enable the outfit to further develop and commercialize its drones and grow its engineering and business teams. 
The startup was founded in 2017 by Aiden Kim, a former software engineer at Oracle. Kim, who holds a PhD in aeronautics and astronautics from Stanford University, also previously participated in dog robot research at Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL), collaborating with Boston Dynamics for hardware development. (His team focused on creating artificial intelligence software for the dog robot research, Kim said.)
While studying for the doctoral program, Kim realized the lack of startups in the autonomous flight field, and he first came up with an idea in 2017 to build a company offering autonomous flight technology for drone manufacturers. After meeting industry experts in the U.S. in 2019, Kim shaped his plan to develop drones and management software for automated warehouse inventories. What he learned from the industry experts at the time was that industries like agriculture and logistics faced labor shortages, Kim told TechCrunch. 
“[Most] B2B logistics warehouses in the U.S. are far from urban areas and face a severe labor shortage,” Kim said. “The autonomous drone technology could be highly suitable for B2B logistics warehouse inventory management.”
B Garage’s mission is to address the labor shortage issue in those sectors by utilizing artificial intelligence and autonomous technology. 
The company has worked on a proof-of-concept pilot test with Kenco Innovation Lab, a unit of Kenco Logistics, for the last few months. Now it is planning to deploy its drones to more than 10 select Kenco warehouses across the U.S. by the end of 2023. It is also working with Incheon Port Authority in South Korea, aiming to commence the project by the year-end.
Companies like Verity, Gather AI and Corvus Robotics have also raised funding for their inventory drones. B Garage has tried to set itself apart from its rivals with four features: full autonomy that covers multiple aisles, no additional infrastructure required, mapping-free operation and automatic battery swapping.
B Garage’s drone can “navigate through multiple aisles, providing comprehensive coverage of warehouse spaces,” Kim said, adding that many other drone solutions are limited to specific paths or single aisles.

On top of that, users don’t need to integrate additional technology to operate drones with their warehouse infrastructure, so there are no extra charges. Competitors typically require an initial fee and ongoing operating costs for installing markers or beacons (indoor GPS) throughout the logistics warehouse and regularly updating the mapping, the CEO explained. 
Another differentiator, the startup claims, is the automatic battery swapping facility. 
“Our drones are equipped with advanced battery technology that enables efficient battery replacement,” Kim continued. If the drone’s battery runs out, the drone automatically returns to its dedicated battery swapping station, which replaces the depleted battery with a fully charged one from its inventory of pre-charged batteries in a matter of minutes. 
B Garage plans to continue enhancing its software solutions with the goal of integrating with its hardware to apply its technology to industries beyond logistics, such as defense and security, according to the company.
It also aims to introduce ground robots for inventory management, Kim said when asked about its plans. The ground robots will allow the startup to cater to a broader range of customers, providing comprehensive solutions for inventory management across various sectors, Kim explained.

Material Evolution raises $19M to decarbonize the cement industry,Paul Sawers,2023/06/29,"
In the industrial world, cement is about as omnipresent as materials get. But despite its clear and obvious utility, cement is responsible for some 8% of global CO2 emissions — if it was a country, it would be third biggest emitter globally, by some estimations.
While cement’s ubiquity comes largely down to how easy it is to produce and the relative cost, creating cement is hugely carbon-intensive due to the amount of energy required to make it. And this is something that U.K. startup Material Evolution is seeking to address with a new low-energy manufacturing process that it says requires zero heat.
Founded in 2017, Material Evolution today announced it has raised £15 million ($19 million) in a Series A round of funding to scale production of its low-carbon cement, which it says has an 85% lower carbon-footprint than normal Portland cement.
While Material Evolution is officially incorporated in the U.S., where it initially intended as its first target market, the company operates substantively out of the U.K., where its founders and team of 20 are based, and also where its entire product development takes place.
There are numerous companies out there trying to address cement’s carbon problem, including young upstarts such as Carbon Re and Carbonaide, both of which have recently raised venture capital (VC) cash. But Material Evolution points to its own proprietary technology as a key differentiator. Rather than using the energy-hungry kilns that are typical of cement making, the company says it uses an “alkali-fusion” process to produce cement at ambient temperatures, from various “industrial wastes and feedstocks,” circumventing the need for fossil fuels.
When Material Evolution talks about “alkali-fusion,” it’s essentially referring to a process based on similar principles to that of nuclear fusion.
“Fusion technology has been hailed as the way to meet humanity’s energy needs for [the next] millions of years, whilst emitting no carbon dioxide or greenhouse gases,” Material Evolution co-founder and CEO Dr. Elizabeth Gilligan said in statement.
The company says that its material is already used within industry, enabled in large part by a strategic partnership with materials company SigmaRoc, which is also a strategic investor in Material Evolution’s Series A round.
The company’s Series A was led by Kompas VC, with participation from Norrsken VC, Circle Rock, and SigmaRoc.

"Typeface, which is building generative AI for brands, raises $100M at a $1B valuation",Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/29,"
In 2022, Abhay Parasnis, the former CTO of Adobe, founded Typeface, a generative AI startup focused on enterprise use cases. With it, he hoped to leverage generative AI — which at the time was just beginning to come into vogue — to deliver personalized content for brands at scale.
Typeface, thanks in part to the hype around generative AI, caught on quickly, attracting Fortune 500 customers within its first year as well as partnerships with Salesforce and Google Cloud. And — perhaps more importantly — it won over investors, who this week injected hundreds of millions of dollars into the startup.
Today, Typeface closed a $100 million Series B round led by Salesforce Ventures with participation from Lightspeed Venture Partners, Madrona, GV (Google Ventures), Menlo Ventures, and M12 (Microsoft’s Venture Fund). Valuing the startup at $1 billion, the tranche brings Typeface’s total raised to $165 million.
Parasnis says that the new capital will be put toward expanding Typeface’s platform and growing the company’s team.
“Enterprise leaders are telling us across the board that they want to embrace generative AI, but they need a solution that meets their unique requirements and is ready for the enterprise,” Parasnis said via email. “They require an AI platform that keeps up with the lightning-fast pace of innovation and feels like a natural extension of their brand. They also need the assurance that their valuable proprietary content remains secure and confidential while seamlessly integrating into their existing workflows.”
The Typeface platform consists of three key components, Parasnis explained — the first being a content hub where users can upload assets and guidelines for “on-brand” text and image generation. The second, called Blend, uses AI to train and personalize content to a brand’s voice and style. As for the third, Flow, it provides templates and workflows designed to integrate into existing apps and systems.

Using Typeface, a content marketing manager could generate an Instagram post — or at least a product shot and caption — to promote the launch of a new product using brand-approved wording and assets. Or a demand generation manager at a business-to-business software-as-a-service company could repurpose an event video into a blog post, draft a follow-up email to attendees and more.
“We provide enterprises with a suite of secure, self-serve solutions that empower any employee to produce on-brand content from their content workflows,” Parasnis said.
There’s no shortage now of companies in the generative AI space. (See Jasper AI, for example, which also recently raised $125 million at a $1.5 billion valuation.) So what makes Typeface different?
For one, Parasnis makes the case that Typeface places a greater emphasis on brand governance, content safety and privacy than most of its competitors. The platform provides dedicated AI models for each customer, ostensibly ensuring that their assets and activity remain private.
What’s not entirely clear is whether Typeface’s models — and the content they produce — could be subject to legal challenges down the line. Pending cases against popular AI art tools Midjourney and Stability AI allege that they infringed on the rights of millions of artists by training their tools on web-scraped images. Meanwhile, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has yet to issue clear guidance on copyright protections for AI-generated works.
Parasnis isn’t anticipating headwinds, asserting that Typeface customers own all the assets they generate on the platform.
“Every part of the enterprise needs compelling, personalized content to drive results, and that too, more at a rapid pace,” he said. “Typeface revolutionizes the way enterprises deliver content, empowering every facet of the organization to drive exceptional results with unprecedented speed.”
It might not matter — for now. The risks don’t seem to be dampening the enthusiasm around generative AI. According to a survey by FreshBooks, 25% of business owners say that they’re currently using or testing generative AI tools while two out of three say they’ll try generative AI for work within the next 12 months.
VCs aren’t shying away either, clearly. According to a PitchBook report released in March, venture firms have steadily increased their positions in generative AI, from $408 million in 2018 to $4.8 billion in 2021 to $4.5 billion in 2022. Angel and seed deals have grown as well, with 107 deals and $358.3 million invested in 2022 compared with just 41 and $102.8 million in 2018.
“With a significant demand among enterprises for personalized generative AI, we must rapidly expand our platform and continuously innovate to meet enterprises’ distinct needs,” Parasnis said. “Moreover, we will expand our exceptional team with deep AI, software-as-a-service and enterprise marketing expertise to enrich the value we offer to our growing community. This funding serves as the catalyst for a robust product roadmap and go-to-market expansion, empowering enterprises to effortlessly generate personalized content at every customer touchpoint, safely and from within their existing enterprise workflows.”

India’s startup funding slides 68% after Tiger and SoftBank make virtually no deals,Manish Singh,2023/06/29,"
Indian startups experienced a significant contraction in funding in the first half of 2023 as some kingmaker late-stage backers quelled new investments in the South Asian nation amid a slowdown in the broader public market.
The first six months of 2023 saw Indian startups raise a mere $5.46 billion, a substantial 68% decline from the $17.1 billion during the same timeframe in 2022 and a drop from $13.4 billion in H1 2021, as per data from market intelligence agency Tracxn shared with TechCrunch.
This year has thus far failed to yield any fresh unicorns in the Indian startup ecosystem, a stark contrast to the 18 new entrants to the billion-dollar club in H1 2022 and 16 minted during the corresponding period the previous year.
The funding drought is permeating startups across different stages. A total of 325 seed funding deals were struck in H1 2023, a dramatic fall from the 936 in the same period in 2022 and 921 in H1 2021, according to Tracxn’s data.
Other early-stage funding rounds, chiefly Series A and Series B, dwindled to 108, compared to 296 and 211 in the equivalent periods in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Late-stage funding also suffered, slumping to 36 deals from 137 and 114 during similar periods the prior years.
The slowdown comes as many late-stage investors, previously prolific backers of Indian startups, have taken a step back. Tiger Global has done just one deal in India this year, according to Tracxn and Crunchbase, whereas SoftBank (which deployed over $3 billion in India in 2021) and Insight Partners (which backed several late-stage startups last year and in 2021) wrote virtually no checks.
Instead, SoftBank has been bulking up liquidity. For the last several weeks, SoftBank has been selling a portion of its Paytm stake each day, according to a market source familiar with the matter. Chief executive Masayoshi Son said at the company’s annual general meeting last week that SoftBank, which has invested just $650 million through its Vision Funds across the globe in the past two reported quarters, plans to go on the “counteroffensive” soon by resuming AI investments.
Tiger Global, which has deployed over $6.5 billion into Indian startups altogether, is highly unlikely to forge investments in new startups in India for a few more months, a partner at the firm told a founder recently. Scott Shleifer, who oversees startup investments at the New York–headquartered hedge fund, which recently disclosed securing $2 billion for its new fund, said on an investor call earlier this year that returns on capital in India have “historically sucked.”
He said, “If you look at the market-leading internet companies, whether it is Google, Facebook, Alibaba or Tencent, revenue for them got bigger than cost more than a decade ago. You had a great legacy of last 17–18 years of materially profitable internet companies. So returns on equity in the internet got really high and the returns for investors have been really high. But that did not happen in India.”
SoftBank and Tiger Global are investors in 33 of the 65 Indian startups that attained the unicorn status in 2021 and 2022. All put together, India has 102 unicorns.
As some of the prominent late-stage names sit on the sidelines, sovereign funds, especially from the Middle East region, have financed the vast majority of those deals in India in recent quarters.
Rahul Chandra, a seasoned investor and co-founder of Arkam Ventures, said he doesn’t anticipate the return of some prolific late-stage investors to their customary investment activity for at least another two years in India.
The lack of participation from late-stage backers and virtually no IPOs have also hurt the appetite of many midstage investors, who are struggling to devise new underwriting models that reflect the current public market view. Several high-flying Indian startups, including Byju’s, Swiggy and PharmEasy, have experienced a dramatic downward adjustment in their valuations — by a staggering 50% or even more.
Despite this setback, there remains a ray of hope for Indian startups in the form of considerable “dry powder” – untapped capital reserves held by venture capitalists. Almost every active VC firm in India, including the likes of Peak XV Partners, Lightspeed, Accel, Elevation Capital, Matrix Partners India, 3one4 Capital and Blume Ventures, have secured new and larger funds in the past 18 months.
Arkam co-founder Chandra said that it’s likely the pace of investments will pick up in the coming months.
“What we are contained by is mostly locally available capital, which I expect will be behaving in a rational manner because there’s no irrational exuberance coming in to drive valuation up. It’ll still mean that people are chasing each other for termsheets for the good founders because the next two years there will be more capital that will get deployed,” he told TechCrunch in an interview.
Indeed, Peak XV, Lightspeed, and Accel have escalated their deal deliberations and are on track to closing nearly 50 early-stage deals since mid-March, according to people familiar with the matter.

Lightspeed says India not for the faint-hearted amid Sequoia split

Visa acquires Brazilian fintech startup Pismo in $1B blockbuster deal,Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/06/28,"
Credit card giant Visa is acquiring Brazilian payments infrastructure startup Pismo for $1 billion in cash in what is likely one of the largest fintech M&A deals taking place this year so far.
Founded in 2016 by Juliana Motta (CPO), Ricardo Josua (CEO), Daniela Binatti (CTO), and Marcelo Parise (VP of engineering), São Paulo–based Pismo has quietly racked up a list of big-name customers, including Citi, Itaú (one of Brazil’s largest banks), Revolut, N26, Nubank and Cora. The startup processes almost 50 billion API calls and $40 billion in transaction volumes annually, and powers almost 80 million accounts and over 40 million issued cards.
For some context of the explosive growth Pismo has seen, at the beginning of 2021, it was doing less than $1 billion per month in transaction volume, according to Josua. It ended 2020 with fewer than 10 million accounts total.
Over time, Pismo has expanded out of its home country and now also operates in several countries across Latin America, including Mexico and Chile, as well as in the U.S. and Europe. The startup also has some customers in India, Southeast Asia and Australia.
Pismo’s cloud-native issuer processing and core banking platform is aimed at giving banks, fintechs and other financial institutions “flexibility and agility,” the company shared when it raised $108 million in Series B funding in October of 2021. It does things like allow customers to launch products for cards and payments, digital banking, digital wallets and marketplaces. Pismo also claims to allow financial institutions to “take charge of their core data and use it intelligently.”
In a written statement, Visa said that by acquiring Pismo, it “will be positioned to provide core banking and issuer processing capabilities across debit, prepaid, credit and commercial cards for clients via cloud native APIs.” The startup’s platform will also enable Visa to provide support and connectivity for emerging payment rails, like Pix in Brazil, for financial institution clients, the company added.
“Through the acquisition of Pismo, Visa can better serve our financial institution and fintech clients with more differentiated issuer solutions they can offer their customers,” said Jack Forestell, Visa’s chief product and strategy officer, in a written statement. The deal, which is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, is slated to close by year’s end. Pismo will retain its current management team, who will remain based in São Paulo.
SoftBank, e-commerce giant Amazon and Silicon Valley–based venture firm Accel co-led the startup’s Series B raise. Falabella Ventures, PruVen and existing backers Redpoint Ventures and Headline also participated in the financing, which brought Pismo’s total funding raised to $118 million. The company did not share its valuation, but Accel partner Ethan Choi told TechCrunch that the sales price was “a very strategic multiple.”
As a SaaS business, Pismo mostly made money by charging transaction fees. It has charged per active account, so prices decrease based on volume. In other words, the more clients a customer has, the less they pay per account.
In a written statement, Josua said: “At Pismo, we aim to enable our clients to launch cutting-edge payments and banking products within a single cloud-native platform — regardless of rails, geography or currency. Visa provides us unrivaled support to expand our footprint globally and help shape a new era for banking and payments.”
Visa was reportedly just one of several companies bidding for the startup, which was not seeking to be acquired, or even fundraising, according to Choi.
“Pismo wasn’t on the block,” he told TechCrunch. Besides the transaction representing “one of the largest LatAm cross-border fintech deals that has happened,” Choi believes it is also “an example of a global card network deciding that they would like to get closer to the banks and the financial institutions they work with by providing core banking and card issuing services to them, in addition to their credit card and debit card rails.”
He added: “There are a lot of synergies to be able to sell these really critical APIs to their existing financial institution customers.”
It’s not the first infrastructure play on Visa’s part. In March 2022, it closed on its $2.15 billion acquisition of Tink, a leading fintech startup in Europe focused on open banking application programming interfaces.
The credit card behemoth also famously abandoned its planned $5.3 billion acquisition of Plaid, a U.S.-based popular open banking startup, before having to call off the acquisition after running into a regulatory wall.
No doubt that Pismo getting scooped up by Visa is a coup of sorts for the entire Latin America region, which saw a surge in global investors pouring capital into the region in 2021 and a bit of a retreat since. It’s also a comeback story, considering that in 2019, Pismo was running out of the cash it had raised in a $900,000 seed round in 2016. In fact, things were so dire that Binatti and Parise even sold their only car in order to fund Pismo’s operations. Now the company’s just over 400 workers will become Visa employees.
The deal also marks the second time that Accel has purchased a financial infrastructure company that ended up getting acquired soon after. In 2020, consumer financial services platform SoFi announced that it was acquiring payments and bank account infrastructure company Galileo for $1.2 billion in total cash and stock. That company was founded in 2000 and bootstrapped to profitability before Accel wrote it a $77 million Series A check in 2019.

"Brex refocuses on startups with hire of SVB veteran, ex-a16z operating partner",Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/06/28,"
Just over one year ago, spend management decacorn Brex declared that it was “less suited to meet the needs of smaller customers” in an announcement that caused shock waves in the startup community.
While Brex soon clarified that by smaller customers it meant small to medium-sized businesses and non-funded startups, the move still felt like a stunning reversal, considering the company had started its life as a credit card company for startups. The announcement came about two months after Brex announced a “big push into software” and that it was placing greater emphasis on moving upmarket to serve larger, enterprise customers.
But then in March, Silicon Valley Bank imploded. 
Brex was one of the bidders for the early-stage and growth portfolios of the bank, which was known for providing a swath of financial services to the startup community. Ultimately, First Citizens Bank took over, but some of those former clients shunned the idea of working with such a large bank and opted to move their accounts to fintechs such as Brex, Mercury and Arc. While Brex declined to share specifics on just how many former SVB customers in total have migrated their accounts, it did say that it opened 4,000 new accounts and received $2 billion in deposits in the first week after the SVB shutdown alone.
That influx of new customers led Brex to rethink its priorities, and strategy.
Today, the company told TechCrunch exclusively that it has tapped Jason Mok, a former Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) operating partner and more than 16-year veteran of Silicon Valley Bank as its new head of startups. In his new role, which he assumed in April, Mok will be helping founders navigate both today’s macroeconomic environment and the recent banking crises, as well as the promise of exciting technologies like generative AI. 
Via email, Brex co-founder and co-CEO Henrique Dubugras told TechCrunch that “founders and startups have always been at the core of Brex.”
He added: “The community needs our support more than ever given the broader macro and collapse of SVB. When it came to hiring someone to lead our startups organization, it was crucial to find someone who shared Brex’s pride and passion for startups; Jason fits the bill.”
At a16z, Mok managed the firm’s seed fund. And at SVB, he served as the managing director and sector head of consumer internet. Interestingly, Mok’s father also worked at SVB in the early 1990s, in a similar capacity as Mok did.
“So I grew up around SVB,” Mok recalls. “I just grew up around Silicon Valley Bank, founders and entrepreneurs, scaling with companies and venture capital.”
While at the organization, Mok said he worked on everything from early stage to growth to venture to warehouse facilities to lending.
“I learned a ton. SVB was like the best place to get your ‘MBA’ for everything about technology, finance, startups and venture capital,” he said.
In 2020, Mok was recruited by a16z to serve as an operating partner to oversee corporate development before overseeing the firm’s seed fund strategy. He left the firm in September 2022, he said, to focus on family before getting recruited by Brex this spring to help lead its renewed focus on startups.
Admitting that he was “heartbroken” by what transpired at SVB, Mok said he was drawn to the opportunity of helping the startup community in a new capacity.
“SVB was a stalwart that enabled so much of what currently is the tech and innovation ecosystem. It was amazing to see so many different people and companies come out of the woodwork to really do their part in helping prop up the innovation system,” Mok said. “Specifically, it was amazing to see Brex step up the way that it did.”

In his new role, Mok said he will be helping guide the post-SVB opportunity for Brex and how the company is “thinking about delivering for startups in the future.”
“Brex is the only non-bank alternative offering a full financial stack, including banking, bill pay and credit cards,” he told TechCrunch. “I’ve joined to add some additional leadership strategy and reaffirm Brex’s commitment to delivering to startups. Over time we have expanded to serving enterprises but startups and founders are at the core of what we do and we want to make sure we continue to iterate, evolve and grow with founders as they scale beyond startup.”
Part of that, Mok said, will include discussing with founders what they need in terms of products so that they can “scale faster and iterate better.”
The company also wants to be more present physically, by hosting events in various cities such as San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles, for the startup community and offering more “Brex ambassadors” that can serve as the face of the brand that founders, operators and VCs can go to for advice, perspective and connections to other founders.
“I’ll be overseeing all of that and really our go-to-market function,” Mok said.
He’ll also help with the further building out of Brex’s business accounts as well as “further optimizing and improving” the company’s onboarding process.
Brex said it has also named Nadav Lidor as the company’s lead for banking products catered to startups. Lidor, who leads Brex’s Israel office, will be focused on Brex business accounts — cash management accounts with FDIC insurance through partner banks and a suite of money movement tools across ACH, wires and checks. 
In late May, Brex shared that two of its products — Empower, its spend management platform, and Brex business accounts — had “each achieved $100 million in ARR,” or annual recurring revenue.
The company added that since launching Empower last year, Brex has signed on companies such as Coinbase, Indeed, SeatGeek, Lemonade and DoorDash, among others. It also said that its business accounts, which it describes as cash management accounts with a suite of money movement tools across ACH, wires and checks, had seen “rapid growth due to the ease of use and up to $6M in FDIC insurance coverage.”
Brex also recently announced it was going global.

Celestial AI raises $100M to transfer data using light-based interconnects,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/28,"
David Lazovsky and Preet Virk, technologists with backgrounds in semiconductor engineering and photonics, came to the joint realization several years ago that AI and machine learning workloads would quickly encounter a “data movement” problem. Increasingly, they predicted, it would become challenging to move data to and from compute hardware as AI models scaled past what could be kept on the die of any one memory chip.
Their solution — architected by Phil Winterbottom, previously a researcher at the distinguished Bell Labs — was an optical interconnect technology for compute-to-compute, compute-to-memory and on-chip data transmission. Along with Winterbottom, Lazovsky and Virk founded a startup, Celestial AI, to commercialize the tech. And now that startup is attracting big backers.
Celestial AI today announced that it raised $100 million in a Series B round led by IAG Capital Partners, Koch Disruptive Technologies and Temasek’s Xora Innovation fund. The tranche, which brings Celestial AI’s total raised to more than $165 million, will be used to support the production of Celestial’s photonics platform by expanding the company’s engineering, sales and technical marketing departments, according to CEO Lazovsky.
Celestial has around 100 employees at present — a number that Lazovsky expects will grow to 130 by the end of the year.
“Today, compute and memory are closely coupled. The only way to add more high bandwidth memory is to add more compute, whether the additional compute is required or not,” Lazovsky told TechCrunch via email. “Celestial’s tech enables memory disaggregation.”
In a data center, memory is often one of the most expensive resources — in part because it’s not always used efficiently. Because memory is tied to compute, it’s challenging — and sometimes impossible, due to bandwidth constraints and sky-high latency — for operators to “disaggregate” and pool the memory across hardware within the data center.
According to an internal Microsoft study, up to 25% of memory in Azure is “stranded,” or left over, after the servers’ cores have been rented to virtual machines. Reducing this stranded memory could cut data center costs by 4% to 5%, the company estimated — potentially significant savings in the context of a multibillion-dollar operation.
Celestial — which began as a portfolio company of The Engine, the VC firm spun out of MIT in 2016 — developed an ostensible solution in its photonics-based architecture, which scales across multiple-chip systems. Using light to transfer data, Celestial’s tech can beam information within chips and chip-to-chip, making both memory and compute available for AI — and other — workloads.
Image Credits: Celestial
Celestial also claims that its tech can reduce the amount of electricity necessary for data movement, indirectly boosting a chip’s performance. Typically, chips devote a portion of the electricity they draw to data movement between their circuits, which takes away from the electricity that the chip can direct to computing tasks. Celestial’s photonics reduce the power required for data movement, allowing a chip to — at least in theory — increase its compute power.
Celestial’s photonics tech, which is compatible with most industry interconnect standards (e.g., CXL, PCIe), delivers 25x higher bandwidth and 10x lower latency and power consumption than optical alternatives, the company asserts.
“With the growth in AI , especially large language models (LLMs) and recommendation engine workloads, there is a shift towards accelerated compute,” Lazovsky said. “The key problem going forward is memory capacity, memory bandwidth and data movement — i.e., chip-to-chip interconnectivity — which is what we are addressing with Celestial’s photonic fabric.”
Celestial is offering its interconnect product through a licensing program and says that it’s engaged with several “tier-one” customers, including hyperscalers and processor and memory companies.
The interconnect product appears to be priority number one for Celestial. The company sells its own AI accelerator chip, dubbed Orion, built on Celestial’s photonics architecture. But as investors told TechCrunch in a recent piece for TC+, AI photonics chips have yet to overcome engineering challenges that would make them practical at scale. Unless Celestial stumbled upon breakthroughs in the areas of data-to-analog conversion and signal regeneration — top stumbling blocks for today’s photonics chips — it’s unlikely that Orion is much further along than the competition.
Chip aside, Celestial has a number of competitors in a photonic integrated circuit market that could be worth $26.42 billion by 2027.
Ayar Labs, which makes chip solutions based on optical networking principles, has raised over $200 million in venture capital since its founding in 2015. Renovus, another rival, recently landed a $73.9 million investment.
There could be consolidation ahead in the broader optical interconnection space, though. Around three years ago, Marvell bought Inphi, an optical networking specialist, for $10 billion. After a period of quiet, Microsoft last year acquired Lumenisity, a startup developing high-speed optical cables for data center and carrier networks.
Both Inphi and Lumenisity were targeting different use cases with their tech. But the enthusiasm from Big Tech around optics and photonics is worth noting.
“Our photonics technology is truly differentiated and is unique with superior characteristics,” Lazovsky said. “Given the growth in generative AI workloads due to LLMs and the pressures it puts on current data center architectures, demand is increasing rapidly for optical connectivity to support the transition from general computing data center infrastructure to accelerating computing.”
Samsung Catalyst, Smart Global Holdings, Porsche Automobil Holding SE, The Engine Fund, imec.xpand, M Ventures and Tyche Partners also participated in Celestial’s Series B.

"As $100M+ venture rounds evaporate, IPOs might have to carry the weight",Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/28,"
Earlier this year we wrote that the “the $100 million venture round is going extinct.” Often our predictions wind up sideways. This time we were on the right track.
According to new data from PitchBook, the U.S. venture market is continuing to endure lackluster velocity for nine-figure investments into private companies, colloquially referred to as “mega-rounds.”

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

In the first half of 2023, PitchBook counted just 108 mega-rounds in the United States. If we presumed that this rate will hold throughout the year, we’re looking at just over 200 nine-figure deals in the U.S. in 2023. That’s a dramatic decline from prior levels. Starting in Q4 2020 through Q3 2022, there were more than 100 mega-rounds recorded per quarter. In 2021, the average was more than 200 per quarter. To see perhaps 200 this year implies that the number of late-stage startups that will be able to raise an IPO-sized round is in free fall.
The rounds are also getting smaller, with data indicating that the average nine-figure round size has fallen under the $200 million mark, exclusive of a few rounds that are hardly traditional venture deals, like OpenAI’s massive round earlier this year. Smaller mega-rounds, and fewer of them, is a tough mix for unicorns of all stripes and sizes.
Of course, we could see nine-figure rounds rebound in other markets. Europe and Asia have seen their fair share of the transactions historically. But as the United States’ venture market is the largest in the world and was once the leading player in mega-round financings, where the U.S. goes, so, too, goes the world.

Cava’s explosive IPO hints that public markets are more ready for growth-stories than founders thought

If unicorns here are struggling to find fodder in the quantity that they became accustomed to, other startups around the world are likely enduring a similar dearth of capital.
Notably PitchBook thinks that “the need for capital likely leading to an uptick in mega-rounds as the year progresses” thanks to “the notion that depleting cash runways will force more of these startups to raise in the harsher dealmaking environment,” it still expects full-year mega-round tallies to come in at dramatically reduced levels compared to prior years.

Techstars raising $150 million for new accelerator fund,Annie Njanja,2023/06/28,"
Startup accelerator Techstars is raising $150 million for its new fund, SEC filings show. The accelerator is seeking new capital ahead of the end of the deployment period of its third institutionally-backed fund, Techstars Accelerator 2021, later this year.
Techstars declined to offer details on how it intends to use or deploy the funding, citing regulatory restrictions. However, like its predecessors, the new fund, Techstars Accelerator 2024, is expected to be used for accelerator-stage and/or post-accelerator investments.
Notably, the Boulder-based early-stage investor has used its current fund only for accelerator-stage investments. Its previous funds backed startups both during the accelerator stage and with follow-on investments after the program.
Fund 3 aimed to back more than 800 pre-seed and seed startups that are part of its global accelerator programs by the end of 2023. Through its accelerator groups, Techstars has so far backed over 3,500 early-stage startups in various sectors, including health tech, fintech, web3 and clean tech.
Startups going through Techstars’ three-month program receive $20,000 and a $100,000 convertible note in exchange for 6% to 9% of common stock, in addition to access to its network and mentorship, amongst other resources.

Techstars debuts new fund for companies too early for its own accelerator

Founded in 2006, Techstars runs more than 50 accelerator groups in major cities across the globe, including New York, Los Angeles, London, Boston, Tel Aviv and Lagos. The accelerator launched the Lagos arm last year in partnership with ARM Labs as part of its plan to expand its specialist and generalist programs globally.
To double down on its growth and expansion plans, Techstars recently launched new funds to bolster its investment efforts.
Last year, for instance, it launched Rising Stars, a fund to back startups that are too early for its accelerator programs. Under this fund, Techstars will issue $100,000 checks in exchange for 7% to 10% equity.
The accelerator also launched the $80 million Advancing Cities Fund in partnership with JPMorgan to back over 400 startups by diverse founders in nine cities across the U.S.

OpenAI brings the competition to DeepMind’s doorstep with new London office,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/28,"
OpenAI is expanding overseas. To London, specifically.
Today, the Microsoft-backed AI startup announced that it plans to open an office in London, its first international outpost. When OpenAI’s London location opens its doors, it’ll focus on advancing “research and engineering capabilities” while balancing collaborating with “local communities and policymakers,” according to CEO Sam Altman.
“We see this expansion as an opportunity to attract world-class talent and drive innovation in AGI development and policy,” Altman, who reportedly had floated Poland and France as alternatives for the office, said in a canned statement. “We’re excited about what the future holds and to see the contributions our London office will make towards building and deploying safe AI.”
London is a conspicuous choice for OpenAI, which hasn’t expanded beyond its San Francisco headquarters since its founding in 2015. The city is the longtime home base of DeepMind, Google’s largest AI research division, and a wellspring of data science talent, owing to its rich academic history and renowned universities.
Broadly speaking, London is also becoming a booming center for AI startup ventures. According to a recent report, as of 2021, over 1,300 AI companies were based in London and the city was the top-funded in the U.K. in terms of venture dollars invested.
The city is also important politically to tech companies heavily invested in AI, like OpenAI, which seek to convince the U.K.’s governing bodies to regulate AI with a light touch. On a recent lobbying tour, Altman made an appearance at the University College London, where he called for “balanced” regulation and warned of the risks of deepfake disinformation.
At that same appearance, Altman said that OpenAI would “cease operating” in the European Union if it’s unable to comply with the provisions of the bloc’s AI Act, one of the first comprehensive set of regulations for the AI industry. He later backed down from the comments — but the play was made.

Quandri raises $8.5M Series A to bring process automation to insurance brokers and agencies,Frederic Lardinois,2023/06/28,"
Robotic process automation (RPA) has been a buzzword for a while now, but most of the tools that try to help businesses automate their workflows tend to be generalists. Quandri, a Vancouver, Canada-based startup, is taking a very different approach with its digital workers for the insurance industry. The company today announced that it has raised an $8.5 million Series A round led by FUSE, with participation from Defined Capital and existing investors Aviso Ventures, Rebellion Ventures, N49P and Good News Ventures. In total, the company has now raised $10 million.
The company was co-founded by brothers Jackson (CEO) and Jamieson Fregeau (president). Jackson was previously the COO of Revenue Accelerator while Jamieson worked at a number of hardware-centric companies, including Open Ocean Robotics. Jackson noted that while he was at Revenue Accelerator, he ended up building a number of bots to automate repetitive data entry tasks. So when the brothers were thinking about what product to build, they decided on putting a different spin on RPA.
“Nobody was really talking about a bot for a customer specifically. It was like: you’d give this capability to a customer. And then they would need to go and configure and build all this stuff themselves in a really rigid way. And that prevented a huge slew of companies from accessing this kind of technology because they don’t have the technical resources — or if they have the technical resources, they’re applied to their very specific core products but not on operational automation.”
What Quandri is building is more akin to “robot-as-a-service” than traditional RPA. Instead of having to build automation themselves, Quandri essentially pre-builds these bots for their customers, which also means that the team has to focus on a very specific niche. After working with a couple of potential customers in the insurance space, Jackson told me, the team realized that this was a vertical where brokers and agencies were still doing a lot of repetitive manual work and where a lot of data was sitting in silos (even as the consumer-side of the industry has quickly modernized).
“There hasn’t been a lot of net new tooling built for brokerages over the last 10 years,” he said. “It’s been somewhat overlooked by a large wave of innovation that has happened in a lot of other industries.”
Right now, Quandri offers three of these pre-built robots: Renewal Reviewer to help agents compare policies upon renewal, a tool that helps users ensure that files are named correctly and contextually (and not “1847AHDKS812 BROKER”), and Download Director, a service that matches unmatched policies and eDocs to the correct accounts and then matches claims and verifies producer commission amounts as needed.
Jackson tells me that the company is currently 100% focused on the insurance industry and specifically on North American brokerages. In the long run, the team may branch out and apply its technology to other verticals.
“Bots are a total game changer for our agency,” said Angela Trimble, president, Trustpoint Services. “I told my Agency Manager we are now at a place where we don’t have to be worried about hiring additional employees when it comes to the tasks involving tedious paperwork because we have bots in place.”

Deal Dive: Startups can still raise capital — even if it’s for a good cause,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/07/08,"
When venture funding started to slow in 2022, many feared that investors would retreat to where they were comfortable: SaaS companies founded by folks in their network. And any company that wasn’t posting top growth metrics would struggle to secure funding. While this has largely been true, there have been bright spots. Everytable’s recent round is one of them.
The mission-driven food tech startup looks to make healthy prepared food, including wraps and salads, as accessible and affordable as fast-food chains. The startup prices its menu based on where each individual store is located in addition to distributing through a variety of other channels, including branded vending machines and delivery.
On June 27, the startup announced a $25 million Series C-2 round led by Dohmen Impact Investment Fund, which backs for-profit companies building food solutions to enhance human health, in addition to existing investors. This round will help the company expand its retail footprint; Everytable hopes to open up 25 stores in the latter half of 2023.
This deal is notable for a few reasons — none of which being that it got announced amid the mass VC summer exodus at the end of June. Someone is still working!

"So, how are Europe’s startups doing?",Haje Jan Kamps,2023/07/07,"
Welcome to Startups Weekly. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday afternoon.
I’ve been keeping an eye on the European startup ecosystem since well before I moved to the U.S., and today’s report from Creandum about the state of venture investing in Europe gave me pause. This, along with PitchBook’s report of what happened across the pond last year, adds up to a complex picture.
As far as I can see — and as I discussed in my column this week — the ecosystem in Europe continues to be pretty fragmented and immature, and investment across the pond took a 16% dip in 2022 compared to 2021. That isn’t unique to Europe, of course; 2022 was hard across the board, and compared to the years before, there were very few liquidity events across the startup world:
Data from PitchBook shows that exit values in 2022 were dismal. Image Credits: PitchBook
All around, 2022 was a dismal year: We haven’t seen this little M&A and IPO activity since 2016. The total value of exits in 2022 was $71 billion. The year before, it was more than ten times that.
Bad years happen, but I’m going to keep a very close eye on how quickly the VC markets bounce back. My suspicion is that the U.S. venture industry is more resilient in the face of a slow year or two and that LPs are less easily spooked. In other words, it’s going to be telling to see who raises new funds, where, and with what investment theses over the next three to five years.

Spotify co-creator Daniel Ek’s new company raised a $65 million round of funding for his preventative healthcare startup Neko Health — all the more impressive given that this is reportedly the first external round of financing for the Stockholm-based company.
Lightspeed Ventures made its first investment in Africa, backing Berry Health, which aims to bring judgment-free healthcare to a continent where stigma cuts deep and is affecting many.
News of the fresh rounds comes on the heels of a healthy amount of activity in health tech — Public Ventures launched a $100 million impact fund focusing on nascent life science and clean tech startups, particularly in Canada.

It’s handbags at dawn for social media
Image Credits: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch
If you’ve stumbled across the TechCrunch homepage in the past week, then you’ve seen our wall of coverage on the utter drama-fest that is the social media landscape at the moment. Investment giant Fidelity already adjusted down its Reddit valuation a month ago, but Manish reports that it further deepened its valuation cuts for Reddit this week, after the Reddit protest plunges user engagement.
If you look beyond the Reddit dumpster fire for a fraction of a second, the rest of social media is aflame as well. Twitter competitors soar after Musk makes another boneheaded move, and Paul argues that its competitors need to get their act together in order to become a true competitor.
Apropos competitors, Meta’s Twitter competitor Threads went live and quickly passed 2 million downloads in just two hours, and more than 30 million in a day. I know, I didn’t really see it coming either, but TechCrunch compiled an all-your-questions-answered article about Threads. My first impression? The app isn’t great, but Instagram’s network effect is formidable, and Twitter has been screwing up so monumentally since Musk’s acquisition that it may just be all it takes to put the bird app in its grave.
That’s a pass from us, mon frère: Natasha L points out that Meta’s Threads app is a privacy nightmare and that it won’t launch in the EU yet. This follows a report that a bunch of tech giants are having to figure out how to respond to the EU’s rebooted antitrust regime.
Money didn’t bring API-ness: Ivan ponders what’s happening over at Reddit as the social media site braces for life after API changes.
Lawsuits from a parallel universe: Devin reports that a Louisiana judge silenced White House social media talks in a lawsuit that seems pretty wild. He writes, “It’s almost pitiable how desperately the lawsuit peddles its conspiracy theories, making out routine emails to be collusion and [the] removal of rule-violating content as censorship.” So . . . that’s fun.
Take down those tweets: While we’re on the topic of wild court cases, Twitter was trying to wriggle out of a case in India, but the judge didn’t mince words: “Punishment for non-compliance is 7 years imprisonment and unlimited fine.” Needless to say, Twitter’s plea against India’s government was dismissed, although the core of the case is still curious: Twitter has been asked to take down hundreds of accounts and tweets, often for denouncing the Indian government.
Skynet awakens

AI is everywhere, but never has it been so confusingly head scratching as in the case of Humane’s first product: The Ai Pin. The secretive startup has been around since 2018 and has reportedly raised more than $230 million since then — and I can’t for the life of me figure out why this is better than just saying, “Hey, [voice assistant],” into your nearest smart device. Someone, please, explain it to me.
Did I mention that AI is hot? In the past couple of weeks, I had two founders reach out to me for fundraising advice, only to get back to me a couple weeks later with an “lol, I guess we don’t need help; we just got several term sheets.” The right teams are raising formidable amounts of funds as the FOMO sets in among investors. One example is Typeface, which is building generative AI for brands and just announced a $100 million raise at a $1 billion valuation.
On top of that, one of the wilder stories we’ve seen so far was a founder selling its four-month-old “OpenAI for China” play for $234 million. That means the startup gained about $2 million of valuation per day from starting to acquisition. Yowzers.
Incidentally, if someone wants to share some AI-related decks for my Pitch Deck Teardown series, I wouldn’t be mad.
Yes, this is definitely Bobby’s mother. He cannot come to school today: Ingrid reports that Voice.ai raises $6 million as its real-time voice changer approaches 500,000 users.
Hey, robot, you grab the crayons, I’ll make the coffee: Kyle reports that Runway raised $141 million as it builds generative AI tools for content creators.
We can’t measure this, but it’s definitely 10x better: Over on TC+, Software.com co-founders Geoff Stevens and Brett Stevens argue that the productivity boosts developers see by using AI are a bit of smoke and mirrors — not least because nobody seems to agree on how to measure productivity among software developers in the first place.

"How to identify, interview and hire a head of growth for an early-stage startup",Jonathan Martinez,2023/07/07,"
The waters are never calm when scaling a startup. In fact, they are typically quite choppy. However, by making the correct hire in the head of growth position, you can navigate to shore much more smoothly.
The individual you’re looking for will create and execute growth strategies, manage marketing initiatives and, ultimately, drive revenue. My more informal take on this role is that it’s someone who deeply understands growth fundamentals, has significant expertise in one to two growth pillars and knows how to build an effective team.
I’ll walk you through when and how to hire your head of growth, their archetypes, how this role stands apart from other marketing executive positions, and what to expect from this hire during their first few quarters.
Head of growth archetypes
In my decade of growth marketing, I’ve seen quite a few growth leaders who began at various startups, all possessing varying levels of experience. To make it easier, I’ve grouped these candidates into three major categories, or archetypes:

Generalists: Experience across numerous growth pillars.
Specialists: Deep expertise in one pillar.
Tertiaries: Data, finance/VC, VC or product background.

While I’ve seen members of each category become successful as heads of growth, I strongly advise hiring from either category one or category two for seed to Series B startups.
When building a growth function from zero, it’s vital to have someone who can drive the execution for your early channels and campaigns. When it comes to category three, I’ve only witnessed success after a growth team was already in place, with their efforts centered around optimizing efforts across data analytics and product.
Outside of these three major archetypes, there are two important flavors that are consistent across the groups:

B2B or B2C
Mobile or web

These two flavors can make or break the success of your growth efforts, as their type of marketing is so distinct. Someone coming from an extensive background of web acquisition at a B2B company like Rippling would not be well-suited to run growth at a B2C consumer startup such as Spotify.
Most growth marketers will heavily index in B2B or B2C, as their careers typically stay on that path. However, it’s quite common to see growth marketers who have experience in both mobile and web acquisition, and it’s absolutely acceptable to hire them.
You’ll occasionally find a unicorn who’s a generalist and has experience in B2B, B2C, mobile and web. If you do, recruit them immediately.
Heads of growth come in many flavors. Image Credits: Jonathan Martinez
How to interview
I’m fortunate to have been on both sides of the interview table for head of growth positions, largely at tech B2C startups, so I have a good sense of what makes for amazing interviewees.
Below are example questions to ask and a few case studies I’ve seen work well:
Interview questions:

What are the most important growth metrics for our startup to track?
How would you measure success in our growth efforts?
We’re having issues in our funnel — how would you analyze and optimize?
What do you think our largest growth levers are and why? "
Pitch Deck Teardown: Nokod Security’s $8M seed deck,Haje Jan Kamps,2023/07/07,"
Gone are the days when you needed a developer to build an app for a relatively easy task. No-code and low-code development let you dramatically increase the speed of building and bringing simple (and, sometimes, not-so-simple) apps to market. I swear, half my life is being run by Zapier at the moment: Book a meeting with me, and all sorts of things happen automatically in the background to ensure that our meeting is on the right calendars, is transcribed and the video of the call is stored away and tagged with your company’s name.
The ease of creating apps that low-code and no-code offer has trade-offs, though: In order to work, they need access to some pretty sensitive data. If someone wants access to my data, they could try to hack my email, or they could hack one of the many automations tied to my email accounts. When more and more apps are essentially running on the same underlying architecture and code, they become a very tempting target for hackers and others with nefarious intentions.
Enter Nokod Security, which offers to monitor no-code and low-code apps for security vulnerabilities and mitigate breaches.
The company recently raised $8 million from Acrew Capital, Meron Capital and Flint Capital, and the team was gracious enough to share the (lightly edited) deck they used so we could take a sneaky peek under the hood.

We’re looking for more unique pitch decks to tear down, so if you want to submit your own, here’s how you can do that.

Three things to love
Nokod’s deck has a lot of cool things going on, as well as some stuff that had me pretty confused. As always, I’ll get to my misgivings and OldManYellsAtCloud.gif feedback in just a moment. For now, let’s look at the slides that got me excited.
Give me a T! Give me an E!
Okay, I’m not gonna spell out T-E-A-M in the subhead, but this is an example of a company that knows its strengths. In an early-stage company, a founding team that has an unfair advantage is a straight-up superpower. Nokod has all bases covered on that front:
[Slide 2] Extraordinary founding team. Image Credits: NokodThe two co-founders have both started and exited companies in the cybersecurity space before. That’s a hell of a way to catch an investor’s attention. Relevant experience and successful exits screams “unfair advantage.” Even after just reading this one slide, I was pretty unsurprised that this company successfully raised money.
Apart from the obvious, this slide shows that the founding team understands what’s important in a pitch deck: If you’ve got incredible traction, lead with that. If you don’t, highlight your experienced team.
Well-articulated problem
[Slide 9] An elegant outline of the problem at hand. Image Credits: Nokod.A good fundraising story will have a good explanation of what the problem is and why it might be worth solving. Not everything on this list is well explained. To wit: Do you, without googling, know what PII is, or, indeed, why collection and storage of PII might be a bad thing?
The company could have taken the effort to explain the impact of some of these issues and why low- and no-code apps are particularly vulnerable in these situations, but I get the message in broad strokes: The cost of embracing no-code and low-code is that people might not always know exactly what’s going on, and if something does happen, it can be hard to figure out exactly where the ne’er-do-wells gained entry to a system.
A better go-to-market slide than most
[Slide 16] Let’s sell this thing. Image Credits: Nokod 

			This go-to-market slide has a clear profile of the customer: how they can be reached, what the business model is and where they are geographically. 					


Building a coherent go-to-market strategy can be surprisingly hard. It’s what I end up arguing about with my pitch coaching clients most often. Having some vague, hand-wavy “build it and they will come” theory works when you are focusing on the product, but if you are raising money to acquire customers, you don’t get to shrug and say, “We will figure it out when we get there.” You aren’t getting there. You are raising money to execute, so you are there.
This go-to-market slide has a clear profile of the customer: how they can be reached, what the business model is, where they are geographically and even who the decision-maker is within the business. I’m not sure how many medium-sized companies have a CISO or director of application security. I suspect a lot of the time, these decisions fall to a CTO rather than a dedicated, clearly defined security role.
Still, as an investor, I can look at this and see the outline of a plan. My next question would be: “Okay, talk me through your process. How do you actually land a sale?” The story should be consistent and outline a good sales funnel — something like, “The leads come from X, we reach the decision maker through A, B and C, and then we close the deal 25% of the time. But we suspect we can increase that percentage if we do Y and Z.” An answer like that will pass muster for me, and doubly so if the company already has paying customers and can point to the sales process it used.
In the rest of this teardown, we’ll take a look at three things Nokod could have improved or done differently, along with its full pitch deck!

Remote-work startups were a hot commodity when the pandemic began, but in the post-vaccine era, many investors and founders are reconsidering their enthusiasm, Rebecca Szkutak reports.
“If I looked at all the companies that are actually categorized as remote work, you’d see this little tip of the iceberg,” said Kevin Spain, a general partner at Emergence Capital. “Below that there are a lot of other companies effectively following and benefiting from that trend.”

Some companies working on hybrid workplace solutions “have pivoted out of the category,” others have reduced staff, and “one virtual office startup recently sold off its IP and transitioned to AI,” wrote Rebecca.
“It’s hard to pin the exact numbers on it,” writes Rebecca, “but there are signs that things aren’t going well for many remote work startups.”

I’m currently in the U.S. on a B-1/B-2 visitor visa. The sponsoring company would like me to start in August. I heard it can take several months to change my status to a J-1. Is there a way to get a J-1 faster?
Is there anything I should know about the J-1, particularly if I later decide to stay in the U.S. once the J-1 program ends?

Should you move to a new state for tax savings before selling your startup?
Image Credits: Catherine Falls Commercial (opens in a new window) / Getty Images
Once an acquisition is in the works, it’s natural for founders to start safeguarding their newfound wealth.
“On a $30 million exit, a founder could save approximately $4.3 million by moving from California to Florida or approximately $4.4 million by moving from New York City to Florida,” writes Peyton Carr, managing director of Keystone Global Partners.
“That’s a lot of incentive to pull up the stakes and head to Miami,” but unless you follow state-level guidelines about where you spend time and generate income, “your move is likely to trigger an audit.”

If I were a tech investor, there’s no way I’d sign a non-disclosure agreement.
Presumably, I’d be meeting with hundreds of founders each year. Signing an NDA might preclude me from doing another deal with someone else working in a similar space: why would I ever agree to that?
According to Haje Jan Kamps, entrepreneurs should only ask for an NDA when disclosing “the details of your tech with anyone outside your company.”

VC Office Hours: Fabrice do Rego on building one of the few Black-led funds in the EU,Dominic-Madori Davis,2023/07/07,"
Before he became one of the few Black fund managers in the EU, Fabrice do Rego had quite a long career in finance. He started off with Lehman Brothers, before moving to stints at Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, and eventually founding M&A advisory firm Valmeon Corporate Finance.
But during all his years analyzing M&A deals and corporations, do Rego rarely saw people who looked like him in that industry. That realization, he tells me, inspired him to start The Blueprint VC with Ibrahim Ouassari to back founders from under-represented backgrounds in France and Belgium.
For do Rego, the logic behind launching The Blueprint is simple: Mixed teams with diverse backgrounds are known to perform well, yet capital allocation to such teams is still low. “There’s a lot of money being left on the table,” he said. So, he decided, literally, to go get that money.
Launched in December 2021, The Blueprint started raising a €25 million fund last January, which the founders hope to invest in 30 companies within the next four years. They’ve already backed two.
The firm likes to invest in mixed teams of diverse origins, mostly focused on gender and ethnicity. The Blueprint focuses on seed and pre-seed rounds, writes checks ranging from €100,000 to €400,000, and has a reserve for follow-on investments. It’s sector-agnostic but does not invest in deep tech or biotech at the moment.
I recently caught up with do Rego to talk about his work with The Blueprint, surviving the venture downturn and the best way to cultivate the next generation of talent in the EU.
(Note: The following interview has been edited lightly for length and clarity.)
TechCrunch: You’ve been raising this €25 million fund for about a year, with a diversity-focused investment thesis on a continent with noted issues regarding equity and inclusion for marginalized groups. What has the process of approaching limited partners been like?
Fabrice do Rego: It has been much more difficult than what I expected.
We have a great team, and I thought with such a team, it would be easy. But we faced some odd times raising the fund, especially with institutions. Their first question was the “pipeline problem” [asking if there was enough diverse talent to fund in France and Belgium].
Another thing that was difficult is the difference between continental Europe and the U.S. or maybe even the U.K. — we don’t yet have a super strong and wealthy community of Black people who are connected to each other. That is something we lack, and when you want to raise the first fund [for something like The Blueprint], that’s the type of LP you need to have for your first millions.
The minimum target size of our fund is €25 million. Anything below that threshold, it’s super hard to have a professional fund. We wanted our first close to be €12 million, and we will probably reduce it to €10 million because we want to deploy as much as possible, fast. "
Web3 games don’t need to highlight blockchain elements to succeed,Jacquelyn Melinek,2023/07/07,"

Blockchain-based games want to go mainstream, but the million-dollar question is: What’s the best way to do it?
According to some web3 game developers, there might not be just one right answer.
To win Web 2.0 audiences over, it appears the industry will have to meet them where they are. To do that, web3 game devs should move web3 components to the back end and avoid promoting games as being based on web3, according to Sumeet Patel, founder of NFT-based algorithmic prediction game Exiled Racers.
That makes sense to me. When using applications, people don’t really care about what’s going on behind the scenes. They just want something that’s easy to use and does what they want it to. While some people may want to understand the technology and dive deep, the majority don’t really care.
“It doesn’t sound good, but gaming doesn’t need blockchain today, but blockchain does need gaming,” said Nicholas Douzinas, business development and growth lead at decentralized gaming platform Ajuna Network.
The global gaming industry is expected to grow from $282 billion in 2023 to $666 billion by 2030, as more people increasingly choose video games as their primary form of entertainment, and 4G-enabled smartphones enable people everywhere to indulge in mobile games, according to a report by Fortune Business Insights.
But blockchain gaming wasn’t even mentioned as a trend or driving factor for gaming growth. I think that’s fair because it’s such a small fraction of the market and has a long way to go before it can even make a dent in the industry.
“NFTs mean nothing to gaming; some people don’t care about ownership,” said Douzinas. But on the other side of the spectrum, some people want to engage deeply with web3 technology, he noted.
Ajuna Network aims to attract people who are interested in web3 technology and blockchains but are comfortable with owning a token and the possibilities that come with it, Douzinas said.
Not all gaming companies are taking that route. "

SVB’s collapse drove 26K customers to Mercury in 4 months,Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/07/07,"
When Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March, a flurry of startups rushed to step in to help fill a gap in the startup and venture capital community.
One of those startups, Mercury, in particular found itself in the position of trying to meet a sudden surge of demand amidst the panic.
“The craziest time was the first five days,” recalls CEO and co-founder Immad Akhund. “It started Wednesday night — where it was very stressful and not just from Mercury’s perspective, but all of Silicon Valley was holding their breath. People were worried about what was going to happen next.”
Akhund says he spent most of his time those first few days on calls and responding to direct messages from existing and potentially new customers.
“People were very stressed and saying ‘I need a bank account now,’” he says. “Every question had this urgency.”
In response, Mercury — working with partner banks Choice Financial Group and Evolve Bank & Trust — upped its FDIC insurance, first from $1 million to $3 million and then to $5 million. It also released a new product called Vault, so people could park their cash beyond those amounts into U.S. government treasury bills.
Still, one of the questions that kept coming up, according to Akhund, was, “If SVB is failing, why is Mercury safe?” The question was fair, in his view, considering that Mercury itself is a startup.
In the first few days after the collapse, the company saw more than $2 billion in deposits. And in all of March, Mercury saw nearly 8,700 new customers depositing funds into its accounts.
“It was by far our biggest month we’ve had at Mercury, a huge inflow,” Akhund recalls. “We tried to prioritize people coming from SVB and even built some tools so they could connect to SVB accounts.”
But it wasn’t a short-term boom, something that Akhund was worried about.
The company claims that 95% of its net new customers have stayed with Mercury nearly 90 days out from the SVB crisis and that those deposits have held steady. Also, that new customer growth has continued even after the SVB crisis has settled, with the company having doubled new signups per month since April — leading to 17,000 total new customers depositing funds from April to June, a figure that Akhund shared with TechCrunch exclusively. Its total customer base includes businesses such as including Deel, On Deck, Linear, Sprig and Forage. The company says it crossed the 100,000 customer mark in 2022.
That recent surge of customers has contributed to the company’s annualized revenue run rate growing 4x year-over-year from May 2022 to May 2023, Akhund told TechCrunch. Overall, in 2022, Mercury processed $50 billion in transactions. In the first half of 2023 alone, the company has processed more than $42 billion in transactions. Mercury also, he said, has been profitable for the last 12 months. He declined to say how many customers the company specifically has today, saying only that it is “over 100,000.”
Further, according to data obtained from Kruze Consulting, more than 30% of Kruze’s clients now have a Mercury account, up from 17% at the end of February — the highest share of any neobank or bank, according to Mercury.
While Mercury is open to any U.S. business, its focus is on startups and e-commerce companies, which make up 70% of its customer base. Startups in particular, Mercury touts, have unique needs that many claim big banks are unable to adequately meet.
“We were already growing and we saw an approximately 20% jump because of what happened with SVB,” Akhund said. “It’s obviously kind of been an inflection point, and we’ve kind of sped up after this.”
Since its 2017 inception, Mercury has raised over $163 million in funding from investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, Coatue and CRV as well as angel investors, athletes, entertainers and customers. Its last round was a $120 million Series B that was announced in July of 2021.
I dug into all these details and much more with Akhund on Equity Podcast, which you can listen to here.

Reporter’s note: The story was updated post-publication to correct the number of customers that Mercury has.

Google’s Gradient Ventures backs Weflow to bring greater hygiene to Salesforce data,Paul Sawers,2023/07/07,"
Google’s venture capital arm Gradient Ventures has made another foray into Europe, investing as part of a $3.2 million seed round in two-year-old German startup Weflow.
Weflow is the latest in a line of ecosystem startups to emerge from frustrations with using the omnipresent CRM (customer relationship management) software that is Salesforce. These venture-backed upstarts focus on things like providing data backups or improving lead generation, while just last week a new company called Unaric emerged out of stealth with $35 million for the express purpose of buying and consolidating Salesforce-ecosystem startups.
Yes, Salesforce-focused tools are big business, with some estimates pegging the market value at four times that of Salesforce itself.
Weflow, for its part, is setting out to improve sales teams’ efficiency, pipeline visibility and general “Salesforce data hygiene,” according to Weflow co-founder and CEO Janis Zech, who likens his platform to something akin to “Notion for revenue teams.”
“[The main problem we solve is] helping companies to forecast their pipeline accurately — this typically requires capturing sales data, both structured and unstructured, surfacing deal insights and pipeline analytics to run forecast predictions,” Zech explained to TechCrunch.
Show me the data
The ultimate problem that Weflow seeks to fix is that of the sheer spread of data across the B2B sales sphere, spanning the countless meetings, emails and calls leading to a deal’s conclusion. Weflow promises to bring this data together within a coherent structure to deliver insights.
To do this, Weflow has developed what it calls a “revenue workspace,” pitched as an all-encompassing platform that allows companies to capture CRM data while serving up deal insights and tools for managing their sales pipeline. More recently, the company introduced collaborative forecasting and pipeline analytics, too.
Under the hood, Weflow uses AI to allocate what it calls a “deal score,” which is effectively a prediction that considers things like buying signals, sales activities and historical data to forecast the likelihood of a deal closing. In the future, Zech says the platform will also lean on AI to forecast future revenues, as well as leverage unstructured email data and even video/call transcripts to uncover hidden deal insights.

‘Salesforce fatigue’
Although Zech and his two co-founders, Henrik Basten and Philipp Stelzer, launched Weflow in 2021, the Berlin-based startup has been years in the making, built on frustrations Zech experienced at an adtech startup he founded in 2009 called Fyber (then known as SponsorPay).
“Experiencing severe ‘Salesforce fatigue’ at Fyber, we realized CRMs have become clunky infrastructure, not places to effectively work on deals and drive sales performance,” Zech said. “It’s a problem that affects most companies’ top lines.”
Zech eventually sold Fyber for €150 million in 2014, and in the intervening years he invested both as an angel and partner at Point Nine Capital. More recently, he co-founded a startup studio that birthed a company called Back, which Gradient Ventures also invested in before it was acquired by Personio last May.
As for Weflow, there are clear similarities to other tools on the market already, including venture-backed Salesforce ecosystem company Scratchpad, and revenue forecasting unicorn Clari. According to Zech, Weflow’s main selling point over incumbents in the space include per-user pricing transparency (e.g. Clari seemingly only offers a “get quote” button, while Scratchpad invites would-be customers to “schedule a demo”). Additionally, Weflow offers workflow tools such as a task manager, notepad and a Chrome extension to easily integrate with Gmail and Google Calendar.
The Google factor
Securing Google’s VC off-shoot as a lead backer is a major coup for any young startup, opening doors to potential new partners and customers, among other commercial benefits.
While the lion’s share of Gradient’s investments hail from the U.S., it’s no stranger to the European startup scene. Last month, we learned it had invested in Versed, a Dutch startup developing tools to help anyone create video games using generative AI. And last year it backed U.K. insurance tech startup Penny, as well as Germany’s Gigs, which wants to make it easier to launch a mobile network.
Prior to all this, Gradient has also invested in Denmark’s Contractbook, Kaizo from the Netherlands, Finland’s Oura and, as noted, Germany’s Back Technologies.
Prior to now, Weflow had raised $2.7 million in pre-seed funding back in 2021; with its fresh cash injection it said that it’s looking to further invest in its AI efforts, bringing it to other areas of its platform.
Aside from lead investor Gradient Ventures, Weflow’s seed round included contributions from existing investor Cherry Ventures, Hello World and several angel investors.

SpeedyBrand uses generative AI to create SEO-optimized content,Kyle Wiggers,2023/07/07,"
While working at Vetan, a startup helping small- and medium-sized (SMBs) businesses manage employee payroll, Ranti Dev Sharma realized that SMBs often lack the tools to thrive online with organic sales. The cost to hire an agency is beyond their budget, and generating content is costly — both in terms of time and money.
“Having a great online presence is critical for e-commerce stores like Shopify and Woo, as online traffic is the bread and butter of their business,” Sharma told TechCrunch in an email interview. “But existing content marketing solutions are not complete and require search engine optimization (SEO) expertise. Businesses need multiple SEO tools and to hire content strategists, writers and agencies to outsource their content marketing work.”
So along with Jatin Mehta and Ayush Jasuja, Sharma co-founded SpeedyBrand, which aims to bring “high-quality,” affordable SEO content to SMBs using generative AI. SpeedyBrand today announced that it raised $2.5 million in a funding round led by GV (Google’s venture arm) and Y Combinator that values the company at $15 million post-money.
SpeedyBrand’s platform, powered by generative AI, can create custom SEO-optimized content — including websites and social media posts — for brands. Brands first choose a topic. Then they have the platform generate text and suggest images that might be appropriate for the type of content they’re generating.
From SpeedyBrand’s dashboard, generated content can be edited and further customized before being published to various channels. An analytics component allows brands to track the performance of the content once it’s live.
“The economic slowdown requires cost-effective marketing solutions,” Sharma said. “Speedy is well-positioned to help businesses with an affordable solution.”
But there’s reason to be wary of the tech.
For one, generative AI, no matter how good, can — and does — run amok. Thanks to a phenomenon known as “hallucination,” AI models sometimes confidently make up facts. And, as a result of biases and other imbalances in their training data, text-generating AI can spew toxic, wildly offensive remarks.
In another potential problem for brands, generative AI has been shown to plagiarize copyrighted work. One study found that an indirect predecessor to ChatGPT, GPT-2, can be prompted to “copy and paste” entire paragraphs from its training data.
Then there’s the matter of generative AI spamming up the internet. As The Verge’s James Vincent wrote in a recent piece, generative AI models are changing the economy of the web — making it cheaper and easier to generate lower-quality content. Newsguard, a company that provides tools for vetting news sources, has exposed hundreds of ad-supported sites with generic-sounding names featuring misinformation created with generative AI.
Sharma asserts that SpeedyBrand isn’t a content mill — and that it takes steps to mitigate any toxic content that the platform’s AI might generate. SpeedyBrand’s AI can be personalized to brand tone and generates provably “plagiarism-free” content, he claims, incorporating feedback from content edits to improve future output.
To what extent is all this true? It’s tough to say without a third-party audit. But brands, no doubt eager to jump on the generative AI train, appear to be embracing SpeedyBrand.
The company, which has a six-person team, has around 50 paying customers and over 1,000 users. Annual recurring revenue stands at $100,000, and Sharma anticipates that it’ll reach $1 million in the next year.
That’s impressive considering the competition. SpeedyBrand faces off against Typeface, which recently emerged from stealth with $65 million in venture capital. Startups like Movio, Copysmith, Copy.ai, Sellscale, Jasper, Omneky and Regie.ai, too, are using generative AI to create (ostensibly) better marketing copy, imagery and even video for ads, websites and emails.
It’s a large and growing market. Statista reports that 87% of current AI adopters are already using, or considering using, AI for improving their email marketing. Another report projects that the market for generative AI will be worth more than $110 billion by 2030.
Given that almost half of SMB owners handle content marketing themselves, there’s even stronger incentive within that cohort to adopt tools that could — at least on the surface — save time, money and massive headache.
“Speedy saves a company’s marketing workforce hours of marketing hustle — from strategy to content generation and then posting,” Sharma said. “Speedy gives them and their team hours back every day so they can focus on the core of their business.”
With the proceeds from the funding round, SpeedyBrand plans to roll out additional tools for text and image generation.

Indonesian aquaculture startup eFishery nets $200M at unicorn valuation,Catherine Shu,2023/07/07,"
After reports that it is raising new funding, Indonesian aquaculture startup eFishery announced today that it has netted $200 million in a Series D. The company, which makes a smart feeding system for fisheries, says this makes it the first startup in the global aquaculture industry to pass a $1 billion valuation. Its goal is to reach one million aquaculture ponds in Indonesia by 2025 and expand overseas.
The funding was led by Abu Dhabi-based 42XFund and included participation from Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan), Malaysia’s largest public sector pension fund, Swiss asset manager responsibility and 500 Global. Existing investors Northstar, Temasek and SoftBank also returned for the round, with Goldman Sachs acting as an exclusive financial advisor to eFishery. TechCrunch last covered the startup when it announced its $90 million Series C in January 2022.
eFishery cites a study by the Demographic Institute of the University of Indonesia (LDUI) that showed in 2022, eFishery contributed 1.55% to Indonesia’s gross domestic product in the aquaculture sector. This is significant because Indonesia has the second largest fishing and aquaculture industry in the world, ranking only behind China. According to the World Atlas, the country produces 5.8 million tons of fish each year.
Founded in Bandung, West Java in 2013 by CEO Gibran Huzaifah (pictured above), the fishery currently serves 70,000 fish and shrimp farmers in 280 cities across Indonesia. In addition to its IoT auto feeding system, eFishery’s platform includes marketplaces for selling fish and shrimp feed to farmers, fresh fish and shrimp products to B2B consumers and financial products for fish farmers.
Huzaifah started a catfish farming business when he was still in college. He told TechCrunch that during that time, he learned that feed management is crucial because 80% of total cost production is allocated to feeding. But many farmers still do hand feeding, resulting in uneven sizes of fish because not all get the same amount of food.
This is a problem because buyers have specific sizes of fish they want to purchase. Underfeeding isn’t the only problem, however — overfeeding results in nutrient runoff that pollutes water.
Huzaifah saw how tech was disrupting sectors like commerce, financial services and media, but “fish farming practice never changed in the last 30 years. I found it quite ironic that many innovations are developed to solve issues for urban citizens, like online shopping and food deliveries, but the essential sectors, such as agriculture and aquaculture, see almost zero digital innovation.”
After developing eFishery’s smart feeding system, however, Huzaifah faced resistance from fish farmers. After months of convincing them, “they finally wanted to try, not because they believed in the technology but because they pitied me.” One reason was that many farmers were not regular internet users. “I remember we had this Internet 101 with the farmers,” Huzaifah said. “We showed them how to create an email, use Facebook, get information from YouTube and other stuff.”
Even though Indonesia’s aquaculture is already very large, Huzaifah said it has only reached 7% to 9% of its total potential. Some challenges it faces includes fragmentation. Huzaifah explains that Indonesia has 34 provinces with different business practices, so it has to localize for each one.
“I learned the hard way that we have to respect the local players, including using local dialect and building relationships with the middlemen,” he said. “In one case, some middlemen poisoned our ponds. After having a discussion with them, we understood that they just want to do business, that they’re also entrepreneurs. So we found a way to turn them into our local partners because they have the local wisdom, connections assets and so on.”
At farms, feeding accounts for 70% to 90% of total production cost and much of it is still done manually, just as when Huzaifah was running his catfish farm. eFisheryFeeder automatically distributes feed to fish and shrimp and helps farmers control feed by sensing fish appetite through vibrations, which increase as they get hungry. The system allows farmers to manage ponds from their smartphones and collects data like daily fish usage, the type and brand of feed, how many fish have been produced, fish behavior and appetite, stock density and mortality rate.
With aquaculture so important to Indonesia’s economy, other tech startups are addressing different aspects of the industry. In addition to eFishery, startups that have recently raised funding include Aruna, Delos and FishLog.
In order to improve Indonesia’s aquaculture industry and increase the amount of fish it exports, Hazaifah said communities, the government and institutions have to work together to improve fishery operation infrastructure so they can handle larger volumes of fish and improve product quality.
The country should encourage sustainable aquaculture practices, like training, promoting advanced techniques and ensuring access to quality fish seed, to increase fish production, and also engage in trade negotiations to get more buyers. efishery plans to expand overseas by exporting fully traceable, antibiotic-free shrimp.
In a statement about the funding, 42XFund principal Iman Adiwibowo said, “The technology and comprehensive aquaculture solutions provided by eFishery have made a significant impact on the aquatech industry and have benefited small farmers in Indonesia. We are confident that eFishery will continue to promote a sustainable and inclusive economy, as well as contribute to environmental preservation goals not only in Indonesia but beyond.”

"Deel under fire for alleged questionable hiring practices, advice to other companies",Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/07/06,"
A California Senator is urging the state’s Labor and Workforce Development Agency to conduct an investigation into the business practices of fintech turned HR startup Deel.
Last week, Senator Steve Padilla (D-San Diego) sent a letter to Stewart Knox, California Secretary of Labor, alleging that Deel has hired hundreds of employees but classified them as independent contractors. By doing so, Senator Padilla charged, Deel is “effectively denying them the full suite of employment and social safety net benefits and labor protections they are entitled to, including healthcare, retirement, unemployment insurance, worker’s compensation, collective bargaining, and overtime pay.”
Further, Senator Padilla claimed that Deel “appears” to be advising its own customers (which include the likes of Nike, Subway, Reebok, Forever 21 and Klarna) “to misclassify their own employees and evade taxes in California,” as well as avoid paying employee benefits. Earlier this month, according to Padilla, Deel CEO Alex Bouaziz encouraged companies to leverage “the different ways of employing someone or assigning them as an independent contractor…..and therefore don’t put as much tax liability into your company.” He also encouraged companies to “spend some time on this topic” and offered to provide this as a service, stating “we can do that for you.” 
TechCrunch reached out to Deel for comment and Elisabeth Diana, a company spokesperson, provided the following statement:
“These allegations are completely made up and regurgitated from old news, most likely based on competitor hearsay. Compliance is literally what we do, in over 120 countries. We have to understand it for our customers, and we certainly practice it ourselves. Today we have over 50 compliance experts in house and an external network of country advisors. To advise clients on how to misclassify their workers would be at complete odds with our business model. We’ve also created a consortium with external academics called the Deel Lab for Global Employment to study and help prevent misclassification practices. In California we engage a handful of contractors for services, and in the US, contractors represent less than 1% of our workforce. Claims of misclassification there are ridiculous. Unfortunately Senator Padilla did not reach out to us for comment or facts prior to publishing his letter. We welcome speaking with him directly to provide factual information.”
The spotlight on Deel’s hiring practices came to light earlier this year when Insider published an article revealing, among other things, that even CEO and co-founder Alex Bouaziz was classified as an independent contractor. According to Senator Padilla, several employees “have reported being shocked to learn they had been hired as long–term contractors despite originally applying as full-time employees, and without the ability to choose.” Senator Padilla’s office told TechCrunch that the politician has asked for an investigation to determine if the practices mentioned in the article are accurate.
Many of the company’s employees, he said, have access to a range of benefits, including unlimited paid-time off, wellness stipends and reimbursements for gym memberships and doctor’s appointments. But, Senator Padilla alleged, they “continue to be denied the full suite of employment and social safety net benefits and labor protections they are entitled to, including healthcare, retirement, unemployment insurance, worker’s compensation, collective bargaining, and overtime pay, among others.”
“No company is above the law. Deel has been openly flaunting their violation of California labor laws, intentionally misclassifying their employees as independent contractors and denying them critical benefits,” said Senator Padilla in a press release. “California is clear on this issue; employees are entitled to benefits and protections. Corporations engaging in malicious employment schemes like this need to be held accountable and these employees need to see their rights restored.”
In January, TechCrunch reported that Deel had reached $295 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) by the end of 2022 and that it was profitable, according to Bouaziz. The startup, which offers global payroll and other services to companies around the world, was valued at $12 billion at the time of its last raise, although its current valuation is not known. It operates with a SaaS business model, meaning that it charges a subscription fee for its software.
Bouaziz and Shuo Wang started remote-first, San Francisco-based Deel in 2019 as an employer of record (EOR) — with the mission of allowing businesses to hire employees and contractors in other countries “in less than five minutes.” Deel also says that it gives companies the ability to pay teams in more than 150 currencies with “just a click.” It has since evolved its strictly fintech model to what it describes as a “full-stack,” “truly global HR platform” designed “to compliantly manage your entire workforce in just one system—from direct employees to international workers and everything in between.” It has more than 2,000 employees in 90 countries. 
Senator Dave Cortese (D-San Jose), chair of the Senate Labor, Public Employment and Retirement Committee, stated that an independent contractor is “a specific designation for self-employed people or businesses engaged in contract work.”
He added: “It’s not a gimmick for organizations to avoid paying for employee healthcare and other benefits or reducing their tax liability…Any company found breaking the law will be brought to justice, and they would certainly have no business advising other companies on labor law.”
Reporter’s note: TechCrunch was informed after this article was published that  Stewart Knox, California Secretary of Labor, had responded to Senator Pedilla’s letter with his own letter saying: “I take seriously the responsibility to ensure that workers receive their earned pay and benefits and that law-abiding employers compete on a level playing field. We are looking into the information that you provided and will follow up with our findings.”

So, how are Europe’s startups doing?
Pitch Deck Teardown: Nokod Security’s $8M seed deck



Whenever I spend time in the European startup world, a lot of the conversation is focused on how it can differentiate itself. One of the recurring questions is: How do we build a startup ecosystem? That’s an excellent question.
The beginnings of an ecosystem are there, but unlike in the U.S., where there are a handful of major hubs attracting the bulk of the talent and investment, in Europe, there is an appetite for experimentation that fails to fully settle into a coherent whole.
Looking to Silicon Valley might be a trope, but the San Francisco Bay Area is by far the most mature ecosystem around. California attracted more than $100 billion of venture investment in 2022. New York is in a distant second place with around $30 billion, followed by Massachusetts (or more specifically, Boston), with around $20 billion. Europe, in comparison, saw around $100 billion of investment in 2022. That sounds like a big number, but compare the size of the economy of Europe versus that of California.
Europe may be in a state of rapid growth, but as an asset class, VC is lagging behind. For every person living in Europe, $134 dollars are invested in the local ecosystem. For California, the same number is $2,650. Image Credit: Haje Kamps / TechCrunch
You can find office buildings and fast internet in most places, so how did a sprawling area around San Francisco become a working ecosystem? The history is long and complex, and hard to replicate: Stanford University engineering professor Frederick Terman was focusing on radio engineering in the 1940s. Fueled by the Cold War and a lot of defense money, he built a department and taught a bunch of the people who would found the first wave of tech startups in the area.
Stanford created a business park to go along with its research activities, and it kept evolving with the times. The region found itself in an upward spiral: More money invested meant that more engineering talent flocked to Silicon Valley, which sparked more innovation, which led to more tech companies, which in turn meant more defense money and the first few private investors looking to Silicon Valley for opportunities. Lockheed opened a plant in Sunnyvale, mostly because that’s where it could find engineers. Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard founded HP in 1939, and Shockley Semiconductors was founded in 1956 — the same year its namesake, William Shockley, was awarded the Nobel Prize for co-inventing the transistor. Early employees at Shockley left to found AMD and Intel, and from there, the rest is history: Silicon Valley had such a concentration of funds, talent and tech, that it was almost unstoppable.
Fast-forward some 70 years and Silicon Valley has only continued to grow. For startups, the way this shows up is that a lot of people got very wealthy from tech, and they further accelerated the ecosystem by founding new companies. But — crucially — they also became angel investors and advisers to others in the ecosystem. And because those acquiring other businesses are also often based in Silicon Valley, integrating the tech and the staff becomes a lot easier.
So how does this relate to Europe? Well, according to top European VC Creandum’s recent report, there are 65 cities hosting 514 “tech hubs” on the continent. Of course, it’s positive that the European startup scene is evolving and growing, but even after a couple decades of trying to make ecosystems thrive, Europe appears to be spinning its wheels. According to the report, “Europe finally has the pieces in place to challenge the US as the world’s leading tech ecosystem.” It sounds good, but there’s still a lot of work to be done before there’s a fully functioning, self-sustaining startup ecosystem in place. The truth is, every locale is trying to do it differently. That means there can’t be a single, force-of-nature strength ecosystem; instead, the result is a smattering of promising ecosystems that don’t truly get the job done.

15 investors lift the lid on the biggest surprises of H1 2023,Karan Bhasin,2023/07/06,"
The first half of 2023 hasn’t been kind to startups, but venture capital investors weren’t spared migraines either. Some VCs had a tough time of it, with their portfolio companies finding it hard to fundraise, while others dialed back their investment cadence to match the current investment climate. But what would they have done differently if they had a crystal ball? To find out, we asked 15 investors what they found to be the most unexpected trends of the year so far.
Rather unsurprisingly, the biggest surprises all seem to be related to AI in one way or another. Several investors said while they were caught unawares by how quickly generative AI took off, the real eyebrow-raiser was VC funds going from a conservative stance to jumping headfirst into AI-related companies’ cap tables seemingly overnight.
“The No. 1 surprise has been the speed of financings and valuations in the generative AI space. Probably no surprise there. But it really is a tale of ‘haves and have-nots’ in fundraising right now,” said Matt Murphy, partner at Menlo Ventures.

We’re looking for founders to participate in a TechCrunch+ survey about the usefulness of various founder-focused events.
If you’re a founder and have something to share about your experiences at such events, fill out this form.

Jenny He, founder and general partner at Position Ventures, had a similar take: “I was surprised at how quickly the AI boom happened in 2023 and how many top tier firms went from a wait and see approach at the end of 2022 to becoming very active in 2023. Some of our portfolio companies went from quiet insider rounds to very hot competitive rounds at a rapid markup at the beginning of 2023, spurred by the AI boom.”
Not all AI-related surprises were positive, though. John Tough, managing partner at Energize Ventures, was baffled by how readily some firms cannibalized their climate funds to buy into AI. “We knew generalist investor interest in climate was fleeting, but it has still been surprising to see how many household names planned to launch a climate focus area and then moved along to LLMs and AI instead,” he said.
For Rajeev Dham, partner at Sapphire Ventures, this rapid increase in AI investment also brought some worries. “There’s no question that advancements in AI will spawn an incredible set of companies, disrupt industries and be the transformative technology that drives far more productivity within existing companies, but my concern is that we’re still in the very first inning, which will lead to a lot of lost capital,” he said.
It wasn’t all about AI, though. Mark Grace, an investor at M13, was surprised by the range of early-stage valuations: “Valuation ranges are all over the place, especially at the Series A stage. We all know how quiet the later stages have been, and the seed market has seemed strangely resilient. However it has been interesting to see the wide variance in Series A pricing.”
As for what investors wish they’d done differently, several felt they should have been faster on the uptake and more active than they were. “In macro environments like this one you always regret not being more active while everyone else was fearful,” said Logan Allin, managing partner and founder at Fin Capital. “These cycles only come around so often and are a boon for net-new investments in portfolios.”
Jason Lemkin, CEO and founder of SaaStr, wishes he had taken the time to meet with more founders. “I slowed down in 2022 as did many, and should have picked it up more. Multiples are still relatively low in SaaS but great companies are being formed as often as ever.”
But our favorite answer to this question by far came from Howie Diamond, managing director and general partner at Pure Ventures: “Not have personally invested in First Republic Bank stock!”

We’re curious if you’ve run into any surprises in the startup investing world thus far in 2023.

The No. 1 surprise has been the speed of financings and valuations in the generative AI space. Probably no surprise there. But, it really is a tale of “haves” and “have-nots” in fundraising right now.
The No. 2 surprise is the scarcity of later-stage companies raising. It’s not that surprising, but behind the scenes, companies are still getting their houses in order, and it’s really difficult to sell right now, so companies are grinding through things until they find more predictability.
No. 3 would be the amount of M&A and companies trying to be acquired. We’re only going to see that accelerate.
In hindsight, what do you wish you had done differently in the first six months of 2023?
We mobilized the entire firm around GenAI and it paid off. We’ve got a strong portfolio and continue to invest. We’ve even got a handful of investors who are attending hackathons and coding in their free time. I only wish we’d started building that pipeline more purposefully in 2022. So many of these businesses are being started by founders leaving companies with pockets of AI talent, so you really need to be focused upstream on founders before there is even a full twinkle in the eye. We have been doing a great job of this so far, and really doubled down on Menlo’s Future Founders program this year.

We’re curious if you’ve run into any surprises in the startup investing world thus far in 2023.
Startup investing in 2023 has been defined by difficult macroeconomic headwinds on one hand and accelerating AI tailwinds on the other. The dichotomy has created a startup investing environment of haves and have-nots that has been quite interesting and, to some extent, surprising.
I’m surprised that the AI conversation is not centered more on the potential of AI for good. There are intractable problems that society has yet to solve where AI could offer a breakthrough. Technology has a history of presenting these types of breakthroughs and thus has been a harbinger of optimism.
AI is no different, and I see education as a prime example of where AI could offer every child individualized instruction that addresses their style of learning, pacing needs, and adaptive modalities. This could advance education practices for all learners and provide the inalienable right to education for all offered by a good society.
I’m obsessed with thinking through these types of scenarios and working on them, as AI will offer many breakthroughs for the world.
In hindsight, what do you wish you had done differently in the first six months of 2023?
While we spent time on it, we wish we had spent even more time with academics and researchers at top-tier institutions focused on AI. We believe a good subset of the AI generation’s decacorns will originate from deep technical research, much of which is in academic research labs today.

Should you move to a new state for tax savings before selling your startup?,Peyton Carr,2023/07/06,"

How much tax will you owe when you sell your company?
With a Section 1045 rollover, founders can salvage QSBS before 5 years



For company founders and shareholders with an exit on the horizon, this isn’t a myth — a move for tax reasons can make a lot of financial sense.
In tech hubs like the Bay Area and New York City, the highest tax brackets are at 14.4% (as of January 1, 2024) and 14.8%, respectively. In contrast, states like Florida and Texas have no state income tax, meaning there’s no capital gains tax at the state level.
Let’s consider the numbers: On a $30 million exit, a founder could save approximately $4.3 million by moving from California to Florida or approximately $4.4 million by moving from New York City to Florida. That’s a lot of incentive to pull up the stakes and head to Miami.
However, many times it’s not that simple. We all know that moving can be a tough decision, especially for those with strong roots in their community. Leaving behind your favorite golf course, local ski mountain, and your friend group can have a serious impact on your quality of life. And it can be heart-wrenching to pull your kids away from the home, friends, and school they know and love.
This is where some people can get into trouble.
What you need to know about moving to save on taxes
Paying less in taxes isn’t as simple as packing up, skipping town, and resurfacing with a new address in a tax-friendlier state.
As tempting as it may be, you can’t keep a foothold in Silicon Valley while dipping your toe in the Gulf Coast — and still save on taxes. The kids may be unable to stay in their Manhattan private school while you relocate to Miami.
 

			As tempting as it may be, you can’t keep a foothold in Silicon Valley while dipping your toe in the Gulf Coast — and still save on taxes.					


Living in both states won’t save you here; when it comes to taxes, you must be all-in at your new address, or you’ll likely owe taxes at your old address.  Unfortunately, some may not realize this until after they have spent a lot of time, money, and emotional investment.
Every state has its own rules for determining your residency for tax purposes, and you will not be able to fly under the radar if you’re a high-net-worth individual or top earner. High-tax states like New York or California pay especially close attention to those in the highest tax bracket. If you stop paying taxes at the state level, chances are the state will notice and challenge your new residency claim.
In other words, your move is likely to trigger an audit.
In particular, California’s Franchise Tax Board is known to be vigilant in monitoring individuals who attempt to terminate their California residence, making it all the more crucial to thoroughly plan and document your move.
Additionally, it’s important to consider the complexities of community property laws, which may impact your tax exposure if you have a spouse residing in California, even if you move to a lower-tax state. Proper legal and tax advice is essential to navigate these complexities and ensure a smooth transition.
Many people mistakenly think that splitting time between states and claiming the more favorable tax jurisdiction is easy. But when you have the means to travel and maintain more than one home, this doesn’t mean you get to choose the domicile that works most favorably for you when tax time comes. Simply spending 183 days of the year outside your high-tax state isn’t likely going to shrink your tax obligation.
Even after leaving high-tax states like New York or California, it’s important to be aware of potential tax obligations tied to passive income sources within those states. For example, if you continue to have passive income from partnerships, investment properties, or other sources within New York or California, you’ll need to file a nonresident return and pay taxes on that income in those states.
Additionally, having passive income sources in your former state can increase the likelihood of a residency audit. As a result, it’s important to carefully consider whether retaining those investments producing state-specific income aligns with your overall financial and tax planning goals.
Preparing to move
If you’re considering a move to a lower-tax state, it’s crucial to plan ahead and be prepared. The more time you give yourself before your company’s exit, the better off you’ll be. We recommend making a clean break from your high-tax state several years in advance to ensure a smooth transition. It’s also wise to assume that you may be subject to a state tax audit, so keep meticulous records and be prepared. "
Is political unrest taking a toll on Israeli startups?,Anna Heim,2023/07/06,"
Now that the first half of 2023 is officially behind us, we are going to get a flurry of data on VC investment around the world. This will allow us to paint a global picture and zoom in on countries where specific factors might be at play.
Today, we are looking at Israel by way of a new report from Israeli VC firm Viola. It offers data on how much capital Israeli startups raised in H1 and how that compares to previous years. But its authors also venture a few hypotheses on the reasons behind this decline.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

Both on my mind and on Viola’s, of course, is the political crisis Israel finds itself in since the beginning of 2023.
After the Netanyahu government announced its intent to overhaul the country’s judicial system and balance of powers, a series of anti-government protests have continued across the country.
Israel’s tech ecosystem didn’t stay out of the political unrest; entrepreneurs and investors have become key players behind anti-government protests. And more generally, concerns have emerged on the damage that could be done to the country’s economy, of which the tech sector accounts for a significant part.
With this in mind, let’s look at the data compiled by Viola to see how VC investment into Israel fared this year so far — unfavorably — and what might explain its decline.
It’s not looking good
With a provisional tally of $3.2 billion for the first half of the year, funding activity in Israel dropped by 73% compared to the same period in 2022, IVC data shows.
PitchBook data interpreted by Viola reveals a 50% year-on-year decline globally, meaning that Israel fared worse than the rest of the world. And $3.2 billion is also less than Israeli tallies in years prior to 2022.
Unsurprisingly, Israeli startups raised less in the first six months of this year than in the same period of 2021 ($13 billion). In the country, like elsewhere, 2021 was an outlier. But H1 2023 also falls short of H1 2020’s $5.7 billion total. It also fails to meet pre-pandemic levels; in H1 2018 and H1 2019, Israeli startups collectively raised $3.7 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively.
Breaking down the data by stage reveals that the latest and largest rounds are the most affected. The amount of capital that Israeli startups raised through mega-rounds fell by 80% compared to the first half of 2022; growth rounds amounted to 71% less year-on-year; and early-stage rounds saw a 56% decline.

DigitalOcean acquires cloud computing startup Paperspace for $111M in cash,Kyle Wiggers,2023/07/06,"
DigitalOcean, the cloud hosting business, today announced that it’s agreed to acquire Paperspace, a New York-based cloud computing and AI development startup, for $111 million in cash.
DigitalOcean CEO Yancey Spruill says that Paperspace’s infrastructure and tooling, once integrated with DigitalOcean’s products, will enable customers to more easily test, develop and deploy AI applications. As for Paperspace customers, they’ll benefit from DigitalOcean’s cloud services, he says — including databases, storage, app hosting, documentation, tutorials and a robust support system.
For now, Paperspace will remain a standalone business unit within DigitalOcean, and Paperspace customers won’t see immediate changes to their service.
“We’re excited to expand our portfolio tailored to the world’s small- and medium-sized (SMBs) businesses and startups with simplified AI and machine learning offerings,” Spruill said in a press release. “The combined offerings allow customers to focus more on building applications and growing their businesses and less on the infrastructure powering them.”
Paperspace was co-founded in 2014 by Daniel Kobran and Dillon Erb, graduates of the University of Michigan. Backed by Y Combinator and Jeff Carr, one of the co-founders of DigitalOcean, the company runs its own datacenters with custom-configured GPUs.
Paperspace initially focused on low-cost virtual machines, providing high-performance workstations for design, visualization and gaming in the cloud. But as AI entered the mainstream, Paperspace leaned hard into its AI offerings, launching a suite of tools designed for developing, training, deploying and hosting AI models in the cloud.
Prior to the acquisition, Paperspace raised $35 million from investors including Battery Ventures, Intel Capital, SineWave Ventures and Sorenson Capital.
Erb sees the acquisition as a step toward a comprehensive offering of cloud CPU and GPU compute to rival other vendors in the public cloud market. The combined power of DigitalOcean and Paperspace, he asserts, will let a new class of customer — particularly those on a tight budget — delve into AI- and machine learning-driven apps like generative media (e.g. OpenAI’s DALL-E 2), large language models (e.g. ChatGPT), recommendation engines and image classifiers.
“DigitalOcean is renowned for simplifying complex cloud technologies and making them more accessible to developers and business alike,” Erb said in a canned statement. “We’re thrilled to join forces with DigitalOcean, as we believe there’s no better company to unlock the endless possibilities of AI and machine learning for developers and businesses alike.”
The Paperspace acquisition is DigitalOcean’s first since 2022, when it bought Pakistani cloud hosting service provider Cloudways for $350 million, and its fourth since its public stock listing in 2021.
From the outside looking in, it’s a wise move for DigitalOcean, which risks being left behind in the surge for cloud AI and machine learning solutions. While the company’s revenue increased in Q1 2023, growing 29.7% to $165.13 million, earnings per share, return on equity and net margin fell short of expectations.
Increasingly, Big Tech cloud providers like Microsoft, Amazon and Google are turning to generative AI to boost revenues — with some success. A recent CNBC poll found that AI is now the biggest spend for nearly 50% of top executives across the economy, indicating it’s a wise place to invest resources.
Driven by the enthusiasm for AI, Gartner predicts that cloud spending will grow 21.7% in 2023, coming in just under $600 billion this year versus $491 billion last year.

SoftBank backs Japanese robotics startup Telexistence in $170M funding round,Kate Park,2023/07/06,"
SoftBank is backing Japanese robotics startup Telexistence, making good on the tech giant’s recent pledge to go back on the investment offensive in light of the current AI hype.
Tokyo-based Telexistence said Thursday that it has raised $170 million (23 billion yen) in a Series B round of funding from SoftBank, Airbus Ventures, Monoful Partners, KDDI Open Innovation Fund, a fund set up by Foxconn and CTBC Financial Holdings, and Globis Capital Partners. With the latest round, Telexistence has raised a total of approximately $193.5 million (27.5 billion yen) since its inception.
Founded in 2017, Telexistence develops AI-powered robotic arms for the retail and logistics industry. Last year, the company said it would deploy its robots in 300 FamilyMart convenience stores across Japan.
The company will use its fresh capital to bolster its workforce globally, CEO Jin Tomioka said in a statement. But aside from the funding, Telexistence is also announcing a strategic partnership with SoftBank Robotics Group, a unit of SoftBank Group, to ramp up its commercialization in North America. Telexistence is currently in talks with major convenience store chains in North America to conduct proof of concept in the near future, according to the company. Moreover, the startup said it will work with Foxconn to produce its next-generation robot, called “Ghost.”
SoftBank Robotics Group’s Kenichi Kent Yoshida, and Globis Capital Partners’ Ryohei Nomoto will join Telexistence’s board of directors as a result of their investment.
SoftBank has been more than a little bullish about investments in the robotics realm, having backed California-based Bear Robotics back in 2020. Via the SoftBank Vision Fund 2, it has also made investments in Shanghai-based Keenon Robotics, which specializes in developing service robots, and Opentrons, a medical testing robot developer.

A comprehensive list of 2023 tech layoffs,Alyssa Stringer,2023/07/06,"
Last year’s techwide reckoning continues. In 2023, layoffs have yet again cost tens of thousands of tech workers their jobs; this time, the workforce reductions have been driven by the biggest names in tech like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo, Meta and Zoom. Startups, too, have announced cuts across all sectors, from crypto to enterprise SaaS. 
The reasoning behind these workforce reductions follows a common script, citing the macroeconomic environment and a need to find discipline on a tumultuous path to profitability. Still, tracking the layoffs helps us to understand the impact on innovation, which companies are facing tough pressures and who is available to hire for the businesses lucky to be growing right now. It also, unfortunately, serves as a reminder of the human impact of layoffs and how risk profiles may be changing from here. 
Below you’ll find a comprehensive list of all the known layoffs in tech that have occurred in 2023, to be updated monthly. If you have a tip on a layoff, contact us here. If you prefer to remain anonymous, you can contact us here.
The running total of layoffs for 2023 based on full months to date is 201,860, according to Layoffs.fyi. Tech layoffs conducted to date this year currently exceed the total number of tech layoffs in 2022, according to the data in the tracker.

Big Tech corporate venture capital 🤝 generative AI startups,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/29,"
As the race to build generative AI tools for the enterprise devolves into a battle royale, Big Tech companies are busy wielding their most powerful weapons: checkbooks.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

Earlier today, Typeface raised $100 million at a $1 billion valuation, mere months after a $65 million round in February. It’s something to think about considering the company was founded in 2022. But even though we are once again seeing rapid-fire venture rounds at unicorn valuations, the investor list in Typeface’s round is worth noting.
Salesforce Ventures led the round. The CRM and cloud giant recently launched a $500 million fund to invest in generative AI startups, so its presence in this deal is not a complete shock, but the SaaS pioneer had company: Both Alphabet (through its GV investing arm) and Microsoft (through its M12 investing effort) invested in Typeface.
That’s a strange set of bedfellows: Salesforce and Microsoft have competing CRM products, and Microsoft and Alphabet compete in, to pick a few areas, search, productivity software, and public cloud infrastructure.
The Typeface cap table engenders a simple question: Where else are major corporate venture capital (CVC) investors putting their money to work?
To get a feel for the situation, I listed deals from a number of historically active CVC arms of major tech companies. Turns out, the Typeface round is funny for its internally competitive investor list, but it isn’t an outlier at all when it comes to Big Tech dollars flowing into startup accounts. The majors are busy these days. "
Speakeasy is using AI to automate API creation and distribution,Ron Miller,2023/06/29,"
Just about every developer wants to create APIs to help other companies connect to their services more easily, but creating and documenting an API is a time-consuming process. Speakeasy, an early-stage startup, wants to make that an easier and more automated set of activities.
Today, the company emerged from stealth with a $7.6 million seed investment.
Speakeasy co-founder and CEO Sagar Batchu describes his startup as an API infrastructure company, and that means it’s building tools to make it easier to create and distribute APIs, something that is near and dear to him as a developer himself. “We’ve started by working on an important problem to me, one that I’ve faced a lot myself as a developer, which is really dramatically simplifying how developers are able to ship APIs to end users,” Batchu told TechCrunch.
He sees APIs giving developers a kind of superpower. “As developers, APIs allow us to take advantage of another company’s capabilities. And so making it really easy to ship those APIs to developers means that we can really help companies accelerate how their products are adopted, as well as we reduce the burden on developers when they integrate with those APIs,” he said.
While the goal is to build a platform of features eventually to help with that mission, the company is starting with two tools, one to help developers create the APIs, and one to help their users implement them more easily.
The first piece is called Managed SDKs. Developers provide an Open API spec, and Speakeasy uses AI to help build a complete API for you along with the necessary documentation, reducing the amount of time it takes to complete a task like this to minutes.
“Speakeasy uses AI to validate and enhance the spec, creates SDKs in the most popular languages, and publishes automatically to package managers. It takes minutes to set up, and SDKs are updated every time the spec changes – saving developers significant time,” the company explained.
The second piece is designed to help the developer end user implement that API without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure, creating a package using HashiCorp’s popular Terraform tool.
“With Speakeasy, API producers can, for the first time, easily create and maintain Terraform providers from an OpenAPI specification – dramatically reducing engineering burden, while unlocking an entirely new developer community,” the company said.
The startup currently has nine employees, but is hiring engineers to help build out the platform further. As he builds the company, Batchu believes being remote will help him find a more diverse workforce. “So first of all, I think about how adopting a remote-friendly hiring philosophy means that we’ll be able to access more places, more diverse communities. It’s definitely something really important to us. And as we move forward, we will be looking to hire great talent from everywhere,” he said.
Today’s round was led by GV with participation from Quiet Capital, Flex Capital, StoryHouse Ventures and Firestreak Ventures. Last year the company raised an additional $3.3 million in a pre-seed round led by Quiet Capital with participation from a host of prominent industry angel investors.
The Managed SDK piece is generally available starting today. The Terraform piece is available in beta.
"
Level wants to back your fund — and your portfolio companies too,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/06/29,"
In 2023, funds of funds (FoFs) are on track to raise the smallest amount of money in more than a decade. At the same time, muted venture deal activity has many firms ditching their follow-on funds. Despite these twin trends, a new emerging manager is looking to find success with a fund that targets both.
Level Ventures has raised $104 million for its debut fund, a data-driven, three-pronged investing strategy that uses in-house algorithms to back other emerging managers, invest in promising companies from those managers’ portfolios and source deals of its own.
Albert Azout, the co-founder and managing partner at Level, told TechCrunch that the fund is based on an opportunity in the market he noticed when working as a partner at Cota Capital.
He said that many family offices — his own included — were seeing strong returns by backing small and emerging VC funds and enjoying further success by co-investing alongside those firms in their portfolio companies. He decided to launch Level to see if that strategy could prove successful as an institutional investing approach when driven by data.
“We wanted to disrupt the LP side of the equation,” Azout said. “Most LPs, even fund of funds and institutions, tend to underutilize technology. We wanted to build something that was tech-enabled that allowed us to better understand the ecosystem.”
The first key to getting the strategy to work, Azout said, was finding the right fund managers. Level is targeting emerging managers focused on sectors including enterprise automation, deep tech and life sciences. Within those categories, the firm taps its in-house data model that scores firms based on areas like how many board seats a firms’ investors are on, who they are connected with online and where they are investing.
“We spent a lot of time really making sure that our fund manager selection is optimal,” Azout said. “A lot of the early iterations of the technology was building a model and approach that would yield the top quartile of managers. But the dispersion of performance across early-stage managers is very large. Trying to find the best funds is a moving target.”
The firm looks to back funds that are less than $150 million in size that are either pretty institutional — maybe on fund two or three — or are a solo GP who brings more than just capital to the table. So far, Level has backed firms including Air Street Capital, Emergent Ventures and Work-Bench.
From there, the firm looks to use its data capabilities to keep tabs on underlying portfolio companies to unearth which startups make sense for Level to invest in when they raise their next round. Level also gives its portfolio of funds access to the data it uses.
Level’s approach to build data solutions to source and find companies puts it squarely in line with trends that have begun to gain steam in venture. An increasing number of firms are looking to build algorithms to uncover deals they would have missed otherwise or that wouldn’t have crossed their radar.
“We are seeing more and more firms adding automation and data to their sourcing process. It gives you alpha,” he said. “If you don’t have data capabilities, you will be disadvantaged from a sourcing perspective.”
But the firm doesn’t 100% leave it up to the data. Azout said that while the data is great to narrow down the field, there is always a human in the loop, proving how much people drive this industry.
What makes Level distinct from the other firms looking to add data is that for the majority of its direct strategy, the data isn’t helping it cast a wider net to find a better set of companies. Rather it mainly helps it find the most successful startups from the investors they are already backing. While this does set the firm up to potentially get a double homerun if a company ends up as a notable success, it also means failures will be two-fold, at least for the companies it backs with its own funds.
The firm currently has an even mix of investments in both funds and companies, but for its second fund will skew that ratio 75% toward funds and 25% toward companies. For now, it hopes this strategy helps unlock the best of both fund and direct investing.

"After aperitif ambitions sour, Haus is back on virtual shelves via The Naked Market",Christine Hall,2023/06/29,"
Haus, an aperitif company that tried to find a buyer last year after investor funding dried up, now has one.
The Naked Market, founded by Harrison Fugman and Alex Kost, has acquired certain assets of the low-ABV (alcohol by volume) beverage company from CPG Holding Co. and is now relaunching a few of Haus’ customer favorites, including Citrus Flower, Pomegranate Rosemary and Grapefruit Jalapeño.
Helena Price Hambrecht and then-husband Woody Hambrecht, launched Haus in 2019, and it quickly grew a following with millennials looking for beverages with all-natural ingredients, fun flavors and direct-to-consumer delivery.
When asked about the sale, Price Hambrecht told TechCrunch via email, “I am very glad to see the brand live on. I will always be incredibly proud of what we built, and look forward to seeing what the new owners will do with it in this next chapter.”
Fugman and Kost told TechCrunch that they did not know the Hambrechts prior to the purchase. The opportunity to grab select consumer-facing assets of Haus, including the brand and the intellectual property, stemmed from their experience in the space owning brands like Rob’s Backstage Popcorn and Flock Foods, and their own history as Haus customers.
“Given our background as foodies and operators in the food and beverage world, we were admirers of the brand and business that Helena and Woody created,” Fugman said. “We viewed Haus as one of the most iconic brands that’s been built in the industry over the past decade. Very few brands had an impact on the industry and consumers.”
Though the global beverage market is huge, it’s also kind of a small world. Both Haus and The Naked Market share a mutual investor, Great Oaks Venture Capital, though Fugman noted the VC firm was not involved in the acquisition.

Haus, a VC-backed aperitif startup, is up for sale after Series A falls through

How Haus lost its buzz
By 2022, the company was seeing $10 million in revenue and had a national distribution deal. It also attracted venture investors, raising $17 million on rolling SAFE notes from a group that included Homebrew, Haystack Ventures, Coatue, Shrug Capital and Worklife Ventures.
However, Haus was not immune to pandemic-related challenges, including supply chain woes and word-of-mouth not growing as intended.
“It was difficult to build the business that I wanted to build during the pandemic considering we were building a social product,” Price Hambrecht told TechCrunch at the time. “We didn’t have people gathering, we didn’t have natural word of mouth. We were a purely digital growth brand during that time, great for acquisition but not good for monitoring long-term behavior.”
Price Hambrecht chronicled the company’s journey on Twitter, and in August, after additional investor capital didn’t come through, told followers that Haus would go through a process called Assignment for Benefit of Creditors, an alternative to bankruptcy, which is where assets are put into a trust for the purpose of liquidation or distribution to pay off debts. Any assets left over go back to the debtor.
In November, Price Hambrecht updated that the sale did not lead to a buyer, tweeting, “Today the banker running Haus’ sale process informed me that the auction has concluded, and the company did not sell. Candidly, I did not expect this. He said this was a surprise to him as much as it was to me.”

“Haus 2.0”
Meanwhile, financial terms of the Haus asset acquisition were not disclosed, however, an interesting part of the deal includes plans by The Naked Market to give 5% of the company back to previous Haus employees, founders and investors through a structured program. Usually it is investors that are prioritized, and Fugman and Kost said this move is meant to show appreciation to those who worked hard to build Haus.
“The Haus community was really one of the main pillars of the brand, and this is our homage to continuing that community,” Kost said in an interview. “We thought this was a gesture to help continue that spirit as we look into Haus 2.0.”
As part of that new chapter, Fugman and Kost brought in Sonoma winemaker Micah Wirth, whose LinkedIn profile said he had been Haus’ general manager since January, to continue leading winemaking and R&D efforts. The aperitifs will continue to be sold online, and future plans include taking Haus into new categories within the food and beverage space by the end of the year.
Fugman and Kost say they ultimately want to continue the community, product quality and transparency aspects that Haus began four years ago.
“We plan to take these core principles and build on them while continuing to scale Haus’ key hero SKUs and expanding them into a new category,” Fugman said. “We have unbelievable respect and admiration for the product that Helena created and have decided to bring that back to the market.”

Halo.Car launches remotely piloted rental car deliveries in Las Vegas,Rebecca Bellan,2023/06/29,"
Halo.Car, a startup that uses remote operators to deliver rental cars to a customer’s door, has launched driverless operations in Las Vegas.
Driverless operations mean something different for Halo than they do for autonomous vehicle companies like Cruise or Waymo because Halo’s vehicles aren’t capable of self-driving.
The startup’s fleet is kitted out with a suite of six cameras, modems, antennas and other components to send data back to remote pilots at a Halo operations center. Those pilots then use the video and sensor data that’s streamed in to remotely drive the vehicles. Once a remote driver completes a car delivery, they hand over control of the vehicle to the customer and move on to the next vehicle awaiting remote delivery or collection.
Halo has been delivering vehicles to customers in Las Vegas using teleoperations for around a year, but a human driver has always been present in the front seat for safety reasons. Now Halo cars will be delivered to customers with no drivers in the vehicle.
This is an important step toward achieving Halo’s vision of on-demand vehicles being economically viable, according to Anand Nandakumar, founder and CEO of Halo.
That said, Halo isn’t at the stage where it’s hitting positive unit economics just yet. The company will still use a remote chase car that tails behind the remotely piloted vehicles initially. The driver of the tail car can stop the remotely piloted vehicle and take over if needed.
The tail car also acts as a buffer vehicle in case the Halo car needs to stop, thus preventing a potential rear-end accident with other road users. Halo’s cars will come to a stop if the system detects an anomaly, which means they meet Nevada’s minimal risk condition for AVs that says vehicles must be able to stop if there is a malfunction in the system.
Halo says it will ditch the tail car over the next year based on how the current operations perform. That’ll happen in phases across operation zones and depending on the times of day, according to Nandakumar.
While Halo might be the first company to successfully deliver remote-piloted EVs to customers in Las Vegas, it’s not the only one attempting such a feat. In December 2022, Arcimoto, the maker of the three-wheeled electric Fun Utility Vehicles, teamed up with Faction to develop EVs that can be delivered to a customer’s hotel through a combination of low-level autonomy and tele-assist technology.
Halo’s announcement Thursday comes after six months of intensive testing and training internally, says Nandakumar. The startup had originally targeted the end of 2022 for its driverless launch, but delayed in order to ensure the system’s safety.
“As we’ve seen in the rollout of AVs, there are a lot of scenarios to solve for when the vehicles don’t have a driver inside,” said Nandakumar, perhaps nodding to the many incidents of Cruise and Waymo robotaxis stopping in the middle of traffic and impeding traffic. “We want to make sure that our deployment causes minimal public disruption, and of course, is absolutely safe for all road users.”
That’s why connectivity is so important to Halo.Car’s business model. The vehicles are remotely piloted over T-Mobile’s 5G network, with AT&T and Verizon used for backup. Halo developed an algorithm that allows the data streams to use whichever network connection is strongest at any given time in order to ensure reliable, high-quality streaming and low latency.
Starting Thursday, Halo’s driverless vehicle deliveries are available in downtown Las Vegas between the hours of 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., and will expand to more areas of the city in the coming months. The startup’s fleet of 20 vehicles is made up of Chevy Bolt EVs and Kia Niro EVs, according to the company.
Halo says it plans to grow its fleet in Vegas to hundreds of vehicles before expanding to new cities in 2024.
“Our transition to driverless deliveries marks a significant milestone for us as a company. It proves that our remote-piloting technology is not just innovative, but commercially viable and ready to be scaled up,” said Nandakumar in a statement. “As we prepare to expand and launch new markets, our mission remains unchanged: to provide affordable, accessible, efficient EV transportation.”

Why does it seem like every startup is a SaaS company?,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/29,"
If you read enough startup coverage, you’ve noticed that no matter the part of the economy that an upstart tech company is attacking, there’s a pretty darn good chance that it is doing so through software. Software that the startup hosts and charges a recurring fee for customers to access or lever. Software as a service, in other words, or SaaS.
The reasons for this are manifold, but important to grok. First, software empowers. Workers can do more and more quickly with software than they could with pre-digital tools. Second, software is nearly impossibly flexible. It can fit everywhere all at once, solving myriad issues and improving output more generally wherever it lands. And third, software tends to have very attractive economics. This is doubly true for SaaS companies, which not only feature software-styled gross margins, but have recurring revenue to boot.

Enterprise SaaS companies continue to navigate a complex economic environment

That makes SaaS startups valuable in the abstract, as their core output — recurring revenue — is very valuable. Naturally, then, investors that want the most bang for their buck, and founders that want to dent the world with as much gusto as possible, tend to gravitate towards funding and building SaaS startups.
It’s not boring, we promise! To prove that to you, here is a smattering of recent coverage of the wide world of SaaS from TechCrunch+ from the last few weeks. (You can snag TechCrunch+ access here if you still need it!)

Snowflake and Databricks are massive SaaS business, one private and one public. Sure, they do not fit precisely into the Salesforce-style SaaS model of yore, but they offer software as a service and are also battling it out today to build the most fit-for-market enterprise LLM stack. And they are growing at a nearly bonkers clip as well. A great pairing to watch if you care about super-late startups in general.
SaaS startups are not all multi-billion dollar behemoths. Some are quite small. One such startup is Rubber Ducky Labs, which is building tech to help other companies improve their recommender systems. This isn’t tech that you would purchase as a consumer, but Rubber Ducky really does want to affect consumer purchases.
Broadening our lens a bit, let’s talk about vertical SaaS. The idea is simple: Find a particular business category, and build a tailored software solution for those companies. By picking a particular market segment, startups can go deep and build something that resonates. Some folks think that vertical AI is the “next logical iteration of vertical SaaS,” which is both an interesting hypothesis, and one that we agree with.

There’s so much more. Gusto is now doing more than a half-billion dollars in annual revenue while the HRtech space is itself maturing into a massive market. And all the while, the value of software revenue is slowly rebounding, rebuilding confidence in the SaaS model for startups once again.
It’s not all sunshine and roses, mind. During the 2021 tech and venture boom, a number of private-market investors overpaid for startup equity leading to some tough decisions in recent weeks. If it’s tough time for some venture players, it’s a tougher time for certain founders.
But one thing is clear: Even if SaaS evolves into a more on-demand model of selling, managed software services are going nowhere but into more places of our economy. And onto more venture capital betting books.

Social trading app Shares receives EU stock trading license,Romain Dillet,2023/06/29,"
Fintech startup Shares has raised $90 million for its stock trading app. And yet, the service is only available to people who live in the U.K. But that’s about to change as the company has received a couple of authorizations from French regulators. With EU passporting rules, Shares could also expand to other European countries.
As a reminder, Shares lets you trade stocks with no minimum trade size. The company offers fractional shares, which means that you can start investing with as little as £2. It competes with other neobrokers that try to make stock investment more accessible, such as Freetrade in the U.K., Bitpanda and Trade Republic in Europe.
But what makes Shares different from other mobile trading apps is that there’s a social twist. Shares lets you follow your friends and comment on their trades. Users can also create private chats and subscribe to communities of more experienced investors. So far, Shares has managed to attract 150,000 users in the U.K.
Shares just received the accreditation to operate an investment service in France from the ACPR (Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution), France’s financial regulator. And the company plans to take advantage of this license sooner rather than later as it plans to launch Shares in France starting next month. At first, you’ll need an invitation to create an account though.
France’s financial markets regulator (Autorité des marchés financiers) also recently granted the PSAN status to Shares — the startup is now officially a digital assets service provider in France, meaning that it will be able to handle crypto trades as well.
“We are very pleased to receive these authorizations: PSAN registration for cryptocurrencies, and PSI license for trading in stocks and ETFs. This is the reward of an extremely rigorous team effort, of which we are extremely proud. Shares is now regulated by the French regulator and this marks a decisive step in our journey, and allows us to announce our EU launch in July by invitation to our first members,” co-founder and CEO Benjamin Chemla said in a statement.
As you can see, today’s news is going to pave the way for future market expansions in the European Union.

Cyware lands $30M to modernize cybersecurity operations,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/29,"
Cyware, a startup developing products to help enterprises modernize their security operations, today announced that it raised $30 million in a Series C funding round led by Ten Eleven Ventures. Advent International, Zscaler, Emerald Development Managers, Prelude and Great Road Holdings also participated, bringing Cyware’s total raised to $73 million.
Cyware was founded in 2016 by Anuj Goel and Akshat Jain. Goel previously led efforts to research and implement ways to overcome silos within large security teams at companies including Citi. Jain came from Big Tech companies like Oracle and Adobe, where he specialized in building distributed systems.
With Cyware, Goel and Jain say they saw an opportunity to integrate threat intelligence with threat hunting, vulnerability and incident data through prebuilt workflows.
“An effective and proactive security posture relies on a multidimensional approach,” Goel told TechCrunch in an email interview. “When it comes to proactive threat response, it’s critical to connect the dots and quickly respond to a suspicious attack. The more accurate and faster the response to a threat, the less of an impact it has on an organization.”
So where does Cyware come in?
As Goel describes it, Cyware’s platform offers both no-code and low-code capabilities designed to help security teams automate their various threat-combating applications. Via collaboration components, teams can share threat intelligence in real time — with any luck, heading off attacks before they wreak havoc.
Extending the collaborative element, Cyware hosts a network that connects enterprise security teams with each other and with third-party threat data providers. This, Goel says, allows teams to receive threat intel, such as information about vulnerabilities, directly from security vendors, software providers and vetted tech companies.
On trend, Cyware uses AI to extract information from threat intelligence data, score the severity of threats and cluster similar threats together — ultimately combining all the data to generate a report with key insights. Cyware’s AI also provides code suggestions for security orchestration and generates detection rules and signatures that can be dropped into existing threat detection systems.
“Our solutions are built to handle volume and scale, enabling large security teams to effectively operationalize actionable threat intelligence while automating response actions without compromising on performance and speed,” Goel said.
Cyware, which has over 200 employees, doesn’t plan to grow its headcount anytime soon. Goel stressed that this isn’t cause for alarm, pointing to a growing customer base that spans Fortune 1000 companies, government agencies and regulatory bodies.
The fundraising is a testament to Cyware’s strength in a relatively weak market. According to Crunchbase, in the first quarter of 2023, cybersecurity venture capital funding dropped 58% year-over-year while deal flow dropped to 149 deals — the lowest total in years and a 45% drop from Q1 2022.
“Cyware’s platform is designed to reduce repetitive tasks for threat intel and security operations analysts, automate taking intelligent actions to proactively prevent attacks and deliver the right information to the right people at the right time,” he said. “CISOs and other C-suite managers benefit from consolidated dashboards and reports of threats, incidents and response actions, as well as the ability to action information quickly.”
Goel says that the proceeds from the Series C will be put toward expanding Cyware’s go-to-market efforts, market presence, channel business and strategic partnerships.

B Garage raises $20M for its warehouse inventory drones ,Kate Park,2023/06/29,"
B Garage, a San Jose-based startup building autonomous drones along with software to track warehouse inventory, said today that it has picked up $20 million in a Series A round of funding. 
New investor LB Investment led the Series A funding with participation from Ignite Innovation Fund, Krossroad Partners and existing backer SoftBank Ventures Asia. The proceeds, which bring the total amount raised by B Garage to $30 million, will enable the outfit to further develop and commercialize its drones and grow its engineering and business teams. 
The startup was founded in 2017 by Aiden Kim, a former software engineer at Oracle. Kim, who holds a PhD in aeronautics and astronautics from Stanford University, also previously participated in dog robot research at Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL), collaborating with Boston Dynamics for hardware development. (His team focused on creating artificial intelligence software for the dog robot research, Kim said.)
While studying for the doctoral program, Kim realized the lack of startups in the autonomous flight field, and he first came up with an idea in 2017 to build a company offering autonomous flight technology for drone manufacturers. After meeting industry experts in the U.S. in 2019, Kim shaped his plan to develop drones and management software for automated warehouse inventories. What he learned from the industry experts at the time was that industries like agriculture and logistics faced labor shortages, Kim told TechCrunch. 
“[Most] B2B logistics warehouses in the U.S. are far from urban areas and face a severe labor shortage,” Kim said. “The autonomous drone technology could be highly suitable for B2B logistics warehouse inventory management.”
B Garage’s mission is to address the labor shortage issue in those sectors by utilizing artificial intelligence and autonomous technology. 
The company has worked on a proof-of-concept pilot test with Kenco Innovation Lab, a unit of Kenco Logistics, for the last few months. Now it is planning to deploy its drones to more than 10 select Kenco warehouses across the U.S. by the end of 2023. It is also working with Incheon Port Authority in South Korea, aiming to commence the project by the year-end.
Companies like Verity, Gather AI and Corvus Robotics have also raised funding for their inventory drones. B Garage has tried to set itself apart from its rivals with four features: full autonomy that covers multiple aisles, no additional infrastructure required, mapping-free operation and automatic battery swapping.
B Garage’s drone can “navigate through multiple aisles, providing comprehensive coverage of warehouse spaces,” Kim said, adding that many other drone solutions are limited to specific paths or single aisles.

On top of that, users don’t need to integrate additional technology to operate drones with their warehouse infrastructure, so there are no extra charges. Competitors typically require an initial fee and ongoing operating costs for installing markers or beacons (indoor GPS) throughout the logistics warehouse and regularly updating the mapping, the CEO explained. 
Another differentiator, the startup claims, is the automatic battery swapping facility. 
“Our drones are equipped with advanced battery technology that enables efficient battery replacement,” Kim continued. If the drone’s battery runs out, the drone automatically returns to its dedicated battery swapping station, which replaces the depleted battery with a fully charged one from its inventory of pre-charged batteries in a matter of minutes. 
B Garage plans to continue enhancing its software solutions with the goal of integrating with its hardware to apply its technology to industries beyond logistics, such as defense and security, according to the company.
It also aims to introduce ground robots for inventory management, Kim said when asked about its plans. The ground robots will allow the startup to cater to a broader range of customers, providing comprehensive solutions for inventory management across various sectors, Kim explained.

Material Evolution raises $19M to decarbonize the cement industry,Paul Sawers,2023/06/29,"
In the industrial world, cement is about as omnipresent as materials get. But despite its clear and obvious utility, cement is responsible for some 8% of global CO2 emissions — if it was a country, it would be third biggest emitter globally, by some estimations.
While cement’s ubiquity comes largely down to how easy it is to produce and the relative cost, creating cement is hugely carbon-intensive due to the amount of energy required to make it. And this is something that U.K. startup Material Evolution is seeking to address with a new low-energy manufacturing process that it says requires zero heat.
Founded in 2017, Material Evolution today announced it has raised £15 million ($19 million) in a Series A round of funding to scale production of its low-carbon cement, which it says has an 85% lower carbon-footprint than normal Portland cement.
While Material Evolution is officially incorporated in the U.S., where it initially intended as its first target market, the company operates substantively out of the U.K., where its founders and team of 20 are based, and also where its entire product development takes place.
There are numerous companies out there trying to address cement’s carbon problem, including young upstarts such as Carbon Re and Carbonaide, both of which have recently raised venture capital (VC) cash. But Material Evolution points to its own proprietary technology as a key differentiator. Rather than using the energy-hungry kilns that are typical of cement making, the company says it uses an “alkali-fusion” process to produce cement at ambient temperatures, from various “industrial wastes and feedstocks,” circumventing the need for fossil fuels.
When Material Evolution talks about “alkali-fusion,” it’s essentially referring to a process based on similar principles to that of nuclear fusion.
“Fusion technology has been hailed as the way to meet humanity’s energy needs for [the next] millions of years, whilst emitting no carbon dioxide or greenhouse gases,” Material Evolution co-founder and CEO Dr. Elizabeth Gilligan said in statement.
The company says that its material is already used within industry, enabled in large part by a strategic partnership with materials company SigmaRoc, which is also a strategic investor in Material Evolution’s Series A round.
The company’s Series A was led by Kompas VC, with participation from Norrsken VC, Circle Rock, and SigmaRoc.

"Typeface, which is building generative AI for brands, raises $100M at a $1B valuation",Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/29,"
In 2022, Abhay Parasnis, the former CTO of Adobe, founded Typeface, a generative AI startup focused on enterprise use cases. With it, he hoped to leverage generative AI — which at the time was just beginning to come into vogue — to deliver personalized content for brands at scale.
Typeface, thanks in part to the hype around generative AI, caught on quickly, attracting Fortune 500 customers within its first year as well as partnerships with Salesforce and Google Cloud. And — perhaps more importantly — it won over investors, who this week injected hundreds of millions of dollars into the startup.
Today, Typeface closed a $100 million Series B round led by Salesforce Ventures with participation from Lightspeed Venture Partners, Madrona, GV (Google Ventures), Menlo Ventures, and M12 (Microsoft’s Venture Fund). Valuing the startup at $1 billion, the tranche brings Typeface’s total raised to $165 million.
Parasnis says that the new capital will be put toward expanding Typeface’s platform and growing the company’s team.
“Enterprise leaders are telling us across the board that they want to embrace generative AI, but they need a solution that meets their unique requirements and is ready for the enterprise,” Parasnis said via email. “They require an AI platform that keeps up with the lightning-fast pace of innovation and feels like a natural extension of their brand. They also need the assurance that their valuable proprietary content remains secure and confidential while seamlessly integrating into their existing workflows.”
The Typeface platform consists of three key components, Parasnis explained — the first being a content hub where users can upload assets and guidelines for “on-brand” text and image generation. The second, called Blend, uses AI to train and personalize content to a brand’s voice and style. As for the third, Flow, it provides templates and workflows designed to integrate into existing apps and systems.

Using Typeface, a content marketing manager could generate an Instagram post — or at least a product shot and caption — to promote the launch of a new product using brand-approved wording and assets. Or a demand generation manager at a business-to-business software-as-a-service company could repurpose an event video into a blog post, draft a follow-up email to attendees and more.
“We provide enterprises with a suite of secure, self-serve solutions that empower any employee to produce on-brand content from their content workflows,” Parasnis said.
There’s no shortage now of companies in the generative AI space. (See Jasper AI, for example, which also recently raised $125 million at a $1.5 billion valuation.) So what makes Typeface different?
For one, Parasnis makes the case that Typeface places a greater emphasis on brand governance, content safety and privacy than most of its competitors. The platform provides dedicated AI models for each customer, ostensibly ensuring that their assets and activity remain private.
What’s not entirely clear is whether Typeface’s models — and the content they produce — could be subject to legal challenges down the line. Pending cases against popular AI art tools Midjourney and Stability AI allege that they infringed on the rights of millions of artists by training their tools on web-scraped images. Meanwhile, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has yet to issue clear guidance on copyright protections for AI-generated works.
Parasnis isn’t anticipating headwinds, asserting that Typeface customers own all the assets they generate on the platform.
“Every part of the enterprise needs compelling, personalized content to drive results, and that too, more at a rapid pace,” he said. “Typeface revolutionizes the way enterprises deliver content, empowering every facet of the organization to drive exceptional results with unprecedented speed.”
It might not matter — for now. The risks don’t seem to be dampening the enthusiasm around generative AI. According to a survey by FreshBooks, 25% of business owners say that they’re currently using or testing generative AI tools while two out of three say they’ll try generative AI for work within the next 12 months.
VCs aren’t shying away either, clearly. According to a PitchBook report released in March, venture firms have steadily increased their positions in generative AI, from $408 million in 2018 to $4.8 billion in 2021 to $4.5 billion in 2022. Angel and seed deals have grown as well, with 107 deals and $358.3 million invested in 2022 compared with just 41 and $102.8 million in 2018.
“With a significant demand among enterprises for personalized generative AI, we must rapidly expand our platform and continuously innovate to meet enterprises’ distinct needs,” Parasnis said. “Moreover, we will expand our exceptional team with deep AI, software-as-a-service and enterprise marketing expertise to enrich the value we offer to our growing community. This funding serves as the catalyst for a robust product roadmap and go-to-market expansion, empowering enterprises to effortlessly generate personalized content at every customer touchpoint, safely and from within their existing enterprise workflows.”

India’s startup funding slides 68% after Tiger and SoftBank make virtually no deals,Manish Singh,2023/06/29,"
Indian startups experienced a significant contraction in funding in the first half of 2023 as some kingmaker late-stage backers quelled new investments in the South Asian nation amid a slowdown in the broader public market.
The first six months of 2023 saw Indian startups raise a mere $5.46 billion, a substantial 68% decline from the $17.1 billion during the same timeframe in 2022 and a drop from $13.4 billion in H1 2021, as per data from market intelligence agency Tracxn shared with TechCrunch.
This year has thus far failed to yield any fresh unicorns in the Indian startup ecosystem, a stark contrast to the 18 new entrants to the billion-dollar club in H1 2022 and 16 minted during the corresponding period the previous year.
The funding drought is permeating startups across different stages. A total of 325 seed funding deals were struck in H1 2023, a dramatic fall from the 936 in the same period in 2022 and 921 in H1 2021, according to Tracxn’s data.
Other early-stage funding rounds, chiefly Series A and Series B, dwindled to 108, compared to 296 and 211 in the equivalent periods in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Late-stage funding also suffered, slumping to 36 deals from 137 and 114 during similar periods the prior years.
The slowdown comes as many late-stage investors, previously prolific backers of Indian startups, have taken a step back. Tiger Global has done just one deal in India this year, according to Tracxn and Crunchbase, whereas SoftBank (which deployed over $3 billion in India in 2021) and Insight Partners (which backed several late-stage startups last year and in 2021) wrote virtually no checks.
Instead, SoftBank has been bulking up liquidity. For the last several weeks, SoftBank has been selling a portion of its Paytm stake each day, according to a market source familiar with the matter. Chief executive Masayoshi Son said at the company’s annual general meeting last week that SoftBank, which has invested just $650 million through its Vision Funds across the globe in the past two reported quarters, plans to go on the “counteroffensive” soon by resuming AI investments.
Tiger Global, which has deployed over $6.5 billion into Indian startups altogether, is highly unlikely to forge investments in new startups in India for a few more months, a partner at the firm told a founder recently. Scott Shleifer, who oversees startup investments at the New York–headquartered hedge fund, which recently disclosed securing $2 billion for its new fund, said on an investor call earlier this year that returns on capital in India have “historically sucked.”
He said, “If you look at the market-leading internet companies, whether it is Google, Facebook, Alibaba or Tencent, revenue for them got bigger than cost more than a decade ago. You had a great legacy of last 17–18 years of materially profitable internet companies. So returns on equity in the internet got really high and the returns for investors have been really high. But that did not happen in India.”
SoftBank and Tiger Global are investors in 33 of the 65 Indian startups that attained the unicorn status in 2021 and 2022. All put together, India has 102 unicorns.
As some of the prominent late-stage names sit on the sidelines, sovereign funds, especially from the Middle East region, have financed the vast majority of those deals in India in recent quarters.
Rahul Chandra, a seasoned investor and co-founder of Arkam Ventures, said he doesn’t anticipate the return of some prolific late-stage investors to their customary investment activity for at least another two years in India.
The lack of participation from late-stage backers and virtually no IPOs have also hurt the appetite of many midstage investors, who are struggling to devise new underwriting models that reflect the current public market view. Several high-flying Indian startups, including Byju’s, Swiggy and PharmEasy, have experienced a dramatic downward adjustment in their valuations — by a staggering 50% or even more.
Despite this setback, there remains a ray of hope for Indian startups in the form of considerable “dry powder” – untapped capital reserves held by venture capitalists. Almost every active VC firm in India, including the likes of Peak XV Partners, Lightspeed, Accel, Elevation Capital, Matrix Partners India, 3one4 Capital and Blume Ventures, have secured new and larger funds in the past 18 months.
Arkam co-founder Chandra said that it’s likely the pace of investments will pick up in the coming months.
“What we are contained by is mostly locally available capital, which I expect will be behaving in a rational manner because there’s no irrational exuberance coming in to drive valuation up. It’ll still mean that people are chasing each other for termsheets for the good founders because the next two years there will be more capital that will get deployed,” he told TechCrunch in an interview.
Indeed, Peak XV, Lightspeed, and Accel have escalated their deal deliberations and are on track to closing nearly 50 early-stage deals since mid-March, according to people familiar with the matter.

Lightspeed says India not for the faint-hearted amid Sequoia split

Visa acquires Brazilian fintech startup Pismo in $1B blockbuster deal,Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/06/28,"
Credit card giant Visa is acquiring Brazilian payments infrastructure startup Pismo for $1 billion in cash in what is likely one of the largest fintech M&A deals taking place this year so far.
Founded in 2016 by Juliana Motta (CPO), Ricardo Josua (CEO), Daniela Binatti (CTO), and Marcelo Parise (VP of engineering), São Paulo–based Pismo has quietly racked up a list of big-name customers, including Citi, Itaú (one of Brazil’s largest banks), Revolut, N26, Nubank and Cora. The startup processes almost 50 billion API calls and $40 billion in transaction volumes annually, and powers almost 80 million accounts and over 40 million issued cards.
For some context of the explosive growth Pismo has seen, at the beginning of 2021, it was doing less than $1 billion per month in transaction volume, according to Josua. It ended 2020 with fewer than 10 million accounts total.
Over time, Pismo has expanded out of its home country and now also operates in several countries across Latin America, including Mexico and Chile, as well as in the U.S. and Europe. The startup also has some customers in India, Southeast Asia and Australia.
Pismo’s cloud-native issuer processing and core banking platform is aimed at giving banks, fintechs and other financial institutions “flexibility and agility,” the company shared when it raised $108 million in Series B funding in October of 2021. It does things like allow customers to launch products for cards and payments, digital banking, digital wallets and marketplaces. Pismo also claims to allow financial institutions to “take charge of their core data and use it intelligently.”
In a written statement, Visa said that by acquiring Pismo, it “will be positioned to provide core banking and issuer processing capabilities across debit, prepaid, credit and commercial cards for clients via cloud native APIs.” The startup’s platform will also enable Visa to provide support and connectivity for emerging payment rails, like Pix in Brazil, for financial institution clients, the company added.
“Through the acquisition of Pismo, Visa can better serve our financial institution and fintech clients with more differentiated issuer solutions they can offer their customers,” said Jack Forestell, Visa’s chief product and strategy officer, in a written statement. The deal, which is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, is slated to close by year’s end. Pismo will retain its current management team, who will remain based in São Paulo.
SoftBank, e-commerce giant Amazon and Silicon Valley–based venture firm Accel co-led the startup’s Series B raise. Falabella Ventures, PruVen and existing backers Redpoint Ventures and Headline also participated in the financing, which brought Pismo’s total funding raised to $118 million. The company did not share its valuation, but Accel partner Ethan Choi told TechCrunch that the sales price was “a very strategic multiple.”
As a SaaS business, Pismo mostly made money by charging transaction fees. It has charged per active account, so prices decrease based on volume. In other words, the more clients a customer has, the less they pay per account.
In a written statement, Josua said: “At Pismo, we aim to enable our clients to launch cutting-edge payments and banking products within a single cloud-native platform — regardless of rails, geography or currency. Visa provides us unrivaled support to expand our footprint globally and help shape a new era for banking and payments.”
Visa was reportedly just one of several companies bidding for the startup, which was not seeking to be acquired, or even fundraising, according to Choi.
“Pismo wasn’t on the block,” he told TechCrunch. Besides the transaction representing “one of the largest LatAm cross-border fintech deals that has happened,” Choi believes it is also “an example of a global card network deciding that they would like to get closer to the banks and the financial institutions they work with by providing core banking and card issuing services to them, in addition to their credit card and debit card rails.”
He added: “There are a lot of synergies to be able to sell these really critical APIs to their existing financial institution customers.”
It’s not the first infrastructure play on Visa’s part. In March 2022, it closed on its $2.15 billion acquisition of Tink, a leading fintech startup in Europe focused on open banking application programming interfaces.
The credit card behemoth also famously abandoned its planned $5.3 billion acquisition of Plaid, a U.S.-based popular open banking startup, before having to call off the acquisition after running into a regulatory wall.
No doubt that Pismo getting scooped up by Visa is a coup of sorts for the entire Latin America region, which saw a surge in global investors pouring capital into the region in 2021 and a bit of a retreat since. It’s also a comeback story, considering that in 2019, Pismo was running out of the cash it had raised in a $900,000 seed round in 2016. In fact, things were so dire that Binatti and Parise even sold their only car in order to fund Pismo’s operations. Now the company’s just over 400 workers will become Visa employees.
The deal also marks the second time that Accel has purchased a financial infrastructure company that ended up getting acquired soon after. In 2020, consumer financial services platform SoFi announced that it was acquiring payments and bank account infrastructure company Galileo for $1.2 billion in total cash and stock. That company was founded in 2000 and bootstrapped to profitability before Accel wrote it a $77 million Series A check in 2019.

"Brex refocuses on startups with hire of SVB veteran, ex-a16z operating partner",Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/06/28,"
Just over one year ago, spend management decacorn Brex declared that it was “less suited to meet the needs of smaller customers” in an announcement that caused shock waves in the startup community.
While Brex soon clarified that by smaller customers it meant small to medium-sized businesses and non-funded startups, the move still felt like a stunning reversal, considering the company had started its life as a credit card company for startups. The announcement came about two months after Brex announced a “big push into software” and that it was placing greater emphasis on moving upmarket to serve larger, enterprise customers.
But then in March, Silicon Valley Bank imploded. 
Brex was one of the bidders for the early-stage and growth portfolios of the bank, which was known for providing a swath of financial services to the startup community. Ultimately, First Citizens Bank took over, but some of those former clients shunned the idea of working with such a large bank and opted to move their accounts to fintechs such as Brex, Mercury and Arc. While Brex declined to share specifics on just how many former SVB customers in total have migrated their accounts, it did say that it opened 4,000 new accounts and received $2 billion in deposits in the first week after the SVB shutdown alone.
That influx of new customers led Brex to rethink its priorities, and strategy.
Today, the company told TechCrunch exclusively that it has tapped Jason Mok, a former Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) operating partner and more than 16-year veteran of Silicon Valley Bank as its new head of startups. In his new role, which he assumed in April, Mok will be helping founders navigate both today’s macroeconomic environment and the recent banking crises, as well as the promise of exciting technologies like generative AI. 
Via email, Brex co-founder and co-CEO Henrique Dubugras told TechCrunch that “founders and startups have always been at the core of Brex.”
He added: “The community needs our support more than ever given the broader macro and collapse of SVB. When it came to hiring someone to lead our startups organization, it was crucial to find someone who shared Brex’s pride and passion for startups; Jason fits the bill.”
At a16z, Mok managed the firm’s seed fund. And at SVB, he served as the managing director and sector head of consumer internet. Interestingly, Mok’s father also worked at SVB in the early 1990s, in a similar capacity as Mok did.
“So I grew up around SVB,” Mok recalls. “I just grew up around Silicon Valley Bank, founders and entrepreneurs, scaling with companies and venture capital.”
While at the organization, Mok said he worked on everything from early stage to growth to venture to warehouse facilities to lending.
“I learned a ton. SVB was like the best place to get your ‘MBA’ for everything about technology, finance, startups and venture capital,” he said.
In 2020, Mok was recruited by a16z to serve as an operating partner to oversee corporate development before overseeing the firm’s seed fund strategy. He left the firm in September 2022, he said, to focus on family before getting recruited by Brex this spring to help lead its renewed focus on startups.
Admitting that he was “heartbroken” by what transpired at SVB, Mok said he was drawn to the opportunity of helping the startup community in a new capacity.
“SVB was a stalwart that enabled so much of what currently is the tech and innovation ecosystem. It was amazing to see so many different people and companies come out of the woodwork to really do their part in helping prop up the innovation system,” Mok said. “Specifically, it was amazing to see Brex step up the way that it did.”
Image Credits: Jason Mok / Brex
In his new role, Mok said he will be helping guide the post-SVB opportunity for Brex and how the company is “thinking about delivering for startups in the future.”
“Brex is the only non-bank alternative offering a full financial stack, including banking, bill pay and credit cards,” he told TechCrunch. “I’ve joined to add some additional leadership strategy and reaffirm Brex’s commitment to delivering to startups. Over time we have expanded to serving enterprises but startups and founders are at the core of what we do and we want to make sure we continue to iterate, evolve and grow with founders as they scale beyond startup.”
Part of that, Mok said, will include discussing with founders what they need in terms of products so that they can “scale faster and iterate better.”
The company also wants to be more present physically, by hosting events in various cities such as San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles, for the startup community and offering more “Brex ambassadors” that can serve as the face of the brand that founders, operators and VCs can go to for advice, perspective and connections to other founders.
“I’ll be overseeing all of that and really our go-to-market function,” Mok said.
He’ll also help with the further building out of Brex’s business accounts as well as “further optimizing and improving” the company’s onboarding process.
Brex said it has also named Nadav Lidor as the company’s lead for banking products catered to startups. Lidor, who leads Brex’s Israel office, will be focused on Brex business accounts — cash management accounts with FDIC insurance through partner banks and a suite of money movement tools across ACH, wires and checks. 
In late May, Brex shared that two of its products — Empower, its spend management platform, and Brex business accounts — had “each achieved $100 million in ARR,” or annual recurring revenue.
The company added that since launching Empower last year, Brex has signed on companies such as Coinbase, Indeed, SeatGeek, Lemonade and DoorDash, among others. It also said that its business accounts, which it describes as cash management accounts with a suite of money movement tools across ACH, wires and checks, had seen “rapid growth due to the ease of use and up to $6M in FDIC insurance coverage.”
Brex also recently announced it was going global.

Celestial AI raises $100M to transfer data using light-based interconnects,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/28,"
David Lazovsky and Preet Virk, technologists with backgrounds in semiconductor engineering and photonics, came to the joint realization several years ago that AI and machine learning workloads would quickly encounter a “data movement” problem. Increasingly, they predicted, it would become challenging to move data to and from compute hardware as AI models scaled past what could be kept on the die of any one memory chip.
Their solution — architected by Phil Winterbottom, previously a researcher at the distinguished Bell Labs — was an optical interconnect technology for compute-to-compute, compute-to-memory and on-chip data transmission. Along with Winterbottom, Lazovsky and Virk founded a startup, Celestial AI, to commercialize the tech. And now that startup is attracting big backers.
Celestial AI today announced that it raised $100 million in a Series B round led by IAG Capital Partners, Koch Disruptive Technologies and Temasek’s Xora Innovation fund. The tranche, which brings Celestial AI’s total raised to more than $165 million, will be used to support the production of Celestial’s photonics platform by expanding the company’s engineering, sales and technical marketing departments, according to CEO Lazovsky.
Celestial has around 100 employees at present — a number that Lazovsky expects will grow to 130 by the end of the year.
“Today, compute and memory are closely coupled. The only way to add more high bandwidth memory is to add more compute, whether the additional compute is required or not,” Lazovsky told TechCrunch via email. “Celestial’s tech enables memory disaggregation.”
In a data center, memory is often one of the most expensive resources — in part because it’s not always used efficiently. Because memory is tied to compute, it’s challenging — and sometimes impossible, due to bandwidth constraints and sky-high latency — for operators to “disaggregate” and pool the memory across hardware within the data center.
According to an internal Microsoft study, up to 25% of memory in Azure is “stranded,” or left over, after the servers’ cores have been rented to virtual machines. Reducing this stranded memory could cut data center costs by 4% to 5%, the company estimated — potentially significant savings in the context of a multibillion-dollar operation.
Celestial — which began as a portfolio company of The Engine, the VC firm spun out of MIT in 2016 — developed an ostensible solution in its photonics-based architecture, which scales across multiple-chip systems. Using light to transfer data, Celestial’s tech can beam information within chips and chip-to-chip, making both memory and compute available for AI — and other — workloads.

Celestial also claims that its tech can reduce the amount of electricity necessary for data movement, indirectly boosting a chip’s performance. Typically, chips devote a portion of the electricity they draw to data movement between their circuits, which takes away from the electricity that the chip can direct to computing tasks. Celestial’s photonics reduce the power required for data movement, allowing a chip to — at least in theory — increase its compute power.
Celestial’s photonics tech, which is compatible with most industry interconnect standards (e.g., CXL, PCIe), delivers 25x higher bandwidth and 10x lower latency and power consumption than optical alternatives, the company asserts.
“With the growth in AI , especially large language models (LLMs) and recommendation engine workloads, there is a shift towards accelerated compute,” Lazovsky said. “The key problem going forward is memory capacity, memory bandwidth and data movement — i.e., chip-to-chip interconnectivity — which is what we are addressing with Celestial’s photonic fabric.”
Celestial is offering its interconnect product through a licensing program and says that it’s engaged with several “tier-one” customers, including hyperscalers and processor and memory companies.
The interconnect product appears to be priority number one for Celestial. The company sells its own AI accelerator chip, dubbed Orion, built on Celestial’s photonics architecture. But as investors told TechCrunch in a recent piece for TC+, AI photonics chips have yet to overcome engineering challenges that would make them practical at scale. Unless Celestial stumbled upon breakthroughs in the areas of data-to-analog conversion and signal regeneration — top stumbling blocks for today’s photonics chips — it’s unlikely that Orion is much further along than the competition.
Chip aside, Celestial has a number of competitors in a photonic integrated circuit market that could be worth $26.42 billion by 2027.
Ayar Labs, which makes chip solutions based on optical networking principles, has raised over $200 million in venture capital since its founding in 2015. Renovus, another rival, recently landed a $73.9 million investment.
There could be consolidation ahead in the broader optical interconnection space, though. Around three years ago, Marvell bought Inphi, an optical networking specialist, for $10 billion. After a period of quiet, Microsoft last year acquired Lumenisity, a startup developing high-speed optical cables for data center and carrier networks.
Both Inphi and Lumenisity were targeting different use cases with their tech. But the enthusiasm from Big Tech around optics and photonics is worth noting.
“Our photonics technology is truly differentiated and is unique with superior characteristics,” Lazovsky said. “Given the growth in generative AI workloads due to LLMs and the pressures it puts on current data center architectures, demand is increasing rapidly for optical connectivity to support the transition from general computing data center infrastructure to accelerating computing.”
Samsung Catalyst, Smart Global Holdings, Porsche Automobil Holding SE, The Engine Fund, imec.xpand, M Ventures and Tyche Partners also participated in Celestial’s Series B.

"As $100M+ venture rounds evaporate, IPOs might have to carry the weight",Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/28,"
Earlier this year we wrote that the “the $100 million venture round is going extinct.” Often our predictions wind up sideways. This time we were on the right track.
According to new data from PitchBook, the U.S. venture market is continuing to endure lackluster velocity for nine-figure investments into private companies, colloquially referred to as “mega-rounds.”

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

In the first half of 2023, PitchBook counted just 108 mega-rounds in the United States. If we presumed that this rate will hold throughout the year, we’re looking at just over 200 nine-figure deals in the U.S. in 2023. That’s a dramatic decline from prior levels. Starting in Q4 2020 through Q3 2022, there were more than 100 mega-rounds recorded per quarter. In 2021, the average was more than 200 per quarter. To see perhaps 200 this year implies that the number of late-stage startups that will be able to raise an IPO-sized round is in free fall.
The rounds are also getting smaller, with data indicating that the average nine-figure round size has fallen under the $200 million mark, exclusive of a few rounds that are hardly traditional venture deals, like OpenAI’s massive round earlier this year. Smaller mega-rounds, and fewer of them, is a tough mix for unicorns of all stripes and sizes.
Of course, we could see nine-figure rounds rebound in other markets. Europe and Asia have seen their fair share of the transactions historically. But as the United States’ venture market is the largest in the world and was once the leading player in mega-round financings, where the U.S. goes, so, too, goes the world.

Cava’s explosive IPO hints that public markets are more ready for growth-stories than founders thought

If unicorns here are struggling to find fodder in the quantity that they became accustomed to, other startups around the world are likely enduring a similar dearth of capital.
Notably PitchBook thinks that “the need for capital likely leading to an uptick in mega-rounds as the year progresses” thanks to “the notion that depleting cash runways will force more of these startups to raise in the harsher dealmaking environment,” it still expects full-year mega-round tallies to come in at dramatically reduced levels compared to prior years.

Techstars raising $150 million for new accelerator fund,Annie Njanja,2023/06/28,"
Startup accelerator Techstars is raising $150 million for its new fund, SEC filings show. The accelerator is seeking new capital ahead of the end of the deployment period of its third institutionally-backed fund, Techstars Accelerator 2021, later this year.
Techstars declined to offer details on how it intends to use or deploy the funding, citing regulatory restrictions. However, like its predecessors, the new fund, Techstars Accelerator 2024, is expected to be used for accelerator-stage and/or post-accelerator investments.
Notably, the Boulder-based early-stage investor has used its current fund only for accelerator-stage investments. Its previous funds backed startups both during the accelerator stage and with follow-on investments after the program.
Fund 3 aimed to back more than 800 pre-seed and seed startups that are part of its global accelerator programs by the end of 2023. Through its accelerator groups, Techstars has so far backed over 3,500 early-stage startups in various sectors, including health tech, fintech, web3 and clean tech.
Startups going through Techstars’ three-month program receive $20,000 and a $100,000 convertible note in exchange for 6% to 9% of common stock, in addition to access to its network and mentorship, amongst other resources.

Techstars debuts new fund for companies too early for its own accelerator

Founded in 2006, Techstars runs more than 50 accelerator groups in major cities across the globe, including New York, Los Angeles, London, Boston, Tel Aviv and Lagos. The accelerator launched the Lagos arm last year in partnership with ARM Labs as part of its plan to expand its specialist and generalist programs globally.
To double down on its growth and expansion plans, Techstars recently launched new funds to bolster its investment efforts.
Last year, for instance, it launched Rising Stars, a fund to back startups that are too early for its accelerator programs. Under this fund, Techstars will issue $100,000 checks in exchange for 7% to 10% equity.
The accelerator also launched the $80 million Advancing Cities Fund in partnership with JPMorgan to back over 400 startups by diverse founders in nine cities across the U.S.

Techstars names Maëlle Gavet CEO as the accelerator group looks to expand

OpenAI brings the competition to DeepMind’s doorstep with new London office,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/28,"
OpenAI is expanding overseas. To London, specifically.
Today, the Microsoft-backed AI startup announced that it plans to open an office in London, its first international outpost. When OpenAI’s London location opens its doors, it’ll focus on advancing “research and engineering capabilities” while balancing collaborating with “local communities and policymakers,” according to CEO Sam Altman.
“We see this expansion as an opportunity to attract world-class talent and drive innovation in AGI development and policy,” Altman, who reportedly had floated Poland and France as alternatives for the office, said in a canned statement. “We’re excited about what the future holds and to see the contributions our London office will make towards building and deploying safe AI.”
London is a conspicuous choice for OpenAI, which hasn’t expanded beyond its San Francisco headquarters since its founding in 2015. The city is the longtime home base of DeepMind, Google’s largest AI research division, and a wellspring of data science talent, owing to its rich academic history and renowned universities.
Broadly speaking, London is also becoming a booming center for AI startup ventures. According to a recent report, as of 2021, over 1,300 AI companies were based in London and the city was the top-funded in the U.K. in terms of venture dollars invested.
The city is also important politically to tech companies heavily invested in AI, like OpenAI, which seek to convince the U.K.’s governing bodies to regulate AI with a light touch. On a recent lobbying tour, Altman made an appearance at the University College London, where he called for “balanced” regulation and warned of the risks of deepfake disinformation.
At that same appearance, Altman said that OpenAI would “cease operating” in the European Union if it’s unable to comply with the provisions of the bloc’s AI Act, one of the first comprehensive set of regulations for the AI industry. He later backed down from the comments — but the play was made.

Quandri raises $8.5M Series A to bring process automation to insurance brokers and agencies,Frederic Lardinois,2023/06/28,"
Robotic process automation (RPA) has been a buzzword for a while now, but most of the tools that try to help businesses automate their workflows tend to be generalists. Quandri, a Vancouver, Canada-based startup, is taking a very different approach with its digital workers for the insurance industry. The company today announced that it has raised an $8.5 million Series A round led by FUSE, with participation from Defined Capital and existing investors Aviso Ventures, Rebellion Ventures, N49P and Good News Ventures. In total, the company has now raised $10 million.
The company was co-founded by brothers Jackson (CEO) and Jamieson Fregeau (president). Jackson was previously the COO of Revenue Accelerator while Jamieson worked at a number of hardware-centric companies, including Open Ocean Robotics. Jackson noted that while he was at Revenue Accelerator, he ended up building a number of bots to automate repetitive data entry tasks. So when the brothers were thinking about what product to build, they decided on putting a different spin on RPA.
“Nobody was really talking about a bot for a customer specifically. It was like: you’d give this capability to a customer. And then they would need to go and configure and build all this stuff themselves in a really rigid way. And that prevented a huge slew of companies from accessing this kind of technology because they don’t have the technical resources — or if they have the technical resources, they’re applied to their very specific core products but not on operational automation.”
What Quandri is building is more akin to “robot-as-a-service” than traditional RPA. Instead of having to build automation themselves, Quandri essentially pre-builds these bots for their customers, which also means that the team has to focus on a very specific niche. After working with a couple of potential customers in the insurance space, Jackson told me, the team realized that this was a vertical where brokers and agencies were still doing a lot of repetitive manual work and where a lot of data was sitting in silos (even as the consumer-side of the industry has quickly modernized).
“There hasn’t been a lot of net new tooling built for brokerages over the last 10 years,” he said. “It’s been somewhat overlooked by a large wave of innovation that has happened in a lot of other industries.”
Right now, Quandri offers three of these pre-built robots: Renewal Reviewer to help agents compare policies upon renewal, a tool that helps users ensure that files are named correctly and contextually (and not “1847AHDKS812 BROKER”), and Download Director, a service that matches unmatched policies and eDocs to the correct accounts and then matches claims and verifies producer commission amounts as needed.
Jackson tells me that the company is currently 100% focused on the insurance industry and specifically on North American brokerages. In the long run, the team may branch out and apply its technology to other verticals.
“Bots are a total game changer for our agency,” said Angela Trimble, president, Trustpoint Services. “I told my Agency Manager we are now at a place where we don’t have to be worried about hiring additional employees when it comes to the tasks involving tedious paperwork because we have bots in place.”

"Tiny acquires HappyFunCorp, the prolific firm that’s built apps for Twitter, Amazon and more, for $30M",Ingrid Lunden,2023/07/03,"
M&A and consolidation continue to be major themes in the tech world as companies look for their next steps in a tight market. That’s a trend impacting not just startups and larger tech companies, but the firms that work closely with them.
In the latest development, HappyFunCorp — a product engineering house that designs and builds apps and more for the likes of Apple, Disney, Amazon and Twitter — is getting acquired by Canadian firm Tiny for $30 million.
Tiny is based out of Canada and is publicly traded there with a current market cap of around $500 million. HappyFunCorp is being acquired with a mix of shares and cash and will continue to operate independently out of Brooklyn, New York, where it was founded, said Ben Schippers, co-founder and co-CEO, in an interview.
It will also work closer with Tiny, which has built a tidy business out of quietly scooping up companies that — if you could put a description around it — largely focus on providing an array of front and back-end design and product services for tech companies and internet-based businesses.
Other acquisitions in the Tiny stable include e-commerce technology player WeCommerce; Dribbble, an online community for designers to share work and pick up new work; and it also has a stake in Flow, for task and project management. The co-founder of Tiny is Andrew Wilkinson, who is also the co-founder of MetaLab, an interface design company that is also part of Tiny.
Together with HappyFunCorp the companies work behind the scenes with some of the most well-known names in tech — companies that do a lot of major work in house, but also — maybe with a little less fanfare — also turn to third parties to build out products that are typically outside of the normal course of an organization’s workflow and thus a distraction and strain were they to be developed, maintained and updated internally, at least while they’re getting off the ground (or while the company’s watching to see if they can get off the ground).
Customers for the combined Tiny organization range from a long tail covering tens of thousands of smaller online businesses, through to building some significant apps and other work for some of the biggest names in tech, such as Amazon, Facebook/Meta, Twitter, Disney, Samsung and Apple.
Some of the most successful of those projects actually cover both of those ends of the spectrum. One anecdote that has stuck in my memory for years is that MetaLab turned a struggling startup’s rough concept into an app that blew up beyond, seemingly, anyone’s wildest predictions: that app was Slack.
HappyFunCorp was founded in 2009, and in the last 14 years it’s racked up its own very long list of big-name customers. Similar to the other companies in the Tiny stable, it has up to now been bootstrapped and profitable. Revenues in 2022 were $12 million and it’s on track for more growth this year, Schippers said. He, along with current co-CEO Holly Zappa and COO Robb Chen-Ware, will stay on to run the company post-acquisition.
(Note: TezLab, a popular third-party Tesla application that was incubated at HappyFunCorp, is being spun out as an independent company with this acquisition.)
Tiny’s acquisition of HappyFunCorp is significant not just because it’s another example of the consolidation that continues to change the shape of today’s technology landscape; but because it shines a light on a group of companies in the tech ecosystem that are likely to be taking an even more prominent role in the coming years.
Companies continue to trim their workforces — with hundreds of thousands of layoffs in the last year — and they’re also trimming their budgets to meet the current state of the market. And new developments in areas like AI create a lot of variables and unknowns around the corner in both of those departments.
Yet those companies still have their eye on future growth and, to that end, want to continue developing new products and concepts to meet demand and to create new demand. Tiny’s bet is that this pull and push will drive more business into its arms over time.
The profile of companies like this has definitely changed over the last decade, Schippers said.
“Eight, nine years ago we did all this work and we didn’t talk about it,” he said in reference to some of its higher-profile projects, including some ambitious projects of Twitter’s. “Now the pendulum is swinging.”
Cost consolidation, he added, will additionally drive a lot of companies to a “near shore” model focusing on R&D not in New York or Vancouver (where MetaLab and Tiny have operations), but economies like Costa Rica and elsewhere in Latin America “where work can be done at a fraction of the cost,” he said. “Full stop that is where the market is going.”

Trying to close a Series B in 2023? Read this first,Mark Chaffey,2023/07/03,"

Mark Chaffey is CEO of hackajob, a career marketplace for technology job seekers and employers.	

Despite ongoing economic uncertainty, there will always be a path forward for determined founders with strong ideas and smart investors with an eye for opportunity. But make no mistake, the challenges are real and sizable. Global funding in Q1 2023 was down 53% compared to Q1 2022, a precipitous drop hastened by broader market turbulence and fears of a prolonged downturn.
And the stagnation wasn’t limited to just late-stage funding either. Crunchbase analysis revealed that Series B investment in the second half of 2022 was down over 60% from the same period the year before — putting Series B investments on track to come in at the lowest quarterly level in more than three years.
With this backdrop, our company began our Series B round of fundraising in early 2023. We went into the process aware that our sector has historically suffered in a down economy, but we chose to focus on the positives — namely that our ability to close in this environment would showcase the quality of our business and that any investors willing to make an investment despite the challenges would result in a stronger long-term partnership.
How we closed our $25 million Series B in April 2023: 5 key factors
For us, we knew we were ready for a Series B when:

We were cash efficient with a burn multiple under 1.
We had proven product-market-fit and go-to-market fit with excellent unit economics.
We had strong retention, in our case a net revenue retention rate (NRR) of 149%.

From there, it was all about execution. Here are five other strategies that helped us close our Series B.
Set the foundations to scale: Team, process and expertise
Series B rounds are all about scaling the business. The scrambling and existential doubt you had as an entrepreneur won’t go away, but by this point, you should have built a strong executive team around you that is, frankly, more skilled at scaling their individual functions than you are. As soon as you land the Series A, start to lay a real business foundation — pivoting from a survival mindset to a sustainable one.
We embraced this, and after closing our Series A, we built the groundwork throughout 2019 that enabled us to take advantage of the unique opportunity that the COVID-19 pandemic created. Ultimately, this strong foundation led us to close our Series B round in an extremely challenging market.
 

			There will always be a path forward for determined founders with strong ideas and smart investors with an eye for opportunity.					


Your org chart doesn’t have to be fully built at this stage, but you should have a plan to scale. When building out our exec team, we balanced homegrown talent that had progressed internally with individuals who had achieved success at the next level of scale than we operated currently.
When raising a Series B, it is important to hire execs with experience for this stage of the company. A CRO who is used to scaling from $50 million ARR to $100 million ARR has a very different skill set than what you need to scale from $10 million to $30 million ARR. For example, when looking for a VP of finance, we wanted someone with a track record of closing Series B and C investment rounds, as that was the next step for us.
Understand potential investor reservations, then create a plan to counter them
When fundraising, a common piece of advice for founders is to start with your tier 3 funds first and work your way up to pitching tier 1. This gives you the opportunity to learn what questions investors will ask and what objections you might receive before you sit down with the big guns.
This didn’t work for us. The challenge with starting with “tier 3” funds is that the “tier 1” funds often have more context about your space (at least they should if you’ve tiered correctly) and therefore the quality of the questions they ask are far superior to the ones you’ve been prepping on from “tier 3” fund conversations.
Instead, we sought to understand the common objections investors would have about investing in our business through informal catch-up calls when we weren’t in fundraising mode. This enabled us to understand potential investors’ objections upfront without going through the “tier 3” to “tier 1” process while still addressing those objections directly. In these introductory conversations, we were frequently asked the following: "
15 investors talk about their investment cadence in H1 2023,Karan Bhasin,2023/07/02,"
As part of our ongoing coverage of VC performance in the first half of 2023, TechCrunch+ surveyed 15 investors about their investment cadence and their plans for the second half of the year.
As expected, it appears a good mix of investors wrote checks at the rate they’d aimed for, while others fell a bit short. However, there is a sense that a slower investment cadence is going to become the new norm. Rajeev Dham, partner at Sapphire Ventures, and Mark Grace, investor at M13, both noted that the rapid investment cadence of the pandemic years has passed, and the adjustment period has been a bumpy ride for some.
However, those who operated at a slower cadence seem to be favoring a more cautious approach. Gen Tsuchikawa, CEO of Sony Ventures, said, “We have always been selective in our investments, and we are keeping the cadence of those investments flexible for now.”
Dham also advocates prudence for the coming period. “Once we understand what the new operating cadence is of businesses and then apply the appropriate price, which we now all know what it is (what it has always been!), then we can act accordingly. The other massive shoe to drop is further retreat from the most active investors in the 2018–2021 era. The more they retreat, the more likely there is to be less capital in the system chasing startups, which also level sets on price.”
Grace has his eyes firmly set on the full-half of the glass: “I think dealmaking cadence will continue to rebound. You need to be an optimist in this industry!”
Logan Allin, managing partner and founder of Fin Capital, stated that his firm was the most active fintech investor across the globe in Q1 thanks to its focus on early-stage startups founded by repeat founders.
He gave us some insight into his firm’s confidence: “This accelerated rate of new company formation is a function of (a) Management teams turning over the reins to professional management to take the company public or exit via M&A or buyout, and (b) seasoned entrepreneurs with underwater options that are not worth sticking around for to vest further.”

Did your investing cadence meet your expectations? Did you exceed your targets or undershoot them?
The back half of 2022 was dead. Things suddenly picked up in late February, and we felt it across the board. We made investments in Anthropic and Typeface and have continued at a fairly rapid pace since then. In Q2, we made several commitments, including two life sciences companies, one digital health, one hard tech company and a few SaaS companies. So, the end of Q1 picked up and Q2 really accelerated. We even had a term sheet in on a company and we won the deal, but it got acquired.
Is your firm planning on accelerating its dealmaking cadence in the back half of 2023? Why or why not?
Q2 was already busy and active for us, but mainly at the early stage. We have three funds: an incubation fund (Menlo Labs), which has been steady state; our Venture Fund, which picked up significantly in Q2; and our Inflection Fund (defined as early growth in companies with $3 million to $10 million ARR), which was still slow in Q2.
We expect Labs and the Venture Fund to remain just as busy as they have been from a pacing standpoint, but [we] expect the Inflection Fund will accelerate significantly in the back half of the year. About 80% of the companies in our sweet spot haven’t raised in two-plus years, and many will need to come back to market in 2H 2023. We’re excited about that segment of the market, where there is early but predictable scale and where valuations have settled substantially.
There will be many flat and down rounds, and there should be no stigma around that. The multiples VCs will use to value companies will be different, but that doesn’t change whether a business is good or not. So we’ll all get past valuation and focus on building great companies.
Sheila Gulati, managing director, Tola Capital
Did your investing cadence meet your expectations? Did you exceed your targets or undershoot them?
Our current focus is AI, primarily in the areas of domain-specific foundation models, AI/ML tooling, AI SaaS applications, AI compliance and governance, and AI security tools.
We have closed deals in these spaces in 2023, but the frenzy around AI has definitely meant a lot of capital has rushed into this market. The result has been that we have backed off certain deals based on valuation, and we expect this to continue in the AI world. It has meant fewer deals overall.
Is your firm planning on accelerating its dealmaking cadence in the back half of 2023? Why or why not?
We’re focused on doing the right deals. Generational companies will emerge from this transformative period defined by AI, but there will be many losers, too. "
Fintech M&A gets a big boost with Visa-Pismo deal,Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/07/02,"
It was a very busy week in the world of fintech, which certainly kept us on our toes. We covered a couple of notable M&A deals (including one of the biggest of the year so far), a different kind of financial services startup aimed at undocumented immigrants, Brex’s official recommitment to the startup community and more.
End-of-quarter frenzy
As the generative AI craze rages on, Ramp acquires customer support startup Cohere.io
We started the week with some M&A news out of corporate spend management company Ramp. The team shared with us exclusively that it had scooped up an AI-powered customer support called Cohere.io, which had raised $3.5 million in seed funding over its lifetime from backers such as Initialized Capital, Y Combinator and…Ramp co-founders Eric Glyman and Karim Atiyeh. Notably, Ramp (and companies like Deel and Rippling) were also customers. Glyman told us that it was evident from early on that once his company started using Cohere.io, “suddenly the majority of tickets were being answered properly in an automated fashion. […] It actually really worked,” he said. “The technical sophistication of the team was far beyond anything we had ever seen.”
Visa acquires Brazilian fintech startup Pismo in $1B blockbuster deal
Then later in the week came confirmation of one of the biggest, if not the biggest, fintech M&A deals of the year. It was rumored for months that Visa, Mastercard and potentially a bank and private equity firm were all courting Brazilian payments infrastructure startup Pismo. The acquisition was definitely a coup for the Latin American startup community, considering that Visa could have likely considered companies from all over the world. Pismo has apparently seen some explosive growth in recent years — jumping from 10 million accounts at the end of 2020 to 80 million today. Also, at the beginning of 2021, Pismo was doing less than $1 billion per month in transaction volume compared to processing $40 billion in transaction volumes annually today.
However, as noted by KBW managing director Sanjay Sakhrani, the $1 billion purchase price is roughly 30% below the $1.4 billion that Visa was rumored to have offered for Pismo earlier this year. We don’t know what Pismo was valued at when it raised $108 million in a round co-led by SoftBank, Amazon and Accel in 2021. But Accel partner Ethan Choi told us the sales price was “a very strategic multiple.”
Sakhrani also said in a report that in addition to beefing up Visa’s issuer processing capabilities across card products, Pismo also brings “differentiated core banking capabilities and will allow Visa to provide connectivity and support to emerging payment rails like Pix in Brazil.”
The last week in recent memory where we remember seeing such a flurry of fintech M&A activity was in mid-January, when Jonah Crane, partner at Klaros Group, predicted we would continue to see more acquisitions in 2023 thanks to the continued venture slowdown and practically dead IPO and SPAC markets. And according to CB Insights, fintech M&A exits rebounded in the first quarter, but not as much as one might have expected. They were up 15% QoQ to 172 deals. Most of Q1’23’s top M&A deals involved fintechs based outside of the U.S. For the first time in the previous year, the top M&A valuation fell below $500 million.
Side note: The acquisition represented a rare win for SoftBank, which has had a number of high-profile disappointments in recent years with investments in the likes of WeWork, the now defunct Katerra and FTX. Alex and I talk more about that on Friday’s episode of Equity Podcast here.
Brex refocuses on startups with hire of SVB veteran, ex-a16z operating partner
Last summer, Brex made headlines for announcing it would stop serving SMBs and non-funded startups. This summer, it’s making headlines for pledging its recommitment to the startup community. After Silicon Valley Bank imploded in March, Brex (along with the likes of Arc and Mercury) saw an influx of new customers. Specifically, the company says it opened 4,000 new accounts and received $2 billion in deposits in the first week after the SVB shutdown alone. That obviously led the company to rethink its strategy. Last week, Brex told us exclusively that it had hired Jason Mok, a former operating partner at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and 16-plus-year veteran of Silicon Valley Bank to serve as its head of startups. I talked with Mok about his previous experience and how he thinks that will help him in his new role, which includes providing more “Brex ambassadors” who can serve as the face of the brand that founders, operators and VCs can go to for advice, perspective and connections to other founders.
No SSN, no problem, says Maza, a fintech startup aimed at undocumented immigrants
I also wrote about Maza, a fintech startup that raised $8 million in a seed-funding round led by a16z to help undocumented immigrants get an ITIN (individual tax identification number) and access the U.S. financial system. TechCrunch has previously reported on a number of startups focused on the immigrant community — including Welcome Technologies, Fair, Majority and TomoCredit. (It’s unclear whether Fair is still around considering its website appears to no longer exist or is down.) But what makes Maza different is its focus on undocumented immigrants specifically. “We’re doing much more than just providing a bank account — we’re really giving immigrants a stable and legal financial foundation from which to build credit and wealth indefinitely,” said co-founder and COO Robbie Figueroa.
Fun fact: The name Maza came from a song about perseverance called “La Maza” that co-founder and CEO Luciano Arango used to listen to with his mom growing up.
Nubank’s CEO explains what the US could learn from LatAm fintech
In one of the Equity podcasts this week, I spoke with David Vélez, the co-founder and CEO of digital bank giant Nubank. (Did you know it has a market cap of  $37 billion?!) Digital banking is always top-of-mind over here at TechCrunch, so we quickly got into discussing Nubank’s strategy for achieving profitability and how the company has been able to maintain that in a challenging macroeconomic environment. Vélez also compared and contrasted the Latin American and U.S. fintech markets and dished on how he sees banking evolving in the next few years. One particularly interesting part of the conversation, as one Equity listener pointed out: Vélez’s reasoning for only expanding Nubank in three markets over 10 years: “‘I am extremely wary of any deck where people tell me ‘18 markets in 2 years.’”

Deal Dive: Betting on the sports betting market,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/07/01,"
If you live in a state where online sports betting is legal, companies like FanDuel, Caesars Sportsbook and DraftKings don’t let you forget it. They dominate TV ad slots during sports games and seemingly everywhere else, too. They give the mirage that the market is saturated with no room for startups. Betr, well, wouldn’t bet on that.
Betr co-founder and CEO Joey Levy thinks there is still space for companies that bring a new approach and business model to online sports betting. What makes Betr stand out, though, is that it’s built its user interface to be more accessible for the casual sports bettor as opposed to someone who spends all day poring over stats. It also focuses on microbets, so instead of predicting who wins the whole game, users can bet on things like how many free throws Nikola Jokić will get the next time he’s up at the line.
The startup just announced a $35 million Series A2 round with a $300 million pre-money valuation. The round was led by IA Sports Ventures and Eberg Capital and also included existing investors. Betr was founded in 2022 and is live in two states so far, Ohio and Massachusetts.
This is Levy’s third sports betting startup. His first, Draftpot, was a daily fantasy platform that was acquired in 2017. His second, Simplebet, is still running to provide the back-end infrastructure needed to power microbets. But through those he noticed a problem he thinks Betr can solve: Most online sports-betting apps were designed for sports bettors not sports fans.

This week in food tech: Upside Foods wastes no time debuting its cultivated chicken,Christine Hall,2023/07/01,"
If you’re adventurous with your food, or just like to keep up with the fast-moving food tech industry, here’s a roundup of this week’s stories and some notable news we weren’t able to cover.
Upside Foods gets on the plate
In what is perhaps the first ever sale of cultivated meat in the United States, Upside Foods said it is unveiling its whole-textured product at Chef Dominique Crenn’s restaurant Bar Crenn in San Francisco today. This comes just a week after gaining approval to sell its cell-cultivated chicken product in the U.S.
Upside’s cultivated chicken will be fried in a tempura batter, drizzled with a burnt chili aioli and garnished with edible flowers and greens. Incidentally, this is the first time Bar Crenn is putting meat on its menu since it was removed in 2018, according to the company. The cultivated chicken will be incorporated into additional dishes at the restaurant through a series of ongoing monthly services that will commence later this year.

We’ve officially entered a new era of ‘cultivated’ meat production

As seen on TechCrunch
Bluu Seafood reels in $17.5M to bring cultivated fish products to market
Paul reported on Bluu Seafood’s new €16 million ($17.5 million) Series A round of funding. The German company is creating cultivated fish products and unveiled its first products last August, which included a line of fish sticks and fish balls.
Joyful Ventures debuts with $23M focused on investment in sustainable protein startups
Thriving startups in the alternative protein sector now have a new place to pitch. Venture capital firm Joyful Ventures unveiled its new fund. Joyful was co-founded by Jennifer Stojkovic, Milo Runkle and Blaine Vess. The company has already made two investments from the fund, including New School Foods and Orbillion Bio.
Omeat emerges from stealth with beefy tech approach to cultivated meat growth media
Omeat, a cultivated meat startup out of Los Angeles, believes it has cracked the code on how to reduce the traditionally high costs to scale production of cultivated meat via a process that uses regenerative factors extracted humanely from cow plasma to make growth media.
BetterBrand’s new dough raises company’s valuation to over $170M
BetterBrand, a food tech company known for creating “The Better Bagel,” closed on $6 million of Series A capital at a pre-money valuation of $170 million. BetterBrand’s proprietary “grain-changing” technology combines non-GMO and clean label ingredients to create a line of better-for-you baked goods.
Make way for a new vegan protein on the menu
Natasha writes about Finnish startup Solar Foods’ alternative protein, Solein, which has been blended into a custom (vegan) chocolate gelato at a restaurant in Singapore. It’s not your average scoop, she says.

Bluu Seafood reels in $17.5M to bring cultivated fish products to market

Time to make the meat
In April, we ran a commentary focused on whether additional capacity for precision fermentation, which is a method that uses bioreactors to make cultivated meat, is what was really needed to advance the industry and bring costs down.
For those in the camp of more biomanufacturing facilities, Liberation Labs is contributing to that. This week, the company broke ground on its first facility in Indiana that, when fully up and running, will have a capacity to make up to 600,000 liters of bio-based proteins.
Impossible vs. Motif, take 20
During the last roundup, I mentioned the year-old lawsuit between Impossible Foods and Motif FoodWorks became interesting when it was uncovered that Motif suspected Impossible hired some private investigators who allegedly used fake identities to get information on Motif products.
Ultimately a court ruled that this strategy by Impossible did not break any rules, according to the story.
While that was a mark for Impossible, the newest thing to come out is a mark for Motif: The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board agreed to review Impossible’s intellectual property related to using heme to create plant-based meat substitutes. More here.

Are corporations too influential?,Haje Jan Kamps,2023/06/30,"
Welcome to Startups Weekly. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.
This week, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about how some of the biggest companies in the world have as much — if not more — power than entire countries. Most countries, at least, have some level of democratic oversight, but that isn’t true in the same way for companies. My question, then: In a world where the policies of, say, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter become de facto standards all around the world, should we have a greater degree of say (TC+) in what those policies are?
The other thing that’s kept me busy this week is fundraising. Alex talked with 11 VCs (TC+) about how hard it was for their companies to raise so far this year. Meanwhile, I talked with a number of founders who were really struggling to raise money. The truth is, the founders struggling the most have three things in common (TC+).
Now let’s take a look at what happened in the world of startups this week.
Notes from the security frontlines
Image Credits: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch
The most popular story on TechCrunch in the past week was one of my own, which came with a curious backstory: Flipper Devices was founded in Moscow, Russia, in 2020, by a Ukrainian founder and a largely Russian team. I ran the headline that a “Russian hacking device” had made $80 million worth of sales, only for a bunch of PR people to get very upset with me for calling the company, which was founded in Russia and whose team is still 90% Russian, Russian. Don’t get me wrong, I get why a company making a hacking device might not want to be associated with Russia — and the company has gone to great lengths to scrub any traces of that connection from the internet. The whole story was pretty weird, and concluded with me getting an unsolicited scan of the founder’s (Ukrainian) password in my email inbox. Very curious indeed.
That sounds secure…: In a beacon of “here’s what not to do,” Lorenzo reports that an Illinois high school accidentally changed every student’s password to ‘Ch@ngeme!’. The problem? For a moment there, every student knew every other student’s password. D’oh.
Stupid and pointless: Prosecutors called for the British hacker who was responsible for the 2020 Twitter breach to serve at least seven years. Zack reports that the hacker was sentenced to 5 years behind bars. The convicted hacker described his crimes as “stupid and pointless.” Who am I to disagree?
Watching the watchers: Zack reports that Polish-developed stalkerware LetMeSpy, a phone-tracking app, says it was hacked. The leaked data included years of victims’ call logs and text messages dating back to 2013.
News you can touch. Yep, it’s hardware.

A ton of interesting things happened in startup hardware land this week. Uplift Labs signed an interesting deal with Major League Baseball to use the startup’s 3D motion tracking tech to help scout for promising players.
Fast on the heels of its previous $14 million fundraise, Realtime Robotics raised another $10 million or so, representing the third close on what now seems like a never-ending Series A financing for the manufacturing automation startup.
Apropos robotics, Brian also had a fascinating story today on how robots are learning from watching YouTube videos. If my YouTube recommendations are anything to go by, every robot in the world will very soon be expert woodworkers and do very stupid things with explosives.
Who’s a good bot? That’s right, you’re a good bot: In a, “Geez, I feel safer already” type moment, Brian reports that the House GOP discussed the use of robot dogs to patrol U.S. borders.
It flies and it counts. That’s just what it does: Kate reports that B Garage raised $20 million for its warehouse inventory drones. And as we’re talking about flying inventory drones, Brian reported that Gather AI bought drone inventory competitor Ware.
Walking? Feh, check the webcam: The lazy among us may have pointed a webcam at the oven to keep an eye on a pizza, but Devin reports that Lilz takes the same concept to a whole ‘nother level, bringing its gauge-watching smart cameras to the U.S. and raising $4 million.
Startups that are going places
Image Credits: Joby Aviation
Raise your hand if you saw this one coming (while I sit on my hands, because I really did not) — but it seems like the Tesla charging standard is gaining a foothold very quickly. First, Texas said that state-funded EV chargers had to include Tesla plugs (now known as the North American Charging Standards, or NACS), and it seems like Washington state may be following suit.
Wheeee: You couldn’t force me on board one of these things with a gun, but Joby Aviation has reasons to celebrate, as Rebecca reports that the company received a permit to fly its first eVTOL built on a production line.
Pulling the e-brake: Kate reports that Singapore’s ride-hailing firm Grab lays off over 1,100 employees, representing around 11% of its staff — its first big round of layoffs since 2020.
End of the road for Lordstown: It’s been an uphill battle for Lordstown Motors. Rebecca reports that the company is suing Foxconn, claiming fraudulent conduct that “destroyed” the American company’s business. Over on TC+, Alex ponders that there’s not a lot of SPAC deals left that didn’t come crashing down painfully and spectacularly. Canoo, anyone?
Despite all its rage, it is still just a car in a cage: Even as Lordstown implodes and a lot of the other EV companies are struggling, Faraday Future raises $90 million to keep itself alive.

Foo-wee, it’s been a lively week. My personal favorite was Tim’s story about Forcite launching a $1,100 smart helmet, finally bringing a version of the decade-old Skully dream to fruition.
U so basic: Netflix decided that it had enough of letting its users skate by on the cheap, and Ivan reported that the streaming giant quietly axed its basic plan in Canada.
We totally have lots of users, promise! Some strange dodginess this week — Amanda reported that Unicorn social app IRL is to shut down after admitting 95% of its users were fake.
Yeah, saw that one coming: In my very personal opinion, Shein — and other, similar purveyors of essentially disposable clothing — is the literal worst for the environment. It seems like the company got a sheen of comeuppance, as Amanda reports that an influencer’s highly curated trip to a Chinese factory backfired.
The crowd is going Vilnius: Europe keeps investing huge sums of money into tech ecosystems, and Paul reports that Lithuania’s capital Vilnius is about to invest more than $100 million into “Europe’s largest tech campus.”

Secretive hardware startup Humane’s first product is the Ai Pin,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/30,"
Humane, the startup launched by ex-Apple design and engineering duo Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, today revealed details about its first product: The Humane Ai Pin.
It’s been a long time coming. Humane has kept its work more or less under wraps since 2018, its founding year, unveiling no products but bringing on dozens of ex-Apple employees responsible for the iPhone’s touchscreen keyboard, elements of Apple’s industrial design and infrastructure for Apple services like iCloud, Apple Pay and Home.
Humane’s product, as it turns out, is a wearable gadget with a projected display and AI-powered features. Chaudhri gave a live demo of the device onstage during a TED Talk in April, but a press release issued today provides a few additional details.
“The [AI Pin is a] connected and intelligent clothing-based wearable device uses a range of sensors that enable contextual and ambient compute interactions,” the release reads. “The Ai Pin is a type of standalone device with a software platform that harnesses the power of Ai to enable innovative personal computing experiences.”
Stripping away the marketing jargon, the Ai Pin will be able to — assuming Humane’s claims hold water — perform many of the tasks a smartphone can, but with fewer gestures and voice commands required. Activated with a tap, the Ai Pin, designed to clip to a breast pocket, can offer a summary of emails and calendar invites, translate between languages and answer and place phone calls.
Thanks to a camera and computer vision-powered software, the Ai Pin can also recognize objects around it, such as food nutrition labels. And using a built-in projector and depth sensor, it can project an interactive interface onto nearby surfaces, like the palm of a hand or the surface of a table.

“Our Ai Pin presents an opportunity for people to take AI with them everywhere and to unlock a new era of personal mobile computing which is seamless, screenless, and sensing,” Chaudhri and Bongiorno said in a canned statement.
Humane also revealed today that it’s collaborating with Qualcomm to develop the Ai Pin’s internal hardware. An unnamed chip from Qualcomm’s Snapdragon series will power the wearable; Human’s promising more info to come later in the year ahead of the device’s launch.
“Humane’s Ai Pin will deliver a superior AI experience,” Qualcomm SVP of product management Ziad Asghar was quoted as saying in the release: “With the advent of generative AI, Humane’s Ai Pin and user experience takes excellent advantage of some of the key strengths of on-device AI and uses real-time contextual information to provide the user with exciting, personalized AI use cases.”
Humane previously announced that it’s partnering with SK Networks and Microsoft to bring its platform and services to market, with Microsoft supplying the cloud processing power and SK Networks handling distribution. Meanwhile, Humane’s collaborating with OpenAI to integrate its tech into the startup’s device — whatever form it ends up taking, exactly. LG, for its part, is working with Humane on R&D projects for the next phase of its product life cycle as well as adapting Humane’s tech for smart home devices. And Volvo’s teaming up with Humane on a potential automotive industry offering.
To date, San Francisco-based Humane, which has a more than 200-person workforce, has raised $230 million from investors including Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, Kindred Ventures, SK Networks, LG Technology Ventures, Microsoft, Volvo Cars Tech Fund, Tiger Global, Qualcomm Ventures and OpenAI CEO and co-founder Sam Altman.

"TechCrunch+ roundup: Vertical AI, crypto losses decline, machine learning investor survey",Walter Thompson,2023/06/30,"
According to Paris Heymann, a partner at Index Ventures, the current wave of AI-powered products and services can be sorted into three layers:

Foundational models
AI infrastructure
AI applications

“Some of these applications will be broadly horizontal,” he writes in TC+, “but many AI applications will also be vertical, or industry-focused.”

Generative AI startup Typeface emerged from stealth this year, but the $100 million Series B round that just boosted it to a billion-dollar valuation signals that “big tech companies are busy wielding their most powerful weapons: checkbooks,” writes Alex Wilhelm.
In The Exchange, he examines how companies like Microsoft, Salesforce and other corporate venture entities are buying their way into AI-adjacent products and services.
“So long as your founding team has an AI pedigree and a plan to sell lots of AI tech to big companies, you can expect a flood of cash from big tech funds and traditional venture investors alike.”

Dear Sophie,
Our startup employs about 30 people globally through a combination of direct and co-employment based on their country.
Over the last year and a half or so, we helped several team members relocate from Ukraine and Russia to various non-Schengen countries such as Georgia, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and Uzbekistan.
We realize it’s more expensive if we bring these employees to the U.S., but our startup will be more successful. How do we bring them here?

“There has been way more opportunity to invest in a VC than there has ever been in the past,” said Kyle Stanford, a senior venture analyst at PitchBook.
“For new LPs coming into the market, they didn’t need to go to a fund of funds to get access.”

Voice.ai raises $6M as its real-time voice changer approaches 500K users,Ingrid Lunden,2023/06/30,"
Services like Midjourney and ChatGPT have pushed the boundaries of how AI can create images and text out of basic text prompts. Now, audio appears to be the inevitable next frontier. Music generation based on word prompts, AI tutors for language learning and voice simulators have all seen developments in recent months. Voice.ai hopes to be a part of that conversation (heh) with technology that lets users change (and disguise) their voices in real time, and now it has raised its first outside funding on the heels of early growth.
With more than 480,000 users and a library of more than 50,000 voice filters, Voice.ai has picked up $6 million, funding that it plans to use to take its voice changing tech into new places.
Mucker Capital and M13 are leading the round. Before now, Voice.ai has grown by word of mouth — the startup has a Discord channel with more than 120,000 people — on the back of $3 million in self-funding.
Currently the company’s tools — available as apps for Mac, PC, Android and iOS — are getting adopted by gamers, content creators, Vtubers and others on TikTok, Zoom, Discord, Minecraft, GTA5, Fortnite, Valorant, League of Legends, Among Us, Skype, WhatsApp and other platforms. The Voice.ai interface lets them create a new voice, or select from some 50,000 different pre-created voices (created and shared by users like themselves), which can be used as-is or modified, to use live in supported platforms, or for recordings.
The plan is to use the funding to hire more technical talent and to build new SDKs and APIs to work with further platforms like Meta, Unreal and Unity; bring on multi-language support; and add in new applications like singing where voice is center stage.
The startup doesn’t single it out, but it will be interesting to see if it uses some of the funding also to increase server capacity.
That is no small burden. Anecdotally, we’ve heard that GPU pain is one of the biggest gating factors in how a lot of AI apps are able to scale at the moment. (It’s partly why you’re seeing big deals being made that include strategics providing processing and server capacity.)
For Voice.ai specifically, your voice is processed locally and channeled into wherever it will be used through what founder and CEO Heath Ahrens described to me as a “virtual audio cable.” But when you look at reviews of its apps, a common lament is that when you sign up you are put on a waitlist because “overwhelming demand has our servers at max capacity” with a promise that you’ll be informed when the service increases that capacity.
There are dozens of speech-to-voice and voice-to-speech services in the market today, and already a lot of activity among them: Last year Spotify acquired Sonantic and Snap bought an AI voice assistant even earlier than that; another startup, Sanas, is working on changing your accent and there are the voice simulators Murf and Acapela, among many others. Voice.ai counts itself in the same general category as Respeecher and ElevenLabs, two voice-to-voice AI startups, letting users apply masks to tweak or completely transform their voices — in some cases creating completely synthetic voices in place of the real thing.
Respeecher, founded and based in Ukraine, made a name for itself by helping build a new Darth Vader voice for new Star Wars installments, based on how James Earl Jones sounded 45 years ago when he originated the role. (In keeping with a character hell-bent on destroying worlds, Darth’s voice was delivered to the Hollywood client from its offices in Ukraine as Russia marched into the country.)
ElevenLabs — famously (or infamously as the case may be) — has built a platform that is frighteningly good at cloning voices, and earlier this month it picked up its most recent funding round of $19 million from a group of big-name investors.
Voice.ai is trying, in that mix, to position itself as the AI voice modifying app for Everyman.
“There are plenty of companies that are trying to provide a different flavor of voice tech to businesses,” Ahrens told TechCrunch in an email (ironically, it wasn’t possible to arrange a live interview with him). Ahrens has some experience with the building of B2B AI tech: his two previous companies — iSpeech for text-to-speech and Haystack for face recognition — are built around API offerings.
“What sets Voice.ai apart is that we are focused on bringing tech that was previously reserved for enterprise companies directly into the hands of consumers in an affordable fashion.” Many users, he noted, “come to us from classical DSP voice changers and voice modulators which they had been using in the past and which are still popular among many gamers and streamers.”
“Affordable” comes in two tiers, with most users now on a free service that requires them to opt in to providing computational power to train Voice.ai’s models, with its service built on its own private data set comprised of “millions of unique users.” No pricing is provided on the site: we’re asking for those details.
“We believe in making technology accessible and plan on working together with the open source community to democratize Voice AI technology,” added Ahrens.
Voice.ai also claims it takes what is a fundamentally different approach to the challenge of changing a voice, tapping into some of the ethos that has built up around the use of avatars by Vtubers, gamers and others online.
“Most voice AI companies that are coming into the space try to build scalable enterprise focused text-to-speech solutions or expensive voice-to-voice services for production studios,” Ahrens said. “We start from the opposite spectrum and try to deliver value to individuals who are looking to expand how they sound online. The core value proposition of our speech-to-speech AI isn’t that it can perfectly replicate any given person. It’s that it retains the core elements of a user’s speech: their emotion, pacing and emphasis while replacing the sound of the voice, in order to create a completely unique new end result, in real-time.”
It might be because of how the demographics in interactive platforms like gaming skew, but for now Voice.ai’s audience is 70% male versus 30% female with new categories opening not just around who is using the tech, but why.
That includes not just those using avatars and building voices to match them, or those looking for more privacy protection, but also, he said, “transgender users who can represent themselves with voices that match their identity, as well as users exploring completely new online personas for themselves.”
There is already a base of users tapping into Voice.ai’s direct-to-consumer offerings, but one of the reasons why Mucker is investing in the startup is because it believes that there is an opportunity to build out a network of developers using and integrating its tech.
“Voice.ai is poised to revolutionize the AI developer community in a manner akin to AdMob’s impact on the mobile app developer community,” said Omar Hamoui, a partner at lead investor Mucker Capital. (Hamoui previously founded the mobile ad startup AdMob, eventually acquired by Google, so he has some direct experience building mobile developer tools.) “By offering user-friendly solutions that were once exclusive to large enterprises, Voice.ai aims to democratize access for developers worldwide.”
Karl Alomar, the former COO of Digital Ocean, who led the investment for M13, said investors will be taking an active role in the next stage of development. “At Digital Ocean too we saw the value of building a community of builders by builders,” he said. “We’re excited for creators and developers to build on the Voice.ai platform.”

"Well done, Pismo and Visa! You gave SoftBank a win",Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/30,"

Hello, and welcome back to Equity, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.

All the cool kids are filling out the Equity listener survey. We want to hear from you! 

Mary Ann and Alex are back for another busy news week chock full of deals to chew through.
Here’s the rundown:

Deals of the Week: We think that the idea behind the recently funded Honey Homes is excellent, but we’re split about the cost. We also went over Gusto’s latest financial achievements and its plans to team up with Remote.
Fintech M&A: The biggest deal of the week in fintech was Visa’s purchase of  Pismo. We haven’t had unicorn-level acquisitions lately, so this one was welcome. Elsewhere in the space, Brex has brought on board a former SVB and a16z denizen, and Ramp bought Cohere.io (not this Cohere, the other one).
Other M&A: But those weren’t the only deals. Databricks bought MosaicML, IBM bought Apptio and ThoughtSpot has acquired Mode Analytics.
Help, my unicorn is starving: We closed with Alex’s look at the declining funding to unicorn and web3 startups, as well as Rebecca Szkutak’s latest on the secondary market in the process.

Equity will be back on Wednesday as we head off into yet another holiday weekend here in the U.S. when Alex will finally put his PTO to use. In the meantime, let’s catch up on Twitter @EquityPod. Talk soon!

For episode transcripts and more, head to Equity’s Simplecast website. 
Equity drops at 7:00 a.m. PT every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, so subscribe to us on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify and all the casts. TechCrunch also has a great show on crypto, a show that interviews founders, one that details how our stories come together and more!

Pitch Deck Teardown: Super.com’s $60M Series C deck,Haje Jan Kamps,2023/06/30,"
It’s rare to find a pitch deck that forces me to dig deep to unearth something to criticize. The last time was with Orange’s seed deck, and in this week’s installment, I had to dive deep into the deck that Super.com used for its $60 million equity, plus $25 million venture debt round.

We’re looking for more unique pitch decks to tear down, so if you want to submit your own, here’s how you can do that. 

Slides in this deck
Super.com operated with a deck that tells a great story. It consists of 17 slides:

Cover slide
Mission slide
Traction slide 1
Traction slide 2
Team slide
Customers (interstitial slide)
Customer profile
Target customers / market size
A Savings Super App (interstitial slide)
  Why Now slide
  “Why a super app” slide
  Product slide
  Product road map slide
  User behavior slide
  Solution slide (“SuperCash is core to the experience”)
  Value Proposition slide (“Personalized Experiences”)
  The Ask slide

Three things to love
It’s hard to choose from all the stuff that works in this deck because the Super.com team really knocked it out of the park. But here are three highlights, which, incidentally, are the three most important slides you can have in a pitch deck. I’m utterly unsurprised that the company successfully managed to raise money.
You’ll raise if you’ve got traction…
Super.com starts its pitch with two traction slides in what can only be described as a masterful flex:
[Slide 3] Traction snapshot. Image Credits: Super.com[Slide 4] Traction over time. Image Credits: Super.comIn Slide 3, the company really flexes its stuff: 80 million customers, $1 billion in goods sold, and $150 million in terms of money saved for customers is beyond impressive. But then, in Slide 4, it shows how that growth is accelerating over time.
I’ve said it before: If you can show incredible traction, you don’t really need much else. Super.com does that, but it also has the goods for the rest of its story.
And an incredible team…
Super.com knows its strengths, and it segues from talking about its mission with its traction into a conversation about its team. Co-founders Henry Shi and Hussein Fazal have built a deep bench of incredible team members:
[Slide 5] What a team. Image Credits: Super.com 

			This is what an absolutely world-class team slide looks like.					


Each of the business verticals — travel, finance and the shop — are led by some world-class people, who are all CEO material in their own right. The company’s CFO is ex-Bank of America, and the CMO used to head marketing at Chase.
In addition, the company has attracted Joanne Bradford (president at Honey, COO at SoFi, and head of global partnerships at Pinterest) and Anan Kashyap (ex-CFO at Ethos and Poshmark) as independent board members.
In a huge market
Most of the time, I recommend doing a top-down TAM/SAM/SOM analysis to arrive at your market size, but Super.com chose a bottom-up approach:
[Slide 8] A slightly unusual market size slide in that it expresses it in customers, not dollars. Image Credits: Super.comThe company says that in the U.S. alone, 25% of the population is its target customer, and it can stretch to around 54% of the population if it expands its reach further.
If this were a pre-seed deck, I’d tell the founders to get it together and do better. But for a company that already has 80 million users, I want to know where it is going to grow. This slide does a good job of answering that question.
The company’s CEO, Fazal, gave me some important context:
We serve the customers who need it the most — typically lower household income, with no to low FICO scores, typically looking to save before they buy. There are about 183 million in that customer base. As we are seeing the wealth inequality gap in the U.S. growing, we have a unique opportunity to make a difference in the lives of more than 100 million Americans. We’re really well-positioned to do this given our active customer base: It’s customer-driven expansion.
That’s a hell of a story.
In the rest of this teardown, we’ll look at three things Super.com could have improved or done differently, along with its full pitch deck!

Fidelity deepens valuation cut for Reddit and Discord,Manish Singh,2023/06/30,"
Fidelity has further slashed the estimated worth of its holding in the social platform Reddit and the chat app Discord as well as SaaS startup Gupshup, giving a preview into how one of the world’s largest asset managers sees the impact of the ongoing slowdown in the public market on privately-held startups.
Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund valued its holdings in Reddit at $15.4 million as of May 31, according to the fund’s monthly disclosure released Friday. That’s down 7.36% from the $16.6 million mark at April’s closure and altogether a slide of 45.4% since its investment in August 2021. The updated share value suggests a $5.5 billion valuation for Reddit.
Fidelity marked down the value of its Discord’s holding to $1.7 million, down 13.4% from a month ago and 47% since the $3.3 million initial investment. (Worth noting that the vast majority of markdown in the value of Reddit and Discord holdings by Fidelity predominantly occurred last year.)
Reddit, which is currently grappling a revolt from moderators of some popular subreddits over API cost changes, was valued at $10 billion when the social media giant attracted funds in August 2021. Discord raised funding in September 2021 at a valuation of $15 billion.
The financial giant also readjusted the value of its holding in Twitter to $6.86 million, up from $6.55 million from a month prior, but still down 65% since the original investment. It slashed its holding in SaaS startup Gupshup to $10.15 million, down from $11 million at April’s closure and 38% since the original investment.

Fertifa enables companies to offer fertility and reproductive health benefits,Catherine Shu,2023/06/30,"
The number of workplaces offering fertility and reproductive healthcare benefits are on the rise. Doing so can help companies become more competitive employers and bolster diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, for example by attracting more women and LGBTQ+ people. Based in London, Fertifa wants to enable more companies in Europe to offer reproductive benefits to workers. Its clients already include Lululemon, Meta, Bain Capital and Virgin. Today the startup announced it has raised a £5 million seed round (about $6.3 million USD) led by Notion Capital and Triple Point Ventures.
Other participants included Conviction, Calm/Storm, Tiny.vc, EQT Foundation and angel investors Eamon Jubbawy, Catherine and Jonathan Lenson, Dorothy Chou, Caroline and Mike Hudack and Scott Mackin. Existing investors Passion Capital, Lemonade Stand, Speedinvest, Monzo co-founder Tom Blomfield, Adam Knight and Jeremy Yap also returned for the round.
Fertifa was founded in 2019 by Tony Chen and Nick Kuan, who have since left the company but remain as shareholders. Eileen Burbidge, who led Fertifa’s pre-seed round along with her Passion Capital partner Malin Posern, joined in January 2022 as executive director to lead the startup and take charge of its business development. Fertifa currently has 22 employees.
Burbidge told TechCrunch in an email that she’s committed to Fertifa’s mission because she has been through “many reproductive health journeys,” in different places and stages of her life, while maintaining a career. These include two elective terminations in her 20s in California, two miscarriages in her 30s while living in London and three rounds of IVF in 2017. She is now perimenopausal and on HRT.
“Although I am an example that it’s possible to do (and to just grin and bear it or carry on), I’m also witness to what a difference it could make for employee wellbeing if individuals had support from their workplaces,” she said. “For example, I imagine how it might have helped me if I’d felt able to perhaps take a day off when I knew I was having a miscarriage at work or to tell someone even as GP of my own venture fund that I was going through IVF and having injections every day.” Access to reproductive healthcare was another concern. “As someone who grew up in America and now lives in the UK, I’m intensely sensitive to what appears to be a slow erosion or roll back of reproductive health rights (or even simply access to via public healthcare due to strains on the NHS and providers)—and I’m desperately keen to play a part in ensuring that as many people as possible have access to education and information so they may make the best choices for themselves,” Burbidge said.
Services Fertifa help facilitate include fertility preservation like egg, embryo and sperm freezing, fertility planning, IVF, IUI and ICSI treatment cycles, contraception, surrogacy and adoption, as well as care for menopause, endometriosis, PCOS, fibroids, STIs and men’s sexual health. Fertifa says it has increased revenues 10x over the last year, and also saved patients more than £1.5 million through employer-funded allowances. It’s also saved employers about £250,000 in compliance by identifying ineligible claims.
Other providers in the space include Peppy, which focuses on menopause, endometriosis and PCOS education in the United States, and reproductive health benefits platforms Apryl, Maven Clinic and Carrot. Fertifa says its differentiators are the scope of its offering, which includes educational resources that are available to employees through an app, clinical services from an in-house team lead by medical director Dr. Gidon Lieberman, reimbursement administration, prescription writing and fulfillment.
Burbidge added that one of Fertifa’s main “competitors” is inaction on the part of employers. Fertifa combats that by demonstrating the business case for providing reproductive health and wellbeing support. It is also often requested by employees through their networks or executive sponsors. “Another influence is when corporates see their competitors acting and investing in the space—and they realize they compete for talent with those companies, so need to meet the bar,” she added.
Fertifa works with companies of all sizes and monetizes through a per employee per month pricing model. It also offers reimbursement administration by charging a 5% fee on transaction volume, with an annual minimum.
The new funding will allow Fertifa to launch new services like treatment financing and scale up its enterprise sales. Its goal is to become the market leader in the U.K. within a year, and then the EMEA category leader by the end of 2024.
In a statement about the financing, Notion Capital partner Itxaso del Palacio said, “Although there is 8x more spent on assisted reproductive technology (ART, including IVF, IUI, ICSI, etc.) in Europe over the U.S., there are three unicorn companies in the U.S. [Maven Clinic, Progyny and Kindbody] and none in Europe. It’s clear there is a massive opportunity for a team with commitment to better outcomes to make a significant impact. We believe we have found this in Fertifa and are excited to see what can be achieved.”

Korea’s Alwayz aims to make online shopping fun again with $46M in funding,Kate Park,2023/06/29,"
Seoul-based e-commerce company Levit, an operator of the shopping app Alwayz, wants to make the shopping experience more entertaining and affordable. The two-year-old startup has recently raised $46 million in a Series B round of funding led by DST Global Partners with participation from new investor BOND and existing backers KB Investment, Mirae Asset Capital, Korea Investment Partners, GS Ventures, and Klim Ventures. With the latest round, Levit has raised a total of $67 million since its inception.
Alwayz offers a wide range of products, from daily groceries to home appliances and apparel to cosmetics. But it deviates from typical e-commerce platforms by incorporating social features like short videos and gamification into online shopping to draw customers. 
For example, users can earn rewards by playing games nurturing the pig character Don-Don-E, or receive crops in real life after successfully cultivating crops by playing a game called AI-Farm in its app. In addition, Alwayz recently introduced a “Shorts” feature that allows users to watch short videos and, in return, get discounts when shopping.  
It also attracts customers with low-price products. Users get discounts if they purchase products with other users or their friends on Alwayz. Alwayz’s C2M (consumer-to-manufacturer) model eliminates layers of distributors, including logistics, inventory and other intermediaries, allowing the app to offer high-quality products at lower prices. Most sellers on Alwayz are producers or manufacturers, according to the company.
“Our average product selling price is around 20% cheaper than the lowest prices on other e-commerce platforms,” chief executive officer and co-founder of Levit, Jaeyun Kang, said. “This has been made possible because lesser-known brands, which traditionally spent nearly 30-50% of the selling price on marketing in search-based [e-commerce] platforms, can now sell their products more efficiently on Alwayz through discovery-based shopping.” 
Levit says games and social features help users enter the Alwayz app daily and be exposed to various products, even if they do not immediately intend to buy. 
“As users enjoy the engaging experience on our platform, we leverage their high engagement to expose them to a range of items through our recommendation algorithms. This way, even if items are from lesser-known brands, customers can discover and buy them,” Kang said. Levit describes this user experience as a “discovery shopping experience.” 
When asked about how it ensures low-priced products are high-quality, the company CEO said its recommendation algorithms assess all items on Alwayz, using factors such as conversion and customer repurchase rates. “We ensure an item isn’t widely exposed until it has proven its quality, and this approach allows us to maintain the quality of items,” he said.

Since its launch in September 2021, the startup claims Alwayz has amassed 1 million users within three months and has reached 7 million users, 2.5 million monthly active users (MAUs) and 1.3 million daily active users (DAUs) in one and a half years. Alwayz aims to secure more than 12 million registered users, 5 million MAUs, and 3 million DAUs by the end of 2023, Kang said, adding that it has nearly 20,000 sellers registered on the app. 
Three founders of Levit — Kang, Sangwoo Park and Hyunjik Lee — have set their sights on two ambitious goals: establishing Levit as the leading e-commerce company in South Korea and capturing a significant share of the global discovery shopping market.
Alwayz has to compete with local peers, the likes of Coupang, Naver and Kurly, but its business model is more similar to the U.S.-listed e-commerce Pinduoduo and China-based AliExpress in terms of social features and lower-price products. 
The outfit, which has 20 people on the team, is planning to bring its platform to the U.S. market as early as this year. 
“Disruption in horizontal commerce is rare,” said Daegwon Chae, general partner of BOND. “Dislodging large incumbents requires meaningfully better, faster, cheaper experiences, which are difficult to achieve in a mature and efficient market. Alwayz has broken through with its relentless focus on user experience, engagement and value.”

11 VCs reveal how hard it was for their startups to fundraise in H1 2023,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/29,"
Everyone knows that raising venture capital has been harder for startups lately — unless you are building an AI startup, of course. But instead of only talking to founders, we’re flipping the script today.
We wanted to hear from investors how their portcos are handling a cash-light environment. To that end, TechCrunch+ recently asked 11 VCs how the first half of 2023 bore out for their investments.
From their answers, it appears a startup’s ability to fundraise in today’s climate is based on several key factors, including capital efficiency, the market and its needs.

Q2 failed to bring a funding reprieve for web3 startups and unicorns

How bad was H1 2023?
Menlo Ventures’ Matt Murphy was succinct when we asked how 2023 was shaping up for his firm’s portfolio companies: “Fundraising is challenging, full stop.” [Update: Menlo Ventures reached out to underscore that Matt’s comment here is in reference to the larger industry since less than 10% of their portfolio needed to raise in the last 12 months.]
“Challenging” is a good descriptor. So is “quiet,” which is how Jason Lemkin of SaaStr Fund put it. For Kaitlyn Doyle of TechNexus Venture Collaborative, the year has been mostly “flat rounds with companies trying to delay the valuation discussion.” She added that the second quarter felt a lot like the first, with investors and startups taking a “wait and see” stance.
Other investors had slightly brighter perspectives on H1 2023. Rex Salisbury of Cambrian Ventures felt the narrative that “this is a terrible time to raise” is simply not true, especially at the early stage. That sentiment matches what we’ve seen thus far in the data: The earlier a startup goes out to raise a round, the better its chances of landing a strong valuation. Indeed, the massive repricings of the public market are yet to trickle down to seed and pre-seed deals. "
Fund of funds are starting to play a different role for venture LPs,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/06/29,"
Fund of funds (FoF) were created to serve as a bridge for LPs to get access to managers they couldn’t back otherwise. But in an environment where funds are not seeing consistent support from their existing LPs, and there are more venture funds than ever, is their role still relevant?
Fund of funds fundraising — say that five times fast! — has declined for years. To compare, traditional U.S. venture firm fundraising set a record in 2022 with $162 billion. U.S.-based VC FoF raised just $400 million in the first quarter of 2023, according to PitchBook, and $3 billion in 2022. This compares to $24.4 billion in 2021 and $33.7 billion — the fundraising peak — in 2017.
It’s not surprising why many LPs have soured on the strategy, said Kyle Stanford, a senior venture analyst at PitchBook. For one, backers of these funds pay a mix of fees to both the FoF and the underlying commitments the FoF manager makes.
“LPs have that double layer of fees. And that extra time it takes after [an LP] invests in the fund of funds and then have it deployed is just something that LPs right now just don’t want to deal with,” Stanford told TechCrunch+.
And with there being so many new firms and funds in the market, the issues surrounding LPs not getting access to attractive VC funds is largely moot and that barrier isn’t really an issue anymore, he said. “There has been way more opportunity to invest in a VC than there has ever been in the past,” he said. “For new LPs coming into the market, they didn’t need to go to a fund of funds to get access.”
But to be clear, even if the funding numbers are down, FoF still holds a place in the future of venture — maybe just a different one than they did traditionally. Multiple firms have started innovating on the model, and FoF can still help LPs get access to the managers they can’t invest in otherwise, albeit for different reasons than before.

"Niantic lays off 230 employees, cancels NBA and Marvel games",Amanda Silberling,2023/06/29,"
Pokémon GO maker Niantic laid off 230 employees today, just one year after it laid off around 90 employees.
During last year’s layoffs, Niantic canceled four projects, including a Transformers game. Some Niantic games will meet the same fate this time around. After four months in the App Store, Niantic is shutting down NBA All-World; the company will also cancel production on a game based on the Marvel franchise.
“In the wake of the revenue surge we saw during Covid, we grew our headcount and related expenses in order to pursue growth more aggressively,” CEO John Hanke wrote in an email to employees, cross-posted to the company blog.
This has been a common refrain among the hundreds of tech companies that have conducted layoffs over the last year — companies claimed they overhired during the pandemic and now need to right-size their teams. In Niantic’s case, Hanke said that revenue has returned to pre-pandemic levels, and new projects have not delivered as much revenue as they would have hoped.
One such new project is Peridot, a Tamagotchi-like mobile game. Niantic’s first attempt at original IP since Ingress, Peridot launched in May. But according to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, Peridot has only made $1.4 million in gross in-app purchase revenue thus far.
Peridot is a technologically sophisticated game, complete with a robust breeding system that makes every players’ pets genetically unique. But players were disappointed at launch, since many of the game’s most exciting features are paywalled. The only way to hatch a new Peridot, for example, is to pay $5 for an in-game item. And once you pay to hatch a Peridot, you discover that you also have to pay if you want your new pet to have certain unique fur patterns or styles.
Pokémon GO is Niantic’s cash cow, pulling in more than $1 billion in in-app purchases each year since 2020. But players have also been feeling slighted by Niantic’s in-app purchase system.
At the end of March, Niantic nearly doubled the price of remote raid passes, an extremely popular in-app item. The company’s reasoning is that remote play options were essential during pandemic lockdowns, but they go against Niantic’s vision for the game, which is to get people outside to play together in person. Players don’t feel that way, though. Some even chose to boycott Pokémon GO in protest. While their protest may not have caught Niantic’s attention, its in-app purchase sales likely did.
Between July 2022 and March 2023, Sensor Tower data shows Niantic made an average of $70 million in gross in-app purchase revenue each month. In the three months since the remote raid pass price increase, Niantic has made an average of $53 million per month.
“The top priority is to keep Pokémon GO healthy and growing as a forever game,” Hanke wrote. Some Pokémon GO staff were impacted by these layoffs.
Though games like Peridot have not yet proved financially sustainable, Niantic has an entire business arm separate from its own games. Niantic’s Lightship AR developer kit makes it possible for any developer who knows how to use Unity to make AR games. Developers also have access to Niantic’s impressive visual positioning system (VPS), which lets users interact with local landmarks in their real-world surroundings.
Hanke even mentioned in his note to employees that the company wants to ramp up its focus on building for mixed-reality devices and AR glasses. So, if Niantic can’t seem to make a successful follow-up to Pokémon GO, maybe its developer tools can keep the company on the right track.

"Runway, a startup building generative AI for content creators, raises $141M",Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/29,"
It’s a big day for generative AI funding.
On the heels of Inflection AI landing a $1.3 billion investment, Runway, a startup building generative AI tools for multimedia content creators, today announced a $141 million extension to its Series C round from Google, Nvidia and Salesforce, among others.
Building on the Series C the company announced in December, Runway says that the new capital will be used to scale its in-house research efforts and expand Runway’s headcount.
“We’re focused on how we can continue pushing the boundaries of creativity,” Runway CEO Cris Valenzuela told TechCrunch via email. “The additional funding allows us to double down on this, innovating on new tools for artists and creators.”
Runway was founded in 2018 by Valenzuela, Alejandro Matamala and Anastasis Germanidis. Valenzuela met Matamala and Germanidis while in art school at NYU, where the trio came to realize that they shared a curiosity in AI’s creative potential. From there, Valenzuela, Matamala and Germanidis started building a suite of AI-powered tools geared toward moviemakers, cinematographers and photographers.
Runway’s focus has gradually shifted over the years to generative AI, particularly on the video side. Its current flagship product is Gen-2, an AI model that generates videos from text prompts or an existing image.

We tested Gen-2 and found it to be impressive — if somewhat wanting. But to Runway’s credit, Gen-2 — the follow-up to Runway’s Gen-1 model launched in February — is one of the first commercially available text-to-video models.
Runway has ambitions beyond building a toolset, to be clear. The startup recently founded Runway Studios, an entertainment division that serves as a production partner for enterprise clients. It also launched the AI Film Festival, an event Runway claims is one of the first dedicated to showcasing films produced in whole or in part by AI.
Valenzuela says that Runway’s customer base now spans Fortune 500 and Global 2000 companies, including New Balance and “millions” of individual creators.
The growing enterprise client base isn’t surprising, considering the massive hype around all forms of generative AI. In a recent FreshBooks survey, 25% of businesses said that they’re testing generative AI tools, while around 33% plan to try generative AI for work within the next year.
“Content creation today is very expensive and time consuming,” he added. “We want to help bring those cost and time factors as close to zero as possible, especially as companies’ content needs are only increasing . . . [Our goal is to] reimagine content creation and [build] a new type of creative suite, the generative suite.”
The Series C extension — which values Runway at $1.5 billion, a source familiar with the matter tells TechCrunch — brings the company’s total raised to $237 million. It makes Runway one of the better-funded generative AI startups out there, in league with Cohere, Character.ai ($150 million) and Stability AI (~$100 million).

"Thrive Capital doubles down on Clair, a fintech helping frontline workers get paid instantly",Christine Hall,2023/07/06,"
After developing a free earned-wage advance offering for frontline workers two years ago, fintech company Clair is back with a new tool to help workers get paid after completing a shift and receiving $25 million in new equity funding.
The round was led by Thrive Capital and includes Upfront Ventures and Kairos. Clair’s total venture-backed funds now rise to $45 million, according to Nico Simko, co-founder and CEO of Clair. As part of the investment, Michael Presser, investing partner at Kairos, was appointed as a board observer.

The company also announced $150 million as part of a new consumer lending program from partner bank Pathward, which holds the FDIC-insured accounts for Clair and provides the wage advances to frontline workers. Clair is facilitating loans that Pathward issues directly to Clair’s customers when they take a wage advance, with the lending between Pathward and the customers, according to the company.
Clair currently works with over 10,000 employers, workforce management systems and payroll and over 50,000 workers. Employees will see Clair through those existing employer systems that allow you to select your schedule separate from your payroll system. Employers can onboard employees and see payroll data. Employees can download the Clair app and conduct financial activities, including savings, check printing and the ability to withdraw funds for free through ATMs.
Simko touts the company’s new offering as “the first free on-demand pay solution” where users can withdraw funds immediately for the money they’ve earned but not yet received, instantly into their account.
“We’re the first provider that went to a bank and convinced the bank to do those advances, basically as micro loans, $50 loans,” Simko said. “Most early-stage, on-demand pay companies are the ones advancing the funds. By convincing a bank to do this, it gives regulatory certainty to our partners and consumers because there is a national bank backing it.”
He explained that having a bank make the advances “fueled our growth, which included 10x revenue growth over the past year,” and provided security measures for employers still thinking about the demise of Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank.
Simko intends to deploy the new capital into meeting demand for Clair’s backlog of customers. And while it is focused on workforce management and payroll companies, the company has received some inbound requests from larger businesses that Simko aims to address.
Clair is also launching a new offering for employers called Clair for Employers, which is a way for them to offer free, holistic financial wellness benefits to their employees. The offering integrates with a companies’ payroll providers, and employees of companies using it can also access additional features in their Clair accounts, including 3% cash back on gas and groceries purchased on their Clair Debit Mastercard.
In addition, the company is looking at other offerings, including a dynamic 401(k) and health savings account.
“With financial services tied to payroll and workforce management, the sky’s the limit,” Simko said. “Most of these need to be tied to a bank and payroll system, and since we have these deep kinds of HR integrations, the vision of Clair is to build the best bank for America’s workforce.”
Editor’s note, July 6, 2023, 8:23 a.m.: Story updated to reflect that the $150 million is not debt funding, but a consumer lending program.

Dear Sophie,
I just found out that I’ve been selected as a trainee in the J-1 exchange program. 
I’m currently in the U.S. on a B-1/B-2 visitor visa. The sponsoring company would like me to start in August. I heard it can take several months to change my status to a J-1. Is there a way to get a J-1 faster? 
Is there anything I should know about the J-1, particularly if I later decide to stay in the U.S. once the J-1 program ends?
— Techie Trainee
Dear Techie,
Congratulations on being selected as a J-1 educational and cultural exchange trainee!
The purpose of the J-1 is to exchange knowledge between countries. Check out my podcast that provides an overview of the J-1 as well as the waiver process. The J-1 visa is intended for people from around the globe to work or study in the U.S. and then take their newly acquired knowledge and skills back to their home country.
The Trainee J-1 usually lasts 18 months. Some J-1 holders are required to return to their home country for at least two years once their J-1 status ends. The waiver process can be particularly tricky. I recommend you consult an immigration attorney before you begin your program to confirm if you are subject to the two-year foreign residency requirement. They can also help you with any J-1 change of status or waiver application as necessary.
Good news: USCIS (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services) just rolled out premium processing for J-1 changes of status, shortening the process for individuals currently inside the United States!

Keep in mind: non-immigrant intent
Most U.S. visas such as the B-1/B-2 for visitors, J-1 for exchange visitors, and F-1 for students require their holders to have non-immigrant intent: it’s your job to prove to the U.S. government that you plan to depart the United States at the end of your program. Evidence of immigrant intent — your intention to live permanently in the U.S. by obtaining a green card — is cause for immigration officials to deny your visa. Other factors, like having a significant other who is a U.S. citizen or stating that you are planning to work in the U.S. long-term, could also be interpreted as evidence of your immigrant intent.
For the J-1, you will need to demonstrate to immigration officials that you intend to eventually return to your home country by maintaining a residence in your country or showing you have ties to your country of residence. The reason the State Department administers this program is to promote the flow of knowledge around the world. (Remember, before the internet, we generally had to physically travel to share knowledge, information, and network with people in other countries!)
How to get a J-1
After you enroll in a program, it will issue you a Form DS-2019, which is the Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor (J-1) Status. Recently, most people have been applying for new J-1 visas at the consulate and receive a multiple-entry visa. The duration is based on whatever reciprocity agreements the State Department has in place with the government of your country of citizenship. "
Brinc launches new program for climate tech startups,Catherine Shu,2023/07/05,"
Brinc, the Hong Kong–based accelerator backed by investors like Animoca Brands, is launching a new program for fledgling climate tech startups. The three-month program is tailored for founders who are focused on carbon dioxide removal (CDR). They will receive fundraising support, guidance on how to scale up and introductions to Brinc’s network of follow-on investors, mentors and corporates.
Janina Motter, Brinc’s Climate Tech Program manager, told TechCrunch that the accelerator has focused on climate tech for several years through its food tech vertical. “From those successes, we recognized sector specificity is key to maximize value for founders,” she said. “This is why we plan to have several different climate tech programs over time, with this new program focused on carbon removal, utilization and storage.” She added that Brinc has seen underinvestment in carbon removal relative to its climate impact.
The inaugural cohort includes four startups. Motter said “the strongest applicants understand how their approach fits into the competitive landscape and have compelling answers about ‘why them? why now?’ for the company to grow. Furthermore, for CDR in particular, it’s critical that startups have some initial understanding of how their technology fits into broader context (ecological risk, co-benefits, local communities, etc.) and are willing to develop a robust framework which will help them scale responsibly.”
From the United Kingdom, Airhive is creating geochemical direct air capture (DAC) to scale carbon removal. Its DAC system is modular and based on a fluidized nano-structured sorbent.
Based in the United States, CarbonBridge captures fermentation CO2 — CO2 generated by fermenting plant matter — to make beer, wine and other products, before it enters the atmosphere, and produces eco-friendly methanol through a microbial conversion process. The startup says this is a cost-effective alternative to mainstream methanol made from fossil fuels.
Hong Kong’s Formwork IO wants to reduce carbon emissions in architecture and other parts of the built environment. It does so by creating carbon-negative concrete through the use of waste carbon dioxide and materials as binders. Formwork IO is focused on the Asian market, where it says more than 70% of cement is produced.
Poás Bioenergy, based in Costa Rica, turns agricultural waste, including coffee and pineapple residue, into biochar and syngas, making waste management more efficient and giving farms a source of clean energy.
The Climate Tech Program is supported by organizations like Artesian, Carbon Business Council, CO2CRC, Direct Air Capture Coalition, PML Applications and others.

Crypto funding drops for fifth straight quarter as investors continue to pull back,Jacquelyn Melinek,2023/07/05,"

Funding for crypto startups continues to grow more scarce. Venture capital flowing into the industry dropped for the fifth consecutive quarter since Q1 2022 to $2.34 billion globally as investors withhold their checkbooks, fearing risks from a severe regulatory stance and an uncertain economy.
The second quarter’s $2.34 billion tally was raised across 382 deals, according to PitchBook data, but it’s a stark decline from the $12.14 billion peak the industry hit in the first quarter of 2022. The biggest raises during Q2 2023 were LayerZero’s $120 million Series B round and Worldcoin’s $115 million Series C round.
“It’s a numbers game,” said Lydia Chiu, VP of business development at Ava Labs. In general, investors are seeing lower valuations, so they’re writing “smaller checks,” she told TechCrunch+.
This decline in capital deployment could be attributed to regulatory headwinds in the U.S., which have inclined a lot of crypto-related deal flows in Q2 to be structured like traditional venture structures, like raising equity, opposed to token investments or simple agreement for future tokens (SAFTs), Chiu said.
 

			The Tiger Globals and Softbanks of the world aren’t going to invest in everything anymore.							Lasse Clausen, founding partner, 1kx



Regulations have certainly stifled optimism around the industry, but there are also a number of other factors at play. A handful of popular crypto companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year, squelching confidence in the industry, and a few traditional firms and entrepreneurs left the U.S. ecosystem altogether when the market turned. It also didn’t help when investors suddenly adopted a much more discerning approach that valued profits over growth.
According to Chiu, valuations in the industry dropped a stark 50% from the first half of 2022 to the second half of 2022. Since then, crypto startups’ valuations have dropped an additional 15% to the first half of 2023, totaling almost 70% year over year.
That’s a severe decline — startups that raised money in January 2022, for example, would be hard pressed to raise capital again today without taking a steep discount on their price tags.
But it’s not all doom and gloom, and crypto-native founders and investors are not yet giving up hope. “That trend is not necessarily going to reverse, but it may slow down in Q3 or be less severe,” Chiu said.
Indeed, there’s still “a lot of money being deployed,” said Lasse Clausen, founding partner at early-stage crypto investing firm 1kx. “[Funding] looks like it’s down, and it absolutely is, but comparing it to all time highs, those didn’t even make any sense.”

Announcing the SaaS Stage agenda at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023,Frederic Lardinois,2023/07/05,"
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) has become something akin to the default model for software distribution. But it’s more than a business model. It’s also a way of developing and managing software throughout its life cycle — and that means its underpinnings are forever changing.
We decided to host a special SaaS Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023 to dig deeper into the current state of SaaS, especially now that AI is changing the software landscape once again. We announced the new stage a few weeks ago, and today we’re excited to provide a first look at the agenda. Stay tuned — we’ll add more in the weeks to come!
We’ll examine the current state of SaaS of course but, more importantly, the agenda explores what comes next. We’ll talk to some of the sharpest minds and professionals in the industry — executives from early- and late-stage SaaS companies, leaders from the infrastructure companies that power the industry and the venture capitalists who fund them. The agenda is about 80% complete, so make sure to check back for more updates!
We hope you’ll join us at TechCrunch Disrupt on September 19–21 in San Francisco.
The SaaS Stage Agenda at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023
Selling Your SaaS Startup: The VC View
with Whit Bouck (Insight), Megan Reynolds (Vertex) and Cathy Gao (Sapphire Ventures)
There are many reasons to sell your SaaS startup, but what is the investor perspective? This panel looks at why VCs might support your move to sell, and when they might encourage you to keep going.
What’s Next for GitHub?
with Thomas Dohmke (GitHub CEO)
GitHub has long been at the core of developer workflows, but over the course of the last few years, the company started going well beyond being a code repository and collaboration service. To a large degree, that’s thanks to its Copilot code completion service. In this session, we’ll talk about what’s next for GitHub as it expands beyond its core service under the ownership of Microsoft.
Cloudflare’s Journey from TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield to Public Company
with Michelle Zatlyn and Matthew Prince (Cloudflare co-founders)
Cloudflare launched onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2010. Today it’s a public company. We will chat with the co-founders about their journey and the challenges they face in today’s investment climate.
AI for SaaS
with Ines Chami (Numbers Station AI), David DeSanto (GitLab) and Navrina Singh (Credo AI)
The use cases for generative AI are endless, so it’s no surprise that virtually every new and existing SaaS startup now wants to make it part of their core product. In this session, we’ll talk about how to best do that, no matter whether you have an established product or you’re just starting out — all while doing so responsibly.
The State of Quantum
with Itamar Sivan (Quantum Machines)
Quantum computing is quickly moving from a science-fiction concept to a technology that has the potential to change the state of computing. In this session, we’ll talk about the state of the industry, the challenges ahead and the potential risks involved.

Steering through venture’s global correction with the GPCA’s CEO,Alex Wilhelm,2023/07/05,"

Hello and welcome back to Equity, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines. This is our Wednesday show where we niche down to a single topic and dig deep.

All the cool kids are filling out the Equity listener survey. We want to hear from you! 

Long-time Equity listeners and TechCrunch readers should be familiar with LAVCA, an association of capital managers in the Latin America region. We have reported on its data a number of times. Well, it turns out that LAVCA is part of the larger Global Private Capital Association, which keeps tabs on a host of markets that we’re working to cover more carefully as startup activity becomes an increasingly global phenomenon.
So to cap off the second quarter, and to get our claws into what is going on around the world, we had Cate Ambrose, the CEO of the GPCA on the show to riff with us about Asia and Africa and Latin America and Central and Easter Europe. Here’s what we wanted to find out:

How wild was the 2021-era venture peak in less mature startup markets?
How resilient are smaller startup ecosystems in a more conservative venture and macroeconomic environment?
Are we seeing green shoots anywhere in the world? Or put another way, where is the rebound kicking off?
We closed with a short discussion on the role of government in startup markets and squeezed in an AI question because how could we not!

We have another interview coming your way Friday, so stay tuned!
For episode transcripts and more, head to Equity’s Simplecast website.
Equity drops at 7 a.m. PT every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, so subscribe to us on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify and all the casts. TechCrunch also has a great show on crypto, a show that interviews founders, one that details how our stories come together and more!

"Yes, investors will sign an NDA, but only in this specific circumstance",Haje Jan Kamps,2023/07/05,"
If you’ve tried to get an investor to sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) before you pitch them, you’ll often be waved off with something like, “We don’t do that.”
That is somewhat sensible: Investors talk to a lot of startups, so signing an NDA could open them up to liabilities in many ways. For example, an investor could agree to not share anything you’ve disclosed, but it’s possible they heard another startup doing exactly what you do, with exactly your approach a couple of weeks before they spoke to you. That puts them in an awkward position.
This practice is therefore so widespread it’s become something of a rule.

As a startup founder, you really need to understand how venture capital works

There are times when you should push back against such conventions, though: When you’re discussing the details of your technology.
If an investor says they don’t sign NDAs, here’s what you should do: Take the meeting anyway but move the slides that talk about your technology to another part of the presentation deck, behind an interstitial slide saying, “Beyond this point, an NDA is required.”
Your job as the founder — using the market size, your unique team and traction — is to tell enough of a compelling story that the investors choose to sign an NDA ahead of your next meeting.
Here’s why you might need an NDA

CADDi raises $89M Series C to scale its B2B supply chain marketplace for manufacturing parts ,Kate Park,2023/07/05,"
The pandemic has damaged the entire manufacturing supply chain, which is not likely to return to normal until at least 2024 due to a few challenges, including the ongoing U.S.-China tech battle. According to a recent survey by the Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM), which surveyed more than 150 equipment manufacturing firms and 179 equipment manufacturing executives, 98% of the respondents still are facing the supply chain issue and more than half are experiencing worsening supply chain conditions owing to a labor shortage and access to source intermediate components. 
Today, a startup called CADDi, which operates a business-to-business (B2B) marketplace for the manufacturing industry, said it has raised $89 million in a Series C round, bringing its total capital to $164 million, to scale its business and help those equipment manufacturing players. 
Existing investors Globis Capital Partners, DCM Ventures, Global Brain, World Innovation Lab, JAFCO and Minerva Growth Partners participated in the Series C financing along with four new investors, including SMBC Venture Capital and Mitsubishi UFJ Capital. 
CADDi did not provide its post-valuation but said the valuation had been up from its previous funding. In 2021, TechCrunch reported that its valuation was estimated at $450 million at its Series B funding, citing sources familiar with the deal. 
Since its last fundraising, the number of employees has more than doubled from 250 to 590 globally, and the startup launched a new platform called CADDi Drawer, an artificial intelligence-powered cloud service for managing drawing data, last June. 
Yushiro Kato (CEO), a former consultant at McKinsey & Company, and Aki Kobashi (CTO), who previously worked as an engineer at Lockheed Martin and Apple, co-founded CADDi in 2017. The startup now offers two major solutions: CADDi Manufacturing, a parts procurement platform, and CADDi Drawer. 
CADDi deals with mid-volume production and high-mix, low-volume production manufacturers, also known as make-to-order manufacturing, in which manufacturers produce products after confirmed orders. But the problem is consumers cannot get optimal pricing with low- to mid-volume production manufacturers due to volume constraints.
The outfit says the CAADi Manufacturing platform eliminates some procurement work and aggregates orders to help find similar materials, processes and suitable delivery schedules. It enables customers to access optimal prices with a 99.83% on-time delivery rate and a 99.96% non-defective rate yielding, Kato said in an email interview. It also allows manufacturers’ procurement costs to reduce by nearly 20%. 
CADDi Drawer offers access to “all procurement data” and details that impact quality, cost and delivery (QCD); its platform also enables users to save significant time and costs while allowing manufacturers to improve QCD with more drawings created. Since April, the CADDi Drawer team has worked with the AI team to handle the information. 
“Because of the difficulty of access [drawings], drawings are often recreated or just not found, which means keys to improving QCD, the KPI for manufacturing professionals, are never unlocked,” Kato said. “So, instead of more drawings providing more improvement, it’s almost like the data is never saved, and people are forced to start from scratch every time.” 
CADDi claims it works with 70% of Japan’s top 20 industrial equipment manufacturers (by revenue) for CADDi Manufacturing. For CADDi Drawer, its customers include Tokyo Electron and EBARA. 
It will use the proceeds to enhance CADDi manufacturing and CADDi Drawing and expand its workforce in the U.S., aiming to reach its goals of posting $10 billion in revenue from CADDi manufacturing and $1 billion in revenue from CADDi Drawer by 2030. 
Some of the pains in the procurement industry in the U.S. are similar to those in Japan, Kato said, citing not only labor shortages in the manufacturing sector but also many ongoing mergers and acquisitions. But factories are not integrated well on account of different systems and standards, Kato noted. 
“We can expand into the U.S. by leveraging [our] knowledge and technology that have developed since our inception, primarily in Japan and across a variety of manufacturing industries,” Kato said. 
The Japan-headquartered company recently opened an office in the U.S. and supplier operations in Mexico to cater to clients in the U.S. In Asia, CADDi has offices in Vietnam and Thailand.

Daniel Ek’s Neko Health raises $65M for preventative healthcare through full-body scans,Paul Sawers,2023/07/05,"
Neko Health, the health tech startup co-founded by Spotify co-creator Daniel Ek, has raised €60 million ($65 million) in its first external round of funding.
The Series A round was led by Lakestar, with participation from Atomico and General Catalyst.
Founded out of Sweden in 2018 by Ek and Hjalmar Nilsonne, Neko Health exited stealth back in February with the lofty promise of preventative healthcare via full-body scans backed by AI software that help doctors detect skin conditions including cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, among other metabolic syndromes.
Each scan apparently takes around 10 minutes and costs €250, according to the company, and is followed by an in-person consultation where the results are explained.

The Stockholm-headquartered company claims a team of 35 doctors, researchers and technicians spread across Europe, and it has a waiting list for people seeking full-body scans out of its inaugural clinic in Stockholm.
“Healthcare costs are spiraling out of control — we believe preventive health will be key to reversing this trend,” Neko Health CEO Hjalmar Nilsonne noted in a statement. “Doctors today just don’t have enough time or resources to focus on prevention. This leads to many health problems going unnoticed until they get really serious, causing a lot of pain and putting a massive strain on the healthcare system.”
Unhealthy silence
What’s perhaps most notable about Neko at this juncture is its aversion to interviews, particularly against the backdrop of high-profile health techs such as Theranos’ spectacular fall from grace after making bold claims with little foundation. Indeed, Neko Health declined to give interviews to international media when it formally launched earlier this year, and little opportunity was given to ask questions ahead of today’s funding announcement.
At any rate, Neko Health has amassed a fairly impressive roster of investors spanning the U.S. and Europe, which have collectively backed companies including Spotify, Airbnb, Snap and HubSpot. And as a result of their investments, Lakestar and Atomico’s founders, Klaus Hommels and Niklas Zennström respectively, will join Neko’s board of directors alongside Neko’s two founders.
The company said it will use its fresh cash injection to accelerate its expansion plans, including more clinics across Europe, and investing in R&D, clinical studies and recruitment.

"PharmEasy, once valued at over $5 billion, seeks new funding at a 90% valuation cut",Manish Singh,2023/07/05,"
Indian online pharmacy startup PharmEasy is planning to raise about $300 million in a new round of funding at a 90% markdown from the previous valuation, two people familiar with the matter said, effectively giving in to some investors’ push to sell itself. Should PharmEasy succeed in securing the new funding, its valuation will drop to half of the total capital it has raised over years.
PharmEasy, one of India’s largest pharmacy firms, is racing to raise the new capital to pay its lender Goldman Sachs, the people said, requesting anonymity discussing sensitive information. PharmEasy borrowed about $285 million from Goldman Sachs last year to pay off an earlier debt that it took to move ahead with a majority stake acquisition of Thyrocare for over $600 million.
The firm, which offers a range of services including tools and information on wellness, consultations, diagnostic and radiology tests and treatment deliveries, had filed for an $843 million IPO in November 2021, but later deferred the plan.
PharmEasy’s chief executive did not respond to a request for comment.
Indian newspaper Economic Times first reported the development, while Moneycontrol said separately that healthcare group Manipal was looking to lead the $300 million funding into the startup. Some of the startup’s backers have been pushing it to sell the business for several quarters, according to three people familiar with the matter.
API Holdings, the parent firm of PharmEasy, was valued at $5.6 billion in its most recent funding round in the second half of 2021.
The startup plans to raise new financing through a rights issue that would value the price of its shares at 5 Indian rupees, down from 50 earlier, Economic Times reported, citing internal documents.
At the proposed terms, if the round materializes, PharmEasy will see its valuation plummet to about $500 million to $600 million. The startup, whose stake in Thyrocare itself is worth about $241 million at Wednesday’s closure, has altogether raised over $1.1 billion against equity and in debt. It will also become the first major Indian unicorn to raise a down round.
PharmEasy has been looking to raise a new round for several quarters, but has struggled to find a taker at even $2 billion valuation, TechCrunch reported earlier. The company did not respond at the time.
The firm counts TPG, Prosus, Temasek, B Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, Eight Roads Ventures, Steadview Capital and JM Financial among its backers.

"After bootstrapping for 8 years, accounting startup Dougs raises $27 million",Romain Dillet,2023/07/04,"
Dougs, a French accounting startup, has been around since 2015. It already generates $16.4 million (€15 million) in annual recurring revenue. And it’s a bootstrapped company, meaning that it hasn’t opened its capital and raised any funding from VC firms. But now, the company has decided to raise its first funding round.
Dougs raised $27 million (€25 million) from Expedition Growth Capital, a British VC firm that is looking for investment opportunities in bootstrapped companies that have reached a certain level of maturity. And Dougs seems to fit the bill quite well as the company has 14,000 clients and is already profitable.
At its core, Dougs is an online chartered accountant service for small and medium companies. It handles your financial statements and generates certified tax filings. Behind the scenes, Dougs works with chartered accountants, legal experts, HR professionals, etc. But the company has also designed its own accounting application to improve the relationship between the Dougs team and its clients.
In particular, clients can connect Dougs with their bank accounts so that the accounting platform can automatically fetch transactions. From the customer portal, clients can upload documents, receipts and more. Dougs can also handle expense reports and invoices, which means that you can use Dougs to get an overview of your company’s revenue — past, present and future.
Additionally, Dougs can facilitate the incorporation process. It can also be used for your company’s payroll. Dougs also provides legal advice when needed. In other words, the startup handles all the usual tasks that would be handled by an accountant.
There are 250 people working for Dougs. With today’s funding round, the company expects to reach the next level by doubling the size of its team by 2025. Up next, the startup plans to expand to new countries, such as Germany and the U.K.
Dougs competes with other online chartered accountant services, such as Keobiz, Livli, Wity, etc. Some tech companies like Pennylane are taking a different approach as they work with existing accounting firms to make them switch from a legacy accounting software solution to a modern software-as-a-service platform.
But there’s room for many companies in this space, as accounting firms remain extremely fragmented in France. Existing accounting firms working with old-school accounting applications remain the default option for many small and medium companies.

The Tesla Gigafactory planned to be built in Mexico should be seen, Bloomberg argues, “as a graduation moment for Mexican manufacturing.” And there’s hope that the CHIPS bill, which President Joe Biden promoted to supercharge semiconductor production in the U.S., will benefit its southern neighbor as well.
While the prospect of new factories and more jobs is good news for Mexico, the country and its Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) peers can harbor higher hopes when it comes to deep tech, a new report posits.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

Titled “Deep Tech: The New Wave” and created in collaboration with the Inter-American Development Bank’s innovation laboratory (IDB Lab), the report concludes that there is room for a twentyfold increase in VC investment into LAC deep tech startups over the next decade.
While such projections are always open for debate, the reasoning and data behind this conclusion are worth looking into.
Diving deep
What “deep tech” means changes according to who’s using it. The consulting firm behind this report, Surfing Tsunamis, used this definition by Propel(x) CEO Swati Chaturvedi:
Deep technology companies are built on tangible scientific discoveries or engineering innovations. They are trying to solve big issues that really affect the world around them. For example, a new medical device or technique fighting cancer, data analytics to help farmers grow more food, or a clean energy solution trying to lessen the human impact on climate change.
Based on this definition, the report says LAC’s “most notable deep tech success story to date” is cybersecurity startup Auth0, which Okta acquired for $6.5 billion in 2021.
Despite this fairly broad definition covering everything from cybersecurity to biotech, most LAC startups don’t fit the bill. Inferring from a previous report, Surfing Tsunamis estimates that deep tech companies represent roughly 10% of the regional startup ecosystem.

Making sense of the $6.5B Okta-Auth0 deal

“The vast majority of startups from Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) [regions] focus on product and business model innovation, with limited technology risk,” it said.
Venture capital investment into LAC deep tech represents an even smaller share of overall VC dealmaking in the region. However, it is on the rise, both in absolute numbers and proportionally, growing from $96 million (0.59%) in 2020 to $172 million (2.2%) in 2022.
What do the recipients of this venture capital look like? They are fairly diverse, both in terms of sector and country of origin. "
Plaid will deposit open banking intel on the Fintech Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023,Lauren Simonds,2023/07/04,"
If a cat had a thousand lives, we would name it Plaid — in recognition of the fintech startup giant that moves forward relentlessly, regardless of obstacles along the way. Case in point: When the Department of Justice scuttled a $5 billion acquisition deal with Visa, Plaid barely blinked.
Instead, it continued its quest to make open banking a reality by releasing new features and raising more money. It’s been an impressive performance, considering the challenges presented by the macro-environment — from which Plaid was entirely not immune.
These are just a few reasons why we’re excited that Zach Perret, Plaid’s co-founder and CEO, will join us for the aptly named session “Plaid’s Zach Perret Opens Up on Open Banking.” You’ll find it on the Fintech Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023, which takes place September 19–21 in San Francisco.
We look forward to hearing Perret’s take on the current state and overall future of open banking. We’re also interested in how he, and the company, regrouped after the Visa deal fell through. What did it take to focus and forge ahead?
Plaid has been gradually expanding its offerings over the years — including adding income verification services, facilitating payments and tackling fraud. We wonder whether Perret ever worries about the company trying to do too much at once.
We’ll also ask what’s ahead for Plaid, and, without a doubt, more questions will pop up between now and September. Join us for what’s sure to be an interesting, insightful session.
Zach Perret: Plaid co-founder and CEO
When Zach Perret realized how difficult it was to build a personal finance application, he co-founded Plaid in 2013. The tech platform gives developers easy and secure access to a financial data network capable of powering any digital financial service.
Prior to founding Plaid, Perret was a consultant for Bain and graduated with degrees in physics and chemistry from Duke University.

What’s it like being a Black founder in France?,Dominic-Madori Davis,2023/07/04,"
In France, Shaila Sahai says pitching investors usually goes like this.
She is a woman, Black and a CEO, and when she walks into a meeting with investors, armed with a slide deck for her fintech startup We Take Part, she’s often greeted with bafflement. “They are surprised, and they can’t hide it,” she told me.
She’ll go on to pitch her company, and then: “They usually just leave the conversation,” she said. “I’ve had people say, ‘Oh, okay, nice, very interesting. Thank you. See you soon.’ And we were in the middle of a conversation.”
In France, Sahai isn’t alone in facing this almost systemic avoidance of people who look like her, but you wouldn’t be able to find any proof of it. The French startup ecosystem for Black founders is shrouded in mystery, especially because France’s embrace of universalism and its color-blind approach to economic and social policy has meant that there is little to no data or visibility into the startup and venture capital industry’s racial and ethnic diversity.
The country does not track its racial diversity metrics (former French president Nicolas Sarkozy tried and failed to change that about 14 years ago), meaning that while racism continues to exist in the country like everywhere else in the world, there is no hard evidence of that racism. Many Black founders are reluctant to draw attention to themselves and instead move in silence, contributing to a lack of success stories about them.
 

			We have to fight all these stereotypes to prove we can do interesting things.					


For those looking to break into the tech sector, this lack of information makes it look like there is nothing happening within venture capital for Black founders.
Naturally, that isn’t true: Laura Pallier raised a $20 million Series A for her fintech SaaS platform Regate last September; Alvyn Severien closed a $13 million Series A for his algae products company Algama in January; Nelly Chatue-Diop raised $2 million last year for her web3 investment startup Ejara; Bruno Mendes Da Silva raised $3.5 million last year for his AI-focused data startup Heex Technologies; and Sebastien Luissaint raised $2.4 million last August for Myditek, an agtech startup.
This list isn’t comprehensive, of course, but it’s representative of the fact that Black founders can and do run fast-growing businesses in tech and other fields. “We are invited to speak, we are invited onstage to testify,” Sahai said. “But we have more to bring to the table than just testaments. We should be invited to the decision-making process. We should be funded. And that’s it.”
“It’s impossible that you can be their equal”
Black people in France have faced a long history of discrimination that’s been swept under the rug. Many Black people in France hail from or are descendants of immigrants from its Outremer or “overseas departments” — mostly islands such as Réunion and Martinique — and are legally French citizens. Others have ancestors from former French colonies in Africa, including Côte d’Ivoire, Mali and Senegal.
Sahai, who was born and raised in France, believes the country is still “embarrassed” about its history of enslaving and colonizing Africans and Afro-Caribbeans. Despite that, deep-seated racial stereotypes and prejudices still fester in the country, manifesting in the form of economic discrimination against Black entrepreneurs, a few founders told TechCrunch+.
Compared to the U.K., where there have been more open and honest conversations about racism and colonialism, she said the French don’t want to acknowledge their history.

Google’s Gradient backs YC alum Infisical to solve secret sprawl,Paul Sawers,2023/07/03,"
Secret sprawl, where companies store authentication credentials and similar sensitive data across multiple locations, is a real and growing problem for any company wanting to avert a security breach.
Companies might have hundreds of secrets — such as API keys, passwords or database access tokens — spread across their infrastructure, making it difficult to keep tabs on what is stored where, who has access to it, and whether any of this data has inadvertently found its way into the public realm. By way of example, back in 2017, Uber revealed a major breach that exposed the personal data of some 57 million customers, and while there were many security failures at play, the root cause stemmed from hackers that found an AWS access key in a GitHub repository of an Uber developer.
And it’s against that backdrop that we’ve seen a slew of startups and Big Tech tools go to market designed to help companies manage their secret sprawl. The latest is a San Francisco-based company called Infisical, which today announced it has raised $2.8 million in a seed round of funding led by Google’s Gradient Ventures to help companies of all sizes centralize their secret management.
Top secret
Infisical is pitching itself as a holistic secret-management platform combining all the components a company needs — a bit like what Rippling has been doing in the workforce management space, except for secrets, according to Infisical co-founder Vlad Matsiiako.
“As companies are becoming more digital and integrated with other software, it’s harder to manage all of their application and developer secrets — they have to buy multiple tools and give all of them access to their secrets, which is a security concern on its own,” Matsiiako explained to TechCrunch. “You can think of Infisical as an all-in-one secret management stack that combines all related product verticals for a company.”
This includes a dashboard for managing secrets across different projects and environments; client SDKs; a command line interface (CLI); native integrations with the likes of GitHub, Netlify and Vercel; secret versioning and “point-in-time recovery”; audit logs; and secret scanning.

As for a business model, Infisical attracts revenue through its hosted cloud incarnation, which it sells as a SaaS, and through its self-hosted counterpart by selling enterprise-grade features.
The (sort of) open source factor
While Infisical is pushing itself as an “open source” SecretOps platform, a quick peek at its licensing on GitHub reveals that it’s perhaps more aligned with the open-core or source available realm, than it is the pure open source sphere. That is to say, while much of the platform’s core functionality is apparently available to use under the permissive MIT license, including secret-scanning and infrastructure integrations, it has retained a lot of the features — such as audit logs, single-sign on, recovery and access controls — under a proprietary license under a separate enterprise edition (EE).
“Our entire codebase is available for everyone to view on GitHub, and we keep all core secret management functionalities available under the MIT license,” Matsiiako said. “We strongly believe that solo developers and hobbyists should be able to experiment with most features for free using either Infisical Cloud or Infisical self-hosted.”
The thinking here is that when users start considering Infisical in terms of deploying for critical commercial use cases, they need more features such as advanced security and compliance. So even if a company has chosen to self-host Infisical, they still have to purchase an enterprise license to leverage core proprietary features.
“The goal is really to charge only larger enterprises,” Matsiiako added.
There are a bunch of similar tools on the market already, including the open source Vault project from billion-dollar cloud infrastructure giant HashiCorp, which has pretty much set the standard for the secret-management sector. However, Matsiiako argues that Infisical is aimed more at general developers rather than platform-engineering teams, making it easier to deploy with a flatter learning curve.
“Vault is difficult to adopt for developers without a background in security or infrastructure, and we find it to be more popular amongst security and platform-engineering teams,” he said. “Because of that, companies experience slower development cycles and some even resort to developing fully custom developer-facing solutions on top of — or instead of — Vault.
Other notable alternatives include Doppler and Akeyless, which are substantively proprietary SaaS products, and even tangential products such as secret-scanning tools from the likes of GitGuardian, a feature that Infisical is already supporting as part of its platform.
“By integrating secret scanning inside of Infisical’s bundle offering, we extract synergies between secret management and secret scanning, and a company looking for related secret management solutions now only needs to go through one vendor instead of multiple,” Matsiiako said.
The story so far
The company’s trio of founders — Matsiiako, Maidul Islam and Tuan Dang — met at Cornell University, where they studied a mix of computer and data science subjects, going on to work at various companies such as AWS, Figma and Bung. They then met up to kickstart their new venture together out of San Francisco last August.
“Throughout our past collective experiences and talking to industry peers, we recognized that managing application secrets was cumbersome and that problems in the secret management industry were far from being solved,” Matsiiako said. “It became clear to us that we needed to build an open source solution that’s simple to use for secret management; being open source gives developers the flexibility of using Infisical Cloud or self-hosting it on their own infrastructure which is what larger companies frequently do.”
Infisical went on to raise $500,000 from its participation in Y Combinator’s (YC) winter ’23 program, and it recently made its first engineering hire, who joined them from enterprise software giant Red hat.
Aside from lead backer Gradient Ventures, the company’s seed round included investments from YC, 22 Ventures and angel backers such as Elad Gil and YC’s Diana Hu.

Kenya’s MyDawa aims to be an all-in-one health platform backed by $20 million funding,Annie Njanja,2023/07/03,"
Kenyan e-health startup MyDawa has raised $20 million from private equity investor Alta Semper Capital to expand its regional reach and product offerings with the aim of becoming an all-in-one health platform for users.
MyDawa, which launched in 2016, has diversified from an e-pharmacy to include online and in-person consultations, as well as laboratory services at its expanding network of walk-in pharmacies and health centers.
It has also launched its own branded products, and plans to open up its technology infrastructure from telehealth to fulfillment, helping other businesses in the health sector to scale. It claims to have already inked deals with some of Kenya’s biggest clinic chains, which are looking to expand their reach.
Additionally, MyDawa has acquired Uganda’s Guardian Health, one of the many acquisitions and collaborations it aims to make as it expands beyond Kenya. The growth plans will be steered by new CEO Priscilla Muhiu, formerly of Glovo Kenya.

African health tech startups in the supply chain segment show rapid growth, spurring a $7M investment initiative

Commenting on the funding and newest acquisition, MyDawa co-founder Neil O’Leary said: “Alta Semper’s ambition exactly matches that of MyDawa, and it brings the drive, connections and clout to succeed. Three years ago, AAIC, a Japanese-backed African healthcare fund, joined as our first external investor and now the team has been augmented in the strongest manner possible.”
“MyDawa now has both a solid secure base and a great expansion opportunity based on a great offering which improves health outcomes. Guardian is a great first step on fulfilling our ambition,” O’Leary added.
MyDawa raised $3 million from AAIC’s Africa Healthcare Fund in 2019, and has also received $1.2 million grant funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation to fight the spread of HIV/AIDS by increasing access to PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis) medication.
Alta Semper CEO Afsane Jetha, said the investment marked the PE firm’s first entry into digital healthcare in Africa, regarded as one of the sectors with the potential for great growth in the coming years.
“MyDawa was the logical choice for us as their groundbreaking technology, underpinning a scalable business model, along with regulatory knowhow and market entry experience, mapped so well to our own strategy. The drive to increase the access to good advice and safe and affordable medication is core to our overall mission of democratizing access to health and well-being across the African continent,” said Jetha.
“With consumer spending in Africa projected to reach $2.1 trillion by 2025, this represents one of the continent’s largest business opportunities. Therefore, the investment into MyDawa is part of our strategic aim at meeting this growing demand by investing in locally produced and value-priced consumer goods and services.”

The remote work startups that will last aren’t actually remote work startups,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/07/03,"
Back in 2020 when the pandemic forced people to work from home, entrepreneurs saw an opportunity to build tools to fuel this new transition to remote work. From virtual offices to making it easy to run payroll for a distributed team, founders leaned in hard.
But now, three years later, some companies have remained remote, others have gone back to the office, and most are operating somewhere in the middle. It’s become increasingly unclear if there really is a large market for companies focused on catering exclusively to remote work. It seems that the remote work category has lost steam — but has it?
It’s hard to pin the exact numbers on it — because the category can include companies across various sectors — but there are signs that things aren’t going well for many remote work startups.

"Hello Alice, Global Entrepreneurship Network unveil $70M Equitable Access Fund",Christine Hall,2023/06/28,"
Hello Alice, a fintech helping small businesses access capital, and entrepreneurship ecosystem Global Entrepreneurship Network (GEN) created a $70 million Equitable Access Fund designed to bridge the financing gap experienced by women and BIPOC-owned founders.
“There’s an estimated $40 billion gap among the BIPOC community alone,” Elizabeth Gore, Hello Alice co-founder, told TechCrunch. “Also, the biggest gap we saw to growing businesses was lack of credit history.”
She also noted that many small business owners don’t have the generational wealth or collateral to put up for loans. Some turn to credit; however, just 25% of small business owners have applied for a business credit card, and 85% of those applications were denied due to poor credit or lack of credit.
The Equitable Access Fund will provide those credit enhancements, including guarantees, loan loss reserves and cash collateral deposits to financing partners. It will be deployed over the next five years with aims to improve equitable access to credit and unlock up to $1 billion in credit for small business owners in what Gore called the “new majority,” which includes women, veterans, BIPOC, Latinx, those with disabilities, LGBTQIA+ and other groups.
Initial capital commitments were led by Wells Fargo. Other partners in the program include First National Bank of Omaha, Mastercard and the Kauffman Foundation.
The fund is part of the Equitable Access Program, run by Hello Alice and GEN, which provides increased credit access via a Mastercard secured card and financial education. As part of the program, Hello Alice also launched a business health score tool in April that provides an overview of a business’s financial health and recommendations on how owners can improve their performance.
Meanwhile, Hello Alice serves 1.3 million small business owners, and its loan center has distributed just over $30 million in grants and continues to grow with 92 lenders, Gore said.
“With the economic uncertainty, upheaval in banking and a lot of the fear that things are tightening and interest rates are changing, we’re going to see that it’s even harder for folks to get loans, particularly in the first 24 months of their business,” Gore added. “We really rushed to get out the business health score, which was supposed to come out later, because it is absolutely critical that all business owners are managing their cash flow appropriately right now.”

"No SSN, no problem, says Maza, a fintech startup aimed at undocumented immigrants",Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/06/28,"
Want more fintech news in your inbox? Sign up here.
While there are a multitude of fintech companies offering digital banking services to a variety of demographics, there has been one segment of the population that historically has been underserved even more than others: the undocumented immigrant.
Because undocumented immigrants don’t have Social Security numbers, it can be difficult to impossible to access traditional banking services. A startup called Maza has set out to help solve that problem.
While several fintech startups set out to serve immigrants generally (Welcome Technologies, Majority, TomoCredit are examples), Maza says its main differentiator is that it provides immigrants with an individual tax identification number (ITIN), plugging in directly with IRS-certified acceptance agents “to make the Tax ID number process automated for customers.” The end goal, notes co-founder and COO Robbie Figueroa, is to unlock access to the rest of the U.S. financial system and avoid non-traditional (and sometimes predatory) approaches to finance, such as loan sharks and pawn brokers.
Maza customers are “immediately” equipped with a U.S. bank account and debit card. The company claims that because its members also have a tax ID number, they can start building a credit history and applying for loans. Having a bank account also allows them to receive payments from employers and file taxes. With Maza, customers without SSNs can access credit and thus, develop a credit history so they can do things like get auto or home loans. The startup also says it offers a robust peer to peer payments functionality.
On the back end, Maza says it “handles” their taxes to ensure they remain compliant, even going as far as automatically renewing their financial identity documentation for them.
Since its 2022 inception, the Los Angeles-based, 15-person startup has grown to having 50,000 users (each paying $150 a year for access) on its platform, enabling $41 million in digital payments to date.
Maza’s unique model caught the attention of Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), which recently led the company’s $8 million seed funding round. Other backers include SV Angel, Box Group, Restive Ventures, Global Founders Capital, Abstract Ventures and a group of angel investors including Anré Williams, CEO of American Express National Bank, and Plaid co-founder William Hockey.
While its total addressable market is the more than 15 million immigrants living in the U.S., Maza says its focus is on the Latino, or Spanish-speaking, population.
“Customers go from undocumented to partially documented,” Maza co-founder and CEO Luciano Arango told TechCrunch in an interview.
Arango and Figueroa teamed up with Siggy Bilstein (CTO) to start Maza after seeing their own parents struggle as immigrants in the U.S. (The trio is a combination of Colombian, Peruvian, Brazilian and Ecuadorian descent.)
Image Credits: Maza
Like many fintechs offering digital banking services, Maza is not itself a bank. It is able to offer its services without requiring an SSN by partnering with Visa and Blue Ridge Bank. The company’s banking product features “broad payment functionality,” it touts, as well as integrations with all major payment platforms, including PayPal, Zelle, Venmo and CashApp. Further, money deposited in Maza, the company claims, earns “one of the highest checking account interest rates,” an effort to help its members “grow their wealth over time.”
Interestingly, while Maza might be a digital bank, its marketing efforts are mostly focused offline. The company has found success targeting high-density, smaller Latino neighborhoods in markets such as South Florida, Washington Heights, New York and east Los Angeles with campaigns including posting bulletins in churches. It also does Google advertising but Arango says most of its growth thus far has been organic.
In the long run, Maza’s goal is to expand into credit building and to outside of the U.S. because as Arango said, “the whole world doesn’t have a Social Security number.”
Image Credits: Maza
“We want to be able to get folks cleared into the U.S. financial system no matter where they are,” added Arango, who also previously co-founded — and then sold — ScopeAI, which got acquired by ObserveAI in 2021.
“We’re doing much more than just providing a bank account — we’re really giving immigrants a stable and legal financial foundation from which to build credit and wealth indefinitely,” Figueroa said. 
Andreessen Horowitz Partner Seema Amble said Maza’s thesis is something that a16z has “been excited about for a long time.” 
Writing via email, she said: “There is a massive gap between mainstream financial access and the Latino population in the US (which is 19% of the U.S.). And the product needs don’t mean just translating existing products into Spanish – it’s offering them a set of products that fits their life and work.” 
Banking products are not accessible to most Latinos, Amble added, but not primarily because of a language barrier. 
She wrote: “They’re blocked from even accessing these products in the first place. Maza has identified the true pain point, lack of SSN, and they have built a product that unblocks everything from payments, to credit and mortgages without leaving the app….Compared to some of the other startups, Maza has focused on this core pain point and wants to continue to offer community-tailored products, rather than just offer another card product marketed towards Latinos.”

Workflow automation startup Parabola raises $24M,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/28,"
Parabola, a San Francisco-based startup that uses AI to help expedite back-office processes, particularly in the logistics and e-commerce sectors, today announced that it raised $24 million in a Series B funding round led by OpenView, with participation from strategic investor Flexport alongside Matrix, Thrive, Good Friends, Webflow, Otherwise Fund, Abstract Ventures and Merus Capital.
Alex Yaseen, Parabola’s founder and CEO, says the new capital will be put toward hiring and product R&D. To date, the company’s raised $34.2 million — inclusive of the latest tranche.
“Most software companies struggled in the pandemic shift, but we’ve found success,” Yaseen said. “2023 is the year of the operator, and Parabola is the go-to platform to empower them.”
So what does Parabola do, exactly? Boiled down to basics, the platform applies AI to automate various workflows. Using Parabola, customers can take documents like PDFs, text message logs, images and emails and have Parabola standardize, enrich or categorize them.
For example, given a list of product names, Parabola can categorize them according to specific departments, such as “clothing,” “home goods,” “grocery” and “electronics.” It also can standardize inconsistently formatted invoices and extract the amount, due date, sender information and line items from each into a table. And it can analyze Amazon keyword rankings within a specific time frame, enabling e-commerce teams to optimize their product listings.
Yaseen describes Parabola as a “collaborative data tool” for nontechnical users who’d otherwise be stuck with arduous manual processes and spreadsheets.
“Our core differentiator is our ability to be owned directly by an operations team to build solutions to their own problems without getting bottlenecked on data and IT.” Yaseen said. “This enables them to automate workflows that otherwise are too fast-changing for engineers to write code on their behalf.”
Business process automation is a growing trend, with 66% of organizations responding to a recent McKinsey survey saying that they’ve experimented with process automation in one or more business functions. The motivation is cost savings, often. A UiPath survey estimates that businesses can save an average of $1.5 million per year by automating at least a portion of their processes.

Lots of vendors have emerged to meet the large addressable market, unsurprisingly, including so-called integration-platform-as-a-service providers like Zapier, Workato, Tray and MuleSoft, as well as internal-tool-building platforms like Retool and Airplane.dev. Retool has done particularly well for itself lately, raising $45 million at a $3.2 billion valuation last July.
Yaseen makes the case that Parabola’s rivals, though — even the well-funded ones — focus less on building logic and more on transferring data between different systems, plus require extensive technical resources to boot.
“Many users choose to stick with their outdated and mundane processes because it’s what they’re familiar with, and they believe that their complex datasets cannot be automated,” he added. “[But] enterprise leaders can no longer exhaust valuable engineering resources on projects that can be achieved otherwise … We’ve built a suite of collaboration features that turn the ‘individual use-case’ into a ‘company use-case,’ allowing operations teams to  align on best practices and ultimately build off one another’s work.”
Parabola claims to have clients in a “wide range of industries,” including e-commerce, retail, consumer packaged goods and shipping and logistics. The 30-employee startup’s current customer base stands at just over 500 brands, and Yaseen says the plan is to expand Parabola’s headcount to 60 people by the end of the year.

Memphis.dev looks to simplify event streaming with open source and SaaS products,Ron Miller,2023/06/28,"
Startups have been looking for ways to disrupt event streaming, popularized in the last decade by Kafka, the open source event streaming platform. Just this week we looked at Redpanda getting a $100 million Series C for its event streaming platform, and today Memphis.dev, an earlier-stage startup, announced a $5.5 million seed investment to support its open source project and SaaS offering called Memphis Cloud, which they are making generally available starting today.
Memphis co-founder and CEO Yaniv Ben Hemo says that the company was founded on the idea that streaming was too complicated, and they wanted to simplify it. He said they came from organizations dealing with massive amounts of data, where they struggled to get insights from it.
“The component that was usually the most challenging one was getting Kafka to absorb the massive amount of data that we ingested, and also what we call the Day 2 operations, which are all about how to take the raw data that we ingested and make it into something that the organization can do something with to create insights from it,” Ben Hemo told TechCrunch.
The company wanted to build a solution that helped solved these kinds of problems for developers building real-time streaming applications, and they built and open sourced this new message broker they called Memphis. He said they wanted to attack two key problems that they saw with streaming large amounts of data and building applications making use of that data.
“So the first part would be the management over the scalability, the maintenance that it requires, the amount of time that it takes and complexity to really implement such a technology or a solution within the organization.” The second part involved how to build applications that really take advantage of the data the engine was processing.
The founders started by building the open source project, and eventually building Memphis Cloud, which is geared toward enterprises with typical features like authentication and permissions, but they are also making it a serverless experience, making it easier to implement without worrying about the underlying resources required to run any particular application, while paying only for what you use. The company has also designed it to work on multiple platforms, including AWS and Google Cloud Platform for starters.
“We try to create as much alignment as we can between the commercial version and Memphis. But the commercial version is definitely more for enterprises, organizations that require serverless experience, and don’t want anything to do with infrastructure and scale and monitoring and stuff like that. So it really made sense for the community, as well as some other features that we simply were not able to deploy through the open source version, technically,” Ben Hemo said.
The company currently has 14 employees with two open recs, and as currently constituted has a pretty diverse group. He says he hopes to continue that along multiple dimensions of diversity, including geographical, as he builds the organization.
Today’s seed investment was led by Angular Ventures and Boldstart Ventures along with several prominent industry angels.

Unaric exits stealth with $35M to buy and consolidate Salesforce-ecosystem startups,Paul Sawers,2023/06/28,"
A new company is emerging out of stealth today with $35 million in funding and a plan to acquire and consolidate startups within the Salesforce ecosystem.
Unaric, as the company is called, has secured $25 million in debt and $10 million in equity from various VCs, angels and growth lenders, as it looks to bring together independent Salesforce-focused SaaS companies help them capture a larger chunk of the gargantuan market that has cropped up around Salesforce these past couple of decades.
Some companies have built megabucks businesses on top of Salesforce, including Salesforce-native DevOps platform Copado; Salesforce data backup platform OwnBackup; and lead-generation platform Qualified. Thousands of smaller companies have cropped up off the back of Salesforce’s rise to the giddy heights of a $200 billion enterprise behemoth, creating an ecosystem that some estimates peg at four times that of Salesforce itself.
However, relatively few companies within that Salesforce ecosystem become massive in their own right, due in part to their narrowly-focused “point solutions” that mean end-users have to combine multiple different tools from various smaller vendors — something that larger enterprises are often reluctant to do. And this is where Unaric enters the fray.
“For enterprise customers it can be painful to purchase and manage small niche solutions,” Unaric co-founder and CEO James Gasteen explained to TechCrunch. “Unaric addresses this by building larger suites, which solve large problems for customers through a single vendor who can provide greater innovation, better service and global support.”
‘By founders, for founders’
Founded out of London in July last year, Unaric is aiming to buy up to 40 companies over the next three years, the first of which it’s announcing today with the acquisition of Salesbolt, a product that automatically keeps CRM contacts up-to-date. Over time, Unaric says that it intends to increase the opportunity for cross-selling and knowledge-sharing across all Salesforce products under its wing, as well as introduce a “shared central infrastructure” including a product and engineering hub.
The Salesbolt deal pegs Unaric’s initial focus firmly in the RevOps realm, an area Gasteen says it will double-down on.
“By acquiring multiple companies in this area we will be able to drive cross-sales,” he said. “This is an area where we already have a pipeline of deals lined up. The next stage is to use our knowledge of industries and existing customers’ needs to build out suites of companies focused on particular industry sectors.”
Unari is the handiwork of Gasteen and chief product officer Neil Crawford, each having previously founded Salesforce-ecosystem companies, and chair Peter Lindholm and CFO Moritz Birke. Gasteen, in fact, already has experience of merging two Salesforce-focused companies, when his previous startup Precursive acquired a “complementary” product called Taskfeed back in 2019.
“There is a mismatch in the Salesforce ISV (independent software vendor) ecosystem which we have experienced personally, and we know how to put it right,” Gasteen said. “We believe that by building suites of products that match more closely the needs of enterprises, we can help companies to significantly increase their sales, scale their businesses and sell to corporate buyers who would not normally buy from individual vendors.”
Such a hefty acquisition spree will, of course, require a lot of capital, which is where Unaric’s external funding comes into play. The $25 million debt segment emanates from Atempo Growth, with the remaining seed equity tranche coming from LocalGlobe, Concentric, FJ Labs and angels such as OwnBackup founder Sam Gutmann, Hotjar founder Johan Malmberg and enterprise software startup investor Dave Kellogg.
Longer term, Gasteen says Unaric is looking to emulate the growth trajectory of a number of established enterprise software companies, such as Veeva Systems, a $32 billion life sciences software company; and Ncino, a $3 billion fintech. Both companies were initially built on top of Salesforce and embraced the cloud from the get-go, but more importantly they have focused their efforts on broad techstacks spanning a single sector.
“They have created a lot of value in the ecosystem through being focused on a single industry techstack,” Gasteen said. “They have built the companies mainly through product development and some M&A. Our idea is to emulate the success of these companies by building many Ncino’s and Veeva’s within Unaric.”

"Astrix Security, which uses ML to secure app integrations, raises $25M",Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/28,"
Astrix Security, a platform that helps companies manage and secure third-party app integrations, today announced that it closed a $25 million Series A funding round led by CRV with participation from Bessemer Venture Partners and F2 Venture Capital.
Co-founder and CEO Alon Jackson says that the round, which brings Astrix’s total raised to $40 million, will be put toward expanding headcount across the company’s offices in Tel Aviv and the U.S.
“The pandemic enforced cloud and software-as-a-service (SaaS) adoption, thus increasing third-party adoption and automation — requiring a solution to fit this digital and fast-paced interconnected world,” Jackson told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Astrix was founded to close a significant and unaddressed security gap by allowing security teams to extend access management and threat detection to the non-human identity layer.”
Jackson co-launched Astrix in 2021 alongside Idan Gour, who he met while serving in the Israel Defense Forces. Both say that they saw a need to create a platform that could help companies bring app integrations, which continue to gain in popularity, under firmer control from a security standpoint.
To their points, according to one recent report, company departments use between 40 and 60 different apps, with departments using an average of 200 apps organization-wide. This can amplify the security risk. Another poll, published in 2022 by the Ponemon Institute and Mastercard’s RiskRecon, found that 54% of organizations were breached through third parties over the preceding 12 months.
“Apps are often connected by employees across departments without the security team’s knowledge, making having visibility and governance into every third-party connection virtually impossible,” Jackson said.
Astrix connects to a company’s core systems — including SaaS, integration platform-as-a-service and infrastructure-as-a-service — to attempt to protect against over-privileged and malicious third-party app connections that might expose an organization. Using machine learning-based behavioral analysis engines, Astrix tries to spot deviations from standard app-to-app connectivity behaviors and suggest remediation steps that security teams can take to address the root of the problem.

Beyond detecting threats, Astrix provides a view of all the internal and third-party integrations within a business environment, as well as all access keys in use (e.g. API keys and service accounts) and the permissions and level of access granted to each one.
James Green, a general partner at CRV, said that it was these holistic observability features that caught CRV’s eye.
“Astrix is taking an innovative approach to extending identity and access management and threat detection to all non-human identities, giving unprecedented capabilities to manage the growing API-based third-party attack surface across all environments,” he said in an emailed statement.
Astrix isn’t without rivals in the app connection security space, including Apiiro, which works to help developers and security operators find and solve app-related issues that could result in vulnerabilities. There’s also Valence Security, Wing Security and Kodem, the last of which recently came out of stealth with $25 million in venture backing to tackle app security.
But Jackson, while declining to reveal the size of Astrix’s customer base, noted that Astrix recently brought on high-profile customers, including Figma, Priceline, Bloomreach and Rapyd.
“Cybersecurity is one of the few fields that is traditionally less impacted during down times,” Jackson said. “Moreover, layoffs and down markets create more cybercrime worldwide, and we’ve especially been experiencing this in the past year.”
That first point isn’t necessarily true — Q1 marked lowest VC funding for security in a decade, according to one report. But it seems that Astrix is successfully bucking the trend.

Fairphone CEO Eva Gouwens to step down,Paul Sawers,2023/06/28,"
Fairphone CEO Eva Gouwens has announced that she’s stepping down, some five years after landing in the hotseat.
Founded out of the Netherlands back in 2010, Fairphone has set out to differentiate from other smartphone makers by focusing on sustainability and lowering its environmental footprint — this includes making its devices modular and thus easier to replace parts and minimizing its use of conflict minerals. The company has also expanded into tangential products, including headphones and accessories, and has raised around $94 million in funding, including a $53 million tranche just six months ago.
Stepping down
Gouwens joined Fairphone first as managing director in 2017, before replacing the company’s founder Bas van Abel the following year as CEO.
Quoting former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, Gouwens indicated that her reason for stepping down was simply to her running out of steam: “I know what this job takes, and I know I no longer have enough in the tank to do it justice. It’s as simple as that.”
At the time of writing, it appears that Fairphone has not yet found a successor, with today’s announcement signaling the start of a search process to find the company’s next CEO.
“Now I know it is the right time for me to find someone like-minded yet fresh to take my place,” Gouwens said. “Someone who understands Fairphone’s mission and vision. Someone who can help Fairphone scale even greater heights.”

Dear Sophie, 
Our startup employs about 30 people globally through a combination of direct and co-employment based on their country. 
Over the last year and a half or so, we helped several team members relocate from Ukraine and Russia to various non-Schengen countries such as Georgia, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and Uzbekistan. 
We realize it’s more expensive if we bring these employees to the U.S., but our startup will be more successful. How do we bring them here?
— Meaningful Moneymaking
Dear Meaningful Moneymaking,
Many companies have helped make a meaningful difference in people’s lives, supporting talented team members and their families from countries such as Ukraine and Russia to relocate to safety. Thank you for now considering how to help certain individuals relocate to the U.S. May all humans enjoy peace, prosperity, and freedom.
Many employers are continuing to work with the Ukrainian and Russian professionals who have left their homes since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.
Of the 8 million people who have left Ukraine, more than 270,000 have been admitted to the United States, most of them under the Uniting for Ukraine program, which provides a temporary stay in the United States and a work permit.
Between 500,000 and as many as 1 million people have left Russia and thousands of Russians have sought entry to the U.S. between February 2022 and April 2023. According to Russian government figures, about 100,000 IT specialists (about 10% of the tech workforce) left Russia, which is likely underestimated.
Before I dive into options for bringing Ukrainian and Russian employees to the United States, I recommend you work with an immigration attorney to devise a strategy for each employee you’re seeking to sponsor based on their education, skills, qualifications, location, and situation. Your company has several options for bringing your Ukrainian and Russian employees to live and work in the United States.
Uniting for Ukraine
The Uniting for Ukraine program, which began last year, provides a way for Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members to come to the United States to stay for two years under temporary parole status. Individuals participating in the program must have a U.S.-based supporter or multiple supporters — an individual, organization, or business — who agrees to financially support their stay.
The supporter must fill out Form I-134A (Online Request to be a Supporter and Declaration of Financial Support) and submit it to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The program includes the option for a Employment Authorization Document (EAD) — otherwise known as a work permit.
Right now, parole under the Uniting for Ukraine program cannot be extended beyond two years, but that may change. Your company could consider sponsoring employees on parole for work visas or green cards. I explain in more detail below. "
Bluu Seafood reels in $17.5M to bring cultivated fish products to market,Paul Sawers,2023/06/28,"
Bluu Seafood, a German company creating cultivated (i.e. “lab-grown”) fish products, today announced it has raised €16 million ($17.5 million) in a Series A round of funding.
Founded out of Berlin in 2020 originally as Bluu Biosciences, Bluu Seafood starts with a “one-time” fish biopsy — which, it says, doesn’t require killing any fish — and then uses stem-cell technology to grow entire cell lines (i.e. fish species) inside a lab.
The company unveiled its first products last August, including a line of fish sticks (or “fish fingers”) and fish balls. These are made from cultivated fish cells that are enriched with plant proteins, a process it says helps make their mouth-feel and cooking process more realistic.

Production problems
Bluu Seafood is one of numerous biotech startups that are setting out to address the world’s seafood production problems, which includes overfishing, contamination and cruelty. But the movement is not limited to marine animals, with countless companies raising bucketloads of VC cash to reproduce everything from bacon to burgers and chicken and beyond.
Bluu Seafood, for its part, had raised €7.1 million in funding so far, and with another €16 million in the bank it’s now gearing up to attain regulatory approval in various markets, including Singapore, which is currently the only market in the world where cultured meat (chicken) is available to buy. However, the Food and Drug Association (FDA) also started rubberstamping such edibles as being safe for human consumption, and just this week it approved two companies to begin selling their lab-grown chicken products — so we can expect some commercial activity in the U.S. in the very near future.
First up, Bluu Seafood is aiming to enter Singapore, where it says it expects to receive approval sometime in 2024, while it says it has also kickstarted the approval process with the FDA, and will then set about targeting the European market.
Bluu Seafood’s Series A round was led by Sonae-subsidiary Sparkfood and LBBW VC, with participation from Delivery Hero, SeaX Ventures, Manta Ray Ventures, Norrsken VC, Hamburgische Investitions- und Förderbank and Dr. Oetker.

Flowie wants to make invoices flow freely,Romain Dillet,2023/06/27,"
Meet Flowie, a new French startup that wants to facilitate money movements between companies. The company centralizes everything related to accounts receivable and accounts payable so that everyone in the company can see relevant information when it comes to getting paid by clients and receiving money from suppliers.
Flowie was started by Yann Ravel-Sibillot, Rémi Legorrec and Aurélie Hadida. In particular, the company’s CEO — Yann Ravel-Sibillot — already has plenty of experiences when it comes to managing invoices at scale. He was the CTO of Big Mamma and worked on Sunday, a fast restaurant checkout flow.
With this new startup, the Flowie team wants to improve how companies handle invoices. Flowie acts as a central repository for all your transactional data.
It connects with all your existing tools, such as the ERP system that holds your contracts, order numbers, receipt slips, etc. Flowie also integrates with your CRM so that you can get some context about the relationship with a client or a supplier. Finally, it also connects with your bank account so that it can see if you received a payment and initiate new payments.
For instance, when you receive an invoice from a supplier, usually the person in charge of accounting doesn’t really know if they’re supposed to pay this supplier. Maybe your company never received what you paid for.
Instead of having an internal conversation and creating friction, anybody can validate transactions on Flowie. The platform automatically tries to fetch information from the invoice, and people in the company can add files to provide context.
When a transaction is approved, you can either choose to pay it now or pay it at some point in the future. If you schedule a future payment, you can notify your supplier that the payment has been scheduled and there’s no need to get back to you about that pending invoice.
On the other side of the equation, when it comes to accounts receivables, companies can upload an invoice on Flowie. It is converted into an e-invoice with a QR code. Clients can click on a link and see different payment methods. They can pay with a bank transfer, a card payment or a direct debit. Flowie also lets you offer early payment discounts.
It’s still early days for the startup. The company has raised a bit of money from business angels and there are 11 people working on the product. But the company has already tracked hundreds of millions of euros in invoices on its platform.

Reka emerges from stealth to build custom AI models for the enterprise,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/27,"
Large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT-4 are all the rage these days, owing to their unparalleled ability to analyze and generate text. But for organizations looking to leverage LLMs for specific tasks — say, writing ad copy in a brand’s style — their generalist nature can become a liability.
When the instructions get too precise, even the best LLMs struggle with consistency. Fine-tuning, or narrowing an LLM’s scope, is one solution. But it’s often challenging from a technical standpoint, not to mention costly.
Motivated to find an easier way, a team of researchers from DeepMind, Google, Baidu and Meta founded Reka, which emerged from stealth today with $58 million. DST Global Partners and Radical Ventures led the tranche with participation from strategic partner Snowflake Ventures, alongside a cohort of angel investors that included former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman.
San Francisco–based Reka is the brainchild of Dani Yogatama, Cyprien de Masson d’Autume, Qi Liu Head and Yi Tay. While working on AI systems, including DeepMind’s AlphaCode and Bard, the four co-founders say that they realized it was impractical to expect a large LLM to be deployed for all possible use cases.
“We understand the transformative power of AI and would like to bring the benefits of this technology to the world in a responsible way,” Yogatama told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Reka is a research and product company that develops models to benefit humanity, organizations and enterprises.”
Reka’s first commercial product, Yasa, doesn’t quite meet those lofty ambitions. But it exemplifies the startup’s early approach. Going beyond text, Yasa is a multimodal AI “assistant” trained to understand images, videos and tabular data in addition to words and phrases. It can be used to generate ideas and answer basic questions, Yogatama says, as well as derive insights from a company’s internal data.
In this way, Yasa, which is in closed beta, isn’t dissimilar to models like GPT-4, which can also understand text and images. But the twist is that Yasa can be easily personalized to proprietary data and applications.
“Our technology allows enterprises to benefit from progress in LLMs in a way that satisfies their deployment constraints without requiring a team of in-house expert AI engineers,” Yogatama said.
Yasa is just the start. Next, Reka plans to turn its attention to AI that can accept and generate even more types of data and continuously self-improve, staying up to date without the need for retraining.
To that end, only available to select customers for now, Reka also provides a service to adapt LLMs it developed to custom or proprietary company datasets. Customers can run the “distilled” models on their own infrastructure or via Reka’s API, depending on the application and project constraints.
Reka, it should be noted, isn’t the only startup chasing after models better suited for enterprise use cases. Writer lets customers fine-tune LLMs on their own content and style guides. Contextual AI and LlamaIndex, which recently emerged from stealth, are developing tools to allow companies to add their own data to existing LLMs. And Cohere trains LLMs to customers’ specifications.
Not to be outdone, incumbents like OpenAI now offer tools for fine-tuning models and connecting them to the internet and other sources to ensure that they remain up to date.
But Reka’s sales pitch won over one early customer (and investor), Snowflake, which partnered with the startup to let Snowflake customers deploy Yasa from their accounts. Appen, the big data analytics company, also recently announced that it’s working with Reka to build tailored multimodal model–powered apps for the enterprise.
Rob Toews, a partner at Radical Ventures, had this to say when we asked why he invested in Reka:
What makes Reka unique is how it offers every business the power and potential of an LLM without having to put up with many tradeoffs. Reka’s distilled Yasa models keep the data within the enterprise, they’re incredibly efficient in terms of cost and energy and they don’t require costly research teams building models from scratch. If every business will become an “AI” business, Reka’s ambition is to give each of those businesses its own, production-quality foundation model.
Yogatama says Reka, which currently isn’t generating revenue, will use its funding to date to acquire computing power from Nvidia and build a business team.

Building a durable growth funnel doesn’t just scale your business: it also signals to investors that a team can move directionally, which is a major confidence builder.
“Acquisition, activation and retention are critical,” writes Jonathan Martinez, TC+’s in-house growth expert. “While referral and monetization are also quite important, they won’t make or break a startup.”
He says early-stage teams should push well beyond “vanity metrics” like click-throughs and conversions to develop advanced metrics that are specific to the business they’re building.

It’s complex work, but don’t be intimidated — a growth analyst or data scientist contractor can easily set up the dashboards you’ll need to run experiments, set goals and track day-to-day progress.
“This isn’t meant to be a teardown of each specific startup, but rather a holistic look into what leading companies are doing, their mindsets when it comes to growth and how to replicate these actions in your own startup,” says Martinez.

Crypto maximalists are comfortable making big bets, but ambiguous oversight by U.S. financial agencies is holding back corporate adoption, according to a study conducted by The Block and Coinbase.
“Around 91% of surveyed executives agree that lack of clear regulation on crypto, blockchain or web3 make the space hard to navigate,” reports Jacquelyn Melinek, who interviewed Kara Calvert, head of U.S. policy at Coinbase, and Faryar Shirzad, its chief policy officer.
“It doesn’t matter where lines are drawn, we’ll build to those lines,” said Shirzad. “But we can’t deal with a lack of clarity; the uncertainty is not healthy.”

"As Lordstown immolates, SPAC deals that didn’t go to zero feel like the exception",Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/27,"
In 2020 and 2021, we had several months when enthusiasm for new EV manufacturers was crossed with the resurgence of blank-check companies. Also called special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, these listed shell companies promised quick access to capital and a path to the public markets, and a wide array of tech and tech-ish companies took them up on the offer.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

In 2020 and 2021, several electric vehicle companies took the SPAC route to raise quick cash and go public, especially because investors were pretty OK with investing in such experimental transactions. Full of enthusiasm, these companies’ investor presentations showed a clear path to production and stellar profits.
It’s obvious in retrospect, but the results often proved to be messy.
U.S.-based EV company Lordstown Motors is one such example. Today, the company filed for bankruptcy protection and sued its former partner Foxconn at the same time. As TechCrunch reported earlier this morning:
Lordstown Motors has made good on its threat to sue Foxconn, the Taiwanese company best known for manufacturing Apple’s iPhones. The EV company took legal action against Foxconn Tuesday, and simultaneously filed for bankruptcy and put itself up for sale. […]
In its complaint, Lordstown says Foxconn misled the EV maker about collaborating on vehicle development plans and was “not the partner that it promised to be.” The complaint accuses Foxconn of pretending to support the Endurance pickup truck and future joint product development in order to secure ownership over Lordstown’s most valuable asset, the Ohio manufacturing plant, and to poach some of Lordstown’s skilled manufacturing and operational employees.
It would be easy to dismiss Lordstown’s failure as the result of a dispute between the two companies. But that would be wrong. In reality, the Lordstown saga is a blend of pure SPAC nasty. Let’s take into account a few pertinent facts to form our opinions.

Khosla Ventures just doubled down on this handyman-on-demand service for homeowners,Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/06/27,"
If you own a home, you know that there is always something that needs to be repaired, installed or generally addressed. Whether it’s a leaky faucet, a new bed that needs to be assembled or a Nest thermostat that needs to be installed, there is always something.
One startup wants to make that particular part of home ownership less painful by offering up a dedicated handyman to be there to take care of all the random tasks on your to-do list. It’s an interesting model. Honey Homes hires the handyman as part of its staff, as a salaried employee to help ensure consistency in who’s taking care of the work in your home. Homeowners pay Honey Homes a flat fee ($200 per month or $2,000 per year) for the convenience of a membership-based “end-to-end” service using its app.
The way it works is that members are matched with a dedicated handyperson who comes by at least once a month to take care of home improvements and preventative maintenance. Because the employees are salaried, they also receive benefits, including parental leave and paid time off, a rarity in an industry that has historically relied on contractors.
Honey Homes launched the company with its first 10 beta customers in August of 2021 and is currently available to single-family homeowners in all of the San Francisco Bay Area suburbs, although not San Francisco proper. It recently began operations in Dallas.
Husband and wife team Vishwas Prabhakara (Yelp’s first general manager) and Avantika Prabhakara (a former marketing head at Opendoor, Trulia and Zillow) teamed up with Katie Pham and Rory O’Connell to start Honey Homes in 2021.
In the last two years, Honey Homes has grown to more than 500 members and has completed over 20,000 tasks for homeowners, according to Vishwas. The company grew members — and thus revenue — by 8x in 2022, he added, and almost doubled already this year.
Since inception, the company has raised a total of $12.1 million in funding, including more recently $9 million in a Series A led by Khosla Ventures. Khosla and Pear VC co-led Honey Homes’ seed round in 2021. Other backers include Teambuilder Ventures and Moving Capital, along with angel investors such as DoorDash co-founders Tony Xu and Stanley Tang, Lyft co-founder Logan Green, Opendoor co-founder Eric Wu and Mercury co-founder Immad Akhund, among others. 
Vishwas told TechCrunch he began working on the company in earnest after talking to a number of homeowners and concluding that there would be enough people interested in paying for a generalist to come to their house once or twice a month for ongoing maintenance or improvement work. 
“I asked them, ‘would that be interesting to you? Would you pay for that?’ And surprisingly to me, the answer was a resounding yes,” he said. “We seemed to hit a nerve with homeowners.”
The Honey Homes app lets a homeowner create a to-do list and schedule appointments. It also helps pair homeowners with specialists if needed.
But what if, I was curious, you cross all the tasks off your to-do list? What then?
“The one thing that has been really eye-opening is that by offering this as a membership service, all of a sudden you realize you want more,” Vishwas said.”And there are some people who just like the peace of mind.”
Honey Homes employs 45 people, including 25 handy people. Vishwas said the consistency of workers has helped boost its credibility.
“From a homeowner perspective, what you want is somebody you can build a relationship with and trust,” he told TechCrunch. “And so seeing the same person over and over is highly valuable to a homeowner.”
The startup has also launched something called Honey Homes University, or a training facility for people who work in the field so they can build their skills. Looking ahead, Honey Homes eventually plans to expand into urban centers but for now is focused on serving suburban single family homeowners, which Vishwas says tend to have a wider set of upkeep and maintenance needs. 
Khosla Partner Evan Moore, who joined the Honey Homes board as part of the Series A funding round and also is a co-founder of DoorDash, said that while he was VP of product at Opendoor he saw that the company “could get dramatically better service, quality and pricing from home service providers.”
But as an individual homeowner, “it’s hard to reliably get good work done at a reasonable cost.”
Moore wrote via email: “Many startups have attempted to improve this customer experience and failed, but it seems Honey Homes got it right. Rarely does an idea work so well so quickly. I’ve been involved since day one and have been fortunate to see the incredible response from customers.”
He believes that Honey Homes differs from many other consumer startups in the home services space that simply match homeowners with potential vendors or “serve as a concierge.”
Added Moore: “Honey Homes solves the whole problem of home improvement and maintenance, from idea to completion. By doing quality work repeatedly, we build trust with our customers. They then reward us with more work over time.”

"Gusto reaches $500M in trailing revenue, teams up with Remote to support international hires",Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/27,"
Gusto, best known for its American payroll management software and services, is playing in the big leagues.
TechCrunch+ has exclusively learned that Gusto has surpassed a significant revenue milestone: In its most recent fiscal year (the 12 months ended April 30, 2023), it generated revenue of more than $500 million, the company said.
The company also has a key profitability benchmark within reach, anticipating reaching free cash flow positivity in the next few quarters, where it expects to stay thereafter.
Gusto has so far held details regarding its financial performance close to its chest, so these numbers are illuminating. In 2021, the company admitted to recording revenue in the nine figures, but these new details place Gusto among the largest private-market tech companies in terms of scale.
We could better nail down Gusto’s place in the private technology company hierarchy if we had, say, a fourth-quarter revenue figure that we could annualize. But given what we have, Gusto certainly ended its last fiscal year on a greater run rate than $500 million, meaning that it is far and away large enough to go public in its current form.
Gusto declined to share information relating to its recent growth rate, but CEO Josh Reeves told TechCrunch in 2021 that his company was growing around 50% per year.
Reaching cash flow positivity is notable for Gusto in today’s business climate, which has many tech startups and unicorns working to conserve cash. Ending cash burn is not a simple process. “At-scale companies should have a path to be able to fund themselves,” Reeves told TechCrunch+, adding that his company has “been on a path” to cash flow positivity for the past four or five years.
Understandably, Gusto has no plans to raise more outside capital. That said, we don’t expect it to pursue a direct listing when it does go public.

When the tech IPO market reopens, keep an eye on HR unicorns

Partner power
How did Gusto breach the half-billion-dollar revenue milestone? By pursuing a multipart model. Back in mid-2021, the company launched an embedded payroll feature, which allowed other companies to offer its payroll services to their customers inside their app or service.
The work has paid off: The company told TechCrunch this week that since its launch, its embedded payroll service has grown to a partner base of 27. Those partners, in turn, support more than a half-million businesses. Gusto also said that it has agreements with a few “Fortune 250” companies but declined to share their names.
Gusto’s efforts to offer its payroll services to other companies via an API was foreshadowing, to a degree. Reeves indicated at the time of the launch that more of Gusto’s platform would become available via an API over time. That was made possible by the company’s work to use internal APIs to power its own software.
And this prior API-related work stands to pay dividends, given that Gusto announced this morning that it is teaming up with Remote to support international hires.
Remote + Gusto
In the United States, Gusto is best known for its HR tech business, including payroll and benefits management. Remote, in contrast, helps companies hire and support full-time staff around the world.
Gusto powers its American customers’ domestic payroll and supports international contractors, while Remote allows companies to hire internationally, handling the necessary work to do so in a compliant manner.
According to Reeves, demand for Gusto to support full-time international workers was clear — in a more remote-friendly world, this is not a massive shock — which makes the Remote partnership feel contentedly logical. Gusto confirmed that the deal is a revenue-share arrangement.
But why not build instead of partnering with another company? Reeves framed his company’s choice by reaching back in time, explaining that Gusto launched only with support for California before going on to support all U.S. states over the next three years. It chose to leave revenue on the table by being methodical.
He said that Remote has taken a similar approach to international markets, “expanding country by country” by building the “right infrastructure” to do so.
That shared perspective regarding careful compliance and the chance at a quick time to market made the Remote partnership a “no-brainer,” Reeves said. The two companies also share a backer in General Catalyst.
For Remote, the deal took a while to close but left both parties quite happy, its CEO Job van der Voort told TechCrunch+.
Van der Voort said that a few years ago, his company decided to offer its services through APIs, mirroring what we heard from Gusto back in 2021. The result is that Gusto customers will be able to add international talent via Remote inside of the Gusto app. There will be a button, van der Voort explained, which sounds simple enough.
To begin with, Gusto customers can start hiring via Remote in Canada, and more markets will be added shortly thereafter. Van der Voort said he wants to bring his company to as many markets as possible in time, past the 75 or so it currently supports. So, Gusto customers could have the ability to hire nearly anywhere globally when that happens. For both unicorns, that shared capability could unlock a new bloc of growth.
Before we get into the competitive considerations at play in the deal, we should note that both companies were not bowled over when we recommended that they just get it over with and do a merger.
Is Gusto’s $500 million number big?
According to PitchBook data, Gusto’s most recent private valuation was around $9.6 billion, just shy of the decacorn mark. Remote is worth a flat $3 billion, according to Crunchbase. The two companies therefore represent a massive amount of private-market wealth held by dozens of investors. If this deal goes well and allows each to do more total business, it could make a lot of pockets fatter. "
4 VCs illustrate why there’s good reason to be optimistic about the machine learning startup market,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/27,"
When you talk about investments in artificial intelligence startups versus machine learning startups, it’s important to distinguish “AI” from “machine learning.” Those phrases are often used interchangeably, but they carry a slightly different meaning.
Machine learning, or ML, is a method of training AI models so that they can learn to make decisions. Put another way, ML involves training models to solve specific tasks by learning from data and making predictions. AI, on the other hand, is the broader concept for systems that mimic human cognition.
So ML is a subfield of AI but not the same thing.
Lonne Jaffe, managing director at Insight Partners, explains that Insight uses a “three-layer” framework to unpack the definition of an ML startup.

We’re widening our lens, looking for more investors to participate in TechCrunch+ surveys, where we poll top professionals about challenges in their industry.
If you’re an investor and would like to participate in future surveys, fill out this form.

At the first layer, he says, are core infrastructure companies — products with which a person builds an ML system. At the second layer are apps that seek to tackle a particular use case or workflow using ML. The third layer, meanwhile, comprises ML startups that manifest within an industry as an “actual player” in that industry — think startups that become a startup bank, even if the core of the startup is still ML talent.
According to this framework, examples of ML startups range from Weights & Biases, which provides tools to create and monitor AI models, to Iterative Health, a healthcare company that leverages an ML system designed to identify cancerous polyps from a colonoscopy.
The market for ML is quite large, with a report from Grand View Research estimating that it was worth $49.6 billion in 2022 and could grow at a CAGR of 33.5% by 2030. And it’s been building for some time: A 2021 survey by Dresner Advisory Services found that 59% of all large enterprises are deploying ML, with 50% of those organizations claiming to have 25 or more ML models in use today.
Why is this area growing so fast? 451 Research, the tech R&D group within S&P, posited in a recent report that the initial wave of ML adoption focused on making legacy systems and processes smarter — like business intelligence, customer support, sales and marketing and security. But now, as those applications mature, the attention has shifted to more niche, industry-specific and lucrative ML applications, particularly in finance, retail, manufacturing and healthcare.
Jerry Chen, a partner at Greylock, believes we’re just starting to see what the next generation of ML companies will be. “The cycle is going strong,” he told TechCrunch+. “I’m curious to see how incumbent companies and tech players enter, compete or partner with the startups. In particular, I think we will see some interesting go-to-market partnerships in the next few months.”
But what about the broader VC ecosystem? Are VCs in general optimistic about the future of ML?
To get a better sense, TechCrunch+ surveyed investors including Chen and Jaffe about the state of ML investing today. We touched on the health of the ML funding landscape, and whether the hype around ML, which several years ago was quite strong, is beginning to die down. We also asked investors what challenges stand in the way of ML tech adoption and what the next few months might look like in terms of market growth.
We spoke with:

How strong is the ML venture fundraising market today and how has it evolved thus far in 2023?
The release of ChatGPT five months ago sparked the fire of startup innovation around ML, along with a renewed fundraising dynamic. We’ve gone from systems of prediction — like classification or recommendation systems — to systems of creation. While funding has been flowing into generative ML systems, there has also been a lot of progress in more “traditional,” discriminative ML systems, like prediction or classification systems.
We’ve been particularly active recently in applied computer vision ML systems in healthcare, some of which may soon match or even exceed human physician performance across certain domains. For example, dental startup Overjet uses AI to analyze dental X-rays to help dentists decide if a tooth needs a filling or a crown, improving patient outcomes. "
Prosus slashes edtech giant Byju’s valuation to $5.1 billion,Manish Singh,2023/06/27,"
Prosus, the largest non-founder shareholder in Byju’s, has drastically slashed the worth of its stake in the edtech giant, implying a starkly diminished valuation of $5.1 billion to the Indian startup.
Prosus disclosed on Tuesday that it had downsized the value of its 9.6% stake in Byju’s to around $493 million in the financial year ending in March. This figure stands in stark contrast to the $6 billion at which Prosus had valued Byju’s as recently as November of the previous year. More concerningly, that’s a staggering drop from the $22 billion valuation at which Byju’s has raised multiple tranches of funding in the past 18 months.
The markdown comes at a time when the most Indian valuable startup is grappling with a number of challenges — a legal battle with lenders, resignation of board members and departure of global auditing firm Deloitte.
Prosus, Peak XV Partners and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative confirmed late last week that their representatives had resigned from the board of Byju’s. The board members’ resignations came shortly after Deloitte told the startup’s board that it was also resigning from its role.
Deloitte, which was slated to work with Byju’s until 2025, said that the edtech giant had failed to hand over financial results for the year ended March 2022.
In its Tuesday annual report, Prosus said it had lost “significant influence” in Byju’s during the current year “due to the loss of board representation.”
Prosus is not only one of the largest shareholders of Byju’s, it’s also one of the earliest. The investment giant has never sold its stake in the Indian startup, which has raised over $6 billion to date. It’s also not the only Byju’s shareholder to write down the worth of their startup stake.
Byju Raveendran, the co-founder and chief executive of Byju’s, has been working on securing a substantial large funding round to calm his existing investors.
TechCrunch reported last month that Byju’s was in talks with sovereign wealth funds and other investors, aiming to raise up to $950 million.
In a shareholder call last week, the chief financial officer of Byju’s pledged to have the auditing for the financial year ending March 2022 conclude by September this year, and for the financial year ending March 2023 by December, said a person briefed on the minutes of the call.
Raveendran also assured shareholders that he had intended a smoother transition for board members and acknowledged the abrupt departure of Deloitte.
He attempted to assuage the concerns by stating that he was all-in committed to Byju’s, having injected hundreds of millions of dollars of personal funds, taken as loans, into the company.
“Byju’s is not my work; it is my life,” he stated, according to the person briefed.

BentoML scores $9M funding to expedite AI app development,Rita Liao,2023/06/26,"
The success of large language models like GPT has sparked a frenzy of developers eager to make AI-powered applications. But building AI services can be tricky, especially due to the shortage of skilled developers to meet the rising demand these days.
That’s where Chaoyu Yang, an early software engineer at the data mega-unicorn Databricks, comes in. Along with his co-founders, he’s built the AI development framework BentoML, which just announced a seed financing round.
Yang, in an interview with TechCrunch, explained that today’s AI services are often built on multiple machine learning models, making their management and operation complicated. Many programmers entering the fray are coming from a full-stack or application development background, meaning they often lack the skills to build the required AI infrastructure, resulting in a prolonged development process.
A demo AI app like Microsoft’s Visual ChatGPT, an upgrade to the chatbot that allows it to produce responses from both text and image prompts, for example, can take at least three to six months to make it production-ready, Yang said.
While tech behemoths like Microsoft enjoy the financial prowess and human capital to train AI models and put them to use in the real world, smaller businesses, in Yang’s words, are collecting “valuable data that can benefit tremendously from AI” but “lack the resources to build the infrastructure for development.”
BentoML, which provides a high-level API that abstracts away the details of the infrastructure needed for running AI models on the cloud, belongs to a camp of tools like SageMaker that wants to smooth the path for developing AI services. It’s a so-called AI application framework, a set of tools that make it easier to build, ship and scale AI applications, like a construction tool kit one uses to build a house.
Specifically, BentoML is targeting data scientists who train AI models, DevOp engineers who manage their lifecycle and developers who actually build applications on top of the models.
With BentoML, developers can make Visual ChatGPT scalable and cost-efficient for production use in as short as two days, said Yang. Users have also used the framework to run the art generator Stable Diffusion and open source LLMs on the cloud.
Yang compared his company to Vercel, which focuses on serving front-end developers and was last valued at over $1 billion. BentoML aims to be the Vercel for AI, he said.
While Yang predicted that AI would eventually become more production-ready, he admitted he didn’t think the AI application wave would arrive so soon. The founder expects AI app developers to account for over 90% of the platform’s users in the future.
“If you ask me a year ago, I’d say that probably 90% of the companies would be training their own models, but the foundation models that have recently emerged are so powerful that they can perform well even given a dataset it has never seen before,” he said.
“Rather than focusing on model training, developers now only need to work on finetuning and product engineering, which in themselves present a bottleneck because of the shortage of AI-focused developers.”
BentoML was open sourced in 2019 and later introduced a self-hosted SaaS version to enterprise customers. It’s been acquiring users organically through its open source community, which quadrupled its membership to more than 3,000 over the past year, with Japanese messaging giant Line and South Korean internet conglomerate Naver being among its early adopters.
Yang declined to disclose the company’s revenue size.
Investors are taking note of BentoML’s traction in the developer community. The startup recently raised $9 million from its seed financing round led by DCM Ventures, with Bow Capital also participating. DCM’s general partner, Hurst Lin, has joined BentoML’s board following the round.
The exuberant AI market has been a boon to BentoML, but the rapidly changing industry also makes it tricky for the team to juggle short- and long-term goals, Yang admitted.
“You might have to build things that ride the current trend, but in the long term, we of course want to have our own moat. The question is how we balance our time and human resources between the two.”
Update (June 28, 2023): The article previously stated that Line was a South Korean company. Line is headquartered in Japan and is a subsidiary of Z Holdings, a joint venture between Japan’s SoftBank and South Korea’s Naver.

French VC firm Frst reaches $80 million first close for its new seed fund,Romain Dillet,2023/06/25,"
Frst, the Paris-based VC firm with no vowel in its name, is in the process of raising its second fund. The firm has already reached a first closing of €72 million (nearly $80 million at today’s exchange rate).
And if there’s one thing to say about this new fund it’s that business is as usual for Frst. As the name suggests, Frst aims to be the first VC firm to invest in a tech startup.
Frst even tells me that around half of the VC firm’s term sheets are sent before the startups are incorporated. The firm has decided to keep the same formula, with some fresh capital to invest over the next few years.
The team, led by Pierre Entremont and Bruno Raillard, originally met when they were working for Otium Venture as part of Pierre-Édouard Stérin’s family office. In 2019, the team created its own VC firm and raised the initial Frst fund (called Frst 2). At the time, Frst raised €90 million (nearly $100 million at today’s exchange rate).
With today’s new fund called Frst 3, the investment firm expects to reach the upper limit of €100 million ($110 million). Frst has secured funding from the European Investment Fund, Bpifrance’s Fonds National d’Amorçage 2, Axa Venture Partners and Isomer. Several individual investors are also investing in the fund itself, such as entrepreneurs working for PayFit, Owkin, Shippeo, Pigment, Electra, Supercell, Wolt, Aiven and Homa Games.
While Frst doesn’t focus on one vertical in particular, the firm believes that there will be plenty of interesting investment opportunities in the coming years due to the rise of artificial intelligence.
“The rapid developments observed in the field of Artificial Intelligence over the past few months and the disruptions they are creating make an extremely favorable context for startups. From work to medicine, defense, education, or natural resource management, the economy and society as a whole are preparing to undergo unprecedented changes,” Entremont said in a statement.
Overall, if you include Otium Venture’s original €44 million fund, the Frst team has more than €200 million of assets managed or advised ($219 million). With this metric, Frst says that it is now the largest seed fund focused on French startups specifically.
“France is particularly well positioned to play a leading role in this upcoming revolution, notably due to its production of top technical talent. This is why Artificial Intelligence has always been a very present theme in our investments, with, for instance, Owkin or Doctrine 7 years ago. We have also already made several investments with Frst 3 in teams with remarkable technical quality,” Raillard said in a statement.
The Frst team has invested in dozens of startups, such as Pigment, Electra, Poolside, Doctrine, PayFit, Shippeo and Owkin. With its new fund, it plans to invest between €1 million and €3 million in around 30 companies.

utu raises $33M to help travelers get more from tax-free shopping,Catherine Shu,2023/06/25,"
utu, a travel tech company that helps flyers get more out of their tax-free shopping, announced today it has raised a $33 million Series B from investors, including SC Ventures. utu also announced it has acquired CardsPal, a Singapore-based fintech that offers deals and promotions nearby to users.
During the pandemic-induced travel hiatus, utu worked to establish partnerships with travel, hotel chain and retail brands. The company notes that even though travel has rebounded, only about 1% of venture funding over the past 15 years has gone to travel, primarily short-term rental hospitality. utu’s goal is to create innovation in the tax-free shopping sector, which allows tourists to reclaim VAT on their purchases.
utu offers customers a Tax Free Card, which has two main offerings. First, tax-free shoppers can opt for frequent flyer miles or hotel points instead of VAT refunds. Or they can select an immediate store voucher that is equal to 120% of the VAT or GST they paid while shopping overseas. utu says that retailers, airlines, hotels and other organizations that partner with them can not only increase customer loyalty, but also grow their revenue from tourist shopping by up to 40%.
utu’s partners include 10 global airlines, like Air France-KLM, Emirates, Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines, as well as Accor, one of Europe’s large hospitality brands. To facilitate payments, utu works with fintech partners with Nium and also uses its own proprietary tech. It plans to announce more partnerships later this year.
Customer pay VAT upfront, and can reclaim it through operators like Planet or Global Blue. But they don’t get back the full amount of VAT, which is where utu comes in.
utu co-founder Asad Jumabhoy spent eight years working in the duty-free business, before another 25 in tax-free shopping. While operating fashion and perfume stores at Changi Airport in Singapore in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Jumabhoy started a tax refund business that evolved into Global Blue. After selling Global Blue in 2012, Jumabhoy decided to take his understanding of retail margins, value-added taxes and customer shopping habits to develop utu.
“The way we think about our work is that we are unbuilding new product layers on top of the existing tax-free shopping infrastructure that unlocks value for all stakeholders connected to tourist shopping — brands, tourists and our VAT refund partners,” he said.
Jumabhoy said even though tax-free shopping is a common practice, there are still two problems. The first is that the process of getting VAT refunds is difficult, and secondly, tourists only get part of their VAT spending back. utu focuses on the second problem and wants to give tourists more value when they shop. For example, they can receive over 90% of their refund value in airline frequent flyer miles.
The CardsPal acquisition will give utu a digital marketplace, a promotions engine and self-service merchant registration portal. It will also expedite utu’s rollout in markets like France and Italy, plus another 50 countries that offer VAT and GST refunds.
utu’s funding will be used to grow its product distribution across all countries that offer a VAT refund service, invest in technology and new products and strengthen its management to execute its growth plan.

There are signs that it will be a hot secondaries summer,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/06/25,"
One of the main reasons we have yet to see a meaningful recovery in late-stage deal activity is the lack of consensus around how startups should be valued. No one wants to pay 2021 prices, but gauging what startups are worth now isn’t easy.
However, there are signs that folks are coming to an agreement.
Last week, Forge Global, a private securities marketplace, released data that shows the average difference between what secondary sellers were looking to sell for and what buyers were looking to buy shares for — also known as the bid/ask spread — had decreased to 17%. This is the lowest percentage in a year, showing that buyers and sellers are starting to get on the same page regarding price.

Did this one feature entice Robinhood to acquire X1?,Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/06/25,"
Welcome back to The Interchange! If you want this in your inbox, sign up here. We’re back after a brief hiatus, with lots of fintech news, including Robinhood’s latest acquisition, Plaid’s newest product and a ChatGPT-powered AI tool that aims to help you save money on bills.
Robinhood’s motives
When Robinhood announced on June 22 that it was acquiring credit card startup X1 for $95 million, it caused all sorts of chatter in the fintech world.
Why would Robinhood want to buy a credit card startup? Did it get a good deal, considering that X1 has raised only $62 million over its lifetime? Did its investors get a good deal or just a return on their investment? Why X1 in particular over the many other credit card startups out there?
Let’s talk about that last point first.
When we talked to X1 in December at the time of its last fundraise, founder and CEO Deepak Rao told us the company was launching a new trading platform that would give its cardholders the ability to buy stocks by using earned reward points. He even singled out Robinhood as a company he was hoping to compete with, telling TechCrunch: “By using credit card points to buy stock instead of cash or their savings, we feel this is a safe way for many consumers to start investing. There is no real downside as their investing is technically free.”
Aha.
Could that be what drew Robinhood to X1??
On this week’s Equity podcast, we chatted about that possibility, with co-host Alex Wilhelm noting that one would have to earn a lot of rewards before being able to buy many stocks. He also pointed out that Robinhood perhaps had some money to burn, as well as the company declaring that it was looking for something new as a way of “broadening [its] product offerings” and “deepening” its relationship with existing customers.
If you’ve been following Robinhood’s performance over the past year, a desire to diversify its business is probably not a surprise. We noted that not only has Robinhood’s crypto trading slowed, but also the company has seen significant user attrition. So an X1 acquisition gets Robinhood into the credit card space and an additional revenue stream.
Still, one observer noted that while X1’s basic premise of offering credit based on income rather than credit score was innovative, since it first formed in 2020 it has not really since delivered anything — other than the new stock feature — that stands out in the market.
Fintech analyst Alex Johnson shared a similar sentiment, tweeting: “The brand alignment is strong. Both companies have a certain unearned machismo about them. Other than that though, I don’t get this for Robinhood. X1 doesn’t have a lot of customers (did it ever even fully launch?) and none of its features are revolutionary.”
It is true that X1 may not have had a lot of customers, especially in comparison to a giant like Robinhood, but the company claimed to be on a growth trajectory, with Rao telling us last December that the company saw $3 million a month in revenue last October, giving it an annual revenue rate of $36 million.
Not everyone is down on the deal, though. Better Tomorrow Ventures’ Sheel Mohnot tweeted that while X1 may not have a lot of customers, Robinhood does. He added: “[T]his seems like a good acquisition to me, cheaper to cross-sell than to sell to new customers.”

Weekly News
Fintech startup Plaid got its start as a company that connects consumer bank accounts to financial applications but has since been gradually expanding its offerings to offer more of a full-stack onboarding experience. And on June 22, Plaid announced even more new product releases that moved the company into a whole new direction while also helping to diversify its revenue streams. At the top of that lies Beacon, which it is describing as a “collaborative anti-fraud network enabling financial institutions and fintech companies to share critical fraud intelligence via API across Plaid.” More here.
Navan (formerly TripActions) offers both a corporate card and a subscription to its software. In a twist, the company announced on June 12 the launch of a new product called Navan Connect, which it describes as a patented card-link technology that gives businesses a way to offer automated expense management and reconciliation without having to change their corporate card provider. For the initial launch, Navan has partnered with Mastercard and Visa, with plans to announce additional network tie-ups in the near future. More here.
Spend management startup Brex was named to Time’s 100 Most Influential Companies list. As it made the recognition, Time wrote: “Co-CEO Henrique Dubugras says think of Brex as a ‘spend platform.’ The company launched its corporate charge card for startups five years ago, and has since grown into a fintech conqueror. Valued at $12.3 billion in 2022, it has made 10 acquisitions, and after Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse, it received $2 billion in deposits and opened 4,000 new accounts. Last year Brex launched Empower, software that links Brex cards and accounts to a custom expense-­management service. The company services startups, helping new businesses get off the ground, as well as enterprise clients, including DoorDash, Indeed, Coinbase, SeatGeek, and Lemonade.” Ramp, another spend management startup, also made the list, with Time writing: “Notching an $8.1 billion valuation just three years after being founded is striking, even for a tech startup. While many fin­tech companies struggled last year, Ramp’s meteoric rise accelerated. The business-expense-software firm saw revenues quadruple as its customers looked to stay lean through inflation. Ramp’s Visa cards are tied to employer-­set policies, so employees instantly know if charges are approved; reports and receipts aren’t always needed. Employers get alerts about duplicate expenses and items they may be overpaying for. ”
Brubank, an Argentina-based digital bank founded by former Citibank executive Juan Bruchou, shared with TechCrunch that since launching in 2019, it has brought in nearly 3 million clients, making Brubank “the largest Spanish-speaking digital bank in Latin America, with a 50% activity rate,” according to the company. It also has been sustaining bottom line profitability for the past 12 months.
At least two companies are poised for a credit card launch this summer: Snowfoll, one of three startups that pitched at TC Early Stage Boston in April, will launch a credit card in July that is tailored to users in the U.S. and India so they can more easily transmit cash cross-border. The company said users in the U.S. are eligible for limits as high as $30,000, and the card reduces the need for having separate bank accounts in the U.S. and India. In addition, the process is instant and cost-free. Meanwhile, Step, the financial platform tailored to teens, their families and young adults, opened up a waitlist for its latest card, Step Black Card. Cardholders will be eligible for perks, including earning 5% on savings balances up to $1 million and up to 8x the points on purchases. Read TechCrunch coverage on Step here and here.

The start of a new season is always a good time to revisit past predictions and look for new topics to track. Today, dry powder and university spinouts. — Anna
Record levels of dry powder in Europe?
In November of last year, PitchBook made so many predictions on venture capital and private equity in Europe that it is now reexamining them in a fresh report.
The new report, titled “European Private Capital Outlook: H1 Follow-Up,” doesn’t just look at whether PitchBook analysts were right or wrong. It also reevaluates its forecasts and what changed since then to make new assertions.
Several of PitchBook’s new predictions have to do with private equity, but the one that caught my attention relates more directly to startups: the amount of venture capital that may or may not be available to them.
Often referred to as dry powder, the money raised by VC funds that hasn’t been invested yet was expected by PitchBook to reach record levels in Europe this year. Its EMEA Private Capital analyst Nicolas Moura stands by the prediction, but the nuances between then and now are worth exploring.

Deal Dive: Caraway shows what else digital health can do,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/06/24,"
Access to healthcare has long been an issue in the U.S., but the sheer magnitude of the problem became apparent during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Numerous digital health startups stepped in to address the plethora of issues, and for a few quarters, VCs flocked to back them.
Many of those startups are still focusing on the same things, like telehealth primary care or chat-based therapy, but there’s little visibility into the adoption and customer acquisition they’ve seen. It’s clear investors aren’t so sure either: VC investment in digital health dropped to just $3.4 billion in Q1 2023 from a peak of $15.1 billion in Q2 2021, according to CB Insights.
I’m not saying the sector is dead in the water by any means, but the founders still finding success are doing far more than merely building off their peers. A recent fundraise illustrates clearly what VCs are finding attractive in the sector, and the types of startups that may find traction in today’s climate.
On Wednesday, digital health startup Caraway said it had raised an oversubscribed $16.8 million Series A round led by Maveron. The startup looks to offer 24/7 access to physical and mental health resources targeted at Gen Z customers, and its integrated healthcare service has doctors and nurses who are always available for text chats and calls. It also offers tools that help its customers maintain and respond to mental and physical health issues in between appointments or when professionals are offline. The app is licensed to operate in 10 states.
When founder Lori Evans Bernstein started the company in January 2022, she had just left her previous startup, HealthReveal, which used AI to help people manage chronic illnesses. Around the time, Evans Bernstein realized how hard it could be for people to get treatments when talking with her niece: After 15 weeks of fruitlessly waiting for appointments to treat a reaction to an unknown allergy, her niece simply gave up and hoped it wouldn’t come back.
“The more I peeled the onion, the more I couldn’t believe the lack of access to care and the experience they had to go through to get the care they needed,” Evans Bernstein said. That story inspired her to start Caraway, aiming to do away with those barriers to accessing healthcare. "
What happens if regulators nix the $20B Adobe-Figma deal?,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/23,"
When Adobe announced it was putting up $20 billion to buy Figma in September 2022, it didn’t take long before people began assuming it was a blatant attempt to take a competitor off the market. 
It was certainly curious, especially considering the offer was double what the company’s most recent valuation had been and worth around 50x Figma’s revenue. It’s hard to argue that the deal wasn’t a display of brute force on Adobe’s part, the kind of corporate rollup that regulators are trying to put a stop to after years of letting the tech giants run rampant, buying up startups that could eventually erode their market share.
The proposed Adobe-Figma deal has certainly gotten the attention of regulators — and not in a welcoming way. Already, the Justice Department, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) — Britain’s competition watchdog — and the EU are taking long, hard looks at the deal, and it wouldn’t be too much of a stretch to think that any of them could nix the deal for being anticompetitive.
“We are still in preliminary phases of the regulatory process and are having constructive discussions with the CMA, EC and DOJ about the businesses, markets and positive economic impacts this deal will bring to support [customers’ positive] reviews [of the product],” an Adobe spokesperson told TechCrunch+.
It seems pretty obvious even to a casual observer that Adobe is trying to take a potential rival off the board, a move that could stifle both competition and innovation, not a great mix for design software consumers. 
To be sure, the deal would give Adobe an entirely new look, one it has tried to build on its own with a design tool rival, Adobe XD. But XD never gained much traction, which explains why the company was willing to fork over $20 billion to get the cream of the crop.
In an interview at TechCrunch Disrupt last fall, Figma co-founder Dylan Field argued that the two companies would truly be better together. But of course he has 20 billion reasons to think that.
When asked to explain why he decided to join forces with the company that his marketing team had been painting as its biggest rival, he saw two companies marrying creativity and design, and he couldn’t see having the resources to move in that direction on his own, at least not for a long time. “If we want to go and make it so that we’re able to go into all these more productivity areas, that’s gonna take a lot of time. To be able to go and do that in the context of Adobe, I think gives us a huge leg up, and I’m really excited about that,” Field said.
But with regulators looking closely, it’s not a stretch to wonder if that’s ever going to happen. But even if it does, would the deal be a net-positive for Figma and its backers? Let’s talk about it. "
When AI bots pose as humans,Haje Jan Kamps,2023/06/23,"
Welcome to Startups Weekly. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday afternoon.
This week, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about the implications of artificial intelligence. One of the most fragile parts of the puzzle is the training data. We already know that you can see if your images were used to train the datasets and that a lot of the training datasets out there are . . . spurious at best. Some startups are trying to build datasets trained exclusively on licensed data, and human artists are pretty grumpy when big-name studios use AI to generate art.
An interesting curveball is realizing that even evaluating training data may be challenging, as researchers discover that Mechanical Turk workers — who are, in theory, human workers doing tasks that machines can’t do — are reportedly using AI tools themselves. That’s fine for some tasks, but not great if the text they are generating is meant to be used as the rubric that AI-generating text tools are measured against. The old computing adage of “garbage in, garbage out” still stands. If you can’t trust the training data, you can’t trust the output (TC+).
Seen through the lens of startups, AI is continuing to go gangbusters — and Amazon’s AWS is throwing its not inconsiderable weight behind the burgeoning trend, with a $100 million program to fund generative AI initiatives.
The highest highs and deepest lows of transportation
Image Credits: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch
It’s a bad week when a submersible goes missing, followed by a series of reports showing that perhaps the company didn’t have the most solid safety track record. The sub imploded under the ocean’s crushing pressure, killing its five passengers and raising new questions about the role of whistleblowers in startup land. The OceanGate underwater vessel used a carbon fiber hull that “wasn’t rated for Titanic depths,” claimed the operations-director-turned-whistleblower. It goes to show that, while startups famously “move fast and break stuff,” perhaps that tenet doesn’t quite extend to life-or-death critical equipment.
A highlight for transportation this week is a breakthrough in battery manufacturing. It turns out that up to half the energy required to make a lithium-ion cell is used in the process of drying certain components of the battery cell. Volkswagen just came up with a new process (TC+) that does away with that requirement, drastically reducing the cost and time it takes to create the batteries that power our electric vehicles.

Sure, that seems . . . useful?: In what has to be one of the biggest headscratchers of the decade, Mercedes is adding ChatGPT to its infotainment system, Devin reports.
Give us those sleek Tesla plugs: Last week, GM and Ford announced they would be using Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS) very soon. Tim predicted that the company’s Supercharger network will strain as a result. This week, Rivian announced it will adopt the charging standard as well.
More NACS tailwinds: First GM and Ford, then Rivian, and now Texas weighs in, saying state-funded EV chargers must include Tesla plugs.

Hackers gonna hack
Image Credits: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch
Both in startup land and beyond, we are seeing a tremendous amount of movement in security news over the past couple of weeks. We’ve had a ton of coverage of Reddit slowly imploding over the new API charges the social media giant introduced a little while back. But one story I particularly wanted to highlight is that hackers are threatening to release confidential data stolen from Reddit unless the company pays a ransom demand — and reverses its controversial API price hikes. It seems pretty curious for hackers to demand both policy changes and cash. If they were given one or the other, I wonder which they would choose — and what that says about the power of hack-tivism.
Malicious hacking has long been in the news, but I find it particularly interesting that we are seeing more and more startups trying to help tackle the problem, whether that’s hardening API security, data security at source or Internet of Things devices. As hackers get more sophisticated, and as computer security exploit exploration becomes more prevalent (just last week, a ransomware gang listed its first victims of MOVEit mass-hacks, which included U.S. banks and universities), opportunities for startups also increase. And yet, as Alex explored recently, it seems like a miss that VCs aren’t queuing around the block (TC+) to fund the current generation of cybersecurity companies.

That seems bad. That’s bad, right? Yeah, that’s bad: A simple bug exposed access to thousands of smart security alarm systems.

You’re so money and you don’t even know it

Fintech, what are we going to do with you? Even in an industry that’s all about money, the vertical just continues exploding with investment. Paro raised $25 million to match independent financial experts with firms, open banking fintech company Volt just raised a huge round at a valuation north of $350 million, and Majority, a digital bank for U.S. migrants, closed almost $10 million as it expands operations in Texas.
Sexy it ain’t, but investors know that fintech — once the company gets a soupçon of traction and a fistful of customers — is interesting for two reasons: Money never goes out of fashion, and there are M&A-hungry multinational giants who are standing by to snap up a company that’s on the upswing. At startup scale, the most recent example was that Robinhood just acquired credit card startup X1 for $95 million. At a very different scale indeed, Nasdaq announced it is planning to acquire financial services software company Adenza for $10.5 billion.
There’s money in them money trees, it appears.

How to identify, interview and hire a head of growth for an early-stage startup
Don’t wait to identify your startup’s ideal customer personas



Don’t reinvent the growth funnel.
There’s more than a decade of growth marketing now behind us. Thousands of startups have experimented with infinite variations and tweaks to their growth funnel, so why should you try to reinvent the same foundation?
The most important aspects are acquisition, activation and retention. While referral and monetization are also quite important, they won’t make or break a startup like those first three. If you can’t acquire, activate or retain consumers to your startup, your probability of success is practically nil.
In this article I will walk you through world-class setups from several leading companies, broken down by each stage of the funnel, so that you can draw inspiration from what has already been proven over the last decade.
This isn’t meant to be a teardown of each specific startup, but rather a holistic look into what leading companies are doing, their mindsets when it comes to growth and how to replicate these actions in your own startup.
Funnel stage I: Acquisition
Without question, the most advanced acquisition I personally encountered occurred while I was a leader of rider growth at Uber. As you can imagine, at that time we had swarms of product managers, data scientists and all the complementary growth roles you can think of helping us push our growth marketing team forward.
When building the correct approach for acquisition, these are the aspects that will elevate a world-class program above an average one:

Attribution setup
Mindset on metrics
Focus on large levers

In terms of our attribution, I must begin by qualifying that I have never seen an attribution framework that was 100% accurate, as it is essentially impossible to capture all acquisition data without leakage.
At Uber we did still spend a great deal of time working with our attribution partners, such as our mobile measurement partner, and were constantly locating areas of improvement. Before unloading on your acquisition budget, you should first ensure you are capturing all possible data from your paid channels. If you’re acquiring on the web, this means adding UTM parameters to all campaigns.
 

			Acquisition, activation and retention are critical. While referral and monetization are also quite important, they won’t make or break a startup.					


Conversely, if you’re acquiring on a mobile app, this means having a mobile measurement partner fully integrated into your app. I’ve written an entire column on how to set up a proper tech stack that I implore readers to visit if they are starting their own attribution efforts from scratch.
Mindset on acquisition is what separates marketers flashing vanity metrics such as CTR and CVR, while simultaneously losing sight on down-funnel conversion metrics. At Uber, we focused on advanced metrics such as predicted LTV (pLTV) and predicted first trips (pFT) of new riders that we were acquiring in real time. Using methodologies we developed in-house that analyzed various data points, including acquisition channel and geography, we were able to accurately predict the number of trips a new user would make 90 days out.
Whatever your north star metric is, you should always be looking far into the future to understand the value of your acquisition so that you can double down on those channels that bring the highest-value consumers.
Acquisition is ever-changing and the best-in-class marketers work hard to stay in touch with the latest creative trends, new ad formats to test, and those next golden pockets to sell to. When I was on the growth team at Coinbase, we spent a minimum of 10% of our budget testing the new ad formats that TikTok was releasing.
The point here is that you should focus on the largest paid acquisition levers as they come to fruition, with one such example being creative on paid social. I recommend the following sites that keep startup founders up-to-date on the latest growth and marketing trends — SocialMediaToday for paid social or Search Engine Land for paid search.
Funnel stage II: Activation "
"TechCrunch+ roundup: AI + travel, fusion investor survey, why you’ll never get funding",Walter Thompson,2023/06/23,"
Most founders won’t realize that they’re on the wrong track until it’s too late.
That’s because failure is something many entrepreneurs can only perceive in hindsight: The day-to-day work of building a startup requires a high degree of confidence — and for some, denial.
Quoting the movie “Grosse Pointe Blank,” perhaps this column by Haje Jan Kamps will be “a swift, spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.”

In his experience, there are three reasons why some startups will never get a thumbs-up from an investor:

the market is too small;
the team is not good enough;
the plan doesn’t make sense.

These are all major problems, but here’s the good news: These are only existential issues for ego-driven founders. People who can accept they don’t have all the answers are able to pivot to success.
On the other hand, those who look in the mirror and see Captain America smiling back tend to make poor CEOs.

When it comes to integrating AI with travel, “even a small lead matters right now,” according to Eric Crowley and Adam Segall of global investment bank GP Bullhound.

Warming public markets are boosting the secondary market for startup shares

Follow-on investment may be harder to obtain, but Alex Wilhelm reports that “the combination of seller pessimism and modest buyer optimism” is driving an “uptick in secondary market activity.”
Interpreting data from Caplight, Forge, Other Information and PitchBook, he concluded that the increase may signal a potential rise in startup valuations.
“It’s becoming clearer how much pain startups will need to endure to raise more capital, but it’s anybody’s guess if they’re willing to accept that fact.”

Black founders based in the United Kingdom have an even harder time than their U.S.-based counterparts when it comes to accessing venture capital, reports Dominic-Madori Davis.
“Between 2009 and 2019 in the U.K., just 30 Black people received VC funding, equating to less than 0.4% of all funds allocated to founders.”
She interviewed multiple investors who are working to expand this community, including Karl Lokko, co-founder of venture firm Black Seed, which recently announced its £5 million inaugural fund.
“The wheels are starting to turn, but we’ve got a long road ahead,” he said.

Prosus, Peak XV Partners and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative confirmed Friday that their representatives have resigned from the board of Byju’s, India’s most valuable startup that is also reeling from the departure of its auditor Deloitte this week.
The board members’ resignations — which Byju’s vehemently denied on Thursday — came shortly after global auditing giant Deloitte told the startup’s board that it was resigning from its role. Deloitte, which was slated to work with Byju’s until 2025, said that the edtech giant had failed to hand over financial results for the year ended March 2022.
A spokesperson for Peak XV Partners confirmed the departure of GV Ravishankar, a partner at the firm, from Byju’s board and said the investing giant, formerly known as Sequoia India, was “committed to supporting the company for bringing on board an independent director in order to strengthen business processes and internal control mechanisms.”
In a statement, a Prosus spokesperson said:
Prosus confirms that Russell Dreisenstock, the representing Board Director from MIH Edtech Investments, B.V. (a Prosus entity) on the board of Think & Learn Private Limited, resigned from his position. The Company is required to file the resignation letter with the MCA in India within the required time period.
In a statement, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative confirmed that Vivian Wu has quit Byju’s board. The resignations halve the board’s size to just three individuals: Byju’s co-founders — Byju Raveendran and Divya Gokulnath — and Raveendran’s brother Riju.
In a statement, a Byju’s spokesperson said the company’s management is engaging with investors to reconstitute the board and said departing members left because their shareholding had fallen.
“The need for reconstitution arose as few investors had to vacate the board seat due to their shareholding falling below a minimum required threshold as per our SHA. We want to reassure all stakeholders that we are actively working towards constituting a diverse and world-class board commensurate with the company’s size and scale.”
Trouble is mounting at Byju’s, which is also the most valuable edtech globally. India’s corporate affairs ministry ordered an investigation into Byju’s last week after the ministry took cognizance of “various corporate governance lapses” at the startup, television channel CNBC-TV18 reported earlier Friday — another reporting that Byju’s denied.
Deloitte said Thursday that it was resigning because it had not received “any communication” from Byju’s on the status of “audit readiness of the financial statements and the underlying books and records for the year ended March 31 2022.”
It was a déjà vu moment for the auditor. Byju’s attracted intense scrutiny last year from the government, investors and creditors after it repeatedly failed to publish its accounts. In September, Byju’s finally published its accounts for the year ending March 2021, revealing revenue figures that fell short of its own projections.

"While everyone keeps talking about AI, HR tech startups are quietly building toward a $24B market",Anna Heim,2023/06/23,"
While venture capitalists, startup founders and major tech companies compete to see who can say “AI” the most in a week, people are busy building other, more useful stuff.
And one particular group has caught our eye: companies that build software for human resource management.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

TechCrunch+ noted in March that there’s a burgeoning group of HR tech unicorns in the United States that are ripe to go public when that window opens. But our initial scope proved limited, because HR tech is hot in Europe right now as well and it’s worth paying attention to.
It makes sense that HR tech has managed to grow rapidly and still fly under the radar — it’s not going to be hyped as the economic model of the future and neither will it be criticized for having the capability to potentially end civilization.
Still, HR tech companies often find themselves moving hundreds of millions of dollars — if not billions — through their channels and have therefore become large and lucrative.
Today we’re digesting notes from a recent GP Bullhound report on European HR tech to expand our general comprehension of the sector in anticipation of an environment in which IPOs are again a reality.
Morphing into unicorns, one paycheck at a time
Strikingly, GP Bullhound reports there is just as much bullish sentiment around HR tech as around AI and climate tech. “We look for these sectors to produce the next tech giants, with maintained if not increased bull-market funding levels and exponential growth in the number of companies,” the report said. "
EvaluAgent raises $20M to build out software that evaluates call center agents,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/23,"
After spending more than a decade in the customer experience industry, three friends, Jaime Scott, Michelle Dinsmore and Alex Richards, decided to launch their own company, EvaluAgent, to develop quality assurance testing software for contact centers.
The three co-founders say they were motivated by a shared desire to find a solution to the problem of contact center manager overwork. Reviewing customer calls and texts for quality assurance calls takes time — so much time, in fact, that it’s rarely done regularly. According to one source, only between 1% and 2% of calls to a contact center actually get evaluated.
“At its heart, the contact center’s role is to serve customers,” Scott, who serves as the company’s CEO, told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Those customers are human beings and, as such, are always going to demand a level of service and experience technology alone won’t be able to offer. Our belief is that the greater the employee experience for agents, the greater the customer experience they’ll be able to offer.”
Scott, Dinsmore and Richards incorporated EvaluAgent in 2012. The team grew quickly, but was largely focused on working with a small number of corporate clients. That changed in 2018 and 2019, when Scott says the leadership recognized a gap in the market for a more flexible software-as-a-service-based quality assurance testing solution.
Today, EvaluAgent’s platform aims to help quality assurance staff analyze conversations — both text and voice — across channels to coach and train customer agents. Via mostly automated workflows, EvaluAgent tries to boost the efficiency of QA teams, showing quality assurance-related stats in a unified dashboard.
Managers can give employee feedback via EvaluAgent’s dedicated tool while employees can find answers to common questions in EvaluAgent’s built-in company knowledge base.
“EvaluAgent not only delivers quality assurance, but also provides customers with tools to ensure that evaluators’ findings convert to ongoing behavior change in the agent base,” Scott said. “Altogether, the platform represents a complete system of record for contact centers’ quality teams.”
EvaluAgent also offers an automated scoring system, driven by a combination of speech recognition technologies and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The system, SmartScore, transcribes conversations if necessary and uses ChatGPT — an AI chatbot that understands text — to summarize them for insights, rating line items and providing coaching tips. 
“Out-of-the-box key moments, such as customer frustration, repeat contact, and complaint escalation, are automatically tagged,” Scott explained. “It … empowers organizations to achieve more interaction coverage and streamline the quality assurance process while keeping quality teams in full control.”

One wonders about bias creeping into the algorithms used to evaluate agents’ actions, though. After all, studies have shown that AI is more likely to classify Black speech as “toxic” or “offensive.” And it’s well-understood that voice recognition tech, too, is racially and ethnically biased. So can SmartScore be trusted?
Scott didn’t elaborate on which measures, if any, EvaluAgent takes to combat bias in its algorithms. But he stressed that they aren’t intended to replace human quality assurance evaluators.
“EvaluAgent has made investments in its technical resources to incorporate the best AI models available for its use cases,” he said. “We are model-agnostic, which we believe is a significant advantage in the modern rapidly-evolving AI landscape. Additional AI-fueled innovation and automation, which incorporate the latest AI models but allow quality assurance teams to remain at the center of key workflows, will follow on the back of this financing.”
The lack of transparency hasn’t gotten in the way of the company’s success, it seems. EvaluAgent claims it’s seen revenue grow nearly fivefold over the last three years, with customers ranging from Fortune 500 enterprises to mid-market business process outsourcers and tech companies.
The momentum captured the attention of major investors, which poured cash into EvaluAgent’s Series A. Announced today, the Series A, led by PeakSpan, closed at $20 million, bringing EvaluAgent’s total raised to $21 million.
PeakSpan’s Phil Dur, the lead partner on the deal, says that he saw “tremendous opportunity” in what he described as the “quality arena.” That’s despite stiff competition in the over-$35.3-billion space, apparently — startups including Invoca offer features similar to — but not exactly the same as — EvaluAgent’s.
“Having spent years studying the category, we believe EvaluAgent is the strongest vendor of quality assurance and performance improvement software,” Dur said via email. “The platform shines for small and mid-market contact centers, while maintaining the capacity to serve enterprise-level businesses with large contact center operations.”
Scott says that the Series A funding will be put toward enriching its products, expanding its remote team and supporting customers in “new and existing geographies.”
“Roughly 25% of the contact center market still runs their QA programs on spreadsheets, while another portion makes the best of in-house legacy tools,” he said. “Contact centers are facing a new dynamic — balance leaner staff and fewer onsite agents with an increasingly demanding customer (call volumes, hold times and escalations have been steadily rising) all while optimizing cost to navigate a potentially choppy macroenvironment.”

"Dropbox hearts AI, the creator-platform wars and why we’re bullish on fake booze",Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/23,"

Hello, and welcome back to Equity, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.
Mary Ann and Alex are back, and once again they tapped the TechCrunch roster for expert input. This week, we’re lucky enough to have Kirsten Korosec back on the podcast. She’s TechCrunch’s mobility lead, hosts a podcast of her own and is one of our favorite humans.

All the cool kids are filling out the Equity listener survey. We want to hear from you! 

The summer slowdown is far from happening yet, so we had a whole raft of stuff to chew through. It was a good thing that we had six hands on deck! Here’s the rundown:

Deals of the Week: Mary Ann wanted to talk about Robinhood buying X1, a deal that seemed inexpensive but we lack enough numbers for full confidence; Alex wanted to riff on Dropbox’s new AI fund, even if it does feel a little small; and Kirsten had notes for the team on Cruise’s latest app rollout. Even if Mary Ann and Alex cannot find a way to agree on self-driving cars, we all thought that the Cruise bus is cute.
Twitch and Reddit try to balance corporate requirements with community power: Building off our recent show digging into the creator economy, the crew tackled the latest from Twitch (a new creator-corporate revenue split of sorts) and Reddit (where the battle between the company and its power-users continues to blaze). It’s feeling more hot war than cold war lately on the internet, with platforms struggling to find a way to keep revenue growth coming while not estranging the folks who make their services tick.
The power of Not Boozing: How big is the market for non-alcoholic drinks? Smaller than the market for vodka, certainly, but we’re curious. Also there’s a new app in the market that is helping folks find non-booze bevies, which we dig.

A big thanks to Kirsten for swinging by, and we’ll chat with you Monday morning!

Forcite seeks the smart helmet success that Skully squandered,Tim Stevens,2023/06/23,"
Whither, Skully? The Indiegogo darling of a smart helmet company made all sorts of promises in 2014 and even shipped a few lids to early backers before getting lost on the way to market and disappearing into a cloud of misplaced hype and undelivered promises.
Nearly a decade later, another company called Forcite is back making many of the same promises: a smart helmet that is more digital companion than safety device, which can deliver integrated navigation with visual and auditory prompts.
Forcite, though, is skipping the ugly crowdfunding bit and is instead working directly with distributors. The company has already shipped thousands of MK1S smart helmets and, yes, its technology actually works.
But that’s just the beginning of a journey for this Australian startup working to create a platform that will, it hopes, become an integral part of motorcycle safety.
Inspired by a crash
Forcite co-founders Alfred Boyadgis and Julian Chow. Image Credits: Forcite
Forcite was founded a decade ago, initially dabbling in various wearable technologies like in-helmet cameras for American football players. The move toward smart helmets started in 2019, according to CEO and co-founder Alfred Boyadgis.
“I had a motorcycle accident and wanted to create a technology that wasn’t just about passive safety or impact, something that could predict what was ahead on the road, thus changing the decision,” Boyadgis said in a recent interview.
He was also inspired by the GoPro craze. “Everyone started to use these action cameras on the front of their helmet, com-sets on the side of their helmet,” Boyadgis said. “These things increase the rotational velocity of the helmet.”
In a crash, more rotational velocity on a helmet can mean greater forces transferred to the brain within. Keep everything within the shell of the helmet, and that force is reduced.
Forcite’s in-house team started iterating on design ideas but soon turned to the wisdom of the crowd.
“We put together a group of 8,000 riders, an online test pilot club — it was on a Facebook page,” Boyadgis said. “We got those riders together and started talking about the technology which they use. So, you know, how they use the dash cameras, the things they don’t like about how they use com-sets, how they use audio. And then this new layout, which was, like, how do they receive information in an effective way?”
Motorcycling requires far more concentration than driving a car. A moment’s distraction can be fatal, and so the helmet’s UI had to be minimal.
The Forcite team ultimately nixed early ideas of including an augmented reality display of the sort found in the Skully AR-1.
Nuts and bolts
Image Credits: Forcite
At its simplest, the MK1S is a helmet with an integrated Bluetooth audio connection, including speakers positioned over the ears. This means that riders can take calls, listen to music or get navigation instructions provided to the helmet wirelessly from the phone.
Many manufacturers now sell helmets with integrated Bluetooth functionality. What’s novel in the MK1S is a row of RGB LEDs inside the helmet above the chin bar. These glow upward, providing simple visual cues to the rider, all driven by the smartphone app. A green sweep from left to right means to make a right turn, for example. An inward sweep of orange means an accident ahead. A quick blink of red means the camera is activated.
That 1080p camera is built into the chin and can be used to automatically record incidents. It can also be manually toggled for highlights, which are stored on a microSD card. A separate, wireless controller mounts to the handlebars of the bike and allows the rider to toggle the camera, phone and navigation with a thumb press. For now, that’s the only way to give the helmet commands while on the bike.
While the electronics are within the shell of the helmet, including a rechargeable, ceramic battery, they do not compromise the crucial foam that actually protects the rider’s head. This design not only ensures the maximum possible safety and performance in various international helmet certifications, but it also allows an element of reuse. Should a helmet be damaged in a crash or otherwise, the electronics can be ported over to a replacement.
This could reduce costs for some in the long-term. The upfront cost, however, is significant.
A new Forcite MK1S costs $1,099 in the United States. That compares to about $600 to $800 for a top-shelf helmet made by leading manufacturers like Shoei and Arai — manufacturers that Boyadgis and co tried to partner with.
“So, we actually went around to a lot of manufacturers asking them if they wanted to build one, and all of them were, like, ‘No, we’re very happy with the margins that we make on motorcycle helmets,'” he said.
Predictive aspirations
Most of the MK1S’s functionality is driven by the Forcite app, which for now draws its data from Here Technologies. Developers are reworking the app to use Mapbox (said to offer “a smoother, more polished experience” according to a Forcite rep). The Forcite app provides navigation and gives warnings of debris, crashes and even police, which are communicated to the rider via voice prompts and that strip of LEDs.
Interestingly, those in-helmet alerts work even if the rider isn’t actively navigating.
“It can endeavor to provide you with something that’s coming up on a realistic route ahead, not something that’s on a parallel road or on a road that’s disjunct from your current graph network,” Tom Larcher, Forcite’s senior development manager, said.
That’s just the beginning, according to Larcher. “Predicting a corner that is particularly hazardous is a great one,” he said, indicating that the app will soon look at factors like road conditions, historic incidents and even the motorcycle’s current speed, then warn riders if a given stretch of road is dangerous.
“Predictive AI will be used for that aspect of things,” Larcher said, successfully delivering the hottest buzzword of the moment during our interview.
The ultimate integration
Image Credits: Forcite
The long-term goal is to integrate not just the helmet and smartphone, but also the bike itself. Right now, most motorcycles are raw, simple machines compared to the rolling data factory of a modern car — software-defined vehicles with Ethernet backbones collecting hundreds of data points in real time.
Motorcycles, per Boyadgis, will get there soon.
“There’s definitely more sensors going on to bikes,” he said. “Advanced awareness systems will definitely become a common thing across the entire industry. We want to be that standardized interface.”
Forcite is working to define a new protocol for this kind of connectivity, something more reliable than the typical Bluetooth interfaces used for wireless accessories. Standards, though, are only as useful as those who support them.
For now, Forcite reps declined to identify which manufacturers are onboard for this idea, saying only that they’ve partnered with two brands for “deeper integration.”
Forcite has announced a partnership with Harley-Davidson Australia to “develop a next generation smart helmet and sensing system to preempt and identify hazards, such as debris and other road users and alert riders so they can take evasive action.”
In the world of motorcycling, it doesn’t get much more significant than H-D.
CEO Boyadgis says we won’t see this technology on motorcycles until 2026 at the earliest and hopes to integrate the necessary protocols into Forcite’s helmets as soon as next year.
“What we’re trying to do is work out a way where we get permission from a few manufacturers, both Japanese and Italian, to be able to pair with their bikes without something that they’re selling,” he said.
Next-gen bells and whistles
Other forthcoming advances will be more focused on lifestyle, including an in-helmet voice assistant capable of handling commands like, “Hey, Forcite: contact the first four people I know who ride a Ducati in my area, and then make a route that utilizes that style bike so we all meet up at a Mexican restaurant in time for lunch.”
Boyadgis wants to deploy this “collaborative ride experience” within the next two years, where the helmet becomes a real partner on the bike.
Forcite’s physical offerings will also evolve, including new models optimized for different types of riding, like a retro-styled helmet for cruisers, a flip-up model for the touring crowd and a visored adventure-style helmet.
Markets and money
To get there, the company will need to raise funds. Forcite closed AU$6.6 million in funding in December to drive the expansion into U.S. distribution. The company is now moving into a Series B capital round to raise capital that will fund those future helmet designs as well as the necessary research and development for all those app advancements.
Forcite is focused particularly on the U.S. market and plans to ship more than 10,000 units next year. The brand has already shipped 5,000, roughly 3,000 going to the company’s home Australian market.
But, Boyadgis says, the potential is to go much higher: “Let’s take a brand like an Arai or a Shoei across the United States; they’re selling in excess of, like, 50,000 units. So, that’s where we want to get to.”
The question, though, is whether Forcite’s more high-tech, high-price lids will speak to the same audience as the simple, comfortable, relatively affordable helmets from familiar, respected brands.
Motorcycling is, for many, a rejection of the complexity and claustrophobia of motoring.
Even Boyadgis has simplified his own daily Forcite experience, using it as a dashcam but not using it for navigation. “I do have it connected in the background, but I only have, like, police and speed camera alert — not that I speed or anything. But, they are pretty useful things if I’m going around a bend or something and I need to slow down. So, it really depends on, like, how much you want to use it, right?”
Whether Forcite can challenge the established brands or convince traditional motorcyclists to spend more money remains to be seen. However, there are early indications that Forcite is on the right track. The excitement around the failed Skully AR-1 product showed there’s an appetite for a smarter helmet. And the hunger still appears to be intact; Forcite’s shipments have already outpaced Skully’s.

"Singapore’s ride-hailing firm Grab lays off over 1,100 employees ",Kate Park,2023/06/23,"
On-demand startups in Asia raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors over the last several years to scale and compete heavily in ridesharing, alternative transport, delivery and a supersized range of related and unrelated services. Now comes the reckoning. 
This week, Southeast Asian supper app ride-hailing and food delivery app operator Grab laid off more than a thousand people, or about 11% of its staff, its first big layoffs since 2020.
Grab — which offers services in Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and Myanmar — said it will make severance payments of half a month for every six months of completed service. It also will provide medical insurance coverage through to the end of 2023, as well as career transition consultations, among other measures, for those impacted.
The cuts come about a month after Grab — which trades on the Nasdaq exchange in the U.S. — reported quarterly results that indicated slowing user growth and user spend amid an ongoing net loss, as well as the departure of its co-founder from the business. 
In a memo to staff, CEO and co-founder Anthony Tan downplayed the move as a cost-cutting measure merely aimed at profitability; instead he framed the move as right-sizing in reaction to changes in technology, the state of the capital markets and competition.
“We must adapt to the environment in which we operate,” he wrote in the letter, published online. “Change has never been this fast. Technology such as Generative AI is evolving at breakneck speed. The cost of capital has gone up, directly impacting the competitive landscape.” The group has publicly committed to being “Group Adjusted EBITDA breakeven” by the end of this financial year.
But it’s been aiming for that goal without major cuts to its expenses. Unlike its big competitors in the region Sea and GoTo (the parent company of GoJek), Grab held off from making layoffs in the last year. Last September, its chief operating officer Alex Hungate told Reuters that Grab doubled down on that commitment, despite weakening market conditions. 
Prior to this week’s news, the last time Grab laid off workers was in 2020: It cut 360 jobs during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, when business for all ride-hailing companies globally fell off a cliff. At the time, those cuts worked out to less than 5% of its staff.
By comparison, GoTo laid off 600 employees in March of this year to improve its profitability after cutting 1,300 jobs, or 12% of its workforce, seven months prior to that to preserve cash. 
Although Tan didn’t want to point to profitability as a main goal, the cuts might be seen as a response to some of the lackluster metrics in its last earnings, which have manifested elsewhere: The company has been getting hammered in the markets.
When Grab went public in December 2021 by way of a SPAC, it did so having raised more than $10 billion in outside funding as a startup — with investors including SoftBank’s Vision Fund when its spending exuberance was at its peak, as well as strategic backers like Hyundai — and a valuation of $40 billion. Today, however, the company’s market cap is between $12 and $13 billion.
Another challenge has been heavy, ongoing price competition with rivals, which plays out not just as promotions for consumers, but incentives for drivers, too.
And a third challenge might well be the size of the business. Grab has amassed a large grab-bag of services over the years in its quest to build a “super app” providing any and all services to its consumers. Most recently, the Singapore on-demand firm acquired the Philippine-based motorcycle taxi platform Move It in 2022, a Malaysian supermarket chain Jaya Grocer and Indonesian digital payment platform OVO in 2021.
Grab has not ruled out what else it might do to “adapt” to today’s market, including divestments, sunsetting services or indeed further layoffs.
“The primary goal of this exercise is to strategically reorganize ourselves so that we can move faster, work smarter and rebalance our resources across our portfolio in line with our longer-term strategies,” Tan said.

Joyful Ventures debuts with $23M focused on investment in sustainable protein startups,Christine Hall,2023/06/27,"
The alternative protein sector has seen a lot of movement in the past week, including U.S. regulators approving both Upside Foods and Good Meat to sell their cultivated chicken products for the first time in the country.
Poised to help thriving startups in this sector is a new venture capital fund called Joyful Ventures, which just closed $23 million of its $25 million fund. Advisors and investors include Björn Öste, co-founder of Oatly; Dr. Sandhya Sriram, CEO of Shiok Meats; Ryan Bethencourt, co-founder of Indie Bio and CEO of Wild Earth; and Arturo Elizondo, CEO of EVERY.
The woman and LGBTQIA+-led fund is co-founded by Jennifer Stojkovic, founder of the Vegan Women Summit; Milo Runkle, co-founder of The Good Food Institute; and Blaine Vess, co-founder of edtech startup Student Brands. All are general partners of Los Angeles–based Joyful Ventures.
To learn more about the fund and how the trio plan to drive climate solutions, we spoke with Stojkovic, who told TechCrunch that the fund will invest at the pre-seed and seed stages into startups that have strong B2B opportunities and are innovating technologies, including plant-based, precision fermentation, mycoproteins, molecular agriculture and cultivated technologies.
The company has already made two investments from the fund, including New School Foods, which raised $12 million earlier this year to make plant-based salmon, and Orbillion Bio, a company making cultivated Wagyu beef and other products.
The following conversation was lightly edited for length and clarity.
TC: What inspired the three of you to start Joyful Ventures?
JS: There is still a lack of awareness when it comes to the impact of food. We’re going to build the next big era of great startups, in my opinion, by unlocking the investment potential. There’s billions and billions of dollars of VC dry powder out there. I read about 50% is earmarked for climate, and some VCs are very interested in climate, but most of the ones I speak to don’t know the connection.
Why focus specifically on sustainable proteins?
When we say sustainable protein, we’re really talking about the broader food ecosystem and how it relates to it. We’re looking at everything from how to reduce the water footprint or improve the texturing of the plant protein crop, all the way to the end product on the grocery shelf. The protein aspects are where the driver of emissions is, but the type of widespread change that’s going to need to happen in the system to support transitioning toward, it’s myriad.
We need to be thinking holistically: What are the different mechanisms and levers that need to be pulled to actually transform the system? It’s not as simple as making a product and they’ll show up. How do we get the cost down? That’s going to be investing in the larger agriculture system.
What was the fundraising environment like? How long did it take you to raise the fund?
Terrible! It is June and we started our close in November. That gives you an idea of how long it took to get the first bit of investments in. It’s been tough. We are feeling incredibly elated to be able to even have a double-digit fund like this. That is such a rarity these days. And then of course, there has been back-and-forth about the future of the (alternative protein) space.
The Cargills of the world and the bigger entities, the ones with hundreds of years of scale on how we produce food on the planet, are coming to the table now and saying, “No, this wasn’t just a blip during the pandemic.” Those are the types of folks that we’re talking to, and that is the type of viewpoint that we have. This is a long game. If you’re looking to make a quick buck, food is not it, but if you are looking to make enduring sustainable change that could quite literally save the planet, we’re your team.

VCs remain confident alternative protein has a real future despite public-market woes

What were some of the concerns your LPs had?
Inflation has been a big part of it. There’s very real challenges at the grocery store. There’s going to be an unfortunate reality where brands are not going to be able to sell at the price point that consumers are able to pay right now. If you’re a widespread protein manufacturer, you have a massive portfolio and can play with the numbers. But if you’re a newer startup, you don’t have that kind of ability to change your exposure.
With Upside Foods and Good Meat moving kind of to the next stage, do you feel like this is continuing to move in the right direction?
Absolutely. This is huge. We’ve got the products being sold in Singapore for the last two years. Now we’ve got the United States, which is arguably the biggest, depending on which metric to use, meat market in the world, ready to serve to consumers potentially by the end of 2023. You need a market like America to shake things up. You’re going to see a lot more countries coming as soon as America does that. Things could start snowballing pretty quickly.
What are you looking for in an investment?
We’re investing in founders that are in it for the long haul. We’re not investing in founders that just heard that the alternative protein was a hot space to be in. We look for people that understand what it takes to disrupt a 100-year-old system, and for companies that are not only making food ingredients that can eliminate animals, but, for example, also can serve high-end cosmetic companies. I believe that for this industry, one of the most important things that we do is build companies that have multiple revenue streams. The margins you can make on a high-end cosmetic could be 90%, which allows for you to build in the pricing for the food commodity that you also need to serve.
Why should founders pick you as their investment partner?
We are geographically agnostic and looking at companies all over the world. We are also very conscious to avoid the hype. We have looked at hundreds of deals since we closed the round, and we are extremely thorough with our process and what types of opportunities we’re looking at.

Unshackled Ventures secures another $35M to invest in immigrant founders,Christine Hall,2023/06/27,"
Despite a challenging fundraising environment, venture funds able to prove their thesis are continuing to see interest from limited partners.
Unshackled Ventures is the latest venture capital firm to close on a new fund, its third, with $35 million in capital commitments toward pre-seed investments in immigrant founders. It’s been a while since TechCrunch profiled the firm, founded by Manan Mehta and Nitin Pachisia, and boy has the firm been busy. In addition to deploying over $35 million into 80 companies, Unshackled Ventures has provided over 200 founders with visa sponsorship, immigration support and resources.
When talking about the fundraising environment today versus 2019 when the second fund was announced, Pachisia said it took 18 months to secure capital for the third fund compared to around six months for each of the previous funds. He noted that the environment shifted about halfway after he and Mehta began speaking with LPs “but that it brought us closer to the right kind of LPs that we aligned with.”
Indeed, Fund III more than doubles the firm’s assets under management, Mehta and Pachisia told TechCrunch, and garnered 73% of its funding from institutional investors, including Cambridge Associates, Cendana, Emerson Collective, California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank and Sorenson Impact Advisory.
“A lot of Fund III represents what Fund I was founded for, which are the problems that we faced nine years ago,” Mehta said. “If we provide immigrants with friends-and-family capital support, we believe that we can preserve the American promise and honestly as a venture capital firm, invest in a talent pool that otherwise was overlooked. Immigrants are some of the greatest job creators, and in this country, that’s why we keep on believing as a national advantage, this population is in the American best interest.”

Unshackled Ventures has $20M to invest exclusively in immigrant founders

In 2023, 781,000 foreign workers registered for 85,000 H-1B visa lottery slots, more than double the registrations for the previous year. Unshackled Ventures wants to be able to help more immigrants in this situation, and along with the fund, will begin a program called Eighteen150, a founder-in-residence program, on July 18 to support more immigrant entrepreneurs regardless of their immigration status.
Though Mehta and Pachisia didn’t want to disclose much more on the program just yet, they did say the firm is dedicating $5 million out of Fund III for the program to provide complete immigration and employment support, offering founders $150,000 or 18 months of runway, for 10% ownership.
Meanwhile, Unshackled Ventures has already made 18 investments with Fund III, including Masa Finance, a web3 identify infrastructure layer; Cache Energy, a long-duration energy storage company; and Formally, a generative AI legal tech company.
“The core of it all is backing people when they are ready to jump into their entrepreneurial journeys,” Pachisia said. “One of the trends that we might be bucking a little bit in VC is, as funds get larger, usually investors move later-stage and want to write bigger checks. We’re moving earlier to realize our true advantage lies in that earliest phase of joining the founder when they’re ready to go.”

Y Combinator-backed 0pass seeks to replace passwords in the enterprise,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/27,"
Several years ago, Noah Stanford teamed up with Michael Melone to found 0pass, a startup that aims to make it easier for companies to replace usernames and passwords with biometrics, like Touch ID and Face ID.
Relatively quickly, 0pass gained the attention of investors, including Y Combinator, recently closing a $3.5 million seed round led by Brett Gibson at Initialized Capital with participation from Y Combinator, Box Group, 645 Ventures and angel investors.
Prior to starting 0pass, Stanford joined SpaceX as a security engineer, leading the identity and authentication team. After helping to roll out authentication across SpaceX, he sought to commercialize the tooling he’d built at his previous employer.
“The primary difference between 0pass and other passwordless solutions is that 0pass is able to address passwordless login for all systems under one umbrella rather than just a subset,” Stanford explained. “This means that 0pass is able to handle passwordless login for Windows, Linux, Mac, remote access and websites — fully within the cloud or completely air-gapped.”
0pass’ products, which are available in on-premise and fully managed flavors, enable companies to enroll their employees into hardware authentication devices and biometric authentication such as Windows Hello and Touch ID. The company’s tooling, which uses private keys stored in secure hardware modules, enforces biometrics for access to workstations, apps and web apps and servers — allowing admins to manage authentication methods and tie user identity to security keys.
Image Credits: 0pass
“0pass can integrate with private infrastructure, operating systems, identity providers and any user directories or certificate authorities,” Stanford explained. “Keys are tied to certificates to connect employee identity for authorization.”
0pass competes with a growing number of startups in the passwordless authentication market, which Statista projects will be worth $53.6 billion in 2030. Descope, a “developer-first” authentication and user management platform, recently emerged from stealth with $53 million in funding. There’s also Stytch, an API-first passwordless startup, and Magic, which offers “plug and play,” enterprise-oriented passwordless tech.
Fortunately for 0pass, demand remains strong for passwordless technologies. In a recent survey by Axiad, 82% of respondents — developers and IT and cybersecurity professionals — say that moving to passwordless authentication is in their top five priorities. One motivation? The potential cost savings. According to one source, organizations can save millions by switching to passwordless authentication — thanks to fewer data breaches and password resets, to name a few possible plusses.
As of May 2020, 150 million people were using passwordless logins each month, per a Microsoft report.
“Senior leadership is having to rethink how to secure accounts as traditional methods are repeatedly compromised,” Stanford said. “Taking a completely different approach and changing how every individual at the company logs in is a C-suite directive. Instead of adding more steps and complexity to employee logins, passwordless represents a new paradigm and addresses one of the largest security risks an organization faces.”
0pass moved out of private beta recently, and plans to onboard its first batch of enterprise customers in the coming weeks. Stanford says the company, which has four employees (possibly eight by the end of the year), has at least “several years” of runway, and will spend the proceeds from the round on product development and customer acquisition.

Data security startup Cyera lands a $100M investment,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/27,"
A trend accelerated by the mass move to digital during the pandemic, enterprises are having to handle an increasing amount of proprietary data. According to one survey, the average company deals with 63% growth in data volume per month, with 12% of respondents reporting a whopping 100% growth.
As the amount of data grows, it becomes tougher for organizations to keep track of it — and ensure that it remains secure. Seeking to protect it, Yotam Segev and Tamar Bar-Ilan, who met several years ago in the Israel Defense Forces, co-founded Cyera, a platform intended to provide companies greater visibility over their sensitive data.
Demonstrating the enthusiasm around such solutions, Cyera today closed a $100 million Series B funding round led by Accel, with participation from Sequoia, Cyberstarts and Redpoint Ventures. The round brings Cyera’s total raised to $160 million, which Segev, who serves as Cyera’s CEO, says will be put toward investing in engineering talent and R&D.
The funding is all the more impressive in the context of the broader cybersecurity landscape, which — once bright — has been dimming slightly, at least in terms of the VC investments floating around. Funding for cybersecurity startups dropped 58% in Q1 2023 compared to Q1 2022, with deal flow dipping to 149 deals — the lowest in years and down 45% year-over-year, according to CrunchBase.
“The move to distributed work and software-as-a-service (SaaS) collaboration platforms during the pandemic has accelerated the need for effective data security, and highlighted the shortcomings of legacy solutions to keep pace with data creation, sprawl and evolution in the cloud era,” Segev told TechCrunch in an email interview. “By providing that deep context and understanding of the data a company manages, and providing detailed insight and remediations for security, privacy and compliance exposures, Cyera is revolutionizing data security.”
Cyera falls into the category of platforms known as data security posture management (DSPM), which attempt to abstract away and automate common data detection and protection practices — particularly in the cloud. The past several years have seen a fair number of DSPM startups emerge from stealth, like Laminar Security, Dig Security, Sentra, BigID and Varonis.
The rise has coincided not only with the growth in data under enterprise management, but with the climbing adoption of the cloud and cloud technologies. According to a recent O’Reilly poll, 90% of organizations reported using cloud computing in 2021 — an increase from 88% in 2020. Gartner predicts, meanwhile, that by 2027, more than 50% of enterprises will adopt industry cloud platforms — platforms with features and services tailored to industries such as healthcare, logistics and retail — to accelerate their business initiatives.

So what makes Cyera stand apart from the sea of DSPM vendors out there? Segev asserts that the platform has a wider — and more holistic — focus than most.
“DSPM startups … have limited capabilities,” Segev said. “Legacy vendors attempting to ‘bolt on’ DSPM capability are architecturally flawed and can’t scale the way Cyera does. Cyera has differentiated itself from the slew of DSPM vendors in the space by focusing on an AI-powered data security platform to protect all of a company’s data, everywhere.”
To that end, Cyera leverages an OpenAI large language model (via OpenAI’s API) to deliver context around the data that a company manages. (In recent weeks, Microsoft and Google have similarly launched products that tap language models to help contextualize security issues.) The model can discover, classify and identify different types of data, providing an understanding of what a company’s data represents (e.g. the role is serves and the region where it’s from).
At a higher level, Cyera spotlights exposures, posture issues and risks associated with overly permissive access to data.
A recent addition to the suite, Cyera offers a browser extension that anonymizes sensitive data typed into OpenAI’s AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT — timely in light of company bans of ChatGPT over privacy concerns. SafeType attempts to automatically detect sensitive data in prompts, stopping it (at least in theory) from being sent to ChatGPT.
“We provide complete cloud data security coverage across software-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service and infrastructure-as-a-service environments, with on-prem support coming in 2024,” Segev added. “The result is cloud data security that enables businesses to be more agile and innovative while mitigating risk to reputation, customer loyalty and compliance stemming from data theft.”
Impressively, despite its relatively small (100-person) team, Cyera claims that it’s managed to gain “strong traction” among the S&P 500 in the two years since it launched. Cyera secured “double digit” new customers in Q4 2022 alone and an astounding 800% in revenue growth in 2022.
By the end of the year, Segev expects that the staff will grow to 150 people.
“Cyera’s agentless technology and novel technical innovations to streamline and accelerate data store inventory creation and data classification ensure that businesses will have the confidence that they always know what data they have, where it is located and what it represents,” Segev said. “Because Cyera’s process is automatic and continuous, security teams are empowered with up-to-date context and understanding of sensitive data exposure, as well as insight into how to best partner with the business to address and remediate risk.”

Socure acquires identity verification startup Berbix for $70M,Frederic Lardinois,2023/06/27,"
Socure, the identity verification service that raised a massive $450 million Series E round at a $4.5 billion valuation during the heady fundraising days of late 2021 (and $100 million earlier in 2021), today announced that it has acquired identity verification service Berbix for $70 million in cash and stock transactions. Berbix previously raised a total of $11.6 million, including a $9 million Series A round led by Mayfield in 2020.
This marks Socure’s first acquisition.
Founded in 2018, Berbix focuses on verifying users’ identities by checking scanned IDs in real time. Using its patent-pending forensics engine, Berbix can help businesses detect fake IDs to reduce fraud and ensure compliance with local regulations.
Socure’s platform, meanwhile, takes a slightly broader and multi-dimensional approach that includes both active and passive means to deter fraud in a wide range of sectors, ranging from e-commerce to healthcare.
“From a product perspective, Socure is moving with a high velocity into new markets and new geographies, covering e-commerce marketplaces, gig economy, public sector and healthcare, among others,” Socure founder and CEO Johnny Ayers said. “We are finding repeatedly that there is a need for best-in-class active and passive — documentary and non-documentary — identity verification and fraud controls to solve very complex fraud and customer acquisition challenges.”
He noted that Socure’s customers are asking for the ability to check IDs online that, combined with the company’s existing tools, can help them ensure that, for example, a driver applying to a grocery delivery service is who they say they are.
“Our combined solution is easily quantifiable in terms of speed, accuracy and fraud capture which equate to immediate revenue lift and spend reduction,” said Ayers.
He also noted that Socure is in a good position to make an acquisition like this. He noted that Socure’s revenue grew over 50% in 2022, all while other companies in the space were flat to down. “We are looking to be offensive where it makes sense,” he said. “There are a number of companies that made some very interesting investments in innovation in the past couple of years, but unfortunately don’t have the runway or access to capital to continue independently. It makes sense to continue assessing what is in the market.”
Socure already integrated Berbix in its existing Predictive Document Verification service, which is launching version 3.0 today. The updated service combines Berbix’s forensics engine for spotting fake IDs with Socure’s image capture app and user experience. The company notes that while users can use the document verification service as a stand-alone application, it’s also integrated into the overall Socure platform.
This acquisition is part of a wider trend we’ve been seeing, with well-funded startups capitalizing on their ability to acquire companies that may have a hard time raising the next funding round and/or justifying their previous valuations.
“The cost of capital in the last 18 months for most companies has gone from single digit to 20-30% or more, which we expect will mean a lot of really great assets are coming to market trying to find a home in the winner in a given space,” said Ayers. “We are seeing that every venture fund is bucketing their portfolio into categories of ‘great,’ ‘good,’ ‘ok’ or ‘not good’ — and anything that’s good or less, they’re going to be more open to trade previously overpriced private stock to a much higher quality stock with higher upside and shorter-term liquidity within the winner of a market. We expect there to be individual point solutions that are just never going to get big enough to be a long-term independent company.”

"Zenarate, an AI-powered agent coaching platform, raises $15M",Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/27,"
While running a 5,000-agent contact center, Brian Tuite often experienced the problem of having to train new agents on the basics. The way he tells it, they weren’t prepared for success — and drained the contact center’s resources.
That gave Tuite the idea of creating what he describes as “simulation training” for customer service agents. After pitching it to Rab Govil, he and Govil decided to turn the concept into a company — Zenarate.
“Zenarate is an AI simulation training platform,” Tuite explained to me in an email interview. “It’s a ‘flight simulator’ for customer and prospect-facing agents, where agents in training are immersed in life-like conversation, screen and chat simulations to master high-impact topics they’ll face with live customers and prospects.”
Using Zenarate’s AWS-hosted platform, service agents engage with an “AI coach” that gives them feedback on their tone and soft skills — making suggestions where appropriate. Agents get a scorecard showing that they’ve mastered certain areas and met baseline requirements, like transitioning from service to sales, juggling multiple chats at once and addressing a customer by name.
The AI coach can present random call scenarios, forcing agents to think on their feet. Or customer service managers can assign particular scenarios to particular agents and teams.
“There’s no IT integration for agents to roleplay with the AI coach from the home or office,” Tuite said, touting what he sees as the benefits of Zenarate’s platform. “The only IT requirements are a Chrome or Edge browser and a headset. And there’s no personal or account information for testing or implementation, as all the content is fictitious training data.”
Of course, Zenarate isn’t particularly unique in the market for sales and agent training software — a market that Polaris Research predicts will be worth $7.74 billion by 2032. Rival Vervoe similarly provides “AI-powered” software that agents can use to prep for different types of live calls. So does Second Nature, which attracted an investment from Zoom’s Apps Fund early last year.
I’m also wary of the ways in which companies like Zenarate apply AI, which could open the door to bias — intentional or no. For example, studies have shown that some AI trained to detect toxicity sees phrases in African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) — the informal grammar used by some Black Americans — as disproportionately “toxic.” It’s not tough to imagine a scenario in which a Black customer service agent repeatedly scores lower than a white agent on a certification test because of the vernacular they use. (No need to imagine; it happens.)
Zenarate claims that its AI isn’t biased. But beyond assuring me that the platform’s AI models are trained with each client’s “best and required practice” data and that clients are charged with overseeing the model training, Tuite didn’t offer much in the way of details about Zenarate’s bias mitigation measures — assuming that it takes any.

If investors share these concerns, they aren’t showing it. Zenarate today announced that it raised $15 million in a funding round led by Volition Capital with participation from a number of undisclosed angel investors.
According to Volition’s Sean Cantwell, Zenarate’s positive unit economics were the winning factor; annual recurring revenue is sitting at “double digits,” currently, driven by an over-80-company-strong customer base with “over a million” users.
“There’s a significant growth opportunity to disrupt legacy passive training methods with the power of simulation training,” Cantwell added. “AI-powered simulation is the new standard in customer service and sales training, and Zenarate is leading the trend.”
Palo Alto-based Zenarate plans to spend the bulk of the new capital — which brings its total capital raised to $18 million — on expanding its workforce from 92 employees to 110 by the end of the year.

Redpanda nabs $100M Series C as streaming service experiences significant growth,Ron Miller,2023/06/27,"
Redpanda helps companies capture data in real time in a modern context, providing a new way to stream data while maintaining backwards compatibility with Kafka, the popular open source streaming project.
Today, the company announced a $100 million Series C, just 16 months after announcing a $50 million Series B. This kind of trajectory was common a couple of years ago, but seeing a company raise $150 million in such a quick succession these days has become far more rare.
CEO Alex Gallego says the company has been performing so well that existing investors stepped up with the additional investment, seizing the opportunity to capitalize on the startup’s startling growth.
“We’re basically oversubscribed on this round, and I know you mentioned that in this climate, it’s been hard to raise money, but the reason for this is that we quintupled our revenue last year and doubled the size of the company — and we literally haven’t lost the deal in seven months against all the competitors,” Gallego told TechCrunch.
At the time of the Series B, Gallego described the appeal of the product his startup has created this way:
“What’s happened in the market is that streaming is now the foundational part of how to build new modern applications. It sits as the bottom layer on which to build new applications. And for that you need unification, and what I mean by that is you need limitless data retention. And so that feature alone actually changed how the market perceived and how developers think about real-time data.”
He says that it turned out that this idea has resonated with the market, perhaps even better than he envisioned when he launched the company in 2019. “We’re one of the few technologies where the CIO looks great, because they cut their bill in half, developers love the technology and there’s basically zero cost to migrate from Kafka into Redpanda,” he said.
He says as the company has been growing so quickly, he needs the capital infusion to begin to expand in three areas, including go-to-market, scaling to meet the needs of larger customers and customer support. What’s more, the infinite data retention that the platform allows becomes more important as companies are building large language models, which has also pushed the company’s growth.
Customers currently include Cisco, Akamai, Lacework and Vodafone, among others.
The company had around 60 employees in February 2022. Today, it has 160 and is actively hiring, according to Gallego. He says as a Latino leader, he is cognizant of the need to build a diverse workforce and is working to do so as he scales the company, starting with the leadership team and working from there.
Today’s round was led by a trio of returning investors: Lightspeed Venture Partners, GV and Haystack VC.

CalypsoAI raises $23M to add guardrails to generative AI models,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/27,"
Companies are increasingly embracing generative AI. But they’re not necessarily considering all the blockers and challenges that come along with folding the tech into their existing workflows.
In one recent survey by KPMG, 90% of businesses said that they had “moderate to highly significant” concerns about the risks of using generative AI and doubts about how to mitigate those risks. Only 6%, meanwhile, said that they felt that their company had a mature AI governance program in place.
It’s partly for these reasons that Neil Serebryany founded CalypsoAI, a startup developing software to test, validate and monitor internally developed as well as third-party AI apps prior to their deployment.
“CalypsoAI’s platform promotes the power and competitive advantage that using AI can bring but within a safe, secure and reliable way,” Serebryany told TechCrunch in an email interview.
That’s setting the bar high. But investors evidently believe in CalypsoAI’s ability to deliver. The startup today announced that it raised $23 million in a Series A-1 round led by Paladin Capital Group with participation from Lockheed Martin Ventures, Hakluyt Capital and Expeditions Fund.
Notable angels contributed to the A-1 tranche as well, including former YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki and her sister, 23andMe co-founder Anne Wojcicki. To date, CalypsoAI has raised $38.2 million.
CalypsoAI claims that its tools — deployed as a container within an organization’s infrastructure — allow businesses to monitor and shape the usage of large language models such as ChatGPT via dashboards that show stats related to the toxicity of the models, user engagement and more. Serebryany says that CalypsoAI can prevent sensitive company data from being shared on models while identifying attacks coming from generative AI tools.
“While every company wants to reap the benefits of generative AI solutions — namely the clear productivity gains — they also want to make sure they aren’t subject to cyberattacks and that employees don’t expose sensitive information to public models,” Serebryany added. “By implementing CalypsoAI, CISOs and IT leaders can start to seriously consider implementing generative AI solutions across their organizations in a safe and secure manner — allowing them to introduce efficiencies into their business without the added risk.”
Certainly, there’s demand in the corporate sector for some sort of generative AI guardrail solution. Out of fear that employees might accidentally expose proprietary info, companies including Apple, JPMorgan Chase and Verizon have banned or restricted the use of ChatGPT-like tools internally. Many of these same companies are wary of generative AI’s toxicity and misinformation issues, which continue to plague even the best models available today.
The industry, eyeing the huge potential addressable market, has risen to meet the demand. Microsoft offers the Azure OpenAI Service, which provides governance and compliance capabilities on top of generative AI models from OpenAI, including ChatGPT. Elsewhere, Salesforce recently launched the Einstein Trust Layer, which attempts to prevent text-generating models from retaining sensitive data.
How well these guardrails work in practice is an open question, however. Putting one vendor’s claims into question, researchers recently uncovered flaws in NeMo Guardrails, Nvidia’s toolkit aimed at making AI-powered apps more accurate and secure, that allows the toolkit’s protections to be bypassed.
Serebryany insisted — for what it’s worth — that CalypsoAI’s products are robust to attack. In the same breath, he stressed that CalypsoAI doesn’t hold any data from its customers, instead only facilitating the info flow from employees into the model of a company’s choice.
“Securing LLMs in the enterprise has become a critical venture, which has led to CalypsoAI’s strategic shift to address the needs of enterprises looking to use AI solutions,” Serebryany said. “With many organizations looking to securely use generative AI solutions to propel their business forward, CalypsoAI feels confident about our ability to develop the best possible product and attract the best talent to secure enterprise organizations.”
Serebryany says that CalypsoAI will use the funding from the latest tranche to drive product development, hiring and the company’s go-to-market initiatives. CalypsoAI’s current headcount stands at 35 employees, and the startup recently opened an office in Dublin — a part of CalypsoAI’s plan to double its workforce over the next two years.
“As our company continues to grow and expand, we recognize the value of bringing on new investors to support our growth,” he continued. “By partnering with investors who share our vision and goals, we can continue to innovate and drive our business forward.”

Faros AI raises $20M to bring visibility to software engineering teams,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/27,"
Three years ago, Vitaly Gordon, one of the founding members of Salesforce’s Einstein research division, started Faros AI, a platform for software engineers designed to bring key operational data into one place. Alongside Shubha Nabar and Matthew Tovbin, two fellow ex-Salesforce employees and Einstein co-founders, Gordon sought to help developers better navigate common workflow challenges by shining a light on top bottlenecks.
“Our background was in building machine learning products and engineering teams, and we were motivated by our frustration with the black-box that was engineering operations,” Gordon told TechCrunch via email. “We found that while we were helping Salesforce customers harness AI to improve business outcomes, our visibility and insight into our own engineering processes was sorely lacking. And it wasn’t just us. Most sizable software engineering organizations today are largely flying blind.”
Word spread — and investors flocked. Faros today announced it raised $20 million in a Series A funding round led by Lobby Capital with participation from SignalFire, Salesforce Ventures and Operator Collective. Gordon says that the round, which brings Faros’ total raised to $36 million, will be put toward bolstering Faros’ go-to-market strategy, R&D and customer success initiatives.

According to Gordon, Faros “hadn’t touched” most of the cash from its previous fundraise. But the company ended up hitting milestones sooner than expected, tripling its customer base and quadrupling revenue over the past 12 months.
“Given the unprecedented opportunity to tap top talent and expand our go-to-market footprint, while everyone else is cutting costs and scaling back, we decided to move forward and raise additional capital,” Gordon said.
Faros as it exists today aims to provide a “single-pane” view across a software engineering team’s work, goals and velocity. Customers can connect various data sources to the platform, starting with out-of-the-box modules and benchmarks and then customizing and building their own analytics.
The idea behind Faros is to allow engineers, engineering team managers and the C-suite to measure an organization’s health and tech debt, as well as things like the dependencies between departments and bottlenecks in processes. The platform can break down time spent on feature development versus tech debt and measure the efficacy of onboarding processes, Gordon points out — plus track seniority and tenure by team, location and other dimensions.
“Software is eating the world and engineering becomes the highest budget item for every company,” Gordon said. “With Faros AI, companies no longer have to fly blind and teams can do more with less.”
I can’t speak to Faros’ effectiveness. But there’s some evidence to suggest that today’s software engineering teams do, indeed, lack visibility, to Gordon’s larger point.
Engineering management platform Jellyfish — not the most unbiased of sources in this area, granted — found in a recent survey that engineering and technical leaders underestimate the amount of time their teams end up spending on unplanned work by 81%. According to the same survey — which, again, must be taken with a grain of salt — teams using engineering management platforms dedicate 25% more time to innovation while spending 18% less time on customer support issues and bugs.
Another look at Faros’ platform capabilities. Image Credits: Faros
“While every tech company is seriously affected by the current market conditions, we are experiencing significant tailwinds from companies exploring how they can do more with less, and shifting their engineering resources to core functionality while looking to partner with vendors that can offload this undifferentiated work,” Gordon said.
A portion of the funding from Faros’ recent tranche will support the rollout of Lighthouse AI, Faros’ newly unveiled AI engine that allows users to gather insights about engineering operations from disparate systems — tapping natural language for data analysis. Gordon sees it as the natural evolution of Faros’ platform, enabling engineers to make sense of the vast amounts of data that their organizations generate each day.
“The AI revolution has only just begun,” Gordon said. “We anticipate that every aspect of software engineering is going to be transformed by AI in the next five years, and at Faros, we are making sure that operational intelligence keeps pace, allowing engineering organizations to make that transition with confidence.”
Faros currently has 35 employees and anticipates that number doubling in the next 12 months.

ShopZetu raises pre-seed funding to fuel growth of its fashion marketplace beyond Kenya,Annie Njanja,2023/06/27,"
Kenyan fashion e-commerce startup ShopZetu is set to add beauty and home décor categories to its portfolio, in response to the growing needs of the young and style-conscious women in Africa. This is as it currently scales regionally over the next few months while working to attract international fashion brands, and more than triple the number of vendors on its platform to 1,000.
The startup plans to trial regional delivery services in Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, scaling beyond Kenya, where it launched in 2021, on the backing of a $1 million pre-seed funding it has just closed.
“The goal is for ShopZetu to become the leading lifestyle platform. We are looking to expand our beauty, skincare, hair and home décor offerings, which are all expressions of one’s identity. We want to become a one-stop shop,” said Marvin Kiragu, ShopZetu CEO, who co-founded the startup with Wandia Gichuru, also co-founder of the popular Kenyan fashion brand Vivo.
The pre-seed round was led by Chui Ventures, with participation from Launch Africa, Roselake Ventures and Logos Ventures. Angel investors that took part in the round include Kendall Tang, the CEO of RT Knits; Ben Munoz, the co-founder and CEO of Nadine West; Sumit Bhasin of Estée Lauder Inc.; Patricia Ithau, the CEO of WPP Scangroup; and Peter Njonjo, the co-founder and CEO of Twiga Foods.

Jendaya raises funding to scale its Africa-focused luxury e-commerce platform

Kiragu told TechCrunch that ShopZetu was born out of the need for a multibrand marketplace to bridge a highly fragmented industry that has “hundreds of thousands of sellers” offline and online including on Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp. This, he noted, makes the shopping process cumbersome, lacking price visibility and customer trust.
He added that the infinite number of possible stock-keeping units makes it nearly impossible for any one player to house the available assortment under one physical location.
“ShopZetu seeks to solve this problem by aggregating the available supply of fashion and lifestyle products under one roof,” he said.
ShopZetu’s over 300 vendors, mainly made up of large and small local manufacturers, and traders of imported fashion products, have currently listed more than 20,000 products on the ShopZetu marketplace. Vendor onboarding is free, however, they pay a commission for sales generated on the platform, and for other additional services, including delivery.
“We also offer vendors a variety of services such as content, digital marketing, warehousing, last-mile delivery and returns management. These services are offered at a cost but are largely subsidized to ensure vendor success online,” said Kiragu.
“Our goal is to lower the barrier for anyone to start and scale a fashion brand leveraging ShopZetu’s reach and resources. We have good case studies of brands incubated and launched on ShopZetu and then go on to scale online and establish physical stores,” he said.
The startup requires vendors selling on the marketplace to, amongst other conditions, be well stocked, have high-quality products and inclusive-sizing.
The startup says it has in the past two years served over 30,000 customers, and sold more than 100,000 products, while achieving over 400% increase in monthly orders since January 2021.
ShopZetu says it is eyeing the growing fashion industry in sub-Saharan Africa, which is currently dominated by second-hand clothing. However, startups like ShopZetu are banking their growth on affordable new clothing options, and the growing fashion-conscious, tech savvy population in Africa.
“We believe the market for fashion is huge as clothing is a basic human need. While a big percentage of this is currently serviced by secondhand clothing, we are seeing a gradual shift to new clothing as more affordable options are introduced into the market,” said Kiragu.
“We believe that online fashion retail will leapfrog formal retail and become the largest e-commerce category in Africa.”

Dust uses large language models on internal data to improve team productivity,Romain Dillet,2023/06/27,"
Dust is a new AI startup based in France that is working on improving team productivity by breaking down internal silos, surfacing important knowledge and providing tools to build custom internal apps. At its core, Dust is using large language models (LLMs) on internal company data to give new superpowers to team members.
The company was co-founded by Gabriel Hubert and Stanislas Polu, who have known each other for more than a decade. Their first startup was called Totems and was acquired by Stripe in 2015. After that, they both spent a few years working for Stripe before parting ways.
Stanislas Polu joined OpenAI, where he spent three years working on LLMs’ reasoning capabilities while Gabriel Hubert became the head of product at Alan.
They teamed up once again to create Dust. Unlike many AI startups, Dust isn’t focused on creating new large language models. Instead, the company wants to build applications on top of LLMs developed by OpenAI, Cohere, AI21, etc.
The team first worked on a platform that can be used to design and deploy large language model apps. It has then focused its efforts on one use case in particular — centralizing and indexing internal data so that it can be used by LLMs.
From an internal ChatGPT to next-gen software
There are a handful of connectors that constantly fetch internal data from Notion, Slack, GitHub and Google Drive. This data is then indexed and can be used for semantic search queries. When a user wants to do something with a Dust-powered app, Dust will find the relevant internal data, use it as the context of an LLM and return an answer.
For example, let’s say you just joined a company and you’re working on a project that was started a while back. If your company fosters communication transparency, you will want to find information in existing internal data. But the internal knowledge base might not be up to date. Or it might be hard to find the reason why something is done this way, as it’s been discussed in an archived Slack channel.
Dust isn’t just a better internal search tool, as it doesn’t just return search results. It can find information across multiple data sources and format answers in a way that is much more useful to you. It can be used as a sort of internal ChatGPT, but it could also be used as the basis of new internal tools.
“We’re convinced that natural language interface is going to disrupt software,” Gabriel Hubert told me. “In five years’ time, it would be disappointing if you still have to go and click on edit, settings, preferences, to decide that your software should behave differently. We see a lot more of our software adapting to your individual needs, because that’s the way you are, but also because that’s the way your team is — because that’s the way your company is.”
The company is working with design partners on several ways to implement and package the Dust platform. “We think there are a lot of different products that can be created in this area of enterprise data, knowledge workers and models that could be used to support them,” Polu told me.
It’s still early days for Dust, but the startup is exploring an interesting problem. There are many challenges ahead when it comes to data retention, hallucination and all of the issues that come with LLMs. Maybe hallucination will become less of an issue as LLMs evolve. Maybe Dust will end up creating its own LLM for data privacy reasons.
Dust has raised $5.5 million (€5 million) in a seed round led by Sequoia with XYZ, GG1, Seedcamp, Connect, Motier Ventures, Tiny Supercomputer, and AI Grant. Several business angels also participated, such as Olivier Pomel from Datadog, Julien Codorniou, Julien Chaumond from Hugging Face, Mathilde Collin from Front, Charles Gorintin and Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve from Alan, Eléonore Crespo and Romain Niccoli from Pigment, Nicolas Brusson from BlaBlaCar, Howie Liu from Airtable, Matthieu Rouif from PhotoRoom, Igor Babuschkin and Irwan Bello.
If you take a step back, Dust is betting that LLMs will greatly change how companies work. A product like Dust works even better in a company that fosters radical transparency instead of information retention, written communication instead of endless meetings, autonomy instead of top-down management.
If LLMs deliver on their promise and greatly improve productivity, some companies will gain an unfair advantage by adopting these values as Dust will unlock a lot of untapped potential for knowledge workers.

Dexory nabs $19M to bring visibility to warehouses through analytics and autonomous robots,Paul Sawers,2023/06/27,"
Dexory, a company that serves warehouses with real-time inventory management data using AI software and autonomous robots, has raised $19 million in a Series A round of funding led by European VC Atomico.
Founded in London in 2015, Dexory’s product can be split into two segments. On the hardware side, the company develops robots replete with sensors and cameras to capture data as they traverse a particular warehouse, taking continuous photos of racks as they move at something akin to normal walking speed (e.g., a half-meter/second). The robots capture 3D scans of the site, which can give insights into things like dimensions, shapes and sizes, and volumes of goods sitting on shelves.
Dexory then uses computer vision and machine learning to process the captured data, while tying it to the physical location of the stock but inside a digital twin — that is, a complete virtual equivalent of its real-world counterpart.
“The robots can be deployed multiple times a day or once a day around their shift patterns, including overnight,” Dexory co-founder and CEO Andrei Danescu told TechCrunch over email. “The collection of data insights over a short space of time, all the time, allows analysis for identifying issues on-the-spot and decision making in driving warehouse operational efficiencies.”

Dexory says that its customers use its platform for any number of use cases, such as carrying out autonomous stock checks throughout the day, reducing the need for labor-intensive manual inventory counts. This can also be helpful for solving some of the common warehouse pain points, such as identifying misplaced pallets or other goods that have gone AWOL.
Instinctively, this will never be a perfect solution in every scenario, as it surely isn’t possible to see every item on a shelf, particularly if they’re stacked in rows or located high on shelves. But Danescu reckons that it will go most of the way toward solving at least some of the stock-check problems.
“If the goods are behind one another, the solution might not be able to identify exactly what the goods are — no label to read means nothing to identify of course,” Danescu said. “But due to the 3D scans, it will let the operators know that something else is there, and show them a picture of what that is, solving more than 80% of the problem.”
Moreover, stock checks aren’t the entire purpose for Dexory’s platform. It can also be used to keep tabs on space optimization — for instance, where there may be large gaps with nothing in it. Or it could be used to forecast capacity, or even as part of a company’s safety regulation compliance workflow, where it can spot any dangerous situations arising.
While there are countless robotics companies already infiltrating the retail sphere with similar smarts, including the likes of Bossa Nova, Simbe, and Zippedi, Danescu says they’re setting out to differentiate from the pack through its focus on larger warehouse-style environments, rather than retail stores — its robots can scan up to 15 meters (50 feet) high by physically expanding.
“We have new solutions on the roadmap to go beyond that (19–20m-plus), but that’s barely 2–3% of the market,” Danescu said.

Scaling
For now, Dexory operates in the U.K. and Ireland across the logistics and supply chain sectors; air cargo; retail and e-commerce; and manufacturing, with clients such as Menzies Aviation; Denso Manufacturing U.K., Huboo, and Maersk. Indeed, today’s news comes a week after Maersk revealed it was extending its partnership with Dexory to include more warehouses in the U.K. and Ireland area, after entering into an initial proof-of-concept partnership back in January shortly after Dexory had rebranded from BotsAndUs.
With its fresh cash injection, Dexory has now raised a total of $37.9 million across its various rounds, and it’s planning to scale its platform into new markets, including the U.S., Germany, and the Netherlands.
Aside from lead investor Atomico, Dexory’s Series A round included participation from early Facebook and Spotify investor Lakestar; Maersk Growth, the investment arm of Danish shipping and logistics giant (and Dexory customer) Maersk; London-based early-stage VC Kindred Capital; and Capnamic.

DePoly keeps hard-to-recycle plastic from ending up in landfills,Catherine Shu,2023/06/26,"
About 400 million tons of plastic are produced each year, but less than 10% is recycled, with most of the rest ending up incinerated or in landfills. One reason is that it is difficult for conventional recycling processes to handle contaminated plastics, like those that are made up of several different types of plastics, combined with other materials or those that are just plain dirty. DePoly, a deep tech startup, has developed a process that is able to tackle complex plastic streams and turn plastics back into raw material without affecting quality. The Swiss-based startup announced today it has raised $13.8 million in seed funding.
The round was co-led by BASF Venture Capital and Wingman Ventures, with participation from other investors like Beiersdorf, Infinity Recycling, CIECH Ventures and Angel Invest.
DePoly’s chemical recycling tech converts all PET plastics and polyester textiles back into their main raw chemical components, which are then sold back to the industry to make new items. DePoly says items made from its raw material are virgin quality.
The company currently operates a pilot plant that can process 50 tons per year of complex PET or polyester plastic streams. It serves such industries as post-consumer packaging, textiles, fashion and post-industrial streams. DePoly is building a showcase plant with a capacity of 500 tons to demonstrate its tech at commercial scale, and it already has five customers, ranging from fast-fashion brands, to sporting good brands and packaging users to resin producers.
DePoly was founded in 2020 by CEO Samantha Anderson, CTO Bardiya Valizadeh and CSO Christopher Ireland, and now has a team of 13 people. In the years before launching DePoly, the three moved to Switzerland to work on their PhDs and post-docs. Anderson told TechCrunch that there were a lot of articles being published about issues like microplastics in people, growing plastic patches in the ocean and animals washing up on shore with microplastics in their stomachs.

“For us, all this was quite alarming, particularly that companies seemed not to care about solving the problem now, not in 10 to 15 years,” Anderson said. “So we decided that we wanted to tackle the plastic problem, using chemistry and the skills we had developed during our degrees, with the aim of if we could make it work, to spin a company out and tackle the problem faster than others were moving.”
Conventional plastic recycling means things like bottles and food packaging made of PET and other plastics are brought to a recycling facility, then sorted into colors, cleaned, melted and turned into rPET pellets. But if they are too dirty, mixed with other plastics or in fabric or fiber form, they usually get incinerated or dumped into a landfill, Anderson said. There are also limits to what can be recycled because of health and food safety standards, which means the majority of plastic produced is destroyed or thrown away, and new plastic has to be made from crude oil.
DePloy’s chemical recycling tech operates at room temperature and standard pressure and does not need plastics and materials to be washed, pre-sorted, pre-melted or separated. This means it can be used to recycle PET and polyester materials that don’t make it into conventional recycling systems, including mixed plastics, mixed colors, dirty plastic waste streams, fabrics and fibers. PET is converted back into PTA and MEG, its original two monomers.
Anderson explained that DePoly has a B2B model, connecting users of complex plastic waste, like blended polyesters, multilayered PET items or PET items that are too dirty or chemically contaminated to be introduced into the mechanical recycling process, with people who produce virgin-quality PET items from oil because of limited accessibility to sustainable chemicals like PTA and MEG. DePoly’s tech allows one side to get rid of PET and other plastic waste, and the other side (or the producers) to have access to the original, sustainable chemicals that make up those items, creating a circular economy for plastics.
DePoly can also do content recovery. For example, it can recover PP or cotton from PP/PET combos or cotton/polyester blends. Anderson said this is because of the low temperature of its system, because it doesn’t melt polymers. The startup is also scaling tech for polyurethanes (PU), polylactic acid (PLA) and similar polymers like PBT.
As an example of how DePoly’s chemical recycling process has been used, Anderson said it’s worked with customers in the sporting goods industry that have polyurethane blended polyester items. The polyurethane content means those items would usually be discarded, but DePoly is able to fully recycle them and is now scaling its tech to recover the polyurethane portion.
Anderson cites startups Carbios, Gr3n and Ioniqa as other companies that are doing similar work with plastics, and says she thinks “the tech they’ve developed is really neat.” The main way DePoly differentiates itself is the reaction that occurs during its recycling process, the product output in Ioniqa’s case, the temperature required for the reaction and the contamination threshold allowed. “In our case, we’re lower temperature, produce the same monomers that make up PET and to our understanding have a higher contamination threshold versus others.”
In a statement about the investment, Wingman Ventures principal Antonia Albert said, “We are extremely proud to support DePoly since day one on their journey to tackle this planetary crisis to clean our oceans and landfills from plastic waste and to welcome leading investors from the chemicals, recycling, climate- and deep tech space on board to build the global leader for the sustainable plastics recycling.”

Supply chain startup Baskit supports Indonesia’s middlemen,Catherine Shu,2023/06/26,"
Large brand distributors dominate the top of the supply chain, but toward the bottom, there are thousands of middlemen, including wholesalers, who are the ones creating relationships with retailers. Founded last year, Baskit wants to provide them with tools to digitize the management of their inventory and services to help them get better prices. The Indonesia-based startup announced today it has raised $3.3 million for its seed round, from investors including Betatron, Forge, 1982, Investible, DS/X, Orvel and Michael Sampoerna. This follows a $1.5 million seed round three months ago.
Founder Yann Schuermans said he is a “very big believer in the space. Supply chains are fundamental to the economies of every major economy in Southeast Asia, as anywhere from 40% to 50% of their GDP are dependent on supply chains. Eventually they have to modernize and digitize.”
Baskit currently works with more than 50 wholesalers, predominantly in West Java. Schuermans noted that supply chains in emerging markets are very fragmented, especially in Indonesia, which has a complicated geography with thousands of islands. As a result, a supply chain is not as simple as getting goods from point A to point B. Middlemen are necessary, he said, because supply chains start with a manufacturer and distributors, then the smaller distributors and wholesalers who sell to retailers.
“All of these guys in the middle are so critical with their relationships and connectivity to their communities,” he added. “Their kids go to school with the kids of shop owners who are buying their product.”
Wholesalers often don’t have exclusivity to brands, operating more like traders by buying products they can sell at higher prices. Instead of striving to cut out the role of middlemen from supply chains, Baskit provides them with several layers of tools to grow their businesses. This includes software that helps them digitize their operations and bring inventory online.

Schuermans said Baskit differentiates from other supply chain startups because those often focus on creating ERP software for the upper enterprise part of supply chains, like big brand distributors who do tens of millions of dollars a month in turnover. In contrast, Baskit’s software helps middlemen by organizing their warehouses and inventory, giving them visibility into pricing, missing goods or items that are aging. Then their inventory is connected to an ordering system, so customers who were previously buying goods through offline processes can do so online through a catalog.
Baskit also offers customer service that helps wholesalers source better products and pricing from manufacturers.
“The best way to describe our business is a hybrid between software digitization partner, but with a very commercial kind of service provider angle where we provide in that respect, we almost look like a marketplace,” Schuermans said. “We help to connect the buyers and sellers, but it’s a very tightly managed marketplace.” Ultimately, Baskit’s goal is to make the middlemen in supply chains more attractive partners to the organizations at the top, including big manufacturers and brand owners.
“Inventory is the gold standard here, because when I have the data, I have information on pricing, I know how much product there is available. I know what products are moving fast. That is the centerpiece to our entire stack. Once we have inventory visibility, we can do a lot of magic in how we help them sell, but also in helping that wholesaler optimize their margins,” he added. This is important because wholesalers often operate on thin margins of 3% to 7%, and are also dealing with inflation. By helping middlemen get a handle on their inventory, Baskit is also able to help them decide what suppliers to purchase from and price it correctly for the people they are selling goods to.
Baskit also offers financing services to middlemen, who often struggle to get working capital from traditional financial institutions. It is able to do so because its software has data on how much turnover a business has, and how much money is going and coming in. Baskit is currently working with several P2P lenders, and some traditional banks, including one of which is on its cap table.
Baskit’s plan is to expand into more cities, with the goal of reaching double-digit penetration of the wholesaler base in each one, which Schuermans says will make it an indispensable player. “That gives us a very broad distribution because these 50 wholesalers can cover the entire territory and it also gives us access to a very important supply base, a share of wallet. It’s interesting how very few suppliers, very few wholesalers, can do so much in covering the overall needs of retailers that they serve.”

SignalFire’s State of Talent report 2023,Heather Doshay,2023/06/26,"

Heather Doshay is partner, People + Talent, at early-stage venture firm SignalFire, where she leads recruiting programs for the portfolio and advises founders on applying the firm's Beacon AI for hiring. She's spent 15+ years as a people and talent executive at Webflow, RainforestQA and Hired.	

The era of tech giants overstaffing and overpaying has ended, at least for now. But talent is flooding the market, and those still employed have been left to shoulder all the work — there’s a huge opportunity for savvy recruiters to scoop up top performers.
Today’s job market is a confusing paradox. While unemployment is at a record low and there’s a labor shortage in healthcare and hospitality, tech has seen nonstop layoffs that hit 166,044 workers in Q1 2023 alone. That’s more than all of 2022’s then-record 161,411 tech layoffs.
What’s most unprecedented is that these layoffs are hitting software engineers, including top talent at FAANG companies that were previously considered untouchable. This is in sharp contrast to the 2008 recession, when the U.S. high-tech industry gained about 77,000 jobs in Q4, most in software development, despite the overall U.S. labor market losing 38,000 jobs.

The reversal of fortunes for engineers is particularly brutal coming off of 2021’s startup fundraising boom and relentless optimism. Companies preempted growth with hiring sprees far ahead of their metrics in hopes of continued growth.
But by the summer of 2022, the Great Resignation and “quiet quitting” gave way to mass layoffs by four of the big five in tech — Meta (Facebook), Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet (Google), known as FAANG. All but Apple made sizable cuts, including deeper cuts for software developers.

Executive summary
SignalFire’s State of Talent Report explores macro conditions and top-talent movement trends in tech to identify practical strategies for winning in the current hiring market. Top findings include:

Hiring power is shifting to startups as post-pandemic layoffs and budget cuts cause a “Great Restart” of compensation norms at Big Tech companies that can no longer overpay to win the best talent.
An unprecedented 166,000 tech layoffs happened in Q1 2023 — more than in all of 2022 — and included formerly untouchable software engineers.
Big Tech talent has flooded the market — 69% of FAANG engineers who were laid off or left after May 15, 2022 still listed no current job as of March 15, 2023.
28% of rehired FAANG engineers played musical chairs and switched to another tech giant, while 6% went to early-stage startups — an 82% increase over 2021.
Startups can capitalize on this power shift by recruiting passive talent who have survived Big Tech layoffs — they’re often loyal top performers who are overworked after teammates were cut.
SignalFire can help startups find and hire top passive talent with its Beacon AI engine and recruiting team.

Mass layoffs and the “Great Restart”
To explain the tech talent market’s sudden implosion, here’s the timeline that led to an imbalance in talent supply and demand.
 

			Tech has seen nonstop layoffs that hit 166,044 workers in Q1 2023 alone. That’s more than all of 2022’s then-record 161,411 tech layoffs.					



The 2020 pandemic accelerated the move of commerce, collaboration and entertainment online, causing a boom for many tech companies through 2021.
Hiring accelerated in 2021, creating a candidate-centric market that, coupled with the Great Resignation, drove many companies to use above-market compensation to attract and retain top talent.
Entering 2022, the cost to do business in general steadily began to rise with inflation, coupled with a return to in-person activities, disrupting demand for online services that had fueled pandemic tech growth.
Midyear 2022, tech valuations and cryptocurrency prices recalibrated down.
Ambitious hiring ahead had been a strategic lever to hit ambitious revenue targets, and as those targets were missed, both public and private companies adjusted to decrease burn and extend their runway.

The result: Companies chose to equalize the decreased demand for their products and services by reducing their workforce. Notably, top engineers were not spared.

In this report, we share a data-based analysis of the shifting talent landscape starting May 15, 2022 — when some of the most significant changes were starting to take place — through March 15, 2023, which captures the bulk of relevant data but is not inclusive of all activity to date.
We demystify the talent market on behalf of top engineers, as well as the companies where that top talent might find a new home. We specifically looked at engineers who are in the top 25% relative to their peers — as calculated by SignalFire’s Beacon AI data platform, which leverages a proprietary machine learning algorithm we developed to gauge the quality of engineers — both individually and collectively at their companies.
We used a cohort data approach encompassing the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Layoffs.fyi to capture a point in time when tech layoffs peaked, sticking with the data long enough to understand outcomes for that impacted cohort. More on our methodology can be found in the appendix at the end of the report.
How we got here
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the number of U.S. workers who quit their jobs during the Great Resignation between January and December 2021 made it a record-breaking year, with nearly 47.8 million total workers quitting their jobs. That is twice as many as left or were laid off during the Great Recession of 2009 and 2010.

Over the years leading up to the implosion, fundraising grew in both velocity and size. Pitchbook NVCA Venture Monitor highlights that 2021 saw a peak in the number of deals closed (18,521) and dollars invested ($344.7 billion) followed by a substantial drop in 2022, with four consecutive quarters of declining deal counts. The conjecture is that investor demand went down in both early- and late-stage investments.
To avoid a down round — or perhaps due to a lack of new funding available altogether — companies began to focus on extending their runway by reducing burn. Headcount and salaries are almost always the biggest line item on a company budget. Many companies had used capital to hire in advance of expected revenue growth and then missed revenue targets. They were suddenly strapped with unsustainable burn due to payroll increases.
Cue layoffs.
As the chart below highlights, layoffs in tech nearly doubled in 2022 compared with 2020; and after just the first quarter of 2023, this is already another record-breaking year for layoffs.

FAANGs out
For the past decade, FAANG companies were seen as the safe bet for job seekers, known for rich compensation packages and high job security. Starting in the summer of 2022, a new reality set in with hiring freezes and layoffs. "
Unicorn social app IRL to shut down after admitting 95% of its users were fake,Amanda Silberling,2023/06/26,"
Ironically, the social app IRL‘s users do not exist in real life.
An internal investigation by IRL’s board of directors found that 95% of the app’s reported 20 million users were “automated or from bots,” The Information first reported. So, after raising more than $200 million in venture capital, IRL is shutting down.
IRL was poised to become an event organizing alternative for Gen Z, who are using Facebook less and less. But after raising its SoftBank-led $170 million Series C round at a $1.17 billion valuation, the company’s internal troubles became more obvious.
Last year, IRL laid off 25% of its team, or around 25 employees. During the year prior, IRL had more than tripled its head count, so these cuts came as a surprise. In a note to employees, obtained by TechCrunch, former CEO and founder Abraham Shafi encouraged employees to “adapt” and “be disciplined,” citing that WhatsApp grew to 450 million users with a team of just 55.
“Becoming one of these iconic, impactful companies is akin to winning a gold medal in the Olympics. In fact, probably more challenging,” Shafi wrote in the memo, which was full of similarly outlandish analogies. “Like the Olympics, we know most people don’t want to be Olympians. In the same way, not everyone will want to walk the path we are walking. But for those that want to push their limits and find out what they are capable of, this culture is for you.”
In that same memo, Shafi said the company had “more than enough cash to last well into 2024.” An IRL employee told TechCrunch then that the company had more than $100 million in the bank. Though it’s unknown how much money IRL has left now, a company spokesperson told The Information that it would return its capital to shareholders.
Around the same time as these layoffs, IRL employees started doubting Shafi’s claim that the app had 20 million monthly active users; then the SEC began investigating whether IRL violated securities laws. By April, IRL’s board of directors suspended Shafi and appointed an acting CEO.
TechCrunch attempted to contact Shafi, as well as another IRL employee. Both of their IRL email addresses have been disabled.

Lilz brings its gauge-watching smart cameras to the US and raises $4M,Devin Coldewey,2023/06/26,"
When you run big real-life industrial operations, there’s always a gauge or readout somewhere deep in the facility that your engineers or field teams need to check in person. Lilz is a Japanese startup that builds devices you can set up to read these meters remotely, and the company just raised $4.1 million as they enter the North American market.
Lilz’s devices are basically battery-powered smart cameras that can last for years between charges, while monitoring something like a pressure gauge 24/7.
It may sound a little odd in this modern era — why not just have a smart steam gauge in the first place? The simple truth is much infrastructure and heavy industry doesn’t have that option, or retrofitting may be prohibitively expensive. Yet for safety or efficiency reasons, some simple readout needs to be looked at regularly.
Sending a human down is the simplest solution, or was until Lilz made its devices available a couple years ago. Their robust but low-power computer vision stack analyzes images of the gauge and relays that information digitally.
Now the Okinawa-based company has about 3,500 active cameras at 500 locations and has raised 590 million yen (approximately $4.1 million today) to fuel the next phase of their business. Its investors include JIC Venture Growth Investments, Mitsubishi UFJ Capital, Tokyo Century, Dimension Fund, Okinawa Development Finance Corporation, Okinawa’s Science and Technology Development Center, and Dogan Beta. That’s a Series B round, about twice their $2.2 million Series A round in 2021.
The company has received FCC and ISED certification for its devices and is preparing to launch in the U.S. and Canada. They plan to double their camera deployments and then rapidly expand afterward.

As far as the hardware, Lilz has been working on getting “intrinsically safe” certification as well, meaning the cameras pose no risk of creating safety issues — for example, shorting out and causing a spark that could ignite inflammable fumes. This frequently involves large enclosures for devices, but Lilz designed for it from the start, and its intrinsically safe cameras will only weigh 550 grams.
They’re also planning on releasing a thermal camera with similar qualities to the RGB one; thermal monitoring is important in uncrewed power stations, where a person would simply have to visit with a handheld thermal camera to check. Naturally automating this process is desirable. As with other widely distributed businesses like gas storage and delivery, removing the need for these checks is not only safer, but also saves money, time, and fuel.
Although it would be a stretch to call Lilz an AI company, it’s certainly close enough to claim kinship while the AI market continues to expand. Though it regularly improves its computer vision algorithms and the methods of accessing the data, Jakub Kolodziejczyk, the company’s CTO, said they’ve seen interest beyond meter-reading, since the devices are often at key locations in facilities.
“While we focus on analog gauges, with our cameras, clients can also capture other aspects of their processes they couldn’t track before, and are asking us for capabilities to detect events of interest,” he told TechCrunch. “Some examples we see now are abnormal temperature changes (which ties back to our thermal vision camera offering) and leaks, for both equipment and surrounding environment.”
Lilz devices could learn to detect outliers with very sparse data, he said, but cautioned that “this project is still in exploration phase.”

How to identify, interview and hire a head of growth for an early-stage startup
The 3 stages of building world-class growth funnels



One of the biggest mistakes startups can make at an early stage is not identifying their ideal customer personas (ICP). It is perfectly sensible though, as all your efforts at this stage of growth are usually being consumed with finding product-market fit and acquiring anyone and anything that walks through your front door.
By identifying your ICPs first, you will find product-market fit faster and identify the right customers to sell to.
To start, an ICP is simply a depiction of who your customer segments are — whether they are creative agencies of more than 10 employees or corporations with 100+ employees, or both.
Startups using ICPs tend to acquire more leads with higher quality and are able to shorten their sales cycles. Ideally, you have already identified a handful of ICPs, but no more than five, as that will lead to a dilution of efforts among your teams.
To begin leveraging ICPs in your growth marketing, we’ll dive into methods that will first help identify your ICPs efficiently, then examine how to use their newfound segmentation.
Identifying your ICPs
I’m a big fan of surveys that measure net promoter scores and overall customer feedback, but I don’t believe these are the best formats for identifying ICPs. In the early days of your startup, you should be speaking with every customer you possibly can to better identify your ICPs.
 

			By identifying your ideal customer personas first, you will find product-market fit faster and identify the right customers to sell to.					


Obtaining such information requires more than a simple multiselect answer, or a ranking score from 1-10. Rest assured, I’ve created a three-tiered methodology (conveniently dubbed ICP!) for guiding the conversational and questioning themes you should be using with your customers:

I: Individual (e.g., age, gender, etc.)
C: Current solution
P: Pain points

When speaking with customers, if you follow the general principle of understanding pain points and what an ideal solution looks like to them, you’ll have a pretty good idea of which ICP they fall into. Instead of providing a generic script for your conversations with customers, which can often come across as robotic, I’ve laid out a few questions that fall into each category:
Individual

What is your age range?
What is your gender?
What is your occupation or job title?

Current solution

What are you currently using to solve this problem?
How long have you been using your current solution?
What do you like/dislike about your current solution?

Q2 failed to bring a funding reprieve for web3 startups and unicorns,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/26,"
Lo and behold, we’re already halfway into 2023, which means we’re only a couple weeks away from brand new, sizzling data on the second quarter. However, it’s always wise to keep an eye on the horizon, so we’ve decided to draw the few conclusions about web3 and unicorn funding trends that we can from early data on the past three months.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

I think it’s fair to call the fervor that drove investors to throw money web3 startups a feature unique to the last venture boom. Neither capital nor enthusiasm around fintech were in short supply in those months, and investors poured tens of billions of dollars into blockchain-focused startups that wanted to shake up the world of money and value management.
Firm believers in crypto are resolutely holding the line, but early data on the second quarter indicates that many venture investors are running for cover.
Going by the early numbers, there’s been a decline in the value of venture investment in unicorns and companies close to growing a horn. Indeed, that metric is close to record lows. "
"ThoughtSpot acquires Mode Analytics, a BI platform, for $200M in cash and stock",Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/26,"
ThoughtSpot, an AI-powered analytics platform last valued at $4.5 billion, today announced that it’s entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Mode Analytics, a business intelligence startup, for $200 million in cash and stock.
Mode will become a wholly owned subsidiary of ThoughtSpot once the deal closes later this year, subject to customary closing conditions and the approval of Mode’s shareholders.
It’s ThoughtSpot’s fourth acquisition following (most recently) the company’s purchases of SQL-based analytics firm SeekWell in March 2021 and data integration company Diyotta in May of that same year. Enabling all the deals is ThoughtSpot’s massive war chest, which totaled over $663 million as of August 2019.
As for the Mode acquisition, ThoughtSpot CEO Sudheesh Nair says that it’ll bolster ThoughtSpot’s generative AI apps while doubling the company’s customer base and growing its annual recurring revenue to more than $150 million.
“With this acquisition, we’re giving both data teams and business users the tools they need to efficiently and quickly turn data into insights and those insights into actions,” Nair said in a press release issued this morning.
San Francisco-based Mode, which TechCrunch last covered in August 2020, was co-founded by Derek Steer, Benn Stancil and Josh Ferguson in 2013. All three previously worked at Yammer (they were early employees and stayed on after the Microsoft acquisition), where they were a part of a larger team building custom data analytics tools for the Yammer platform.
Steer told my colleague Ingrid Lunden that the impetus for Mode came out of gaps in the market that the three had found through years of experience at other companies. Specifically, they saw an opportunity to build a product that could provide business intelligence and big data analytics capabilities to help data scientists improve their employers’ decision making.
Mode indeed managed to find a foothold in the vast and growing business intelligence market (worth an estimated $27.11 billion in 2022, according to Fortune), raising $81 million in venture capital prior to the ThoughtSpot acquisition from investors including H.I.G. Growth Partners, Valor Equity Partners and Rev.
At one point, Mode claimed that its customer base covered more than 50% of the Forbes 500, including brands such as Anheuser-Busch, Zillow, Lyft, Bloomberg, Capital One, VMware and Conde Nast.
“At Mode, we’ve always focused on helping data analysts, and worked hard to remove the frustrations that interfered with their day-to-day workflows,” Stancil, who serves as Mode’s CTO, said in a statement via email. “By providing data teams with an integrated, code-first experience, we’ve enabled our customers to move far more quickly and find much more value in their data than they previously could.”
For Mountain View, California-based ThoughtSpot, which was founded in 2012 by a team of engineers who previously worked for Google, Oracle and other Silicon Valley companies, the deal makes perfect logistical sense.
ThoughtSpot’s platform is designed to allow “non-technical” users to conduct data analyses, leveraging tools that monitor information for changing patterns and trends from sources such as Snowflake and Databricks. Tapped by companies including Walmart and Apple, ThoughtSpot’s products focus on self-service analytics, primarily — with a dash of AI and machine learning thrown in for good measure.
What Mode brings to the table is a complementary product set, then. Nair sees the acquisition creating “new ways” for ThoughtSpot customers to provide value to data teams, for example enabling them to create analytics applications and modeled or visualized data in Mode that can then be served up through ThoughtSpot’s dashboards.
“For too long, data teams have been held back by the last generation of archaic data visualization tools like Tableau that forced them to endlessly tweak and update dashboards,” Nair said in a press release. “Whether you want to be code-free for your business users or code-first for your analytics engineers, now is the time to rethink business intelligence if you want to maximize value from your investments in the modern data stack.”
ThoughtSpot’s acquisition, along with other big exits in the big data analytics space, could be a sign of consolidation in the sector ahead of tough macroeconomic conditions to come. Also today, Databricks snatched up MosaicML, a startup developing open source AI tools, for $1.3 billion. And a month ago, Snowflake picked up Neeva, a firm that aimed to build out a new approach to search across consumer and enterprise using AI innovations. (The consumer part never took off, and Neeva sold up.)

We’ve officially entered a new era of ‘cultivated’ meat production,Christine Hall,2023/06/21,"
U.S. regulators met another alternative protein milestone Wednesday when they approved both Upside Foods and Good Meat to sell their cultivated chicken products within the country.
Known as “cell-cultivated” or “cultured meat,” these proteins are made from animal cells rather than slaughtered animals and are often developed using a fermentation process involving bioreactors.
Upside Foods and Good Meat, both based in California, will now be able to serve their food, initially in restaurants. Upside has already taken its first restaurant order and will provide limited quantities to Bar Crenn in San Francisco, while Good Meat has a partnership with a restaurant in Washington, DC, run by chef and owner José Andrés.
Today’s approval follows the U.S. Department of Agriculture last week approving the way both companies were going to label their products.
Both companies also received a grant of inspection from the USDA, Upside for its engineering, production, and innovation center, and Good Meat for its demonstration plant in Alameda, along with its contract manufacturing partner, JOINN Biologics. The inspection process includes examination of facilities and equipment; standard operating procedure for sanitation; and the systematic approach to identification, evaluation and control of food safety hazards, according to Good Meat.

Upside’s cell-cultured chicken is first to receive FDA blessing for its production method

Prior to today, Singapore was the only country allowing sales of cultivated chicken. Good Meat was the first company to get approval to sell its cultivated chicken product there and received a U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance in March, joining Upside Foods as the only two companies to move to that next stage of commercializing their products in the U.S.
Cultivated meat is a complex process that traditionally is expensive and takes time. There’s also consumer tastes involved. In addition to Singapore and the U.S., some regions, like the United Kingdom, are supporting this industry, while others (e.g., Italy) are questioning it.
Globally, there are dozens of companies not far behind in getting cultivated, or cell-cultured, meat products on the market, and following today’s announcement, we will likely see more companies fast-track their products through the regulatory process. In the U.S., companies have to receive approval from both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the USDA before commercializing their products in this country.
Despite the challenges, some venture capitalists investing in the space remain confident. SOSV/IndieBio general partner Po Bronson said via email that the new approvals were “great for the cell-cultivated meat sector.” He explained that much of the “cell-cultivated products coming to market are hybrid products” and that “as cell-cultivated meat grows, this will shape and alter the alternative protein sector, impacting who aggregates and who gets aggregated, where only companies with genuine technological advancements will survive and become part of the larger supply chain. Needless to say, the days of just buying some pea protein, an extruder, some vegetable oil and some methylcellulose — and hoping to print money — are long gone.”
He also noted that the cultivated meat industry is shifting, and it will be difficult for new startups to compete against early companies that have scaled, saying, “We’ve seen some acquisitions but not high value ones. More money will flow, absolutely, but only to companies who can demonstrate their technology is meaningfully different and not imitative or interchangeable. Those are the companies to watch.”
Meanwhile, in a TechCrunch+ investor survey last week, the investors specifically discussed companies working with the U.S. government.
One investor, Johnny Ream, partner at Stray Dog Capital, noted that his firm encourages portfolio companies to engage with regulators early and be transparent in their process.
“Having that open dialogue is critical to identify regulatory risk factors that might be present and should inform the product development strategy,” Ream said. “Without that engagement will be a greater chance of significant regulatory barriers and/or regulator education as a company approaches market entry.”

VCs remain confident alternative protein has a real future despite public-market woes

Dear Sophie,
I’m in the U.S. on an H-1B visa, but I want to leave my current job and pursue a couple of startup ideas: One with a few friends, and the other on my own. 
Do I need to get two separate visas to work at both companies at the same time? Can I transfer my H-1B to one or both companies?
— Energetic Entrepreneur
Dear Energetic,
Wow! Founding two startups and bringing them both to fruition will certainly keep you busy! I admire your drive and applaud you for your gusto and determination!
Let’s first provide some context on work visas versus work permits, and then offer up a few suggestions and alternatives.
Work visas vs. work permits
A work visa, such as the H-1B specialty occupation visa and the O-1A extraordinary ability visa, enables its holder to temporarily live in the U.S. and work only in the engagements included on the original visa petition, Form I-129.
Certain categories of people, such as F-1 students, some dependent spouses of work visa holders, and people pursuing green cards, may be eligible to apply for a work permit that is not tied to any specific employer. (Examples include F-1 OPT, F-1 STEM OPT, E-2 and L-1 spouses, and individuals who have been approved for a green card and have a pending Form I-485, the Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status.) Also known as an Employment Authorization Document (EAD), a work permit provides proof of authorization to work in the U.S. and enables its holder to get a job or jobs.
Compared to a work visa, an EAD offers wide flexibility to entrepreneurs and founders. That’s one reason we often ask our married entrepreneur clients whether their spouse is eligible for a work visa that offers an EAD to a dependent spouse.
H-1B transfer and concurrent H-1Bs
You can transfer your H-1B from your current employer to another employer for part-time or full-time work. You can also hold two or more concurrent H-1Bs from different employers at the same time.
Although an H-1B visa petition is tied to a specific job with a specific employer, there are no limits on the number of H-1B jobs an individual can hold and no standard minimum — or maximum—number of hours a person can work in any given H-1B position.
Since you’re currently on an H-1B — and already went through the annual H-1B lottery process — you can transfer your H-1B to another company and avoid having to go through the lottery process again. However, you should keep in mind that the maximum stay allowed under an H-1B visa is typically six years unless you apply for a green card.
So, if you’ve been inside the U.S. on H-1B status for a cumulative period of four years, transferring your H-1B to your startups would mean you can live and work in the U.S. for two more years in this status.
H-1B transfers and concurrent H-1Bs can be tricky, particularly for early-stage startups, so it’s important to create a compliant foundation for immigration sponsorship. You will need to structure your startups so that they are eligible to sponsor you for a position and that clear lines are drawn between the two startup entities. I recommend you work with both a corporate attorney and an immigration attorney. "
Quick commerce startup Getir plans to exit France amid regulatory issues,Romain Dillet,2023/06/21,"
In a press release sent to AFP, Getir has announced that it plans to exit France. As a reminder, Getir pioneered the concept of quick commerce. Those services allow you to order groceries without picking a delivery slot. Instead, companies like Getir start working on your order right away and can usually deliver your groceries in less than 30 minutes.
Originally from Turkey, Getir is one of the biggest players in this relatively new space. At the height of the instant grocery bubble, Getir reached a valuation of $11.8 billion and expanded to several European countries. Quick commerce requires some steep upfront costs as companies need to build a network of dark stores in big cities so that customers live just a few minutes away from the nearest dark store.
But funding dried up and many quick commerce startups couldn’t reach profitability in time. That’s why Getir acquired Gorillas in late 2022. Gorillas itself had already acquired Frichti, a French startup that delivered both ready-to-eat meals and groceries.
“The complex legal environment and regulations imposed by local authorities made the company’s success very difficult,” a Getir spokesperson told AFP in a statement. In particular, in March, the French government decided that dark stores should be considered as warehouses — not stores. This way, local governments can decide whether they allow warehouses in city centers or not.
It’s unclear what’s going to happen next. While Getir says that it plans to exit the French market altogether, the company has also filed for bankruptcy. Court-appointed administrators are still looking for another company that would be willing to take over some of Getir’s activities in France. In the meantime, Getir’s 1,800 employees in France don’t know if they’ll have a job in a few weeks as it depends on the result of this bankruptcy process.
Flink, one of Getir’s competitors, has also filed for bankruptcy in France. Flink had previously snapped up its French competitor Cajoo.
As for Gopuff, the company has already left the country in January. In other words, it sounds like the entire instant grocery delivery industry is disappearing in France… quick commerce indeed.

Databricks is proof that strong unicorns can grow their way out of a market correction,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/21,"
Databricks recently revealed that it recorded revenue of more than $1 billion in the financial year ended January 31. The company also said it grew more than 60% last year and its data warehousing product crossed the $100 million annual recurring revenue (ARR) threshold in April.
Databricks has always grown quickly, so it’s not surprising to hear that it has surpassed new revenue milestones, but these numbers are impressive even though we’ve been tracking this company for a while.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

Databricks reached ARR of $600 million when it raised a massive round in August 2021, reached $800 million in ARR at the end of 2021, and last August, crossed the $1 billion ARR threshold. However, as ARR is more of a forward-looking metric, the fact that Databricks managed to generate a full billion dollars in revenue is indeed a feat.
Today, we’re nearly half-a-year behind the company’s actual growth curve. Since Databricks saw revenue of $1 billion last year, it must have closed the year with higher ARR, and it has grown for nearly two quarters since then. It’s not easy to nail down how much revenue the company would be making today, but that’s not going to stop us from having a little fun with big numbers.
Databricks has been in the news lately for other reasons as well. Last month, it acquired Okera, a data governance platform with a focus on AI, and Bloomberg recently reported it bought Rubicon, a startup focused on data storage for AI-related work. Given that Databricks deals with corporate data, it makes sense that it is working with AI-related data services — in fact, the company open-sourced its own LLM in April.
But that’s all related to product. Today, we’re just talking about revenue, growth and how close Databricks is to harmonizing its private-market worth with what the public markets might afford it. Spoiler: The fact that it is deep in the AI trenches is not going to hurt its path to an eventual IPO, even if CEO Ali Ghodsi is in no hurry to go public.
The path to $1 billion
Rewinding through all our Databricks financial coverage takes a moment, but it’s worth our time. Here’s a rundown of what we have learned through time: "
20SALES closes $5M inaugural fund to invest in early-stage B2B SaaS startups,Dominic-Madori Davis,2023/06/21,"
20SALES, a venture capital fund led by eight women, said it has closed its $5 million inaugural fund, which it will invest mainly in early-stage, business-to-business SaaS companies.
The newly launched fund is an offshoot of venture firm 20VC, which was founded by Harry Stebbings, but it is a separate vehicle entirely. The fund plans to write checks of $100,000 and above for pre-seed, seed and Series A companies. It currently does not have any reserves for follow-on investments and instead will optimize for ownership on the first check.
The fund hopes to invest in at least 50 companies over the next two years. Although the focus of the fund is not just to solely back women, it hopes to focus its efforts there when possible.
20SALES’ founding partners are Jessica Arnold, Stevie Case, Kelly Bray, Liat Bycel, Kim Graves, Renu Gupta, Maggie Hott and Lauren Schwartz. All will be staying at their jobs and working at this fund part-time.
Stebbings, as a limited partner and advisor to the fund, managed its fundraising process and said the capital came from the LPs of 20VC. “They rarely do first-time funds, if ever,” he said of his own LP base. “However, they immediately saw the unique positioning of the fund and the immense quality of the partnership. Given both these elements, it took a very short time to raise.”
Other LPs include Harvard Management Company and Stewart Butterfield.
Speaking to TechCrunch, Hott said the fund hopes to inspire the next generation of women investors and have a material impact on the number of women operators in the space.
The fund also aims to help build a founder community for women. Female entrepreneurs receive less than 3% of all VC funds allocated in any given year. “We want to fund more of them,” Hott said. “Simple.”

Danti uses natural language processing to make searching Earth data simple,Aria Alamalhodaei,2023/06/21,"
Commercial and defense organizations have an Earth data overload problem: They collect vast amounts of heavily siloed data, with few ways to quickly synthesize insights and deliver them to the people who most need it.
Danti, a startup emerging from stealth today with $2.75 million in funding, wants to solve this problem with a powerful natural language search engine for location-based data. This should enable non-experts to quickly sort through huge amounts of diverse data and find the answers they need.
The search engine could completely change how location-based data is used and understood. On its website, Danti provides a number of possible queries an end user could pose. These span the mundane queries of an insurance underwriter (“What are the risks for property at 2340 River Bend Rd.”), to the more urgent questions of a warfighter (“battle damage assessment in Irpin in last 48 hours”).
The startup is headed by Jesse Kallman, whose career has spanned unmanned aerial systems, satellite data and geospatial intelligence. He eventually landed at Airbus, where he led a new business unit focused on developing geospatial market software, before moving to autonomous aviation startup Xwing, where he was VP of commercialization and strategy.
“I’ve learned the same lessons over and over and over again,” he said. “It was never about the drone, it was never about the satellite. It was always about, ‘what is the question that the user is trying to answer, and how do you get the right information [to them] based on what it is?’”
The solution to the problem, he says, is in the search layer. Just as the first search engines revolutionized the ability for the non-expert to find useful information online, Danti could similarly unlock Earth data end users — so its founder hopes, anyway.
“That’s where we were really inspired and what we really want to try to accomplish,” Kallman said. “How can you build something just purely at the search layer, not going into […] the really nitty-gritty geospatial work, for the [National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency] analyst or even better, the downstream deployed army user who’s just trying to answer a simple question about a property?”
To accelerate development of the search engine technology, Danti closed a $2.75 million pre-seed funding round led by Tech Square Ventures with participation from Radius Capital. The round also included Philip Krim and Raven One Ventures, SpaceVC, Overline, Tareyton Ventures, Jordan Noone, Keith Masback and Jeff Crusey.
Danti’s team stands at less than 15 people and is scarcely four months old, but the startup is moving fast. In April, Danti won an open challenge from the National Security Innovation Network, which asked competitors to pitch solutions to reduce the time-intensive data search process for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. Kallman said the follow-on feedback from NGA, as well as commercial customers, through the open challenge and other beta testing has been “incredible.”
“That’s where we are at this stage. It’s really, really getting deep with many different types of users to really understand what’s valuable to them.”

BetterBrand’s new dough raises company’s valuation to over $170M,Christine Hall,2023/06/21,"
BetterBrand, a food tech company known for creating “The Better Bagel,” closed on $6 million of Series A capital at a pre-money valuation of $170 million.
The company, citing Crunchbase data, also touts that the raise puts founder Aimee Yang among just 150 solo female founders to raise a Series A over $5 million from institutional investors and to achieve that valuation.
“The valuation reflects a combination of our growth, product differentiation, innovative technology and large-scale market potential,” Yang told TechCrunch via email. “There is a tremendous $10-plus trillion market that is largely untapped, for us to be able to dominate. With the results we have achieved at an unprecedented scale and speed, our vision to design the future of food is already being actualized — at this point, our biggest challenge is a race against the clock. We want to get there as quickly as possible to build the brand, and deliver on consumer demand.”
Founded in 2021, BetterBrand’s proprietary “grain-changing” technology combines non-GMO and clean label ingredients to create a line of better-for-you baked goods. For example, the company has created the traditionally carb-heavy bagel into “the net carb equivalent of two banana slices,” with “The Better Bagel” featuring 250% more protein, 90% fewer carbs and no added sugar.
In the past two years, the company has created new bagel flavors, most recently launching “The Pretzel” and “The Sesame.” Other flavors include  “The Classic,” “The Everything,” “The Cinnamon” and “The Chocolate Chip.” BetterBrand is also getting into new categories, and Yang expects to triple the SKU count by the end of this year with the launch of 16 new products.
The products have caught on with consumers. First starting as a direct-to-consumer offering, the products can now be found in more than 1,000 stores in the United States, including Whole Foods, Sprouts, Fresh Market, Gelson’s and Bristol Farms.

Between 2021 and 2022, the company saw over 800% growth, and in late 2022, Yang said BetterBrand “drove more than $1 million in gross sales at Whole Foods Market alone during our first five months on shelves.”
The company is on track to see a similar increase between 2022 and 2023, which is why Yang said it was a good opportunity to go after additional funding.
“Investors can see our results,” Yang said. “Our velocities on shelf have organically outperformed our best-case estimates. Product market fit had been proven, and the foundation had been laid out, so it was a good time to start adding fuel to drive additional innovation and distribution.”
The Series A gives the company nearly $10 million in total venture-backed funding to date. Verso Capital led the new round and was joined by existing investors, including Gaingels Fund, Seven Seven Six, Craft Lane and a group of individual investors, including Cruise founder and CEO Kyle Vogt, Chris Hollod and Jeff and Glenne Azoff. Existing investors Sean Thomas, of the Wendy’s family, and actors Patrick Schwarzenegger and Emmy Rossum, were part of BetterBrand’s earlier fund raises in 2021.
Meanwhile, the company is focused on growth, so the funds will be used to expand into new markets across North America and Europe and on continued innovation and product development poised to begin rolling out in coming months, Yang said.
Investors are also eager to see what’s next. Vogt said in a written statement that, “Aimee Yang is an incredible entrepreneur and a solid operator. Her company offers life-changing, clean, functional products for those who previously felt they had to give up some of their favorite foods to fit their nutritional needs. It’s an exciting journey to be a part of.”

Notarize launches Proof to ensure safe online transactions,Catherine Shu,2023/06/21,"
Notarize, the world’s largest online notary network, is launching Proof, a new company and platform for digital identity verifications. Beginning in August, Notarize’s business tools will be rebranded to Proof, and it is also changing its company name to Proof. Notarize will continue serving its online notary network, which is used by companies like Adobe and FedEx, and the two brands and platforms will exist side-by-side, said founder Patrick Kinsel.
Created in response to the rise in online transactions, Proof is an enterprise-grade platform, designed to serve large banks and real estate companies. It will continue to have all the main components of Notarize’s online notary service, which has been used by millions of users to process transactions like real estate e-closings, vehicle bills of sales and documents like affidavits of identity and power of attorneys. What’s new in Proof is an identity-assured transaction management platform meant to address gaps in online identity verification.
Some examples of the services it offers include verification identity using biometric tech (for example, scanning selfies to make sure they match ID photos), 24/7 human verification of identity and signature verification to ensure that the person signing is who they actually say they are. Proof also looks out for fraud risk in each transaction, the same way credit cards are monitored. For example, if a signature looks like it might be forged, Proof flags it for review.

Proof monitors fraud signals with a risk score based on data like location, device fingerprint, carrier network and prior rejections. All of its transactions are protected with encryption and are NIST IAL-2 compliant, and will be AATL compliant later this year. NIST is the National Institute for Science and Technology and it publishes standards used by government agencies and industries. For example, the National Highway Transportation Administration requires an IAL2 standard for electronic auto sales, which means consumers must provide a combination of identity evidence.
AATL, meanwhile, is the Adobe Approved Trust List, which dictates how PDF documents are cryptographically signed. Kinsel said that by meeting this, Proof will the first platform whose documents are tied to a valid legal identity in accordance with Adobe’s standards. “Our vision is that everything should be cryptographically signed with identity and Acrobat is the trusted reader to instantly confirm the authenticity of every action online,” he added.
If a signer fails to pass Proof’s digital safeguard for automated verification, they will be matched with one of Notarize’s more than 4,000 notaries to complete the document and transaction.
Kinsel told TechCrunch that Proof’s ability to confirm identity and flag risk leverages Notarize’s innovation in identity verification, including its ability to verify photo IDs like driver licenses and passports, present identity challenge questions, perform biometric selfie verification and confirm data attributes from information like consumer addresses and phone numbers. “When we swipe a credit card we know it’s being protected with active fraud monitoring and Proof will deliver the same for the agreements we enter,” he said.
Some examples of how Proof can be used include securing the seller in a real estate transaction, who don’t require notarization but are still at risk with only a basic e-signature, Kinsel said. Proof is also being used by the retirement industry to protect large withdrawals from fraud, and in the auto industry to notarize forms in some states and meet IAL2 standards elsewhere.
Since its launch in 2015, Notarize has been adopted by 2,200 companies, including First American, iPostal, Guaranteed Rate, Salesforce, SimpleNexus, SnapDocs, USAA and Zillow. Notarize says that almost 80% of those transactions were identity affirmations, as e-signatures are becoming increasing targets for fraud as online agreements become more common. Proof was created to expand Notarize’s services beyond notarization and create verifications of consumer identity with each transaction that it says are impossible to forge.
Notarize raised a $130 million Series D in 2021, at a valuation of more than $760 million, which it used to build Proof. Its investors include Camber Creek, Polaris Ventures and Realogy.

A whistleblower raised safety concerns about OceanGate’s submersible in 2018. Then he was fired.,Mark Harris,2023/06/20,"
The director of marine operations at OceanGate, the company whose submersible went missing Sunday on an expedition to the Titanic in the North Atlantic, was fired after raising concerns about its first-of-a-kind carbon fiber hull and other systems before its maiden voyage, according to a filing in a 2018 lawsuit first reported by Insider and New Republic.
David Lochridge was terminated in January 2018 after presenting a scathing quality control report on the vessel to OceanGate’s senior management, including founder and CEO Stockton Rush, who is on board the missing vessel.
According to a court filing by Lochridge, the preamble to his report read: “Now is the time to properly address items that may pose a safety risk to personnel. Verbal communication of the key items I have addressed in my attached document have been dismissed on several occasions, so I feel now I must make this report so there is an official record in place.”
The report detailed “numerous issues that posed serious safety concerns,” according to the filing. These included Lochridge’s worry that “visible flaws” in the carbon fiber supplied to OceanGate raised the risk of small flaws expanding into larger tears during “pressure cycling.” These are the huge pressure changes that the submersible would experience as it made its way and from the deep ocean floor. He noted that a previously tested scale model of the hull had “prevalent flaws.”
Carbon fiber composites can be stronger and lighter than steel, making a submersible naturally buoyant. But they can also be prone to sudden failure under stress. The hull that Lochridge was writing about was made by Spencer Composites, the only company to have previously made a carbon fiber hull for a manned submersible. (That submersible was commissioned by explorer Steve Fossett for a record-breaking dive, but he died in a light aircraft crash before it could be used.)
Lochridge’s recommendation was that non-destructive testing of the Titan’s hull was necessary to ensure a “solid and safe product.” The filing states that Lochridge was told that such testing was impossible, and that OceanGate would instead rely on its much touted acoustic monitoring system.
The company claims this technology, developed in-house, uses acoustic sensors to listen for the tell-tale sounds of carbon fibers in the hull deteriorating to provide “early warning detection for the pilot with enough time to arrest the descent and safely return to surface.”
Lochridge, however, worried in the lawsuit that the system would not reveal flaws until the vessel was descending, and then might only provide “milliseconds” of warning before a catastrophic implosion.

OceanGate plans an expedition to 3D scan the Titanic

Russell McDuff, a veteran oceanographer and chairman of OceanGate’s scientific and research foundation for three years, noted that contact with the Titan was lost on Sunday after only an hour and 45 minutes. “This suggests to me that they might have still been in the water column, descending to the Titanic,” told TechCrunch in a phone interview.
Lochridge also strongly encouraged OceanGate to have a classification agency, such as the American Bureau of Shipping, inspect and certify the Titan.
A day after filing his report, Lochridge was summoned to a meeting with Rush and company’s human resources, engineering and operations directors. There, the filing states, he was also informed that the manufacturer of the Titan’s forward viewport would only certify it to a depth of 1,300 meters due to OceanGate’s experimental design. The filing states that OceanGate refused to pay for the manufacturer to build a viewport that would meet the Titan’s intended depth of 4,000 meters. The Titanic lies about 3,800 meters below the surface.
The filing also claims that hazardous flammable materials were being used within the submersible.
At the end of the meeting, after saying that he would not authorize any manned tests of Titan without a scan of the hull, Lochridge was fired and escorted from the building.
Lochridge, who claimed he was discharged in retaliation for being a whistleblower, made his filing after OceanGate sued him in federal court in Seattle that June. OceanGate has accused him of sharing confidential information with two individuals, as well as with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). In the lawsuit, OceanGate characterized Lochridge’s report as false, and  accused him of committing fraud by manufacturing a reason to be fired.
The lawsuit was settled in November 2018. Neither OceanGate nor Lochridge responded to requests for comment. OSHA could not immediately provide details of the alleged report. A routine OSHA inspection of OceanGate in 2021 found only three minor workplace safety violations resulting in no financial penalties.
A few months after Lochridge’s dismissal, the company published a blog post that laid out its reasons for not having Titan certified by the American Bureau of Shipping or a similar organization.
 “The vast majority of marine (and aviation) accidents are a result of operator error, not mechanical failure,” it reads. “As a result, simply focusing on classing the vessel does not address the operational risks. Maintaining high-level operational safety requires constant, committed effort and a focused corporate culture – two things that OceanGate takes very seriously and that are not assessed during classification.”
In 2019, Rush gave an interview to Smithsonian magazine, in which he said: “There hasn’t been an injury in the commercial sub industry in over 35 years. It’s obscenely safe, because they have all these regulations. But it also hasn’t innovated or grown—because they have all these regulations.”
Following Lochridge’s departure, the Titan was tested safely on increasingly deep dives, including to 4,000 meters in the Bahamas. However, it seems one of Lochridge’s concerns would soon be borne out. In January 2020, Rush gave an interview to GeekWire in which he admitted that the Titan’s hull “showed signs of cyclic fatigue.” Because of this, the hull’s depth rating had been reduced to 3,000 meters. “Not enough to get to the Titanic,” Rush said.
During 2020 and 2021, the Titan’s hull was either repaired or rebuilt by two Washington state companies, Electroimpact and Janicki Industries, that largely work in aerospace. In late 2021, the Titan made its first trip down to the wreck of the Titanic.
Spencer Composites says that the Titan was not using its carbon fiber hull on Sunday’s dive. Presumably apart from the hull work, one source familiar with the company told TechCrunch that not much with Titan had changed at all since 2018.
At the time of publication, the Titan remains missing, with Rush, French diver Paul-Henri Nargeolet, British billionaire Hamish Harding, Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son reportedly on board. A massive search and rescue operation is underway.
“They’re doing everything that they logically can,” McDuff said. “But I’m a little pessimistic because of the amount of time that’s gone by.”

Tiger Global’s search for liquidity illustrates how busted the late-stage market is,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/20,"
The late-stage market is whacked. You only need to look at how Tiger Global Management, previously one of the most active investors in all of startup-dom, has failed to find a buyer for a large basket of its stakes in private tech companies.
The fact that Tiger did not, as PitchBook wrote, find a buyer for “a percentage of its stakes in about 30 companies [packaged in a] strip sale” implies the issue here was that Tiger did not find a buyer willing to pay however much it wanted for those stakes.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

LPs in venture funds put their money into an aggregated pool that is then used by the venture firm to purchase a number of stakes in a variety of companies. The difference between an LP in a new fund and Tiger, which is looking to sell a wide swath of stakes, is that the traditional LP can’t know where its pledged capital will end up.
Tiger, on the other hand, reportedly was looking to sell a basket of its stakes to what we presume is a similar customer base. Its failing to find a buyer for that collection implies that, in this case, more information is not helping move those shares.
PitchBook reports that Tiger is now looking to sell individual stakes in some of its portfolio companies to generate liquidity. Other investors are also struggling to sell collections of stakes, but they’re not seeing bids either, the report said.
Oof.
Tiger did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In the race for dominance in the AI travel industry, even a small lead matters right now.
Every player in the space trying to capitalize on the promise of new AI/LLM (large language model) technologies is struggling with the fact that major platforms like ChatGPT are limited by data that is outdated or not real time. In an industry like travel, where fickle plans and itineraries literally change with the weather, this is particularly problematic.
As both investors in AI travel and advisors coordinating deals for startups in this space with other investors, we like to see companies pushing boundaries and providing value for users in new, concrete ways.
For instance, Kayak and Expedia have launched ChatGPT plugins, but GuideGeek from travel publisher Matador Network provides real-time flight data (GP Bullhound has provided financial advisory services to Matador Network). Meanwhile, Roam Around has a strong visual element to its interface.
But travel information is complex, and incorrect information — or AI “hallucinations” — are a challenge. Roam Around sometimes recommends one site while showing a photo of another (and potentially linking to a third), and in one of our queries, GuideGeek conjured a cleverly named pub that simply doesn’t exist.
 

			Other than Airbnb, there really hasn’t been a major shift in how we plan and book travel online in decades.					


At this early stage, our firm and other investors in the space we work with don’t have an expectation of perfection. The advances between GPT-3 and GPT-4 are so apparent that it’s easy enough to look at the underlying technology and say, “Eh, they’ll figure it out.”
We’re more focused on how companies are shaping and augmenting this technology for travelers and the market segments within the travel industry they are positioned to capture.
Differentiation is key — you need more than a skin for ChatGPT
Most AI products seem to be built on ChatGPT. While each travel company may start with the same baseline, we really like to see proprietary data that can train the AI to produce superior outputs. OTAs (online travel agencies) like Expedia and Booking.com have an advantage here with massive amounts of information about their customers and how people plan and book trips.
Small agile teams have an opportunity to adopt this technology and rapidly scale up before the big guys can effectively implement or risk disrupting their existing business. If consumers can use an AI tool to search all airlines instantly, why does an OTA need to be in the loop?
The OTAs are built on recommending what the masses want, but the whole point of AI is that the answer is now customized to the individual. An average ranking of 8 for a hotel doesn’t apply to a specific person whose main priority is to be close to a lesser-known local surf spot an AI surfaced for them.
To try to drive utilization, startup players have to get more creative with product design. Getaiway and Roam Around have focused specifically on itineraries, with the latter simplifying the user input down to one word — type in a place and get an itinerary, then refine from there. Matador says it plans to include influencer videos from its wide range of content creators in the GuideGeek messaging interface. "
"Shaquille O’Neal will discuss investing in Edsoma, life as a mogul and more at Disrupt",Lauren Simonds,2023/06/20,"
Talk about a slam dunk. Shaquille O’Neal, 15-time NBA All-Star, four-time NBA Champion and three-time NBA Finals MVP, will join us at TC Disrupt 2023, which takes place September 19-21.
Following nearly two decades in the NBA, Shaq has built an estimated $400 million business empire — moving easily from superstar to mogul. He’ll join us in his role as lead investor in Edsoma, an AI-powered reading, education and communication platform for children. Kyle Wallgren, the company’s founder and CEO, will also take part in this fireside chat.
A committed advocate for children’s literacy, O’Neal has participated in charity basketball events and founded the Shaquille O’Neal Foundation to support underserved youth. It’s not surprising to find him adding edtech to his portfolio, but we’re eager to hear why he chose Edsoma. 
Wallgren is a visionary leader committed to making a positive impact through his work, with the ultimate mission to stamp out illiteracy around the world. As a parent, he experienced the challenges of Covid-related school closures, and he founded Edsoma to help parents instill the love of reading in their children and as a way to address decreased reading performance brought on by the pandemic. 
The app helps children learn correct pronunciation as they read aloud, and it also lets parents read with their children from any location — think parents who live separately or travel for work, deployed military personnel or far-flung grandparents.
A bona fide business mogul — Shaq earned his MBA in 2005 —  O’Neal has invested in companies like Google, Apple and Ring. He’s the second-largest individual shareholder of Authentic Brands Group, and he owns multiple franchising storefronts, including Big Chicken, Papa Johns, Krispy Kreme and many other entrepreneurial ventures.
Kyle Wallgren is a successful entrepreneur with a proven track record of building and selling multiple small businesses. He has sold 10 of the 13 companies he’s launched. 
We look forward to learning what qualities Shaq looks for in a founder and how he and Wallgren plan to grow and scale the company.

Jane Technologies launches innovative point-of-sale platform for cannabis dispensaries,Matt Burns,2023/06/20,"
Jane Technologies today announced the launch of its new point-of-sale (POS) platform that it says will improve the overall cannabis shopping experience with reliable online listings and in-store curated shopping recommendations.
Everyone knows the pain. You find your favorite strain on your dispensary’s online menu, only to go to the shop and discover it’s out of stock. You can either pick another strain at random or rely on the questionable advice of the local budtender. Jane’s new POS system aims to change that bummer of a situation, and it’s using its massive e-commerce data catalog to tackle in-store retail.
The new POS integrates with Jane Technologies’ existing e-commerce and advertising solutions product lines. The company started by building the back end for dispensaries’ e-commerce operations. To Jane Technologies, the future of cannabis isn’t a single destination like Amazon; the future of cannabis is the neighborhood dispensary that sells weed online. Jane wants to power their online store — and now the company wants to power their brick-and-mortar locations, too.
Jane’s POS platform includes a debit card payment system, custom hardware, and a personalized shopping experience. But the secret sauce comes from Jane Technologies’ long dedication to providing clean data assets. The company already tracks 1.5 million SKUs, and when new products are launched (or old products modified), Jane’s system pushes the data to its customer base. Shop owners can focus on selling weed while Jane’s platform does the heavy lifting around inventory management.
This new system provides dispensaries with a deep level of customer personalization. As Jane Technologies’ CEO Socrates Rosenfeld explained to me, the regulation around cannabis presents retailers with a unique opportunity. Before entering a dispensary, shoppers must scan their government-issued ID, and suddenly, the retailer knows who’s shopping and what they like to purchase. Jane’s new POS takes advantage of this process, and the system serves the budtender with a list of products previously purchased by the customer and a list of recommended products backed by verified reviews.
“In-store displays can be curated specifically for you,” Rosenfeld said. “Think about the Budtender who will know your preferences and purchase history, and they can recommend more curated personal items.”
This system has long been a staple of online e-commerce, including on Jane Technologies’ e-commerce platform, but now the same platform works in a retail environment that depends heavily on recommendations.
Jane Technologies says integrating the platform with a dispensary’s inventory takes just a couple of hours. They say competitors can take weeks to complete a transition because of the work associated with exporting important product information, imagery, and government tracking IDs.
The system also allows for stand-alone, vending machine–type kiosks that are designed for speed and efficiency, allowing customers to browse and purchase products using a large touchscreen instead of speaking with a retail associate.
Jane Technologies has been testing this system at three dozen partners across the Pacific Northwest, New Mexico, California and Colorado. The company expects its new POS platform to be in 400 retail locations by the end of the year.

Oso sees huge opportunity in simplifying authorization for developers,Ron Miller,2023/06/20,"
We all know what authentication is. You enter a username and password or use your face or your fingerprint, and you can access a device or an application, but what you can do with that application or device falls under the realm of authorization, authentication’s close cousin. For years, developers have been forced to build their own authorization tooling, and unless you’re one of the bigger companies, that takes resources that a lot of organizations simply don’t have.
Oso’s mission is to make it easier to add authorization to any application. “Authorization is a $25 billion market. It’s a problem that every company has to solve. But no one got out of bed to think about it except for my team and me,” company CEO Graham Neray told TechCrunch.
Investors see the same potential, and today the company announced a $15 million round led by Felicis with participation from Sequoia and Harpoon Ventures. While it was at it, the company also announced that a new version of the Oso tooling is now available.
Neray points out that companies like Slack, Google and Airbnb have spent a lot of time and engineering resources building authorization tooling. “The problem is most companies don’t have the resources of a company like Google or Slack, so they limp along. Their systems are terrible and the engineers’ experience is kind of like a Groundhog Day scenario of building these systems over and over again, even though no one wants to. And Oso solves that problem,” he said.
Part of the company’s approach to this is to educate people on the nature of the problem, and how important it is to solve, which has the added benefit of acting as a marketing driver to the open source version of the product, which can in turn lead to sales of the cloud product.
“We’ve also built an extensive library of technical documentation, not specific to Oso, to educate developers on the domain. And as part of that what we’re doing is we’re providing vocabulary and mental models to understand their own authorization problems. So we published a series called Authorization Academy. It’s a series of technical guides on how to build application authorization,” he explained.
In addition to the open source product, which Neray says has been downloaded millions of times, the company added Oso Cloud last year with ARR from that product growing 20% month over month. He says they are doing this without any outbound sales to this point.
“On top of that, our motion is entirely product led and inbound. So what I mean by that is we’re not doing outbound [sales and marketing]. We don’t currently have salespeople, though I’m sure we will in the future. And all of our paid customers started on the free tier, which is no small feat, especially given the microscope under which businesses are being put about how they spend their money and how efficient they are,” Neray said.
And being efficient has meant keeping the company lean with just 13 employees so far. But with the $15 million investment, the startup does plan to start hiring more people this year, and as he does, he is considering how to build a diverse workforce.
“So it starts from the top. It is much more common to find people who are interested in working for a leadership team with which they can identify, and so I think that’s a core part of the strategy,” he said. And that means making sure the leadership team is diverse as the company grows.
As the company puts the additional $15 million in capital to work, Neray is focused on the opportunity he sees in the authorization space.
“I think the combination of the size of the opportunity, and the strength of the business and the growth that we’re seeing is what led the team at Felicis to lead this round. We also have Sequoia who led prior rounds and Harpoon Ventures also participated. That puts our total funding raised over $25 million, which makes us the best capitalized authorization company,” he said.

Diabetes management startup Clivi wants to be ‘Livongo of Latin America’,Christine Hall,2023/06/20,"
Over 422 million people around the world have diabetes, with the World Health Organization noting that the majority of those with the disease are living in low-income and middle-income countries.
In Latin America, there are over 40 million adults with diabetes, according to Statista. And with the global digital health market poised to reach $1.5 trillion in the next seven years, Clivi, a Mexico-based diabetes management startup, wants to help control the disease through its comprehensive, technological and personalized approach to diabetes healthcare delivery.
“In Mexico, there is an average of one endocrinologist per almost 10,000 patients,” Clivi founder and CEO Ricardo Moguel told TechCrunch. “You might see a doctor every three months, but for chronic conditions, patients need to be making decisions every day.”
Clivi is making a balance between humans and technology by connecting patients with endocrinologists, nutritionists and psychologists and enabling users to access monitoring and treatment plans via their communication channel of choice (e.g., WhatsApp) so they can better achieve their treatment goals and adhere to lifestyle changes.
The company also provides all of the supplies, like glucometer, test strips and blood testing kits, as well as medication. Though health plans start at MX$790 per month, the average patient will pay MX$40 per month with private insurance, Moguel said.
He explained that people living with diabetes in Latin America often begin treating their disease late, which can lower their life expectancy by 10 years. Clivi’s goal is to help patients get back four of those years.
Since going live in October 2021, Clivi’s platform has helped thousands of patients so far, 94% of whom have achieved diabetes control within six months, Moguel said. The company is currently seeing an average of 2,000 new patients join the platform each month. It also reached $2 million in annual recurring revenue over the past 15 months, and Moguel expects 10x that growth within the next 12 months.
Over the next five years, the company intends to serve 1 million people through its digital clinic and diabetes remote monitoring service, Moguel said.
Today, it announced $10 million in seed funding toward that goal. The investment was co-led by Dalus Capital and Foundation Capital, with participation from a group of investors, including Cathay Innovation via its C. Entrepreneurs fund; Femsa Ventures; Quiet Capital; 500; Next Billion Ventures; and Conexo. There was also a group of angel investors, including Jüsto founder and CEO Ricardo Weder, Kueski founder and CEO Adalberto Flores, Trust Networks co-founder Suresh Batchu, 99 and Mara founder and CEO Ariel Lambrecht, Meta executive Tara Syed and Reina Madre co-founders Vicente Aristegui and Juan Moctezuma.
The new funding will be used to finish out the product, including its artificial intelligence technology, so that more of the functions are automated and doctors can increase their capacity for treating patients, Moguel said. The company is also going to expand its work with enterprises and public health organizations in Mexico. He expects to “dominate the Mexican market and become the No. 1 diabetes clinic in Mexico within the next year.”
“This will help us to prepare the ground before we start expanding our solution to other Spanish-speaking territories across the region,” Moguel said. “This is the master plan to become not just the Livongo of Latin America, but the largest player in terms of diabetes and chronic conditions in the whole of Latin America.”

"Parrot, an AI-powered transcription platform that turns speech into text, raises $11M Series A",Kate Park,2023/06/20,"
Artificial intelligence touches many aspects of professional industries, including medicine, legal, business, information technology and more. AI-powered transcription service is one example that has become an integral part of those fields.
Parrot, a transcription platform offering speech-to-text depositions for the legal and insurance industry, said Tuesday it has raised $11 million in a Series A round. It also unveiled a new feature that summarizes deposition in mere seconds for legal experts.
Amplify Partners and XYZ Venture Capital co-led the latest capital, bringing its total raised to $14 million since its inception. The company declined to reveal its valuation when asked.
Attorney Eric Baum, his brother Bryan Baum and a team of engineers with expertise in AI and speech-to-text transcription founded Parrot in 2019. Eric, a long-time prosecutor who conducted depositions for the special victims unit of the state attorney’s office of Florida, saw firsthand the shortage of court reporters as demand for the deposition service continues to grow every year. He wanted to streamline the deposition process by using large language models (LLMs), not only for the legal industry but also for other sectors.
“The improvements in LLMs are the next paradigm shift, akin to the internet and mobile,” Amplify Partners general partner Mike Dauber said in a statement.
The CEO of Parrot, Aaron O’Brien, who has been in the tech space for more than 15 years and previously worked at tech firms like Flexport, Uber and Facebook, told TechCrunch that Parrot’s founding team saw an opportunity to bring much-needed technology to the legal industry that has been overlooked and underserved for a long time.
“You’ll often hear that lawyers are resistant to tech, but this hasn’t been our experience,” O’Brien told TechCrunch. “Attorneys are eager to adopt new technologies, but the solutions need to be trustworthy and purpose-built for their workflow.”
O’Brien met the Parrot founding team in 2021, introduced by Parrot’s early investors. The CEO has since helped the AI startup scale a growing deposition provider with global insurance carriers.
Parrot AI’s ultimate goal is to allow users to gather and synthesize information more efficiently in order to achieve better and faster outcomes by leveraging AI.
The startup plans to use the proceeds to ramp up investment in artificial intelligence for the legal and insurance domains and continue developing tools to address the industry’s challenges.
Customers in need of court transcription services typically must call or email a court-reporting vendor and wait days for confirmation, O’Brien said. Parrot lets users book a deposition and secure capacity with one click, and meeting-ready calendar links will be sent to all parties, O’Brien explained.
Another challenge Parrot wants to address is related to deposition review: After a deposition concludes, attorneys must request an expensive transcript, which takes more than ten days to receive. Parrot’s deposition review tools help attorneys access a fully searchable, highly accurate rough draft transcript synced with video and audio, which is one of the company’s highest-value features, O’Brien continued. In addition, Parrot securely stores a comprehensive archive of deposition transcripts, video and audio recordings, and more in its cloud-based platform, he noted.
“At the core of Parrot’s differentiated model is our highly specialized models that are trained extensively on proprietary and domain-specific data,” O’Brien said. “Parrot’s approach is not another enterprise’s solution built on top of generic API — it’s a suite of highly customized models, infrastructure and domain expertise years in the making that offers unprecedented accuracy for legal professionals.”
One customer, Aaron Warner, attorney at Warner & Fitzmartin, described the experience of Parrot as like “going from a Nokia to an iPhone.” According to the startup, once customers begin working with Parrot — from C-suite executives focused on budget and outcomes to the support staff responsible for scheduling depositions — they’re saying there’s no going back.
Hundreds of enterprises’ customers, including law firms, insurance companies, law enforcement and corporations, use Parrot for depositions, witness statements, examinations under oath and more. The outfit didn’t share its business metrics but noted that the four-year-old company generates revenue in the millions.

Hyperline is a billing platform for SaaS products,Romain Dillet,2023/06/20,"
Meet Hyperline, a new product that handles pricing and billing for software-as-a-service companies. The company provides integrations so that you can quickly start billing. It then supports different scenarios, such as recurring subscriptions, usage-based billing, custom discounts and more.
This isn’t the first company that focuses on pricing and billing — examples include Recurly and Chargebee. But these are complex revenue management platforms that don’t necessarily work well for small SaaS startups that are just getting started.
Alternatively, some companies choose to develop these pricing and billing features in house. But B2B software has changed quite a lot with sales negotiation processes and usage-based pricing. It can lead to mistakes.
When you have configured Hyperline, the company handles all things related to revenue. You can import your customer data from your database, configure your pricing rules, connect the platform with your CRM and leverage popular payment providers, such as Stripe or GoCardless.
After that, Hyperline generates invoices directly. It handles different VAT rates — this isn’t a paid add-on like on some platforms. The product then orchestrates payment requests, which means that it can automatically charge a card or a bank account.
Finally, Hyperline provides a monitoring dashboard so that you can see if there is any failed payment. You can also perform billing actions from there.
The startup raised a $4.4 million (€4 million) funding round led by Index Ventures a few months ago. Kima Ventures and Cocoa also participated in the round. Several business angels invested in the company as well, such as Rodolphe Ardant, Guilhem Bellion, Steve Avani, Thibaud Elziere, Quentin Nickmans, Alexandre Berriche and Nico Rosberg.
Iterating on pricing more regularly
By default, tech teams can interact with Hyperline using the company’s API. But “if companies want to configure it and use it in a ‘no-code’ way, they can do so. If you want to tweak your usage-based pricing, you don’t have to through the tech team,” founder Lucas Bédout told me.
And this is key to understanding Hyperline’s appeal. Many SaaS companies define their pricing strategy and then work on the product roadmap. Pricing and product features don’t necessarily evolve at the same time.
“There are discrepancies between pricing and the product team. Pricing is a project that companies do every couple of years. The company brings in consultants and we put everything back in place – it takes six months to a year to implement everything,” Index Ventures partner Julia Andre told me. “But pricing has an impact on acquisition and churn.”
With a product like Hyperline, pricing can become a continuous project. At the same time, Index Ventures is betting on a next-generation pricing and billing startup that could potentially perform better than legacy products.
Dozens of companies are already using the product, such as Gladia, a startup I covered earlier today and is running a usage-based pricing. As Hyperline starts scaling, it will have more data on SaaS revenue strategies and it will be able to make some recommendations to reduce churn, improve the average revenue per customer, etc. And that should also increase Hyperline’s bottom line as the company takes a small cut on each transaction.

Deal Dive: Startups can still raise capital — even if it’s for a good cause,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/07/08,"
When venture funding started to slow in 2022, many feared that investors would retreat to where they were comfortable: SaaS companies founded by folks in their network. And any company that wasn’t posting top growth metrics would struggle to secure funding. While this has largely been true, there have been bright spots. Everytable’s recent round is one of them.
The mission-driven food tech startup looks to make healthy prepared food, including wraps and salads, as accessible and affordable as fast-food chains. The startup prices its menu based on where each individual store is located in addition to distributing through a variety of other channels, including branded vending machines and delivery.
On June 27, the startup announced a $25 million Series C-2 round led by Dohmen Impact Investment Fund, which backs for-profit companies building food solutions to enhance human health, in addition to existing investors. This round will help the company expand its retail footprint; Everytable hopes to open up 25 stores in the latter half of 2023.
This deal is notable for a few reasons — none of which being that it got announced amid the mass VC summer exodus at the end of June. Someone is still working!

"So, how are Europe’s startups doing?",Haje Jan Kamps,2023/07/07,"
Welcome to Startups Weekly. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday afternoon.
I’ve been keeping an eye on the European startup ecosystem since well before I moved to the U.S., and today’s report from Creandum about the state of venture investing in Europe gave me pause. This, along with PitchBook’s report of what happened across the pond last year, adds up to a complex picture.
As far as I can see — and as I discussed in my column this week — the ecosystem in Europe continues to be pretty fragmented and immature, and investment across the pond took a 16% dip in 2022 compared to 2021. That isn’t unique to Europe, of course; 2022 was hard across the board, and compared to the years before, there were very few liquidity events across the startup world:
Data from PitchBook shows that exit values in 2022 were dismal. Image Credits: PitchBook
All around, 2022 was a dismal year: We haven’t seen this little M&A and IPO activity since 2016. The total value of exits in 2022 was $71 billion. The year before, it was more than ten times that.
Bad years happen, but I’m going to keep a very close eye on how quickly the VC markets bounce back. My suspicion is that the U.S. venture industry is more resilient in the face of a slow year or two and that LPs are less easily spooked. In other words, it’s going to be telling to see who raises new funds, where, and with what investment theses over the next three to five years.

Spotify co-creator Daniel Ek’s new company raised a $65 million round of funding for his preventative healthcare startup Neko Health — all the more impressive given that this is reportedly the first external round of financing for the Stockholm-based company.
Lightspeed Ventures made its first investment in Africa, backing Berry Health, which aims to bring judgment-free healthcare to a continent where stigma cuts deep and is affecting many.
News of the fresh rounds comes on the heels of a healthy amount of activity in health tech — Public Ventures launched a $100 million impact fund focusing on nascent life science and clean tech startups, particularly in Canada.

It’s handbags at dawn for social media

If you’ve stumbled across the TechCrunch homepage in the past week, then you’ve seen our wall of coverage on the utter drama-fest that is the social media landscape at the moment. Investment giant Fidelity already adjusted down its Reddit valuation a month ago, but Manish reports that it further deepened its valuation cuts for Reddit this week, after the Reddit protest plunges user engagement.
If you look beyond the Reddit dumpster fire for a fraction of a second, the rest of social media is aflame as well. Twitter competitors soar after Musk makes another boneheaded move, and Paul argues that its competitors need to get their act together in order to become a true competitor.
Apropos competitors, Meta’s Twitter competitor Threads went live and quickly passed 2 million downloads in just two hours, and more than 30 million in a day. I know, I didn’t really see it coming either, but TechCrunch compiled an all-your-questions-answered article about Threads. My first impression? The app isn’t great, but Instagram’s network effect is formidable, and Twitter has been screwing up so monumentally since Musk’s acquisition that it may just be all it takes to put the bird app in its grave.
That’s a pass from us, mon frère: Natasha L points out that Meta’s Threads app is a privacy nightmare and that it won’t launch in the EU yet. This follows a report that a bunch of tech giants are having to figure out how to respond to the EU’s rebooted antitrust regime.
Money didn’t bring API-ness: Ivan ponders what’s happening over at Reddit as the social media site braces for life after API changes.
Lawsuits from a parallel universe: Devin reports that a Louisiana judge silenced White House social media talks in a lawsuit that seems pretty wild. He writes, “It’s almost pitiable how desperately the lawsuit peddles its conspiracy theories, making out routine emails to be collusion and [the] removal of rule-violating content as censorship.” So . . . that’s fun.
Take down those tweets: While we’re on the topic of wild court cases, Twitter was trying to wriggle out of a case in India, but the judge didn’t mince words: “Punishment for non-compliance is 7 years imprisonment and unlimited fine.” Needless to say, Twitter’s plea against India’s government was dismissed, although the core of the case is still curious: Twitter has been asked to take down hundreds of accounts and tweets, often for denouncing the Indian government.
Skynet awakens

AI is everywhere, but never has it been so confusingly head scratching as in the case of Humane’s first product: The Ai Pin. The secretive startup has been around since 2018 and has reportedly raised more than $230 million since then — and I can’t for the life of me figure out why this is better than just saying, “Hey, [voice assistant],” into your nearest smart device. Someone, please, explain it to me.
Did I mention that AI is hot? In the past couple of weeks, I had two founders reach out to me for fundraising advice, only to get back to me a couple weeks later with an “lol, I guess we don’t need help; we just got several term sheets.” The right teams are raising formidable amounts of funds as the FOMO sets in among investors. One example is Typeface, which is building generative AI for brands and just announced a $100 million raise at a $1 billion valuation.
On top of that, one of the wilder stories we’ve seen so far was a founder selling its four-month-old “OpenAI for China” play for $234 million. That means the startup gained about $2 million of valuation per day from starting to acquisition. Yowzers.
Incidentally, if someone wants to share some AI-related decks for my Pitch Deck Teardown series, I wouldn’t be mad.
Yes, this is definitely Bobby’s mother. He cannot come to school today: Ingrid reports that Voice.ai raises $6 million as its real-time voice changer approaches 500,000 users.
Hey, robot, you grab the crayons, I’ll make the coffee: Kyle reports that Runway raised $141 million as it builds generative AI tools for content creators.
We can’t measure this, but it’s definitely 10x better: Over on TC+, Software.com co-founders Geoff Stevens and Brett Stevens argue that the productivity boosts developers see by using AI are a bit of smoke and mirrors — not least because nobody seems to agree on how to measure productivity among software developers in the first place.

"How to identify, interview and hire a head of growth for an early-stage startup",Jonathan Martinez,2023/07/07,"
The waters are never calm when scaling a startup. In fact, they are typically quite choppy. However, by making the correct hire in the head of growth position, you can navigate to shore much more smoothly.
The individual you’re looking for will create and execute growth strategies, manage marketing initiatives and, ultimately, drive revenue. My more informal take on this role is that it’s someone who deeply understands growth fundamentals, has significant expertise in one to two growth pillars and knows how to build an effective team.
I’ll walk you through when and how to hire your head of growth, their archetypes, how this role stands apart from other marketing executive positions, and what to expect from this hire during their first few quarters.
Head of growth archetypes
In my decade of growth marketing, I’ve seen quite a few growth leaders who began at various startups, all possessing varying levels of experience. To make it easier, I’ve grouped these candidates into three major categories, or archetypes:

Generalists: Experience across numerous growth pillars.
Specialists: Deep expertise in one pillar.
Tertiaries: Data, finance/VC, VC or product background.

While I’ve seen members of each category become successful as heads of growth, I strongly advise hiring from either category one or category two for seed to Series B startups.
When building a growth function from zero, it’s vital to have someone who can drive the execution for your early channels and campaigns. When it comes to category three, I’ve only witnessed success after a growth team was already in place, with their efforts centered around optimizing efforts across data analytics and product.
Outside of these three major archetypes, there are two important flavors that are consistent across the groups:

B2B or B2C
Mobile or web

These two flavors can make or break the success of your growth efforts, as their type of marketing is so distinct. Someone coming from an extensive background of web acquisition at a B2B company like Rippling would not be well-suited to run growth at a B2C consumer startup such as Spotify.
Most growth marketers will heavily index in B2B or B2C, as their careers typically stay on that path. However, it’s quite common to see growth marketers who have experience in both mobile and web acquisition, and it’s absolutely acceptable to hire them.
You’ll occasionally find a unicorn who’s a generalist and has experience in B2B, B2C, mobile and web. If you do, recruit them immediately.
Heads of growth come in many flavors. Image Credits: Jonathan Martinez
How to interview
I’m fortunate to have been on both sides of the interview table for head of growth positions, largely at tech B2C startups, so I have a good sense of what makes for amazing interviewees.
Below are example questions to ask and a few case studies I’ve seen work well:
Interview questions:

What are the most important growth metrics for our startup to track?
How would you measure success in our growth efforts?
We’re having issues in our funnel — how would you analyze and optimize?
What do you think our largest growth levers are and why? "
Pitch Deck Teardown: Nokod Security’s $8M seed deck,Haje Jan Kamps,2023/07/07,"
Gone are the days when you needed a developer to build an app for a relatively easy task. No-code and low-code development let you dramatically increase the speed of building and bringing simple (and, sometimes, not-so-simple) apps to market. I swear, half my life is being run by Zapier at the moment: Book a meeting with me, and all sorts of things happen automatically in the background to ensure that our meeting is on the right calendars, is transcribed and the video of the call is stored away and tagged with your company’s name.
The ease of creating apps that low-code and no-code offer has trade-offs, though: In order to work, they need access to some pretty sensitive data. If someone wants access to my data, they could try to hack my email, or they could hack one of the many automations tied to my email accounts. When more and more apps are essentially running on the same underlying architecture and code, they become a very tempting target for hackers and others with nefarious intentions.
Enter Nokod Security, which offers to monitor no-code and low-code apps for security vulnerabilities and mitigate breaches.
The company recently raised $8 million from Acrew Capital, Meron Capital and Flint Capital, and the team was gracious enough to share the (lightly edited) deck they used so we could take a sneaky peek under the hood.

We’re looking for more unique pitch decks to tear down, so if you want to submit your own, here’s how you can do that.

Three things to love
Nokod’s deck has a lot of cool things going on, as well as some stuff that had me pretty confused. As always, I’ll get to my misgivings and OldManYellsAtCloud.gif feedback in just a moment. For now, let’s look at the slides that got me excited.
Give me a T! Give me an E!
Okay, I’m not gonna spell out T-E-A-M in the subhead, but this is an example of a company that knows its strengths. In an early-stage company, a founding team that has an unfair advantage is a straight-up superpower. Nokod has all bases covered on that front:
[Slide 2] Extraordinary founding team. Image Credits: NokodThe two co-founders have both started and exited companies in the cybersecurity space before. That’s a hell of a way to catch an investor’s attention. Relevant experience and successful exits screams “unfair advantage.” Even after just reading this one slide, I was pretty unsurprised that this company successfully raised money.
Apart from the obvious, this slide shows that the founding team understands what’s important in a pitch deck: If you’ve got incredible traction, lead with that. If you don’t, highlight your experienced team.
Well-articulated problem
[Slide 9] An elegant outline of the problem at hand. Image Credits: Nokod.A good fundraising story will have a good explanation of what the problem is and why it might be worth solving. Not everything on this list is well explained. To wit: Do you, without googling, know what PII is, or, indeed, why collection and storage of PII might be a bad thing?
The company could have taken the effort to explain the impact of some of these issues and why low- and no-code apps are particularly vulnerable in these situations, but I get the message in broad strokes: The cost of embracing no-code and low-code is that people might not always know exactly what’s going on, and if something does happen, it can be hard to figure out exactly where the ne’er-do-wells gained entry to a system.
A better go-to-market slide than most
[Slide 16] Let’s sell this thing. Image Credits: Nokod 

			This go-to-market slide has a clear profile of the customer: how they can be reached, what the business model is and where they are geographically. 					


Building a coherent go-to-market strategy can be surprisingly hard. It’s what I end up arguing about with my pitch coaching clients most often. Having some vague, hand-wavy “build it and they will come” theory works when you are focusing on the product, but if you are raising money to acquire customers, you don’t get to shrug and say, “We will figure it out when we get there.” You aren’t getting there. You are raising money to execute, so you are there.
This go-to-market slide has a clear profile of the customer: how they can be reached, what the business model is, where they are geographically and even who the decision-maker is within the business. I’m not sure how many medium-sized companies have a CISO or director of application security. I suspect a lot of the time, these decisions fall to a CTO rather than a dedicated, clearly defined security role.
Still, as an investor, I can look at this and see the outline of a plan. My next question would be: “Okay, talk me through your process. How do you actually land a sale?” The story should be consistent and outline a good sales funnel — something like, “The leads come from X, we reach the decision maker through A, B and C, and then we close the deal 25% of the time. But we suspect we can increase that percentage if we do Y and Z.” An answer like that will pass muster for me, and doubly so if the company already has paying customers and can point to the sales process it used.
In the rest of this teardown, we’ll take a look at three things Nokod could have improved or done differently, along with its full pitch deck!

"TechCrunch+ roundup: J-1 visa details, how to close a Series B in 2023, moving for tax savings",Walter Thompson,2023/07/07,"
Remote-work startups were a hot commodity when the pandemic began, but in the post-vaccine era, many investors and founders are reconsidering their enthusiasm, Rebecca Szkutak reports.
“If I looked at all the companies that are actually categorized as remote work, you’d see this little tip of the iceberg,” said Kevin Spain, a general partner at Emergence Capital. “Below that there are a lot of other companies effectively following and benefiting from that trend.”

Some companies working on hybrid workplace solutions “have pivoted out of the category,” others have reduced staff, and “one virtual office startup recently sold off its IP and transitioned to AI,” wrote Rebecca.
“It’s hard to pin the exact numbers on it,” writes Rebecca, “but there are signs that things aren’t going well for many remote work startups.”

I’m currently in the U.S. on a B-1/B-2 visitor visa. The sponsoring company would like me to start in August. I heard it can take several months to change my status to a J-1. Is there a way to get a J-1 faster?
Is there anything I should know about the J-1, particularly if I later decide to stay in the U.S. once the J-1 program ends?

Should you move to a new state for tax savings before selling your startup?
Image Credits: Catherine Falls Commercial (opens in a new window) / Getty Images
Once an acquisition is in the works, it’s natural for founders to start safeguarding their newfound wealth.
“On a $30 million exit, a founder could save approximately $4.3 million by moving from California to Florida or approximately $4.4 million by moving from New York City to Florida,” writes Peyton Carr, managing director of Keystone Global Partners.
“That’s a lot of incentive to pull up the stakes and head to Miami,” but unless you follow state-level guidelines about where you spend time and generate income, “your move is likely to trigger an audit.”

If I were a tech investor, there’s no way I’d sign a non-disclosure agreement.
Presumably, I’d be meeting with hundreds of founders each year. Signing an NDA might preclude me from doing another deal with someone else working in a similar space: why would I ever agree to that?
According to Haje Jan Kamps, entrepreneurs should only ask for an NDA when disclosing “the details of your tech with anyone outside your company.”

VC Office Hours: Fabrice do Rego on building one of the few Black-led funds in the EU,Dominic-Madori Davis,2023/07/07,"
Before he became one of the few Black fund managers in the EU, Fabrice do Rego had quite a long career in finance. He started off with Lehman Brothers, before moving to stints at Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, and eventually founding M&A advisory firm Valmeon Corporate Finance.
But during all his years analyzing M&A deals and corporations, do Rego rarely saw people who looked like him in that industry. That realization, he tells me, inspired him to start The Blueprint VC with Ibrahim Ouassari to back founders from under-represented backgrounds in France and Belgium.
For do Rego, the logic behind launching The Blueprint is simple: Mixed teams with diverse backgrounds are known to perform well, yet capital allocation to such teams is still low. “There’s a lot of money being left on the table,” he said. So, he decided, literally, to go get that money.
Launched in December 2021, The Blueprint started raising a €25 million fund last January, which the founders hope to invest in 30 companies within the next four years. They’ve already backed two.
The firm likes to invest in mixed teams of diverse origins, mostly focused on gender and ethnicity. The Blueprint focuses on seed and pre-seed rounds, writes checks ranging from €100,000 to €400,000, and has a reserve for follow-on investments. It’s sector-agnostic but does not invest in deep tech or biotech at the moment.
I recently caught up with do Rego to talk about his work with The Blueprint, surviving the venture downturn and the best way to cultivate the next generation of talent in the EU.
(Note: The following interview has been edited lightly for length and clarity.)
TechCrunch: You’ve been raising this €25 million fund for about a year, with a diversity-focused investment thesis on a continent with noted issues regarding equity and inclusion for marginalized groups. What has the process of approaching limited partners been like?
Fabrice do Rego: It has been much more difficult than what I expected.
We have a great team, and I thought with such a team, it would be easy. But we faced some odd times raising the fund, especially with institutions. Their first question was the “pipeline problem” [asking if there was enough diverse talent to fund in France and Belgium].
Another thing that was difficult is the difference between continental Europe and the U.S. or maybe even the U.K. — we don’t yet have a super strong and wealthy community of Black people who are connected to each other. That is something we lack, and when you want to raise the first fund [for something like The Blueprint], that’s the type of LP you need to have for your first millions.
The minimum target size of our fund is €25 million. Anything below that threshold, it’s super hard to have a professional fund. We wanted our first close to be €12 million, and we will probably reduce it to €10 million because we want to deploy as much as possible, fast. "
Web3 games don’t need to highlight blockchain elements to succeed,Jacquelyn Melinek,2023/07/07,"

Blockchain-based games want to go mainstream, but the million-dollar question is: What’s the best way to do it?
According to some web3 game developers, there might not be just one right answer.
To win Web 2.0 audiences over, it appears the industry will have to meet them where they are. To do that, web3 game devs should move web3 components to the back end and avoid promoting games as being based on web3, according to Sumeet Patel, founder of NFT-based algorithmic prediction game Exiled Racers.
That makes sense to me. When using applications, people don’t really care about what’s going on behind the scenes. They just want something that’s easy to use and does what they want it to. While some people may want to understand the technology and dive deep, the majority don’t really care.
“It doesn’t sound good, but gaming doesn’t need blockchain today, but blockchain does need gaming,” said Nicholas Douzinas, business development and growth lead at decentralized gaming platform Ajuna Network.
The global gaming industry is expected to grow from $282 billion in 2023 to $666 billion by 2030, as more people increasingly choose video games as their primary form of entertainment, and 4G-enabled smartphones enable people everywhere to indulge in mobile games, according to a report by Fortune Business Insights.
But blockchain gaming wasn’t even mentioned as a trend or driving factor for gaming growth. I think that’s fair because it’s such a small fraction of the market and has a long way to go before it can even make a dent in the industry.
“NFTs mean nothing to gaming; some people don’t care about ownership,” said Douzinas. But on the other side of the spectrum, some people want to engage deeply with web3 technology, he noted.
Ajuna Network aims to attract people who are interested in web3 technology and blockchains but are comfortable with owning a token and the possibilities that come with it, Douzinas said.
Not all gaming companies are taking that route. "

SVB’s collapse drove 26K customers to Mercury in 4 months,Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/07/07,"
When Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March, a flurry of startups rushed to step in to help fill a gap in the startup and venture capital community.
One of those startups, Mercury, in particular found itself in the position of trying to meet a sudden surge of demand amidst the panic.
“The craziest time was the first five days,” recalls CEO and co-founder Immad Akhund. “It started Wednesday night — where it was very stressful and not just from Mercury’s perspective, but all of Silicon Valley was holding their breath. People were worried about what was going to happen next.”
Akhund says he spent most of his time those first few days on calls and responding to direct messages from existing and potentially new customers.
“People were very stressed and saying ‘I need a bank account now,’” he says. “Every question had this urgency.”
In response, Mercury — working with partner banks Choice Financial Group and Evolve Bank & Trust — upped its FDIC insurance, first from $1 million to $3 million and then to $5 million. It also released a new product called Vault, so people could park their cash beyond those amounts into U.S. government treasury bills.
Still, one of the questions that kept coming up, according to Akhund, was, “If SVB is failing, why is Mercury safe?” The question was fair, in his view, considering that Mercury itself is a startup.
In the first few days after the collapse, the company saw more than $2 billion in deposits. And in all of March, Mercury saw nearly 8,700 new customers depositing funds into its accounts.
“It was by far our biggest month we’ve had at Mercury, a huge inflow,” Akhund recalls. “We tried to prioritize people coming from SVB and even built some tools so they could connect to SVB accounts.”
But it wasn’t a short-term boom, something that Akhund was worried about.
The company claims that 95% of its net new customers have stayed with Mercury nearly 90 days out from the SVB crisis and that those deposits have held steady. Also, that new customer growth has continued even after the SVB crisis has settled, with the company having doubled new signups per month since April — leading to 17,000 total new customers depositing funds from April to June, a figure that Akhund shared with TechCrunch exclusively. Its total customer base includes businesses such as including Deel, On Deck, Linear, Sprig and Forage. The company says it crossed the 100,000 customer mark in 2022.
That recent surge of customers has contributed to the company’s annualized revenue run rate growing 4x year-over-year from May 2022 to May 2023, Akhund told TechCrunch. Overall, in 2022, Mercury processed $50 billion in transactions. In the first half of 2023 alone, the company has processed more than $42 billion in transactions. Mercury also, he said, has been profitable for the last 12 months. He declined to say how many customers the company specifically has today, saying only that it is “over 100,000.”
Further, according to data obtained from Kruze Consulting, more than 30% of Kruze’s clients now have a Mercury account, up from 17% at the end of February — the highest share of any neobank or bank, according to Mercury.
While Mercury is open to any U.S. business, its focus is on startups and e-commerce companies, which make up 70% of its customer base. Startups in particular, Mercury touts, have unique needs that many claim big banks are unable to adequately meet.
“We were already growing and we saw an approximately 20% jump because of what happened with SVB,” Akhund said. “It’s obviously kind of been an inflection point, and we’ve kind of sped up after this.”
Since its 2017 inception, Mercury has raised over $163 million in funding from investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, Coatue and CRV as well as angel investors, athletes, entertainers and customers. Its last round was a $120 million Series B that was announced in July of 2021.
I dug into all these details and much more with Akhund on Equity Podcast, which you can listen to here.

Reporter’s note: The story was updated post-publication to correct the number of customers that Mercury has.

Google’s Gradient Ventures backs Weflow to bring greater hygiene to Salesforce data,Paul Sawers,2023/07/07,"
Google’s venture capital arm Gradient Ventures has made another foray into Europe, investing as part of a $3.2 million seed round in two-year-old German startup Weflow.
Weflow is the latest in a line of ecosystem startups to emerge from frustrations with using the omnipresent CRM (customer relationship management) software that is Salesforce. These venture-backed upstarts focus on things like providing data backups or improving lead generation, while just last week a new company called Unaric emerged out of stealth with $35 million for the express purpose of buying and consolidating Salesforce-ecosystem startups.
Yes, Salesforce-focused tools are big business, with some estimates pegging the market value at four times that of Salesforce itself.
Weflow, for its part, is setting out to improve sales teams’ efficiency, pipeline visibility and general “Salesforce data hygiene,” according to Weflow co-founder and CEO Janis Zech, who likens his platform to something akin to “Notion for revenue teams.”
“[The main problem we solve is] helping companies to forecast their pipeline accurately — this typically requires capturing sales data, both structured and unstructured, surfacing deal insights and pipeline analytics to run forecast predictions,” Zech explained to TechCrunch.
Show me the data
The ultimate problem that Weflow seeks to fix is that of the sheer spread of data across the B2B sales sphere, spanning the countless meetings, emails and calls leading to a deal’s conclusion. Weflow promises to bring this data together within a coherent structure to deliver insights.
To do this, Weflow has developed what it calls a “revenue workspace,” pitched as an all-encompassing platform that allows companies to capture CRM data while serving up deal insights and tools for managing their sales pipeline. More recently, the company introduced collaborative forecasting and pipeline analytics, too.
Under the hood, Weflow uses AI to allocate what it calls a “deal score,” which is effectively a prediction that considers things like buying signals, sales activities and historical data to forecast the likelihood of a deal closing. In the future, Zech says the platform will also lean on AI to forecast future revenues, as well as leverage unstructured email data and even video/call transcripts to uncover hidden deal insights.

‘Salesforce fatigue’
Although Zech and his two co-founders, Henrik Basten and Philipp Stelzer, launched Weflow in 2021, the Berlin-based startup has been years in the making, built on frustrations Zech experienced at an adtech startup he founded in 2009 called Fyber (then known as SponsorPay).
“Experiencing severe ‘Salesforce fatigue’ at Fyber, we realized CRMs have become clunky infrastructure, not places to effectively work on deals and drive sales performance,” Zech said. “It’s a problem that affects most companies’ top lines.”
Zech eventually sold Fyber for €150 million in 2014, and in the intervening years he invested both as an angel and partner at Point Nine Capital. More recently, he co-founded a startup studio that birthed a company called Back, which Gradient Ventures also invested in before it was acquired by Personio last May.
As for Weflow, there are clear similarities to other tools on the market already, including venture-backed Salesforce ecosystem company Scratchpad, and revenue forecasting unicorn Clari. According to Zech, Weflow’s main selling point over incumbents in the space include per-user pricing transparency (e.g. Clari seemingly only offers a “get quote” button, while Scratchpad invites would-be customers to “schedule a demo”). Additionally, Weflow offers workflow tools such as a task manager, notepad and a Chrome extension to easily integrate with Gmail and Google Calendar.
The Google factor
Securing Google’s VC off-shoot as a lead backer is a major coup for any young startup, opening doors to potential new partners and customers, among other commercial benefits.
While the lion’s share of Gradient’s investments hail from the U.S., it’s no stranger to the European startup scene. Last month, we learned it had invested in Versed, a Dutch startup developing tools to help anyone create video games using generative AI. And last year it backed U.K. insurance tech startup Penny, as well as Germany’s Gigs, which wants to make it easier to launch a mobile network.
Prior to all this, Gradient has also invested in Denmark’s Contractbook, Kaizo from the Netherlands, Finland’s Oura and, as noted, Germany’s Back Technologies.
Prior to now, Weflow had raised $2.7 million in pre-seed funding back in 2021; with its fresh cash injection it said that it’s looking to further invest in its AI efforts, bringing it to other areas of its platform.
Aside from lead investor Gradient Ventures, Weflow’s seed round included contributions from existing investor Cherry Ventures, Hello World and several angel investors.

SpeedyBrand uses generative AI to create SEO-optimized content,Kyle Wiggers,2023/07/07,"
While working at Vetan, a startup helping small- and medium-sized (SMBs) businesses manage employee payroll, Ranti Dev Sharma realized that SMBs often lack the tools to thrive online with organic sales. The cost to hire an agency is beyond their budget, and generating content is costly — both in terms of time and money.
“Having a great online presence is critical for e-commerce stores like Shopify and Woo, as online traffic is the bread and butter of their business,” Sharma told TechCrunch in an email interview. “But existing content marketing solutions are not complete and require search engine optimization (SEO) expertise. Businesses need multiple SEO tools and to hire content strategists, writers and agencies to outsource their content marketing work.”
So along with Jatin Mehta and Ayush Jasuja, Sharma co-founded SpeedyBrand, which aims to bring “high-quality,” affordable SEO content to SMBs using generative AI. SpeedyBrand today announced that it raised $2.5 million in a funding round led by GV (Google’s venture arm) and Y Combinator that values the company at $15 million post-money.
SpeedyBrand’s platform, powered by generative AI, can create custom SEO-optimized content — including websites and social media posts — for brands. Brands first choose a topic. Then they have the platform generate text and suggest images that might be appropriate for the type of content they’re generating.
From SpeedyBrand’s dashboard, generated content can be edited and further customized before being published to various channels. An analytics component allows brands to track the performance of the content once it’s live.
“The economic slowdown requires cost-effective marketing solutions,” Sharma said. “Speedy is well-positioned to help businesses with an affordable solution.”
But there’s reason to be wary of the tech.
For one, generative AI, no matter how good, can — and does — run amok. Thanks to a phenomenon known as “hallucination,” AI models sometimes confidently make up facts. And, as a result of biases and other imbalances in their training data, text-generating AI can spew toxic, wildly offensive remarks.
In another potential problem for brands, generative AI has been shown to plagiarize copyrighted work. One study found that an indirect predecessor to ChatGPT, GPT-2, can be prompted to “copy and paste” entire paragraphs from its training data.
Then there’s the matter of generative AI spamming up the internet. As The Verge’s James Vincent wrote in a recent piece, generative AI models are changing the economy of the web — making it cheaper and easier to generate lower-quality content. Newsguard, a company that provides tools for vetting news sources, has exposed hundreds of ad-supported sites with generic-sounding names featuring misinformation created with generative AI.
Sharma asserts that SpeedyBrand isn’t a content mill — and that it takes steps to mitigate any toxic content that the platform’s AI might generate. SpeedyBrand’s AI can be personalized to brand tone and generates provably “plagiarism-free” content, he claims, incorporating feedback from content edits to improve future output.
To what extent is all this true? It’s tough to say without a third-party audit. But brands, no doubt eager to jump on the generative AI train, appear to be embracing SpeedyBrand.
The company, which has a six-person team, has around 50 paying customers and over 1,000 users. Annual recurring revenue stands at $100,000, and Sharma anticipates that it’ll reach $1 million in the next year.
That’s impressive considering the competition. SpeedyBrand faces off against Typeface, which recently emerged from stealth with $65 million in venture capital. Startups like Movio, Copysmith, Copy.ai, Sellscale, Jasper, Omneky and Regie.ai, too, are using generative AI to create (ostensibly) better marketing copy, imagery and even video for ads, websites and emails.
It’s a large and growing market. Statista reports that 87% of current AI adopters are already using, or considering using, AI for improving their email marketing. Another report projects that the market for generative AI will be worth more than $110 billion by 2030.
Given that almost half of SMB owners handle content marketing themselves, there’s even stronger incentive within that cohort to adopt tools that could — at least on the surface — save time, money and massive headache.
“Speedy saves a company’s marketing workforce hours of marketing hustle — from strategy to content generation and then posting,” Sharma said. “Speedy gives them and their team hours back every day so they can focus on the core of their business.”
With the proceeds from the funding round, SpeedyBrand plans to roll out additional tools for text and image generation.

Indonesian aquaculture startup eFishery nets $200M at unicorn valuation,Catherine Shu,2023/07/07,"
After reports that it is raising new funding, Indonesian aquaculture startup eFishery announced today that it has netted $200 million in a Series D. The company, which makes a smart feeding system for fisheries, says this makes it the first startup in the global aquaculture industry to pass a $1 billion valuation. Its goal is to reach one million aquaculture ponds in Indonesia by 2025 and expand overseas.
The funding was led by Abu Dhabi-based 42XFund and included participation from Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan), Malaysia’s largest public sector pension fund, Swiss asset manager responsibility and 500 Global. Existing investors Northstar, Temasek and SoftBank also returned for the round, with Goldman Sachs acting as an exclusive financial advisor to eFishery. TechCrunch last covered the startup when it announced its $90 million Series C in January 2022.
eFishery cites a study by the Demographic Institute of the University of Indonesia (LDUI) that showed in 2022, eFishery contributed 1.55% to Indonesia’s gross domestic product in the aquaculture sector. This is significant because Indonesia has the second largest fishing and aquaculture industry in the world, ranking only behind China. According to the World Atlas, the country produces 5.8 million tons of fish each year.
Founded in Bandung, West Java in 2013 by CEO Gibran Huzaifah (pictured above), the fishery currently serves 70,000 fish and shrimp farmers in 280 cities across Indonesia. In addition to its IoT auto feeding system, eFishery’s platform includes marketplaces for selling fish and shrimp feed to farmers, fresh fish and shrimp products to B2B consumers and financial products for fish farmers.
Huzaifah started a catfish farming business when he was still in college. He told TechCrunch that during that time, he learned that feed management is crucial because 80% of total cost production is allocated to feeding. But many farmers still do hand feeding, resulting in uneven sizes of fish because not all get the same amount of food.
This is a problem because buyers have specific sizes of fish they want to purchase. Underfeeding isn’t the only problem, however — overfeeding results in nutrient runoff that pollutes water.
Huzaifah saw how tech was disrupting sectors like commerce, financial services and media, but “fish farming practice never changed in the last 30 years. I found it quite ironic that many innovations are developed to solve issues for urban citizens, like online shopping and food deliveries, but the essential sectors, such as agriculture and aquaculture, see almost zero digital innovation.”
After developing eFishery’s smart feeding system, however, Huzaifah faced resistance from fish farmers. After months of convincing them, “they finally wanted to try, not because they believed in the technology but because they pitied me.” One reason was that many farmers were not regular internet users. “I remember we had this Internet 101 with the farmers,” Huzaifah said. “We showed them how to create an email, use Facebook, get information from YouTube and other stuff.”
Even though Indonesia’s aquaculture is already very large, Huzaifah said it has only reached 7% to 9% of its total potential. Some challenges it faces includes fragmentation. Huzaifah explains that Indonesia has 34 provinces with different business practices, so it has to localize for each one.
“I learned the hard way that we have to respect the local players, including using local dialect and building relationships with the middlemen,” he said. “In one case, some middlemen poisoned our ponds. After having a discussion with them, we understood that they just want to do business, that they’re also entrepreneurs. So we found a way to turn them into our local partners because they have the local wisdom, connections assets and so on.”
At farms, feeding accounts for 70% to 90% of total production cost and much of it is still done manually, just as when Huzaifah was running his catfish farm. eFisheryFeeder automatically distributes feed to fish and shrimp and helps farmers control feed by sensing fish appetite through vibrations, which increase as they get hungry. The system allows farmers to manage ponds from their smartphones and collects data like daily fish usage, the type and brand of feed, how many fish have been produced, fish behavior and appetite, stock density and mortality rate.
With aquaculture so important to Indonesia’s economy, other tech startups are addressing different aspects of the industry. In addition to eFishery, startups that have recently raised funding include Aruna, Delos and FishLog.
In order to improve Indonesia’s aquaculture industry and increase the amount of fish it exports, Hazaifah said communities, the government and institutions have to work together to improve fishery operation infrastructure so they can handle larger volumes of fish and improve product quality.
The country should encourage sustainable aquaculture practices, like training, promoting advanced techniques and ensuring access to quality fish seed, to increase fish production, and also engage in trade negotiations to get more buyers. efishery plans to expand overseas by exporting fully traceable, antibiotic-free shrimp.
In a statement about the funding, 42XFund principal Iman Adiwibowo said, “The technology and comprehensive aquaculture solutions provided by eFishery have made a significant impact on the aquatech industry and have benefited small farmers in Indonesia. We are confident that eFishery will continue to promote a sustainable and inclusive economy, as well as contribute to environmental preservation goals not only in Indonesia but beyond.”

"Deel under fire for alleged questionable hiring practices, advice to other companies",Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/07/06,"
A California Senator is urging the state’s Labor and Workforce Development Agency to conduct an investigation into the business practices of fintech turned HR startup Deel.
Last week, Senator Steve Padilla (D-San Diego) sent a letter to Stewart Knox, California Secretary of Labor, alleging that Deel has hired hundreds of employees but classified them as independent contractors. By doing so, Senator Padilla charged, Deel is “effectively denying them the full suite of employment and social safety net benefits and labor protections they are entitled to, including healthcare, retirement, unemployment insurance, worker’s compensation, collective bargaining, and overtime pay.”
Further, Senator Padilla claimed that Deel “appears” to be advising its own customers (which include the likes of Nike, Subway, Reebok, Forever 21 and Klarna) “to misclassify their own employees and evade taxes in California,” as well as avoid paying employee benefits. Earlier this month, according to Padilla, Deel CEO Alex Bouaziz encouraged companies to leverage “the different ways of employing someone or assigning them as an independent contractor…..and therefore don’t put as much tax liability into your company.” He also encouraged companies to “spend some time on this topic” and offered to provide this as a service, stating “we can do that for you.” 
TechCrunch reached out to Deel for comment and Elisabeth Diana, a company spokesperson, provided the following statement:
“These allegations are completely made up and regurgitated from old news, most likely based on competitor hearsay. Compliance is literally what we do, in over 120 countries. We have to understand it for our customers, and we certainly practice it ourselves. Today we have over 50 compliance experts in house and an external network of country advisors. To advise clients on how to misclassify their workers would be at complete odds with our business model. We’ve also created a consortium with external academics called the Deel Lab for Global Employment to study and help prevent misclassification practices. In California we engage a handful of contractors for services, and in the US, contractors represent less than 1% of our workforce. Claims of misclassification there are ridiculous. Unfortunately Senator Padilla did not reach out to us for comment or facts prior to publishing his letter. We welcome speaking with him directly to provide factual information.”
The spotlight on Deel’s hiring practices came to light earlier this year when Insider published an article revealing, among other things, that even CEO and co-founder Alex Bouaziz was classified as an independent contractor. According to Senator Padilla, several employees “have reported being shocked to learn they had been hired as long–term contractors despite originally applying as full-time employees, and without the ability to choose.” Senator Padilla’s office told TechCrunch that the politician has asked for an investigation to determine if the practices mentioned in the article are accurate.
Many of the company’s employees, he said, have access to a range of benefits, including unlimited paid-time off, wellness stipends and reimbursements for gym memberships and doctor’s appointments. But, Senator Padilla alleged, they “continue to be denied the full suite of employment and social safety net benefits and labor protections they are entitled to, including healthcare, retirement, unemployment insurance, worker’s compensation, collective bargaining, and overtime pay, among others.”
“No company is above the law. Deel has been openly flaunting their violation of California labor laws, intentionally misclassifying their employees as independent contractors and denying them critical benefits,” said Senator Padilla in a press release. “California is clear on this issue; employees are entitled to benefits and protections. Corporations engaging in malicious employment schemes like this need to be held accountable and these employees need to see their rights restored.”
In January, TechCrunch reported that Deel had reached $295 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) by the end of 2022 and that it was profitable, according to Bouaziz. The startup, which offers global payroll and other services to companies around the world, was valued at $12 billion at the time of its last raise, although its current valuation is not known. It operates with a SaaS business model, meaning that it charges a subscription fee for its software.
Bouaziz and Shuo Wang started remote-first, San Francisco-based Deel in 2019 as an employer of record (EOR) — with the mission of allowing businesses to hire employees and contractors in other countries “in less than five minutes.” Deel also says that it gives companies the ability to pay teams in more than 150 currencies with “just a click.” It has since evolved its strictly fintech model to what it describes as a “full-stack,” “truly global HR platform” designed “to compliantly manage your entire workforce in just one system—from direct employees to international workers and everything in between.” It has more than 2,000 employees in 90 countries. 
Senator Dave Cortese (D-San Jose), chair of the Senate Labor, Public Employment and Retirement Committee, stated that an independent contractor is “a specific designation for self-employed people or businesses engaged in contract work.”
He added: “It’s not a gimmick for organizations to avoid paying for employee healthcare and other benefits or reducing their tax liability…Any company found breaking the law will be brought to justice, and they would certainly have no business advising other companies on labor law.”
Reporter’s note: TechCrunch was informed after this article was published that  Stewart Knox, California Secretary of Labor, had responded to Senator Pedilla’s letter with his own letter saying: “I take seriously the responsibility to ensure that workers receive their earned pay and benefits and that law-abiding employers compete on a level playing field. We are looking into the information that you provided and will follow up with our findings.”

So, how are Europe’s startups doing?
Pitch Deck Teardown: Nokod Security’s $8M seed deck



Whenever I spend time in the European startup world, a lot of the conversation is focused on how it can differentiate itself. One of the recurring questions is: How do we build a startup ecosystem? That’s an excellent question.
The beginnings of an ecosystem are there, but unlike in the U.S., where there are a handful of major hubs attracting the bulk of the talent and investment, in Europe, there is an appetite for experimentation that fails to fully settle into a coherent whole.
Looking to Silicon Valley might be a trope, but the San Francisco Bay Area is by far the most mature ecosystem around. California attracted more than $100 billion of venture investment in 2022. New York is in a distant second place with around $30 billion, followed by Massachusetts (or more specifically, Boston), with around $20 billion. Europe, in comparison, saw around $100 billion of investment in 2022. That sounds like a big number, but compare the size of the economy of Europe versus that of California.
Europe may be in a state of rapid growth, but as an asset class, VC is lagging behind. For every person living in Europe, $134 dollars are invested in the local ecosystem. For California, the same number is $2,650. Image Credit: Haje Kamps / TechCrunch
You can find office buildings and fast internet in most places, so how did a sprawling area around San Francisco become a working ecosystem? The history is long and complex, and hard to replicate: Stanford University engineering professor Frederick Terman was focusing on radio engineering in the 1940s. Fueled by the Cold War and a lot of defense money, he built a department and taught a bunch of the people who would found the first wave of tech startups in the area.
Stanford created a business park to go along with its research activities, and it kept evolving with the times. The region found itself in an upward spiral: More money invested meant that more engineering talent flocked to Silicon Valley, which sparked more innovation, which led to more tech companies, which in turn meant more defense money and the first few private investors looking to Silicon Valley for opportunities. Lockheed opened a plant in Sunnyvale, mostly because that’s where it could find engineers. Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard founded HP in 1939, and Shockley Semiconductors was founded in 1956 — the same year its namesake, William Shockley, was awarded the Nobel Prize for co-inventing the transistor. Early employees at Shockley left to found AMD and Intel, and from there, the rest is history: Silicon Valley had such a concentration of funds, talent and tech, that it was almost unstoppable.
Fast-forward some 70 years and Silicon Valley has only continued to grow. For startups, the way this shows up is that a lot of people got very wealthy from tech, and they further accelerated the ecosystem by founding new companies. But — crucially — they also became angel investors and advisers to others in the ecosystem. And because those acquiring other businesses are also often based in Silicon Valley, integrating the tech and the staff becomes a lot easier.
So how does this relate to Europe? Well, according to top European VC Creandum’s recent report, there are 65 cities hosting 514 “tech hubs” on the continent. Of course, it’s positive that the European startup scene is evolving and growing, but even after a couple decades of trying to make ecosystems thrive, Europe appears to be spinning its wheels. According to the report, “Europe finally has the pieces in place to challenge the US as the world’s leading tech ecosystem.” It sounds good, but there’s still a lot of work to be done before there’s a fully functioning, self-sustaining startup ecosystem in place. The truth is, every locale is trying to do it differently. That means there can’t be a single, force-of-nature strength ecosystem; instead, the result is a smattering of promising ecosystems that don’t truly get the job done.

15 investors lift the lid on the biggest surprises of H1 2023,Karan Bhasin,2023/07/06,"
The first half of 2023 hasn’t been kind to startups, but venture capital investors weren’t spared migraines either. Some VCs had a tough time of it, with their portfolio companies finding it hard to fundraise, while others dialed back their investment cadence to match the current investment climate. But what would they have done differently if they had a crystal ball? To find out, we asked 15 investors what they found to be the most unexpected trends of the year so far.
Rather unsurprisingly, the biggest surprises all seem to be related to AI in one way or another. Several investors said while they were caught unawares by how quickly generative AI took off, the real eyebrow-raiser was VC funds going from a conservative stance to jumping headfirst into AI-related companies’ cap tables seemingly overnight.
“The No. 1 surprise has been the speed of financings and valuations in the generative AI space. Probably no surprise there. But it really is a tale of ‘haves and have-nots’ in fundraising right now,” said Matt Murphy, partner at Menlo Ventures.

We’re looking for founders to participate in a TechCrunch+ survey about the usefulness of various founder-focused events.
If you’re a founder and have something to share about your experiences at such events, fill out this form.

Jenny He, founder and general partner at Position Ventures, had a similar take: “I was surprised at how quickly the AI boom happened in 2023 and how many top tier firms went from a wait and see approach at the end of 2022 to becoming very active in 2023. Some of our portfolio companies went from quiet insider rounds to very hot competitive rounds at a rapid markup at the beginning of 2023, spurred by the AI boom.”
Not all AI-related surprises were positive, though. John Tough, managing partner at Energize Ventures, was baffled by how readily some firms cannibalized their climate funds to buy into AI. “We knew generalist investor interest in climate was fleeting, but it has still been surprising to see how many household names planned to launch a climate focus area and then moved along to LLMs and AI instead,” he said.
For Rajeev Dham, partner at Sapphire Ventures, this rapid increase in AI investment also brought some worries. “There’s no question that advancements in AI will spawn an incredible set of companies, disrupt industries and be the transformative technology that drives far more productivity within existing companies, but my concern is that we’re still in the very first inning, which will lead to a lot of lost capital,” he said.
It wasn’t all about AI, though. Mark Grace, an investor at M13, was surprised by the range of early-stage valuations: “Valuation ranges are all over the place, especially at the Series A stage. We all know how quiet the later stages have been, and the seed market has seemed strangely resilient. However it has been interesting to see the wide variance in Series A pricing.”
As for what investors wish they’d done differently, several felt they should have been faster on the uptake and more active than they were. “In macro environments like this one you always regret not being more active while everyone else was fearful,” said Logan Allin, managing partner and founder at Fin Capital. “These cycles only come around so often and are a boon for net-new investments in portfolios.”
Jason Lemkin, CEO and founder of SaaStr, wishes he had taken the time to meet with more founders. “I slowed down in 2022 as did many, and should have picked it up more. Multiples are still relatively low in SaaS but great companies are being formed as often as ever.”
But our favorite answer to this question by far came from Howie Diamond, managing director and general partner at Pure Ventures: “Not have personally invested in First Republic Bank stock!”

We’re curious if you’ve run into any surprises in the startup investing world thus far in 2023.

The No. 1 surprise has been the speed of financings and valuations in the generative AI space. Probably no surprise there. But, it really is a tale of “haves” and “have-nots” in fundraising right now.
The No. 2 surprise is the scarcity of later-stage companies raising. It’s not that surprising, but behind the scenes, companies are still getting their houses in order, and it’s really difficult to sell right now, so companies are grinding through things until they find more predictability.
No. 3 would be the amount of M&A and companies trying to be acquired. We’re only going to see that accelerate.
In hindsight, what do you wish you had done differently in the first six months of 2023?
We mobilized the entire firm around GenAI and it paid off. We’ve got a strong portfolio and continue to invest. We’ve even got a handful of investors who are attending hackathons and coding in their free time. I only wish we’d started building that pipeline more purposefully in 2022. So many of these businesses are being started by founders leaving companies with pockets of AI talent, so you really need to be focused upstream on founders before there is even a full twinkle in the eye.

We’re curious if you’ve run into any surprises in the startup investing world thus far in 2023.
Startup investing in 2023 has been defined by difficult macroeconomic headwinds on one hand and accelerating AI tailwinds on the other. The dichotomy has created a startup investing environment of haves and have-nots that has been quite interesting and, to some extent, surprising.
I’m surprised that the AI conversation is not centered more on the potential of AI for good. There are intractable problems that society has yet to solve where AI could offer a breakthrough. Technology has a history of presenting these types of breakthroughs and thus has been a harbinger of optimism.
AI is no different, and I see education as a prime example of where AI could offer every child individualized instruction that addresses their style of learning, pacing needs, and adaptive modalities. This could advance education practices for all learners and provide the inalienable right to education for all offered by a good society.
I’m obsessed with thinking through these types of scenarios and working on them, as AI will offer many breakthroughs for the world.
In hindsight, what do you wish you had done differently in the first six months of 2023?
While we spent time on it, we wish we had spent even more time with academics and researchers at top-tier institutions focused on AI. We believe a good subset of the AI generation’s decacorns will originate from deep technical research, much of which is in academic research labs today.

Should you move to a new state for tax savings before selling your startup?,Peyton Carr,2023/07/06,"

How much tax will you owe when you sell your company?
With a Section 1045 rollover, founders can salvage QSBS before 5 years



For company founders and shareholders with an exit on the horizon, this isn’t a myth — a move for tax reasons can make a lot of financial sense.
In tech hubs like the Bay Area and New York City, the highest tax brackets are at 14.4% (as of January 1, 2024) and 14.8%, respectively. In contrast, states like Florida and Texas have no state income tax, meaning there’s no capital gains tax at the state level.
Let’s consider the numbers: On a $30 million exit, a founder could save approximately $4.3 million by moving from California to Florida or approximately $4.4 million by moving from New York City to Florida. That’s a lot of incentive to pull up the stakes and head to Miami.
However, many times it’s not that simple. We all know that moving can be a tough decision, especially for those with strong roots in their community. Leaving behind your favorite golf course, local ski mountain, and your friend group can have a serious impact on your quality of life. And it can be heart-wrenching to pull your kids away from the home, friends, and school they know and love.
This is where some people can get into trouble.
What you need to know about moving to save on taxes
Paying less in taxes isn’t as simple as packing up, skipping town, and resurfacing with a new address in a tax-friendlier state.
As tempting as it may be, you can’t keep a foothold in Silicon Valley while dipping your toe in the Gulf Coast — and still save on taxes. The kids may be unable to stay in their Manhattan private school while you relocate to Miami.
 

			As tempting as it may be, you can’t keep a foothold in Silicon Valley while dipping your toe in the Gulf Coast — and still save on taxes.					


Living in both states won’t save you here; when it comes to taxes, you must be all-in at your new address, or you’ll likely owe taxes at your old address.  Unfortunately, some may not realize this until after they have spent a lot of time, money, and emotional investment.
Every state has its own rules for determining your residency for tax purposes, and you will not be able to fly under the radar if you’re a high-net-worth individual or top earner. High-tax states like New York or California pay especially close attention to those in the highest tax bracket. If you stop paying taxes at the state level, chances are the state will notice and challenge your new residency claim.
In other words, your move is likely to trigger an audit.
In particular, California’s Franchise Tax Board is known to be vigilant in monitoring individuals who attempt to terminate their California residence, making it all the more crucial to thoroughly plan and document your move.
Additionally, it’s important to consider the complexities of community property laws, which may impact your tax exposure if you have a spouse residing in California, even if you move to a lower-tax state. Proper legal and tax advice is essential to navigate these complexities and ensure a smooth transition.
Many people mistakenly think that splitting time between states and claiming the more favorable tax jurisdiction is easy. But when you have the means to travel and maintain more than one home, this doesn’t mean you get to choose the domicile that works most favorably for you when tax time comes. Simply spending 183 days of the year outside your high-tax state isn’t likely going to shrink your tax obligation.
Even after leaving high-tax states like New York or California, it’s important to be aware of potential tax obligations tied to passive income sources within those states. For example, if you continue to have passive income from partnerships, investment properties, or other sources within New York or California, you’ll need to file a nonresident return and pay taxes on that income in those states.
Additionally, having passive income sources in your former state can increase the likelihood of a residency audit. As a result, it’s important to carefully consider whether retaining those investments producing state-specific income aligns with your overall financial and tax planning goals.
Preparing to move
If you’re considering a move to a lower-tax state, it’s crucial to plan ahead and be prepared. The more time you give yourself before your company’s exit, the better off you’ll be. We recommend making a clean break from your high-tax state several years in advance to ensure a smooth transition. It’s also wise to assume that you may be subject to a state tax audit, so keep meticulous records and be prepared. "
Is political unrest taking a toll on Israeli startups?,Anna Heim,2023/07/06,"
Now that the first half of 2023 is officially behind us, we are going to get a flurry of data on VC investment around the world. This will allow us to paint a global picture and zoom in on countries where specific factors might be at play.
Today, we are looking at Israel by way of a new report from Israeli VC firm Viola. It offers data on how much capital Israeli startups raised in H1 and how that compares to previous years. But its authors also venture a few hypotheses on the reasons behind this decline.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

Both on my mind and on Viola’s, of course, is the political crisis Israel finds itself in since the beginning of 2023.
After the Netanyahu government announced its intent to overhaul the country’s judicial system and balance of powers, a series of anti-government protests have continued across the country.
Israel’s tech ecosystem didn’t stay out of the political unrest; entrepreneurs and investors have become key players behind anti-government protests. And more generally, concerns have emerged on the damage that could be done to the country’s economy, of which the tech sector accounts for a significant part.
With this in mind, let’s look at the data compiled by Viola to see how VC investment into Israel fared this year so far — unfavorably — and what might explain its decline.
It’s not looking good
With a provisional tally of $3.2 billion for the first half of the year, funding activity in Israel dropped by 73% compared to the same period in 2022, IVC data shows.
PitchBook data interpreted by Viola reveals a 50% year-on-year decline globally, meaning that Israel fared worse than the rest of the world. And $3.2 billion is also less than Israeli tallies in years prior to 2022.
Unsurprisingly, Israeli startups raised less in the first six months of this year than in the same period of 2021 ($13 billion). In the country, like elsewhere, 2021 was an outlier. But H1 2023 also falls short of H1 2020’s $5.7 billion total. It also fails to meet pre-pandemic levels; in H1 2018 and H1 2019, Israeli startups collectively raised $3.7 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively.
Breaking down the data by stage reveals that the latest and largest rounds are the most affected. The amount of capital that Israeli startups raised through mega-rounds fell by 80% compared to the first half of 2022; growth rounds amounted to 71% less year-on-year; and early-stage rounds saw a 56% decline.

DigitalOcean acquires cloud computing startup Paperspace for $111M in cash,Kyle Wiggers,2023/07/06,"
DigitalOcean, the cloud hosting business, today announced that it’s agreed to acquire Paperspace, a New York-based cloud computing and AI development startup, for $111 million in cash.
DigitalOcean CEO Yancey Spruill says that Paperspace’s infrastructure and tooling, once integrated with DigitalOcean’s products, will enable customers to more easily test, develop and deploy AI applications. As for Paperspace customers, they’ll benefit from DigitalOcean’s cloud services, he says — including databases, storage, app hosting, documentation, tutorials and a robust support system.
For now, Paperspace will remain a standalone business unit within DigitalOcean, and Paperspace customers won’t see immediate changes to their service.
“We’re excited to expand our portfolio tailored to the world’s small- and medium-sized (SMBs) businesses and startups with simplified AI and machine learning offerings,” Spruill said in a press release. “The combined offerings allow customers to focus more on building applications and growing their businesses and less on the infrastructure powering them.”
Paperspace was co-founded in 2014 by Daniel Kobran and Dillon Erb, graduates of the University of Michigan. Backed by Y Combinator and Jeff Carr, one of the co-founders of DigitalOcean, the company runs its own datacenters with custom-configured GPUs.
Paperspace initially focused on low-cost virtual machines, providing high-performance workstations for design, visualization and gaming in the cloud. But as AI entered the mainstream, Paperspace leaned hard into its AI offerings, launching a suite of tools designed for developing, training, deploying and hosting AI models in the cloud.
Prior to the acquisition, Paperspace raised $35 million from investors including Battery Ventures, Intel Capital, SineWave Ventures and Sorenson Capital.
Erb sees the acquisition as a step toward a comprehensive offering of cloud CPU and GPU compute to rival other vendors in the public cloud market. The combined power of DigitalOcean and Paperspace, he asserts, will let a new class of customer — particularly those on a tight budget — delve into AI- and machine learning-driven apps like generative media (e.g. OpenAI’s DALL-E 2), large language models (e.g. ChatGPT), recommendation engines and image classifiers.
“DigitalOcean is renowned for simplifying complex cloud technologies and making them more accessible to developers and business alike,” Erb said in a canned statement. “We’re thrilled to join forces with DigitalOcean, as we believe there’s no better company to unlock the endless possibilities of AI and machine learning for developers and businesses alike.”
The Paperspace acquisition is DigitalOcean’s first since 2022, when it bought Pakistani cloud hosting service provider Cloudways for $350 million, and its fourth since its public stock listing in 2021.
From the outside looking in, it’s a wise move for DigitalOcean, which risks being left behind in the surge for cloud AI and machine learning solutions. While the company’s revenue increased in Q1 2023, growing 29.7% to $165.13 million, earnings per share, return on equity and net margin fell short of expectations.
Increasingly, Big Tech cloud providers like Microsoft, Amazon and Google are turning to generative AI to boost revenues — with some success. A recent CNBC poll found that AI is now the biggest spend for nearly 50% of top executives across the economy, indicating it’s a wise place to invest resources.
Driven by the enthusiasm for AI, Gartner predicts that cloud spending will grow 21.7% in 2023, coming in just under $600 billion this year versus $491 billion last year.

SoftBank backs Japanese robotics startup Telexistence in $170M funding round,Kate Park,2023/07/06,"
SoftBank is backing Japanese robotics startup Telexistence, making good on the tech giant’s recent pledge to go back on the investment offensive in light of the current AI hype.
Tokyo-based Telexistence said Thursday that it has raised $170 million (23 billion yen) in a Series B round of funding from SoftBank, Airbus Ventures, Monoful Partners, KDDI Open Innovation Fund, a fund set up by Foxconn and CTBC Financial Holdings, and Globis Capital Partners. With the latest round, Telexistence has raised a total of approximately $193.5 million (27.5 billion yen) since its inception.
Founded in 2017, Telexistence develops AI-powered robotic arms for the retail and logistics industry. Last year, the company said it would deploy its robots in 300 FamilyMart convenience stores across Japan.
The company will use its fresh capital to bolster its workforce globally, CEO Jin Tomioka said in a statement. But aside from the funding, Telexistence is also announcing a strategic partnership with SoftBank Robotics Group, a unit of SoftBank Group, to ramp up its commercialization in North America. Telexistence is currently in talks with major convenience store chains in North America to conduct proof of concept in the near future, according to the company. Moreover, the startup said it will work with Foxconn to produce its next-generation robot, called “Ghost.”
SoftBank Robotics Group’s Kenichi Kent Yoshida, and Globis Capital Partners’ Ryohei Nomoto will join Telexistence’s board of directors as a result of their investment.
SoftBank has been more than a little bullish about investments in the robotics realm, having backed California-based Bear Robotics back in 2020. Via the SoftBank Vision Fund 2, it has also made investments in Shanghai-based Keenon Robotics, which specializes in developing service robots, and Opentrons, a medical testing robot developer.

A comprehensive list of 2023 tech layoffs,Alyssa Stringer,2023/07/06,"
Last year’s techwide reckoning continues. In 2023, layoffs have yet again cost tens of thousands of tech workers their jobs; this time, the workforce reductions have been driven by the biggest names in tech like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo, Meta and Zoom. Startups, too, have announced cuts across all sectors, from crypto to enterprise SaaS. 
The reasoning behind these workforce reductions follows a common script, citing the macroeconomic environment and a need to find discipline on a tumultuous path to profitability. Still, tracking the layoffs helps us to understand the impact on innovation, which companies are facing tough pressures and who is available to hire for the businesses lucky to be growing right now. It also, unfortunately, serves as a reminder of the human impact of layoffs and how risk profiles may be changing from here. 
Below you’ll find a comprehensive list of all the known layoffs in tech that have occurred in 2023, to be updated monthly. If you have a tip on a layoff, contact us here. If you prefer to remain anonymous, you can contact us here.
The running total of layoffs for 2023 based on full months to date is 201,860, according to Layoffs.fyi. Tech layoffs conducted to date this year currently exceed the total number of tech layoffs in 2022, according to the data in the tracker.

Big Tech corporate venture capital 🤝 generative AI startups,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/29,"
As the race to build generative AI tools for the enterprise devolves into a battle royale, Big Tech companies are busy wielding their most powerful weapons: checkbooks.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

Earlier today, Typeface raised $100 million at a $1 billion valuation, mere months after a $65 million round in February. It’s something to think about considering the company was founded in 2022. But even though we are once again seeing rapid-fire venture rounds at unicorn valuations, the investor list in Typeface’s round is worth noting.
Salesforce Ventures led the round. The CRM and cloud giant recently launched a $500 million fund to invest in generative AI startups, so its presence in this deal is not a complete shock, but the SaaS pioneer had company: Both Alphabet (through its GV investing arm) and Microsoft (through its M12 investing effort) invested in Typeface.
That’s a strange set of bedfellows: Salesforce and Microsoft have competing CRM products, and Microsoft and Alphabet compete in, to pick a few areas, search, productivity software, and public cloud infrastructure.
The Typeface cap table engenders a simple question: Where else are major corporate venture capital (CVC) investors putting their money to work?
To get a feel for the situation, I listed deals from a number of historically active CVC arms of major tech companies. Turns out, the Typeface round is funny for its internally competitive investor list, but it isn’t an outlier at all when it comes to Big Tech dollars flowing into startup accounts. The majors are busy these days. "
Speakeasy is using AI to automate API creation and distribution,Ron Miller,2023/06/29,"
Just about every developer wants to create APIs to help other companies connect to their services more easily, but creating and documenting an API is a time-consuming process. Speakeasy, an early-stage startup, wants to make that an easier and more automated set of activities.
Today, the company emerged from stealth with a $7.6 million seed investment.
Speakeasy co-founder and CEO Sagar Batchu describes his startup as an API infrastructure company, and that means it’s building tools to make it easier to create and distribute APIs, something that is near and dear to him as a developer himself. “We’ve started by working on an important problem to me, one that I’ve faced a lot myself as a developer, which is really dramatically simplifying how developers are able to ship APIs to end users,” Batchu told TechCrunch.
He sees APIs giving developers a kind of superpower. “As developers, APIs allow us to take advantage of another company’s capabilities. And so making it really easy to ship those APIs to developers means that we can really help companies accelerate how their products are adopted, as well as we reduce the burden on developers when they integrate with those APIs,” he said.
While the goal is to build a platform of features eventually to help with that mission, the company is starting with two tools, one to help developers create the APIs, and one to help their users implement them more easily.
The first piece is called Managed SDKs. Developers provide an Open API spec, and Speakeasy uses AI to help build a complete API for you along with the necessary documentation, reducing the amount of time it takes to complete a task like this to minutes.
“Speakeasy uses AI to validate and enhance the spec, creates SDKs in the most popular languages, and publishes automatically to package managers. It takes minutes to set up, and SDKs are updated every time the spec changes – saving developers significant time,” the company explained.
The second piece is designed to help the developer end user implement that API without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure, creating a package using HashiCorp’s popular Terraform tool.
“With Speakeasy, API producers can, for the first time, easily create and maintain Terraform providers from an OpenAPI specification – dramatically reducing engineering burden, while unlocking an entirely new developer community,” the company said.
The startup currently has nine employees, but is hiring engineers to help build out the platform further. As he builds the company, Batchu believes being remote will help him find a more diverse workforce. “So first of all, I think about how adopting a remote-friendly hiring philosophy means that we’ll be able to access more places, more diverse communities. It’s definitely something really important to us. And as we move forward, we will be looking to hire great talent from everywhere,” he said.
Today’s round was led by GV with participation from Quiet Capital, Flex Capital, StoryHouse Ventures and Firestreak Ventures. Last year the company raised an additional $3.3 million in a pre-seed round led by Quiet Capital with participation from a host of prominent industry angel investors.
The Managed SDK piece is generally available starting today. The Terraform piece is available in beta.
"
Level wants to back your fund — and your portfolio companies too,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/06/29,"
In 2023, funds of funds (FoFs) are on track to raise the smallest amount of money in more than a decade. At the same time, muted venture deal activity has many firms ditching their follow-on funds. Despite these twin trends, a new emerging manager is looking to find success with a fund that targets both.
Level Ventures has raised $104 million for its debut fund, a data-driven, three-pronged investing strategy that uses in-house algorithms to back other emerging managers, invest in promising companies from those managers’ portfolios and source deals of its own.
Albert Azout, the co-founder and managing partner at Level, told TechCrunch that the fund is based on an opportunity in the market he noticed when working as a partner at Cota Capital.
He said that many family offices — his own included — were seeing strong returns by backing small and emerging VC funds and enjoying further success by co-investing alongside those firms in their portfolio companies. He decided to launch Level to see if that strategy could prove successful as an institutional investing approach when driven by data.
“We wanted to disrupt the LP side of the equation,” Azout said. “Most LPs, even fund of funds and institutions, tend to underutilize technology. We wanted to build something that was tech-enabled that allowed us to better understand the ecosystem.”
The first key to getting the strategy to work, Azout said, was finding the right fund managers. Level is targeting emerging managers focused on sectors including enterprise automation, deep tech and life sciences. Within those categories, the firm taps its in-house data model that scores firms based on areas like how many board seats a firms’ investors are on, who they are connected with online and where they are investing.
“We spent a lot of time really making sure that our fund manager selection is optimal,” Azout said. “A lot of the early iterations of the technology was building a model and approach that would yield the top quartile of managers. But the dispersion of performance across early-stage managers is very large. Trying to find the best funds is a moving target.”
The firm looks to back funds that are less than $150 million in size that are either pretty institutional — maybe on fund two or three — or are a solo GP who brings more than just capital to the table. So far, Level has backed firms including Air Street Capital, Emergent Ventures and Work-Bench.
From there, the firm looks to use its data capabilities to keep tabs on underlying portfolio companies to unearth which startups make sense for Level to invest in when they raise their next round. Level also gives its portfolio of funds access to the data it uses.
Level’s approach to build data solutions to source and find companies puts it squarely in line with trends that have begun to gain steam in venture. An increasing number of firms are looking to build algorithms to uncover deals they would have missed otherwise or that wouldn’t have crossed their radar.
“We are seeing more and more firms adding automation and data to their sourcing process. It gives you alpha,” he said. “If you don’t have data capabilities, you will be disadvantaged from a sourcing perspective.”
But the firm doesn’t 100% leave it up to the data. Azout said that while the data is great to narrow down the field, there is always a human in the loop, proving how much people drive this industry.
What makes Level distinct from the other firms looking to add data is that for the majority of its direct strategy, the data isn’t helping it cast a wider net to find a better set of companies. Rather it mainly helps it find the most successful startups from the investors they are already backing. While this does set the firm up to potentially get a double homerun if a company ends up as a notable success, it also means failures will be two-fold, at least for the companies it backs with its own funds.
The firm currently has an even mix of investments in both funds and companies, but for its second fund will skew that ratio 75% toward funds and 25% toward companies. For now, it hopes this strategy helps unlock the best of both fund and direct investing.

"After aperitif ambitions sour, Haus is back on virtual shelves via The Naked Market",Christine Hall,2023/06/29,"
Haus, an aperitif company that tried to find a buyer last year after investor funding dried up, now has one.
The Naked Market, founded by Harrison Fugman and Alex Kost, has acquired certain assets of the low-ABV (alcohol by volume) beverage company from CPG Holding Co. and is now relaunching a few of Haus’ customer favorites, including Citrus Flower, Pomegranate Rosemary and Grapefruit Jalapeño.
Helena Price Hambrecht and then-husband Woody Hambrecht, launched Haus in 2019, and it quickly grew a following with millennials looking for beverages with all-natural ingredients, fun flavors and direct-to-consumer delivery.
When asked about the sale, Price Hambrecht told TechCrunch via email, “I am very glad to see the brand live on. I will always be incredibly proud of what we built, and look forward to seeing what the new owners will do with it in this next chapter.”
Fugman and Kost told TechCrunch that they did not know the Hambrechts prior to the purchase. The opportunity to grab select consumer-facing assets of Haus, including the brand and the intellectual property, stemmed from their experience in the space owning brands like Rob’s Backstage Popcorn and Flock Foods, and their own history as Haus customers.
“Given our background as foodies and operators in the food and beverage world, we were admirers of the brand and business that Helena and Woody created,” Fugman said. “We viewed Haus as one of the most iconic brands that’s been built in the industry over the past decade. Very few brands had an impact on the industry and consumers.”
Though the global beverage market is huge, it’s also kind of a small world. Both Haus and The Naked Market share a mutual investor, Great Oaks Venture Capital, though Fugman noted the VC firm was not involved in the acquisition.

Haus, a VC-backed aperitif startup, is up for sale after Series A falls through

How Haus lost its buzz
By 2022, the company was seeing $10 million in revenue and had a national distribution deal. It also attracted venture investors, raising $17 million on rolling SAFE notes from a group that included Homebrew, Haystack Ventures, Coatue, Shrug Capital and Worklife Ventures.
However, Haus was not immune to pandemic-related challenges, including supply chain woes and word-of-mouth not growing as intended.
“It was difficult to build the business that I wanted to build during the pandemic considering we were building a social product,” Price Hambrecht told TechCrunch at the time. “We didn’t have people gathering, we didn’t have natural word of mouth. We were a purely digital growth brand during that time, great for acquisition but not good for monitoring long-term behavior.”
Price Hambrecht chronicled the company’s journey on Twitter, and in August, after additional investor capital didn’t come through, told followers that Haus would go through a process called Assignment for Benefit of Creditors, an alternative to bankruptcy, which is where assets are put into a trust for the purpose of liquidation or distribution to pay off debts. Any assets left over go back to the debtor.
In November, Price Hambrecht updated that the sale did not lead to a buyer, tweeting, “Today the banker running Haus’ sale process informed me that the auction has concluded, and the company did not sell. Candidly, I did not expect this. He said this was a surprise to him as much as it was to me.”

“Haus 2.0”
Meanwhile, financial terms of the Haus asset acquisition were not disclosed, however, an interesting part of the deal includes plans by The Naked Market to give 5% of the company back to previous Haus employees, founders and investors through a structured program. Usually it is investors that are prioritized, and Fugman and Kost said this move is meant to show appreciation to those who worked hard to build Haus.
“The Haus community was really one of the main pillars of the brand, and this is our homage to continuing that community,” Kost said in an interview. “We thought this was a gesture to help continue that spirit as we look into Haus 2.0.”
As part of that new chapter, Fugman and Kost brought in Sonoma winemaker Micah Wirth, whose LinkedIn profile said he had been Haus’ general manager since January, to continue leading winemaking and R&D efforts. The aperitifs will continue to be sold online, and future plans include taking Haus into new categories within the food and beverage space by the end of the year.
Fugman and Kost say they ultimately want to continue the community, product quality and transparency aspects that Haus began four years ago.
“We plan to take these core principles and build on them while continuing to scale Haus’ key hero SKUs and expanding them into a new category,” Fugman said. “We have unbelievable respect and admiration for the product that Helena created and have decided to bring that back to the market.”

Halo.Car launches remotely piloted rental car deliveries in Las Vegas,Rebecca Bellan,2023/06/29,"
Halo.Car, a startup that uses remote operators to deliver rental cars to a customer’s door, has launched driverless operations in Las Vegas.
Driverless operations mean something different for Halo than they do for autonomous vehicle companies like Cruise or Waymo because Halo’s vehicles aren’t capable of self-driving.
The startup’s fleet is kitted out with a suite of six cameras, modems, antennas and other components to send data back to remote pilots at a Halo operations center. Those pilots then use the video and sensor data that’s streamed in to remotely drive the vehicles. Once a remote driver completes a car delivery, they hand over control of the vehicle to the customer and move on to the next vehicle awaiting remote delivery or collection.
Halo has been delivering vehicles to customers in Las Vegas using teleoperations for around a year, but a human driver has always been present in the front seat for safety reasons. Now Halo cars will be delivered to customers with no drivers in the vehicle.
This is an important step toward achieving Halo’s vision of on-demand vehicles being economically viable, according to Anand Nandakumar, founder and CEO of Halo.
That said, Halo isn’t at the stage where it’s hitting positive unit economics just yet. The company will still use a remote chase car that tails behind the remotely piloted vehicles initially. The driver of the tail car can stop the remotely piloted vehicle and take over if needed.
The tail car also acts as a buffer vehicle in case the Halo car needs to stop, thus preventing a potential rear-end accident with other road users. Halo’s cars will come to a stop if the system detects an anomaly, which means they meet Nevada’s minimal risk condition for AVs that says vehicles must be able to stop if there is a malfunction in the system.
Halo says it will ditch the tail car over the next year based on how the current operations perform. That’ll happen in phases across operation zones and depending on the times of day, according to Nandakumar.
While Halo might be the first company to successfully deliver remote-piloted EVs to customers in Las Vegas, it’s not the only one attempting such a feat. In December 2022, Arcimoto, the maker of the three-wheeled electric Fun Utility Vehicles, teamed up with Faction to develop EVs that can be delivered to a customer’s hotel through a combination of low-level autonomy and tele-assist technology.
Halo’s announcement Thursday comes after six months of intensive testing and training internally, says Nandakumar. The startup had originally targeted the end of 2022 for its driverless launch, but delayed in order to ensure the system’s safety.
“As we’ve seen in the rollout of AVs, there are a lot of scenarios to solve for when the vehicles don’t have a driver inside,” said Nandakumar, perhaps nodding to the many incidents of Cruise and Waymo robotaxis stopping in the middle of traffic and impeding traffic. “We want to make sure that our deployment causes minimal public disruption, and of course, is absolutely safe for all road users.”
That’s why connectivity is so important to Halo.Car’s business model. The vehicles are remotely piloted over T-Mobile’s 5G network, with AT&T and Verizon used for backup. Halo developed an algorithm that allows the data streams to use whichever network connection is strongest at any given time in order to ensure reliable, high-quality streaming and low latency.
Starting Thursday, Halo’s driverless vehicle deliveries are available in downtown Las Vegas between the hours of 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., and will expand to more areas of the city in the coming months. The startup’s fleet of 20 vehicles is made up of Chevy Bolt EVs and Kia Niro EVs, according to the company.
Halo says it plans to grow its fleet in Vegas to hundreds of vehicles before expanding to new cities in 2024.
“Our transition to driverless deliveries marks a significant milestone for us as a company. It proves that our remote-piloting technology is not just innovative, but commercially viable and ready to be scaled up,” said Nandakumar in a statement. “As we prepare to expand and launch new markets, our mission remains unchanged: to provide affordable, accessible, efficient EV transportation.”

Why Halo is betting on a remote-operated car-sharing service

Why does it seem like every startup is a SaaS company?,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/29,"
If you read enough startup coverage, you’ve noticed that no matter the part of the economy that an upstart tech company is attacking, there’s a pretty darn good chance that it is doing so through software. Software that the startup hosts and charges a recurring fee for customers to access or lever. Software as a service, in other words, or SaaS.
The reasons for this are manifold, but important to grok. First, software empowers. Workers can do more and more quickly with software than they could with pre-digital tools. Second, software is nearly impossibly flexible. It can fit everywhere all at once, solving myriad issues and improving output more generally wherever it lands. And third, software tends to have very attractive economics. This is doubly true for SaaS companies, which not only feature software-styled gross margins, but have recurring revenue to boot.

Enterprise SaaS companies continue to navigate a complex economic environment

That makes SaaS startups valuable in the abstract, as their core output — recurring revenue — is very valuable. Naturally, then, investors that want the most bang for their buck, and founders that want to dent the world with as much gusto as possible, tend to gravitate towards funding and building SaaS startups.
It’s not boring, we promise! To prove that to you, here is a smattering of recent coverage of the wide world of SaaS from TechCrunch+ from the last few weeks. (You can snag TechCrunch+ access here if you still need it!)

Snowflake and Databricks are massive SaaS business, one private and one public. Sure, they do not fit precisely into the Salesforce-style SaaS model of yore, but they offer software as a service and are also battling it out today to build the most fit-for-market enterprise LLM stack. And they are growing at a nearly bonkers clip as well. A great pairing to watch if you care about super-late startups in general.
SaaS startups are not all multi-billion dollar behemoths. Some are quite small. One such startup is Rubber Ducky Labs, which is building tech to help other companies improve their recommender systems. This isn’t tech that you would purchase as a consumer, but Rubber Ducky really does want to affect consumer purchases.
Broadening our lens a bit, let’s talk about vertical SaaS. The idea is simple: Find a particular business category, and build a tailored software solution for those companies. By picking a particular market segment, startups can go deep and build something that resonates. Some folks think that vertical AI is the “next logical iteration of vertical SaaS,” which is both an interesting hypothesis, and one that we agree with.

There’s so much more. Gusto is now doing more than a half-billion dollars in annual revenue while the HRtech space is itself maturing into a massive market. And all the while, the value of software revenue is slowly rebounding, rebuilding confidence in the SaaS model for startups once again.
It’s not all sunshine and roses, mind. During the 2021 tech and venture boom, a number of private-market investors overpaid for startup equity leading to some tough decisions in recent weeks. If it’s tough time for some venture players, it’s a tougher time for certain founders.
But one thing is clear: Even if SaaS evolves into a more on-demand model of selling, managed software services are going nowhere but into more places of our economy. And onto more venture capital betting books.

Social trading app Shares receives EU stock trading license,Romain Dillet,2023/06/29,"
Fintech startup Shares has raised $90 million for its stock trading app. And yet, the service is only available to people who live in the U.K. But that’s about to change as the company has received a couple of authorizations from French regulators. With EU passporting rules, Shares could also expand to other European countries.
As a reminder, Shares lets you trade stocks with no minimum trade size. The company offers fractional shares, which means that you can start investing with as little as £2. It competes with other neobrokers that try to make stock investment more accessible, such as Freetrade in the U.K., Bitpanda and Trade Republic in Europe.
But what makes Shares different from other mobile trading apps is that there’s a social twist. Shares lets you follow your friends and comment on their trades. Users can also create private chats and subscribe to communities of more experienced investors. So far, Shares has managed to attract 150,000 users in the U.K.
Shares just received the accreditation to operate an investment service in France from the ACPR (Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution), France’s financial regulator. And the company plans to take advantage of this license sooner rather than later as it plans to launch Shares in France starting next month. At first, you’ll need an invitation to create an account though.
France’s financial markets regulator (Autorité des marchés financiers) also recently granted the PSAN status to Shares — the startup is now officially a digital assets service provider in France, meaning that it will be able to handle crypto trades as well.
“We are very pleased to receive these authorizations: PSAN registration for cryptocurrencies, and PSI license for trading in stocks and ETFs. This is the reward of an extremely rigorous team effort, of which we are extremely proud. Shares is now regulated by the French regulator and this marks a decisive step in our journey, and allows us to announce our EU launch in July by invitation to our first members,” co-founder and CEO Benjamin Chemla said in a statement.
As you can see, today’s news is going to pave the way for future market expansions in the European Union.

Cyware lands $30M to modernize cybersecurity operations,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/29,"
Cyware, a startup developing products to help enterprises modernize their security operations, today announced that it raised $30 million in a Series C funding round led by Ten Eleven Ventures. Advent International, Zscaler, Emerald Development Managers, Prelude and Great Road Holdings also participated, bringing Cyware’s total raised to $73 million.
Cyware was founded in 2016 by Anuj Goel and Akshat Jain. Goel previously led efforts to research and implement ways to overcome silos within large security teams at companies including Citi. Jain came from Big Tech companies like Oracle and Adobe, where he specialized in building distributed systems.
With Cyware, Goel and Jain say they saw an opportunity to integrate threat intelligence with threat hunting, vulnerability and incident data through prebuilt workflows.
“An effective and proactive security posture relies on a multidimensional approach,” Goel told TechCrunch in an email interview. “When it comes to proactive threat response, it’s critical to connect the dots and quickly respond to a suspicious attack. The more accurate and faster the response to a threat, the less of an impact it has on an organization.”
So where does Cyware come in?
As Goel describes it, Cyware’s platform offers both no-code and low-code capabilities designed to help security teams automate their various threat-combating applications. Via collaboration components, teams can share threat intelligence in real time — with any luck, heading off attacks before they wreak havoc.
Extending the collaborative element, Cyware hosts a network that connects enterprise security teams with each other and with third-party threat data providers. This, Goel says, allows teams to receive threat intel, such as information about vulnerabilities, directly from security vendors, software providers and vetted tech companies.
On trend, Cyware uses AI to extract information from threat intelligence data, score the severity of threats and cluster similar threats together — ultimately combining all the data to generate a report with key insights. Cyware’s AI also provides code suggestions for security orchestration and generates detection rules and signatures that can be dropped into existing threat detection systems.
“Our solutions are built to handle volume and scale, enabling large security teams to effectively operationalize actionable threat intelligence while automating response actions without compromising on performance and speed,” Goel said.
Cyware, which has over 200 employees, doesn’t plan to grow its headcount anytime soon. Goel stressed that this isn’t cause for alarm, pointing to a growing customer base that spans Fortune 1000 companies, government agencies and regulatory bodies.
The fundraising is a testament to Cyware’s strength in a relatively weak market. According to Crunchbase, in the first quarter of 2023, cybersecurity venture capital funding dropped 58% year-over-year while deal flow dropped to 149 deals — the lowest total in years and a 45% drop from Q1 2022.
“Cyware’s platform is designed to reduce repetitive tasks for threat intel and security operations analysts, automate taking intelligent actions to proactively prevent attacks and deliver the right information to the right people at the right time,” he said. “CISOs and other C-suite managers benefit from consolidated dashboards and reports of threats, incidents and response actions, as well as the ability to action information quickly.”
Goel says that the proceeds from the Series C will be put toward expanding Cyware’s go-to-market efforts, market presence, channel business and strategic partnerships.

B Garage raises $20M for its warehouse inventory drones ,Kate Park,2023/06/29,"
B Garage, a San Jose-based startup building autonomous drones along with software to track warehouse inventory, said today that it has picked up $20 million in a Series A round of funding. 
New investor LB Investment led the Series A funding with participation from Ignite Innovation Fund, Krossroad Partners and existing backer SoftBank Ventures Asia. The proceeds, which bring the total amount raised by B Garage to $30 million, will enable the outfit to further develop and commercialize its drones and grow its engineering and business teams. 
The startup was founded in 2017 by Aiden Kim, a former software engineer at Oracle. Kim, who holds a PhD in aeronautics and astronautics from Stanford University, also previously participated in dog robot research at Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL), collaborating with Boston Dynamics for hardware development. (His team focused on creating artificial intelligence software for the dog robot research, Kim said.)
While studying for the doctoral program, Kim realized the lack of startups in the autonomous flight field, and he first came up with an idea in 2017 to build a company offering autonomous flight technology for drone manufacturers. After meeting industry experts in the U.S. in 2019, Kim shaped his plan to develop drones and management software for automated warehouse inventories. What he learned from the industry experts at the time was that industries like agriculture and logistics faced labor shortages, Kim told TechCrunch. 
“[Most] B2B logistics warehouses in the U.S. are far from urban areas and face a severe labor shortage,” Kim said. “The autonomous drone technology could be highly suitable for B2B logistics warehouse inventory management.”
B Garage’s mission is to address the labor shortage issue in those sectors by utilizing artificial intelligence and autonomous technology. 
The company has worked on a proof-of-concept pilot test with Kenco Innovation Lab, a unit of Kenco Logistics, for the last few months. Now it is planning to deploy its drones to more than 10 select Kenco warehouses across the U.S. by the end of 2023. It is also working with Incheon Port Authority in South Korea, aiming to commence the project by the year-end.
Companies like Verity, Gather AI and Corvus Robotics have also raised funding for their inventory drones. B Garage has tried to set itself apart from its rivals with four features: full autonomy that covers multiple aisles, no additional infrastructure required, mapping-free operation and automatic battery swapping.
B Garage’s drone can “navigate through multiple aisles, providing comprehensive coverage of warehouse spaces,” Kim said, adding that many other drone solutions are limited to specific paths or single aisles.

On top of that, users don’t need to integrate additional technology to operate drones with their warehouse infrastructure, so there are no extra charges. Competitors typically require an initial fee and ongoing operating costs for installing markers or beacons (indoor GPS) throughout the logistics warehouse and regularly updating the mapping, the CEO explained. 
Another differentiator, the startup claims, is the automatic battery swapping facility. 
“Our drones are equipped with advanced battery technology that enables efficient battery replacement,” Kim continued. If the drone’s battery runs out, the drone automatically returns to its dedicated battery swapping station, which replaces the depleted battery with a fully charged one from its inventory of pre-charged batteries in a matter of minutes. 
B Garage plans to continue enhancing its software solutions with the goal of integrating with its hardware to apply its technology to industries beyond logistics, such as defense and security, according to the company.
It also aims to introduce ground robots for inventory management, Kim said when asked about its plans. The ground robots will allow the startup to cater to a broader range of customers, providing comprehensive solutions for inventory management across various sectors, Kim explained.

Material Evolution raises $19M to decarbonize the cement industry,Paul Sawers,2023/06/29,"
In the industrial world, cement is about as omnipresent as materials get. But despite its clear and obvious utility, cement is responsible for some 8% of global CO2 emissions — if it was a country, it would be third biggest emitter globally, by some estimations.
While cement’s ubiquity comes largely down to how easy it is to produce and the relative cost, creating cement is hugely carbon-intensive due to the amount of energy required to make it. And this is something that U.K. startup Material Evolution is seeking to address with a new low-energy manufacturing process that it says requires zero heat.
Founded in 2017, Material Evolution today announced it has raised £15 million ($19 million) in a Series A round of funding to scale production of its low-carbon cement, which it says has an 85% lower carbon-footprint than normal Portland cement.
While Material Evolution is officially incorporated in the U.S., where it initially intended as its first target market, the company operates substantively out of the U.K., where its founders and team of 20 are based, and also where its entire product development takes place.
There are numerous companies out there trying to address cement’s carbon problem, including young upstarts such as Carbon Re and Carbonaide, both of which have recently raised venture capital (VC) cash. But Material Evolution points to its own proprietary technology as a key differentiator. Rather than using the energy-hungry kilns that are typical of cement making, the company says it uses an “alkali-fusion” process to produce cement at ambient temperatures, from various “industrial wastes and feedstocks,” circumventing the need for fossil fuels.
When Material Evolution talks about “alkali-fusion,” it’s essentially referring to a process based on similar principles to that of nuclear fusion.
“Fusion technology has been hailed as the way to meet humanity’s energy needs for [the next] millions of years, whilst emitting no carbon dioxide or greenhouse gases,” Material Evolution co-founder and CEO Dr. Elizabeth Gilligan said in statement.
The company says that its material is already used within industry, enabled in large part by a strategic partnership with materials company SigmaRoc, which is also a strategic investor in Material Evolution’s Series A round.
The company’s Series A was led by Kompas VC, with participation from Norrsken VC, Circle Rock, and SigmaRoc.

"Typeface, which is building generative AI for brands, raises $100M at a $1B valuation",Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/29,"
In 2022, Abhay Parasnis, the former CTO of Adobe, founded Typeface, a generative AI startup focused on enterprise use cases. With it, he hoped to leverage generative AI — which at the time was just beginning to come into vogue — to deliver personalized content for brands at scale.
Typeface, thanks in part to the hype around generative AI, caught on quickly, attracting Fortune 500 customers within its first year as well as partnerships with Salesforce and Google Cloud. And — perhaps more importantly — it won over investors, who this week injected hundreds of millions of dollars into the startup.
Today, Typeface closed a $100 million Series B round led by Salesforce Ventures with participation from Lightspeed Venture Partners, Madrona, GV (Google Ventures), Menlo Ventures, and M12 (Microsoft’s Venture Fund). Valuing the startup at $1 billion, the tranche brings Typeface’s total raised to $165 million.
Parasnis says that the new capital will be put toward expanding Typeface’s platform and growing the company’s team.
“Enterprise leaders are telling us across the board that they want to embrace generative AI, but they need a solution that meets their unique requirements and is ready for the enterprise,” Parasnis said via email. “They require an AI platform that keeps up with the lightning-fast pace of innovation and feels like a natural extension of their brand. They also need the assurance that their valuable proprietary content remains secure and confidential while seamlessly integrating into their existing workflows.”
The Typeface platform consists of three key components, Parasnis explained — the first being a content hub where users can upload assets and guidelines for “on-brand” text and image generation. The second, called Blend, uses AI to train and personalize content to a brand’s voice and style. As for the third, Flow, it provides templates and workflows designed to integrate into existing apps and systems.

Using Typeface, a content marketing manager could generate an Instagram post — or at least a product shot and caption — to promote the launch of a new product using brand-approved wording and assets. Or a demand generation manager at a business-to-business software-as-a-service company could repurpose an event video into a blog post, draft a follow-up email to attendees and more.
“We provide enterprises with a suite of secure, self-serve solutions that empower any employee to produce on-brand content from their content workflows,” Parasnis said.
There’s no shortage now of companies in the generative AI space. (See Jasper AI, for example, which also recently raised $125 million at a $1.5 billion valuation.) So what makes Typeface different?
For one, Parasnis makes the case that Typeface places a greater emphasis on brand governance, content safety and privacy than most of its competitors. The platform provides dedicated AI models for each customer, ostensibly ensuring that their assets and activity remain private.
What’s not entirely clear is whether Typeface’s models — and the content they produce — could be subject to legal challenges down the line. Pending cases against popular AI art tools Midjourney and Stability AI allege that they infringed on the rights of millions of artists by training their tools on web-scraped images. Meanwhile, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has yet to issue clear guidance on copyright protections for AI-generated works.
Parasnis isn’t anticipating headwinds, asserting that Typeface customers own all the assets they generate on the platform.
“Every part of the enterprise needs compelling, personalized content to drive results, and that too, more at a rapid pace,” he said. “Typeface revolutionizes the way enterprises deliver content, empowering every facet of the organization to drive exceptional results with unprecedented speed.”
It might not matter — for now. The risks don’t seem to be dampening the enthusiasm around generative AI. According to a survey by FreshBooks, 25% of business owners say that they’re currently using or testing generative AI tools while two out of three say they’ll try generative AI for work within the next 12 months.
VCs aren’t shying away either, clearly. According to a PitchBook report released in March, venture firms have steadily increased their positions in generative AI, from $408 million in 2018 to $4.8 billion in 2021 to $4.5 billion in 2022. Angel and seed deals have grown as well, with 107 deals and $358.3 million invested in 2022 compared with just 41 and $102.8 million in 2018.
“With a significant demand among enterprises for personalized generative AI, we must rapidly expand our platform and continuously innovate to meet enterprises’ distinct needs,” Parasnis said. “Moreover, we will expand our exceptional team with deep AI, software-as-a-service and enterprise marketing expertise to enrich the value we offer to our growing community. This funding serves as the catalyst for a robust product roadmap and go-to-market expansion, empowering enterprises to effortlessly generate personalized content at every customer touchpoint, safely and from within their existing enterprise workflows.”

India’s startup funding slides 68% after Tiger and SoftBank make virtually no deals,Manish Singh,2023/06/29,"
Indian startups experienced a significant contraction in funding in the first half of 2023 as some kingmaker late-stage backers quelled new investments in the South Asian nation amid a slowdown in the broader public market.
The first six months of 2023 saw Indian startups raise a mere $5.46 billion, a substantial 68% decline from the $17.1 billion during the same timeframe in 2022 and a drop from $13.4 billion in H1 2021, as per data from market intelligence agency Tracxn shared with TechCrunch.
This year has thus far failed to yield any fresh unicorns in the Indian startup ecosystem, a stark contrast to the 18 new entrants to the billion-dollar club in H1 2022 and 16 minted during the corresponding period the previous year.
The funding drought is permeating startups across different stages. A total of 325 seed funding deals were struck in H1 2023, a dramatic fall from the 936 in the same period in 2022 and 921 in H1 2021, according to Tracxn’s data.
Other early-stage funding rounds, chiefly Series A and Series B, dwindled to 108, compared to 296 and 211 in the equivalent periods in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Late-stage funding also suffered, slumping to 36 deals from 137 and 114 during similar periods the prior years.
The slowdown comes as many late-stage investors, previously prolific backers of Indian startups, have taken a step back. Tiger Global has done just one deal in India this year, according to Tracxn and Crunchbase, whereas SoftBank (which deployed over $3 billion in India in 2021) and Insight Partners (which backed several late-stage startups last year and in 2021) wrote virtually no checks.
Instead, SoftBank has been bulking up liquidity. For the last several weeks, SoftBank has been selling a portion of its Paytm stake each day, according to a market source familiar with the matter. Chief executive Masayoshi Son said at the company’s annual general meeting last week that SoftBank, which has invested just $650 million through its Vision Funds across the globe in the past two reported quarters, plans to go on the “counteroffensive” soon by resuming AI investments.
Tiger Global, which has deployed over $6.5 billion into Indian startups altogether, is highly unlikely to forge investments in new startups in India for a few more months, a partner at the firm told a founder recently. Scott Shleifer, who oversees startup investments at the New York–headquartered hedge fund, which recently disclosed securing $2 billion for its new fund, said on an investor call earlier this year that returns on capital in India have “historically sucked.”
He said, “If you look at the market-leading internet companies, whether it is Google, Facebook, Alibaba or Tencent, revenue for them got bigger than cost more than a decade ago. You had a great legacy of last 17–18 years of materially profitable internet companies. So returns on equity in the internet got really high and the returns for investors have been really high. But that did not happen in India.”
SoftBank and Tiger Global are investors in 33 of the 65 Indian startups that attained the unicorn status in 2021 and 2022. All put together, India has 102 unicorns.
As some of the prominent late-stage names sit on the sidelines, sovereign funds, especially from the Middle East region, have financed the vast majority of those deals in India in recent quarters.
Rahul Chandra, a seasoned investor and co-founder of Arkam Ventures, said he doesn’t anticipate the return of some prolific late-stage investors to their customary investment activity for at least another two years in India.
The lack of participation from late-stage backers and virtually no IPOs have also hurt the appetite of many midstage investors, who are struggling to devise new underwriting models that reflect the current public market view. Several high-flying Indian startups, including Byju’s, Swiggy and PharmEasy, have experienced a dramatic downward adjustment in their valuations — by a staggering 50% or even more.
Despite this setback, there remains a ray of hope for Indian startups in the form of considerable “dry powder” – untapped capital reserves held by venture capitalists. Almost every active VC firm in India, including the likes of Peak XV Partners, Lightspeed, Accel, Elevation Capital, Matrix Partners India, 3one4 Capital and Blume Ventures, have secured new and larger funds in the past 18 months.
Arkam co-founder Chandra said that it’s likely the pace of investments will pick up in the coming months.
“What we are contained by is mostly locally available capital, which I expect will be behaving in a rational manner because there’s no irrational exuberance coming in to drive valuation up. It’ll still mean that people are chasing each other for termsheets for the good founders because the next two years there will be more capital that will get deployed,” he told TechCrunch in an interview.
Indeed, Peak XV, Lightspeed, and Accel have escalated their deal deliberations and are on track to closing nearly 50 early-stage deals since mid-March, according to people familiar with the matter.

Lightspeed says India not for the faint-hearted amid Sequoia split

Visa acquires Brazilian fintech startup Pismo in $1B blockbuster deal,Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/06/28,"
Credit card giant Visa is acquiring Brazilian payments infrastructure startup Pismo for $1 billion in cash in what is likely one of the largest fintech M&A deals taking place this year so far.
Founded in 2016 by Juliana Motta (CPO), Ricardo Josua (CEO), Daniela Binatti (CTO), and Marcelo Parise (VP of engineering), São Paulo–based Pismo has quietly racked up a list of big-name customers, including Citi, Itaú (one of Brazil’s largest banks), Revolut, N26, Nubank and Cora. The startup processes almost 50 billion API calls and $40 billion in transaction volumes annually, and powers almost 80 million accounts and over 40 million issued cards.
For some context of the explosive growth Pismo has seen, at the beginning of 2021, it was doing less than $1 billion per month in transaction volume, according to Josua. It ended 2020 with fewer than 10 million accounts total.
Over time, Pismo has expanded out of its home country and now also operates in several countries across Latin America, including Mexico and Chile, as well as in the U.S. and Europe. The startup also has some customers in India, Southeast Asia and Australia.
Pismo’s cloud-native issuer processing and core banking platform is aimed at giving banks, fintechs and other financial institutions “flexibility and agility,” the company shared when it raised $108 million in Series B funding in October of 2021. It does things like allow customers to launch products for cards and payments, digital banking, digital wallets and marketplaces. Pismo also claims to allow financial institutions to “take charge of their core data and use it intelligently.”
In a written statement, Visa said that by acquiring Pismo, it “will be positioned to provide core banking and issuer processing capabilities across debit, prepaid, credit and commercial cards for clients via cloud native APIs.” The startup’s platform will also enable Visa to provide support and connectivity for emerging payment rails, like Pix in Brazil, for financial institution clients, the company added.
“Through the acquisition of Pismo, Visa can better serve our financial institution and fintech clients with more differentiated issuer solutions they can offer their customers,” said Jack Forestell, Visa’s chief product and strategy officer, in a written statement. The deal, which is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, is slated to close by year’s end. Pismo will retain its current management team, who will remain based in São Paulo.
SoftBank, e-commerce giant Amazon and Silicon Valley–based venture firm Accel co-led the startup’s Series B raise. Falabella Ventures, PruVen and existing backers Redpoint Ventures and Headline also participated in the financing, which brought Pismo’s total funding raised to $118 million. The company did not share its valuation, but Accel partner Ethan Choi told TechCrunch that the sales price was “a very strategic multiple.”
As a SaaS business, Pismo mostly made money by charging transaction fees. It has charged per active account, so prices decrease based on volume. In other words, the more clients a customer has, the less they pay per account.
In a written statement, Josua said: “At Pismo, we aim to enable our clients to launch cutting-edge payments and banking products within a single cloud-native platform — regardless of rails, geography or currency. Visa provides us unrivaled support to expand our footprint globally and help shape a new era for banking and payments.”
Visa was reportedly just one of several companies bidding for the startup, which was not seeking to be acquired, or even fundraising, according to Choi.
“Pismo wasn’t on the block,” he told TechCrunch. Besides the transaction representing “one of the largest LatAm cross-border fintech deals that has happened,” Choi believes it is also “an example of a global card network deciding that they would like to get closer to the banks and the financial institutions they work with by providing core banking and card issuing services to them, in addition to their credit card and debit card rails.”
He added: “There are a lot of synergies to be able to sell these really critical APIs to their existing financial institution customers.”
It’s not the first infrastructure play on Visa’s part. In March 2022, it closed on its $2.15 billion acquisition of Tink, a leading fintech startup in Europe focused on open banking application programming interfaces.
The credit card behemoth also famously abandoned its planned $5.3 billion acquisition of Plaid, a U.S.-based popular open banking startup, before having to call off the acquisition after running into a regulatory wall.
No doubt that Pismo getting scooped up by Visa is a coup of sorts for the entire Latin America region, which saw a surge in global investors pouring capital into the region in 2021 and a bit of a retreat since. It’s also a comeback story, considering that in 2019, Pismo was running out of the cash it had raised in a $900,000 seed round in 2016. In fact, things were so dire that Binatti and Parise even sold their only car in order to fund Pismo’s operations. Now the company’s just over 400 workers will become Visa employees.
The deal also marks the second time that Accel has purchased a financial infrastructure company that ended up getting acquired soon after. In 2020, consumer financial services platform SoFi announced that it was acquiring payments and bank account infrastructure company Galileo for $1.2 billion in total cash and stock. That company was founded in 2000 and bootstrapped to profitability before Accel wrote it a $77 million Series A check in 2019.

"Brex refocuses on startups with hire of SVB veteran, ex-a16z operating partner",Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/06/28,"
Just over one year ago, spend management decacorn Brex declared that it was “less suited to meet the needs of smaller customers” in an announcement that caused shock waves in the startup community.
While Brex soon clarified that by smaller customers it meant small to medium-sized businesses and non-funded startups, the move still felt like a stunning reversal, considering the company had started its life as a credit card company for startups. The announcement came about two months after Brex announced a “big push into software” and that it was placing greater emphasis on moving upmarket to serve larger, enterprise customers.
But then in March, Silicon Valley Bank imploded. 
Brex was one of the bidders for the early-stage and growth portfolios of the bank, which was known for providing a swath of financial services to the startup community. Ultimately, First Citizens Bank took over, but some of those former clients shunned the idea of working with such a large bank and opted to move their accounts to fintechs such as Brex, Mercury and Arc. While Brex declined to share specifics on just how many former SVB customers in total have migrated their accounts, it did say that it opened 4,000 new accounts and received $2 billion in deposits in the first week after the SVB shutdown alone.
That influx of new customers led Brex to rethink its priorities, and strategy.
Today, the company told TechCrunch exclusively that it has tapped Jason Mok, a former Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) operating partner and more than 16-year veteran of Silicon Valley Bank as its new head of startups. In his new role, which he assumed in April, Mok will be helping founders navigate both today’s macroeconomic environment and the recent banking crises, as well as the promise of exciting technologies like generative AI. 
Via email, Brex co-founder and co-CEO Henrique Dubugras told TechCrunch that “founders and startups have always been at the core of Brex.”
He added: “The community needs our support more than ever given the broader macro and collapse of SVB. When it came to hiring someone to lead our startups organization, it was crucial to find someone who shared Brex’s pride and passion for startups; Jason fits the bill.”
At a16z, Mok managed the firm’s seed fund. And at SVB, he served as the managing director and sector head of consumer internet. Interestingly, Mok’s father also worked at SVB in the early 1990s, in a similar capacity as Mok did.
“So I grew up around SVB,” Mok recalls. “I just grew up around Silicon Valley Bank, founders and entrepreneurs, scaling with companies and venture capital.”
While at the organization, Mok said he worked on everything from early stage to growth to venture to warehouse facilities to lending.
“I learned a ton. SVB was like the best place to get your ‘MBA’ for everything about technology, finance, startups and venture capital,” he said.
In 2020, Mok was recruited by a16z to serve as an operating partner to oversee corporate development before overseeing the firm’s seed fund strategy. He left the firm in September 2022, he said, to focus on family before getting recruited by Brex this spring to help lead its renewed focus on startups.
Admitting that he was “heartbroken” by what transpired at SVB, Mok said he was drawn to the opportunity of helping the startup community in a new capacity.
“SVB was a stalwart that enabled so much of what currently is the tech and innovation ecosystem. It was amazing to see so many different people and companies come out of the woodwork to really do their part in helping prop up the innovation system,” Mok said. “Specifically, it was amazing to see Brex step up the way that it did.”

In his new role, Mok said he will be helping guide the post-SVB opportunity for Brex and how the company is “thinking about delivering for startups in the future.”
“Brex is the only non-bank alternative offering a full financial stack, including banking, bill pay and credit cards,” he told TechCrunch. “I’ve joined to add some additional leadership strategy and reaffirm Brex’s commitment to delivering to startups. Over time we have expanded to serving enterprises but startups and founders are at the core of what we do and we want to make sure we continue to iterate, evolve and grow with founders as they scale beyond startup.”
Part of that, Mok said, will include discussing with founders what they need in terms of products so that they can “scale faster and iterate better.”
The company also wants to be more present physically, by hosting events in various cities such as San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles, for the startup community and offering more “Brex ambassadors” that can serve as the face of the brand that founders, operators and VCs can go to for advice, perspective and connections to other founders.
“I’ll be overseeing all of that and really our go-to-market function,” Mok said.
He’ll also help with the further building out of Brex’s business accounts as well as “further optimizing and improving” the company’s onboarding process.
Brex said it has also named Nadav Lidor as the company’s lead for banking products catered to startups. Lidor, who leads Brex’s Israel office, will be focused on Brex business accounts — cash management accounts with FDIC insurance through partner banks and a suite of money movement tools across ACH, wires and checks. 
In late May, Brex shared that two of its products — Empower, its spend management platform, and Brex business accounts — had “each achieved $100 million in ARR,” or annual recurring revenue.
The company added that since launching Empower last year, Brex has signed on companies such as Coinbase, Indeed, SeatGeek, Lemonade and DoorDash, among others. It also said that its business accounts, which it describes as cash management accounts with a suite of money movement tools across ACH, wires and checks, had seen “rapid growth due to the ease of use and up to $6M in FDIC insurance coverage.”
Brex also recently announced it was going global.

Celestial AI raises $100M to transfer data using light-based interconnects,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/28,"
David Lazovsky and Preet Virk, technologists with backgrounds in semiconductor engineering and photonics, came to the joint realization several years ago that AI and machine learning workloads would quickly encounter a “data movement” problem. Increasingly, they predicted, it would become challenging to move data to and from compute hardware as AI models scaled past what could be kept on the die of any one memory chip.
Their solution — architected by Phil Winterbottom, previously a researcher at the distinguished Bell Labs — was an optical interconnect technology for compute-to-compute, compute-to-memory and on-chip data transmission. Along with Winterbottom, Lazovsky and Virk founded a startup, Celestial AI, to commercialize the tech. And now that startup is attracting big backers.
Celestial AI today announced that it raised $100 million in a Series B round led by IAG Capital Partners, Koch Disruptive Technologies and Temasek’s Xora Innovation fund. The tranche, which brings Celestial AI’s total raised to more than $165 million, will be used to support the production of Celestial’s photonics platform by expanding the company’s engineering, sales and technical marketing departments, according to CEO Lazovsky.
Celestial has around 100 employees at present — a number that Lazovsky expects will grow to 130 by the end of the year.
“Today, compute and memory are closely coupled. The only way to add more high bandwidth memory is to add more compute, whether the additional compute is required or not,” Lazovsky told TechCrunch via email. “Celestial’s tech enables memory disaggregation.”
In a data center, memory is often one of the most expensive resources — in part because it’s not always used efficiently. Because memory is tied to compute, it’s challenging — and sometimes impossible, due to bandwidth constraints and sky-high latency — for operators to “disaggregate” and pool the memory across hardware within the data center.
According to an internal Microsoft study, up to 25% of memory in Azure is “stranded,” or left over, after the servers’ cores have been rented to virtual machines. Reducing this stranded memory could cut data center costs by 4% to 5%, the company estimated — potentially significant savings in the context of a multibillion-dollar operation.
Celestial — which began as a portfolio company of The Engine, the VC firm spun out of MIT in 2016 — developed an ostensible solution in its photonics-based architecture, which scales across multiple-chip systems. Using light to transfer data, Celestial’s tech can beam information within chips and chip-to-chip, making both memory and compute available for AI — and other — workloads.
Image Credits: Celestial
Celestial also claims that its tech can reduce the amount of electricity necessary for data movement, indirectly boosting a chip’s performance. Typically, chips devote a portion of the electricity they draw to data movement between their circuits, which takes away from the electricity that the chip can direct to computing tasks. Celestial’s photonics reduce the power required for data movement, allowing a chip to — at least in theory — increase its compute power.
Celestial’s photonics tech, which is compatible with most industry interconnect standards (e.g., CXL, PCIe), delivers 25x higher bandwidth and 10x lower latency and power consumption than optical alternatives, the company asserts.
“With the growth in AI , especially large language models (LLMs) and recommendation engine workloads, there is a shift towards accelerated compute,” Lazovsky said. “The key problem going forward is memory capacity, memory bandwidth and data movement — i.e., chip-to-chip interconnectivity — which is what we are addressing with Celestial’s photonic fabric.”
Celestial is offering its interconnect product through a licensing program and says that it’s engaged with several “tier-one” customers, including hyperscalers and processor and memory companies.
The interconnect product appears to be priority number one for Celestial. The company sells its own AI accelerator chip, dubbed Orion, built on Celestial’s photonics architecture. But as investors told TechCrunch in a recent piece for TC+, AI photonics chips have yet to overcome engineering challenges that would make them practical at scale. Unless Celestial stumbled upon breakthroughs in the areas of data-to-analog conversion and signal regeneration — top stumbling blocks for today’s photonics chips — it’s unlikely that Orion is much further along than the competition.
Chip aside, Celestial has a number of competitors in a photonic integrated circuit market that could be worth $26.42 billion by 2027.
Ayar Labs, which makes chip solutions based on optical networking principles, has raised over $200 million in venture capital since its founding in 2015. Renovus, another rival, recently landed a $73.9 million investment.
There could be consolidation ahead in the broader optical interconnection space, though. Around three years ago, Marvell bought Inphi, an optical networking specialist, for $10 billion. After a period of quiet, Microsoft last year acquired Lumenisity, a startup developing high-speed optical cables for data center and carrier networks.
Both Inphi and Lumenisity were targeting different use cases with their tech. But the enthusiasm from Big Tech around optics and photonics is worth noting.
“Our photonics technology is truly differentiated and is unique with superior characteristics,” Lazovsky said. “Given the growth in generative AI workloads due to LLMs and the pressures it puts on current data center architectures, demand is increasing rapidly for optical connectivity to support the transition from general computing data center infrastructure to accelerating computing.”
Samsung Catalyst, Smart Global Holdings, Porsche Automobil Holding SE, The Engine Fund, imec.xpand, M Ventures and Tyche Partners also participated in Celestial’s Series B.

"As $100M+ venture rounds evaporate, IPOs might have to carry the weight",Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/28,"
Earlier this year we wrote that the “the $100 million venture round is going extinct.” Often our predictions wind up sideways. This time we were on the right track.
According to new data from PitchBook, the U.S. venture market is continuing to endure lackluster velocity for nine-figure investments into private companies, colloquially referred to as “mega-rounds.”

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

In the first half of 2023, PitchBook counted just 108 mega-rounds in the United States. If we presumed that this rate will hold throughout the year, we’re looking at just over 200 nine-figure deals in the U.S. in 2023. That’s a dramatic decline from prior levels. Starting in Q4 2020 through Q3 2022, there were more than 100 mega-rounds recorded per quarter. In 2021, the average was more than 200 per quarter. To see perhaps 200 this year implies that the number of late-stage startups that will be able to raise an IPO-sized round is in free fall.
The rounds are also getting smaller, with data indicating that the average nine-figure round size has fallen under the $200 million mark, exclusive of a few rounds that are hardly traditional venture deals, like OpenAI’s massive round earlier this year. Smaller mega-rounds, and fewer of them, is a tough mix for unicorns of all stripes and sizes.
Of course, we could see nine-figure rounds rebound in other markets. Europe and Asia have seen their fair share of the transactions historically. But as the United States’ venture market is the largest in the world and was once the leading player in mega-round financings, where the U.S. goes, so, too, goes the world.

Cava’s explosive IPO hints that public markets are more ready for growth-stories than founders thought

If unicorns here are struggling to find fodder in the quantity that they became accustomed to, other startups around the world are likely enduring a similar dearth of capital.
Notably PitchBook thinks that “the need for capital likely leading to an uptick in mega-rounds as the year progresses” thanks to “the notion that depleting cash runways will force more of these startups to raise in the harsher dealmaking environment,” it still expects full-year mega-round tallies to come in at dramatically reduced levels compared to prior years.

Techstars raising $150 million for new accelerator fund,Annie Njanja,2023/06/28,"
Startup accelerator Techstars is raising $150 million for its new fund, SEC filings show. The accelerator is seeking new capital ahead of the end of the deployment period of its third institutionally-backed fund, Techstars Accelerator 2021, later this year.
Techstars declined to offer details on how it intends to use or deploy the funding, citing regulatory restrictions. However, like its predecessors, the new fund, Techstars Accelerator 2024, is expected to be used for accelerator-stage and/or post-accelerator investments.
Notably, the Boulder-based early-stage investor has used its current fund only for accelerator-stage investments. Its previous funds backed startups both during the accelerator stage and with follow-on investments after the program.
Fund 3 aimed to back more than 800 pre-seed and seed startups that are part of its global accelerator programs by the end of 2023. Through its accelerator groups, Techstars has so far backed over 3,500 early-stage startups in various sectors, including health tech, fintech, web3 and clean tech.
Startups going through Techstars’ three-month program receive $20,000 and a $100,000 convertible note in exchange for 6% to 9% of common stock, in addition to access to its network and mentorship, amongst other resources.

Techstars debuts new fund for companies too early for its own accelerator

Founded in 2006, Techstars runs more than 50 accelerator groups in major cities across the globe, including New York, Los Angeles, London, Boston, Tel Aviv and Lagos. The accelerator launched the Lagos arm last year in partnership with ARM Labs as part of its plan to expand its specialist and generalist programs globally.
To double down on its growth and expansion plans, Techstars recently launched new funds to bolster its investment efforts.
Last year, for instance, it launched Rising Stars, a fund to back startups that are too early for its accelerator programs. Under this fund, Techstars will issue $100,000 checks in exchange for 7% to 10% equity.
The accelerator also launched the $80 million Advancing Cities Fund in partnership with JPMorgan to back over 400 startups by diverse founders in nine cities across the U.S.

OpenAI brings the competition to DeepMind’s doorstep with new London office,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/28,"
OpenAI is expanding overseas. To London, specifically.
Today, the Microsoft-backed AI startup announced that it plans to open an office in London, its first international outpost. When OpenAI’s London location opens its doors, it’ll focus on advancing “research and engineering capabilities” while balancing collaborating with “local communities and policymakers,” according to CEO Sam Altman.
“We see this expansion as an opportunity to attract world-class talent and drive innovation in AGI development and policy,” Altman, who reportedly had floated Poland and France as alternatives for the office, said in a canned statement. “We’re excited about what the future holds and to see the contributions our London office will make towards building and deploying safe AI.”
London is a conspicuous choice for OpenAI, which hasn’t expanded beyond its San Francisco headquarters since its founding in 2015. The city is the longtime home base of DeepMind, Google’s largest AI research division, and a wellspring of data science talent, owing to its rich academic history and renowned universities.
Broadly speaking, London is also becoming a booming center for AI startup ventures. According to a recent report, as of 2021, over 1,300 AI companies were based in London and the city was the top-funded in the U.K. in terms of venture dollars invested.
The city is also important politically to tech companies heavily invested in AI, like OpenAI, which seek to convince the U.K.’s governing bodies to regulate AI with a light touch. On a recent lobbying tour, Altman made an appearance at the University College London, where he called for “balanced” regulation and warned of the risks of deepfake disinformation.
At that same appearance, Altman said that OpenAI would “cease operating” in the European Union if it’s unable to comply with the provisions of the bloc’s AI Act, one of the first comprehensive set of regulations for the AI industry. He later backed down from the comments — but the play was made.

Quandri raises $8.5M Series A to bring process automation to insurance brokers and agencies,Frederic Lardinois,2023/06/28,"
Robotic process automation (RPA) has been a buzzword for a while now, but most of the tools that try to help businesses automate their workflows tend to be generalists. Quandri, a Vancouver, Canada-based startup, is taking a very different approach with its digital workers for the insurance industry. The company today announced that it has raised an $8.5 million Series A round led by FUSE, with participation from Defined Capital and existing investors Aviso Ventures, Rebellion Ventures, N49P and Good News Ventures. In total, the company has now raised $10 million.
The company was co-founded by brothers Jackson (CEO) and Jamieson Fregeau (president). Jackson was previously the COO of Revenue Accelerator while Jamieson worked at a number of hardware-centric companies, including Open Ocean Robotics. Jackson noted that while he was at Revenue Accelerator, he ended up building a number of bots to automate repetitive data entry tasks. So when the brothers were thinking about what product to build, they decided on putting a different spin on RPA.
“Nobody was really talking about a bot for a customer specifically. It was like: you’d give this capability to a customer. And then they would need to go and configure and build all this stuff themselves in a really rigid way. And that prevented a huge slew of companies from accessing this kind of technology because they don’t have the technical resources — or if they have the technical resources, they’re applied to their very specific core products but not on operational automation.”
What Quandri is building is more akin to “robot-as-a-service” than traditional RPA. Instead of having to build automation themselves, Quandri essentially pre-builds these bots for their customers, which also means that the team has to focus on a very specific niche. After working with a couple of potential customers in the insurance space, Jackson told me, the team realized that this was a vertical where brokers and agencies were still doing a lot of repetitive manual work and where a lot of data was sitting in silos (even as the consumer-side of the industry has quickly modernized).
“There hasn’t been a lot of net new tooling built for brokerages over the last 10 years,” he said. “It’s been somewhat overlooked by a large wave of innovation that has happened in a lot of other industries.”
Right now, Quandri offers three of these pre-built robots: Renewal Reviewer to help agents compare policies upon renewal, a tool that helps users ensure that files are named correctly and contextually (and not “1847AHDKS812 BROKER”), and Download Director, a service that matches unmatched policies and eDocs to the correct accounts and then matches claims and verifies producer commission amounts as needed.
Jackson tells me that the company is currently 100% focused on the insurance industry and specifically on North American brokerages. In the long run, the team may branch out and apply its technology to other verticals.
“Bots are a total game changer for our agency,” said Angela Trimble, president, Trustpoint Services. “I told my Agency Manager we are now at a place where we don’t have to be worried about hiring additional employees when it comes to the tasks involving tedious paperwork because we have bots in place.”

"Tiny acquires HappyFunCorp, the prolific firm that’s built apps for Twitter, Amazon and more, for $30M",Ingrid Lunden,2023/07/03,"
M&A and consolidation continue to be major themes in the tech world as companies look for their next steps in a tight market. That’s a trend impacting not just startups and larger tech companies, but the firms that work closely with them.
In the latest development, HappyFunCorp — a product engineering house that designs and builds apps and more for the likes of Apple, Disney, Amazon and Twitter — is getting acquired by Canadian firm Tiny for $30 million.
Tiny is based out of Canada and is publicly traded there with a current market cap of around $500 million. HappyFunCorp is being acquired with a mix of shares and cash and will continue to operate independently out of Brooklyn, New York, where it was founded, said Ben Schippers, co-founder and co-CEO, in an interview.
It will also work closer with Tiny, which has built a tidy business out of quietly scooping up companies that — if you could put a description around it — largely focus on providing an array of front and back-end design and product services for tech companies and internet-based businesses.
Other acquisitions in the Tiny stable include e-commerce technology player WeCommerce; Dribbble, an online community for designers to share work and pick up new work; and it also has a stake in Flow, for task and project management. The co-founder of Tiny is Andrew Wilkinson, who is also the co-founder of MetaLab, an interface design company that is also part of Tiny.
Together with HappyFunCorp the companies work behind the scenes with some of the most well-known names in tech — companies that do a lot of major work in house, but also — maybe with a little less fanfare — also turn to third parties to build out products that are typically outside of the normal course of an organization’s workflow and thus a distraction and strain were they to be developed, maintained and updated internally, at least while they’re getting off the ground (or while the company’s watching to see if they can get off the ground).
Customers for the combined Tiny organization range from a long tail covering tens of thousands of smaller online businesses, through to building some significant apps and other work for some of the biggest names in tech, such as Amazon, Facebook/Meta, Twitter, Disney, Samsung and Apple.
Some of the most successful of those projects actually cover both of those ends of the spectrum. One anecdote that has stuck in my memory for years is that MetaLab turned a struggling startup’s rough concept into an app that blew up beyond, seemingly, anyone’s wildest predictions: that app was Slack.
HappyFunCorp was founded in 2009, and in the last 14 years it’s racked up its own very long list of big-name customers. Similar to the other companies in the Tiny stable, it has up to now been bootstrapped and profitable. Revenues in 2022 were $12 million and it’s on track for more growth this year, Schippers said. He, along with current co-CEO Holly Zappa and COO Robb Chen-Ware, will stay on to run the company post-acquisition.
(Note: TezLab, a popular third-party Tesla application that was incubated at HappyFunCorp, is being spun out as an independent company with this acquisition.)
Tiny’s acquisition of HappyFunCorp is significant not just because it’s another example of the consolidation that continues to change the shape of today’s technology landscape; but because it shines a light on a group of companies in the tech ecosystem that are likely to be taking an even more prominent role in the coming years.
Companies continue to trim their workforces — with hundreds of thousands of layoffs in the last year — and they’re also trimming their budgets to meet the current state of the market. And new developments in areas like AI create a lot of variables and unknowns around the corner in both of those departments.
Yet those companies still have their eye on future growth and, to that end, want to continue developing new products and concepts to meet demand and to create new demand. Tiny’s bet is that this pull and push will drive more business into its arms over time.
The profile of companies like this has definitely changed over the last decade, Schippers said.
“Eight, nine years ago we did all this work and we didn’t talk about it,” he said in reference to some of its higher-profile projects, including some ambitious projects of Twitter’s. “Now the pendulum is swinging.”
Cost consolidation, he added, will additionally drive a lot of companies to a “near shore” model focusing on R&D not in New York or Vancouver (where MetaLab and Tiny have operations), but economies like Costa Rica and elsewhere in Latin America “where work can be done at a fraction of the cost,” he said. “Full stop that is where the market is going.”

Trying to close a Series B in 2023? Read this first,Mark Chaffey,2023/07/03,"

Mark Chaffey is CEO of hackajob, a career marketplace for technology job seekers and employers.	

Despite ongoing economic uncertainty, there will always be a path forward for determined founders with strong ideas and smart investors with an eye for opportunity. But make no mistake, the challenges are real and sizable. Global funding in Q1 2023 was down 53% compared to Q1 2022, a precipitous drop hastened by broader market turbulence and fears of a prolonged downturn.
And the stagnation wasn’t limited to just late-stage funding either. Crunchbase analysis revealed that Series B investment in the second half of 2022 was down over 60% from the same period the year before — putting Series B investments on track to come in at the lowest quarterly level in more than three years.
With this backdrop, our company began our Series B round of fundraising in early 2023. We went into the process aware that our sector has historically suffered in a down economy, but we chose to focus on the positives — namely that our ability to close in this environment would showcase the quality of our business and that any investors willing to make an investment despite the challenges would result in a stronger long-term partnership.
How we closed our $25 million Series B in April 2023: 5 key factors
For us, we knew we were ready for a Series B when:

We were cash efficient with a burn multiple under 1.
We had proven product-market-fit and go-to-market fit with excellent unit economics.
We had strong retention, in our case a net revenue retention rate (NRR) of 149%.

From there, it was all about execution. Here are five other strategies that helped us close our Series B.
Set the foundations to scale: Team, process and expertise
Series B rounds are all about scaling the business. The scrambling and existential doubt you had as an entrepreneur won’t go away, but by this point, you should have built a strong executive team around you that is, frankly, more skilled at scaling their individual functions than you are. As soon as you land the Series A, start to lay a real business foundation — pivoting from a survival mindset to a sustainable one.
We embraced this, and after closing our Series A, we built the groundwork throughout 2019 that enabled us to take advantage of the unique opportunity that the COVID-19 pandemic created. Ultimately, this strong foundation led us to close our Series B round in an extremely challenging market.
 

			There will always be a path forward for determined founders with strong ideas and smart investors with an eye for opportunity.					


Your org chart doesn’t have to be fully built at this stage, but you should have a plan to scale. When building out our exec team, we balanced homegrown talent that had progressed internally with individuals who had achieved success at the next level of scale than we operated currently.
When raising a Series B, it is important to hire execs with experience for this stage of the company. A CRO who is used to scaling from $50 million ARR to $100 million ARR has a very different skill set than what you need to scale from $10 million to $30 million ARR. For example, when looking for a VP of finance, we wanted someone with a track record of closing Series B and C investment rounds, as that was the next step for us.
Understand potential investor reservations, then create a plan to counter them
When fundraising, a common piece of advice for founders is to start with your tier 3 funds first and work your way up to pitching tier 1. This gives you the opportunity to learn what questions investors will ask and what objections you might receive before you sit down with the big guns.
This didn’t work for us. The challenge with starting with “tier 3” funds is that the “tier 1” funds often have more context about your space (at least they should if you’ve tiered correctly) and therefore the quality of the questions they ask are far superior to the ones you’ve been prepping on from “tier 3” fund conversations.
Instead, we sought to understand the common objections investors would have about investing in our business through informal catch-up calls when we weren’t in fundraising mode. This enabled us to understand potential investors’ objections upfront without going through the “tier 3” to “tier 1” process while still addressing those objections directly. In these introductory conversations, we were frequently asked the following: "
15 investors talk about their investment cadence in H1 2023,Karan Bhasin,2023/07/02,"
As part of our ongoing coverage of VC performance in the first half of 2023, TechCrunch+ surveyed 15 investors about their investment cadence and their plans for the second half of the year.
As expected, it appears a good mix of investors wrote checks at the rate they’d aimed for, while others fell a bit short. However, there is a sense that a slower investment cadence is going to become the new norm. Rajeev Dham, partner at Sapphire Ventures, and Mark Grace, investor at M13, both noted that the rapid investment cadence of the pandemic years has passed, and the adjustment period has been a bumpy ride for some.
However, those who operated at a slower cadence seem to be favoring a more cautious approach. Gen Tsuchikawa, CEO of Sony Ventures, said, “We have always been selective in our investments, and we are keeping the cadence of those investments flexible for now.”
Dham also advocates prudence for the coming period. “Once we understand what the new operating cadence is of businesses and then apply the appropriate price, which we now all know what it is (what it has always been!), then we can act accordingly. The other massive shoe to drop is further retreat from the most active investors in the 2018–2021 era. The more they retreat, the more likely there is to be less capital in the system chasing startups, which also level sets on price.”
Grace has his eyes firmly set on the full-half of the glass: “I think dealmaking cadence will continue to rebound. You need to be an optimist in this industry!”
Logan Allin, managing partner and founder of Fin Capital, stated that his firm was the most active fintech investor across the globe in Q1 thanks to its focus on early-stage startups founded by repeat founders.
He gave us some insight into his firm’s confidence: “This accelerated rate of new company formation is a function of (a) Management teams turning over the reins to professional management to take the company public or exit via M&A or buyout, and (b) seasoned entrepreneurs with underwater options that are not worth sticking around for to vest further.”
Read on to learn more about the investing climate of the past six months, and how these investors aim to tackle the next few months.

Did your investing cadence meet your expectations? Did you exceed your targets or undershoot them?
The back half of 2022 was dead. Things suddenly picked up in late February, and we felt it across the board. We made investments in Anthropic and Typeface and have continued at a fairly rapid pace since then. In Q2, we made several commitments, including two life sciences companies, one digital health, one hard tech company and a few SaaS companies. So, the end of Q1 picked up and Q2 really accelerated. We even had a term sheet in on a company and we won the deal, but it got acquired.
Is your firm planning on accelerating its dealmaking cadence in the back half of 2023? Why or why not?
Q2 was already busy and active for us, but mainly at the early stage. We have three funds: an incubation fund (Menlo Labs), which has been steady state; our Venture Fund, which picked up significantly in Q2; and our Inflection Fund (defined as early growth in companies with $3 million to $10 million ARR), which was still slow in Q2.
We expect Labs and the Venture Fund to remain just as busy as they have been from a pacing standpoint, but [we] expect the Inflection Fund will accelerate significantly in the back half of the year. About 80% of the companies in our sweet spot haven’t raised in two-plus years, and many will need to come back to market in 2H 2023. We’re excited about that segment of the market, where there is early but predictable scale and where valuations have settled substantially.
There will be many flat and down rounds, and there should be no stigma around that. The multiples VCs will use to value companies will be different, but that doesn’t change whether a business is good or not. So we’ll all get past valuation and focus on building great companies.
Sheila Gulati, managing director, Tola Capital
Did your investing cadence meet your expectations? Did you exceed your targets or undershoot them?
Our current focus is AI, primarily in the areas of domain-specific foundation models, AI/ML tooling, AI SaaS applications, AI compliance and governance, and AI security tools.
We have closed deals in these spaces in 2023, but the frenzy around AI has definitely meant a lot of capital has rushed into this market. The result has been that we have backed off certain deals based on valuation, and we expect this to continue in the AI world. It has meant fewer deals overall.
Is your firm planning on accelerating its dealmaking cadence in the back half of 2023? Why or why not?
We’re focused on doing the right deals. Generational companies will emerge from this transformative period defined by AI, but there will be many losers, too. "
Fintech M&A gets a big boost with Visa-Pismo deal,Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/07/02,"
It was a very busy week in the world of fintech, which certainly kept us on our toes. We covered a couple of notable M&A deals (including one of the biggest of the year so far), a different kind of financial services startup aimed at undocumented immigrants, Brex’s official recommitment to the startup community and more.
End-of-quarter frenzy
As the generative AI craze rages on, Ramp acquires customer support startup Cohere.io
We started the week with some M&A news out of corporate spend management company Ramp. The team shared with us exclusively that it had scooped up an AI-powered customer support called Cohere.io, which had raised $3.5 million in seed funding over its lifetime from backers such as Initialized Capital, Y Combinator and…Ramp co-founders Eric Glyman and Karim Atiyeh. Notably, Ramp (and companies like Deel and Rippling) were also customers. Glyman told us that it was evident from early on that once his company started using Cohere.io, “suddenly the majority of tickets were being answered properly in an automated fashion. […] It actually really worked,” he said. “The technical sophistication of the team was far beyond anything we had ever seen.”
Visa acquires Brazilian fintech startup Pismo in $1B blockbuster deal
Then later in the week came confirmation of one of the biggest, if not the biggest, fintech M&A deals of the year. It was rumored for months that Visa, Mastercard and potentially a bank and private equity firm were all courting Brazilian payments infrastructure startup Pismo. The acquisition was definitely a coup for the Latin American startup community, considering that Visa could have likely considered companies from all over the world. Pismo has apparently seen some explosive growth in recent years — jumping from 10 million accounts at the end of 2020 to 80 million today. Also, at the beginning of 2021, Pismo was doing less than $1 billion per month in transaction volume compared to processing $40 billion in transaction volumes annually today.
However, as noted by KBW managing director Sanjay Sakhrani, the $1 billion purchase price is roughly 30% below the $1.4 billion that Visa was rumored to have offered for Pismo earlier this year. We don’t know what Pismo was valued at when it raised $108 million in a round co-led by SoftBank, Amazon and Accel in 2021. But Accel partner Ethan Choi told us the sales price was “a very strategic multiple.”
Sakhrani also said in a report that in addition to beefing up Visa’s issuer processing capabilities across card products, Pismo also brings “differentiated core banking capabilities and will allow Visa to provide connectivity and support to emerging payment rails like Pix in Brazil.”
The last week in recent memory where we remember seeing such a flurry of fintech M&A activity was in mid-January, when Jonah Crane, partner at Klaros Group, predicted we would continue to see more acquisitions in 2023 thanks to the continued venture slowdown and practically dead IPO and SPAC markets. And according to CB Insights, fintech M&A exits rebounded in the first quarter, but not as much as one might have expected. They were up 15% QoQ to 172 deals. Most of Q1’23’s top M&A deals involved fintechs based outside of the U.S. For the first time in the previous year, the top M&A valuation fell below $500 million.
Side note: The acquisition represented a rare win for SoftBank, which has had a number of high-profile disappointments in recent years with investments in the likes of WeWork, the now defunct Katerra and FTX. Alex and I talk more about that on Friday’s episode of Equity Podcast here.
Brex refocuses on startups with hire of SVB veteran, ex-a16z operating partner
Last summer, Brex made headlines for announcing it would stop serving SMBs and non-funded startups. This summer, it’s making headlines for pledging its recommitment to the startup community. After Silicon Valley Bank imploded in March, Brex (along with the likes of Arc and Mercury) saw an influx of new customers. Specifically, the company says it opened 4,000 new accounts and received $2 billion in deposits in the first week after the SVB shutdown alone. That obviously led the company to rethink its strategy. Last week, Brex told us exclusively that it had hired Jason Mok, a former operating partner at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and 16-plus-year veteran of Silicon Valley Bank to serve as its head of startups. I talked with Mok about his previous experience and how he thinks that will help him in his new role, which includes providing more “Brex ambassadors” who can serve as the face of the brand that founders, operators and VCs can go to for advice, perspective and connections to other founders.
No SSN, no problem, says Maza, a fintech startup aimed at undocumented immigrants
I also wrote about Maza, a fintech startup that raised $8 million in a seed-funding round led by a16z to help undocumented immigrants get an ITIN (individual tax identification number) and access the U.S. financial system. TechCrunch has previously reported on a number of startups focused on the immigrant community — including Welcome Technologies, Fair, Majority and TomoCredit. (It’s unclear whether Fair is still around considering its website appears to no longer exist or is down.) But what makes Maza different is its focus on undocumented immigrants specifically. “We’re doing much more than just providing a bank account — we’re really giving immigrants a stable and legal financial foundation from which to build credit and wealth indefinitely,” said co-founder and COO Robbie Figueroa.
Fun fact: The name Maza came from a song about perseverance called “La Maza” that co-founder and CEO Luciano Arango used to listen to with his mom growing up.
Nubank’s CEO explains what the US could learn from LatAm fintech
In one of the Equity podcasts this week, I spoke with David Vélez, the co-founder and CEO of digital bank giant Nubank. (Did you know it has a market cap of  $37 billion?!) Digital banking is always top-of-mind over here at TechCrunch, so we quickly got into discussing Nubank’s strategy for achieving profitability and how the company has been able to maintain that in a challenging macroeconomic environment. Vélez also compared and contrasted the Latin American and U.S. fintech markets and dished on how he sees banking evolving in the next few years. One particularly interesting part of the conversation, as one Equity listener pointed out: Vélez’s reasoning for only expanding Nubank in three markets over 10 years: “‘I am extremely wary of any deck where people tell me ‘18 markets in 2 years.’”

Deal Dive: Betting on the sports betting market,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/07/01,"
If you live in a state where online sports betting is legal, companies like FanDuel, Caesars Sportsbook and DraftKings don’t let you forget it. They dominate TV ad slots during sports games and seemingly everywhere else, too. They give the mirage that the market is saturated with no room for startups. Betr, well, wouldn’t bet on that.
Betr co-founder and CEO Joey Levy thinks there is still space for companies that bring a new approach and business model to online sports betting. What makes Betr stand out, though, is that it’s built its user interface to be more accessible for the casual sports bettor as opposed to someone who spends all day poring over stats. It also focuses on microbets, so instead of predicting who wins the whole game, users can bet on things like how many free throws Nikola Jokić will get the next time he’s up at the line.
The startup just announced a $35 million Series A2 round with a $300 million pre-money valuation. The round was led by IA Sports Ventures and Eberg Capital and also included existing investors. Betr was founded in 2022 and is live in two states so far, Ohio and Massachusetts.
This is Levy’s third sports betting startup. His first, Draftpot, was a daily fantasy platform that was acquired in 2017. His second, Simplebet, is still running to provide the back-end infrastructure needed to power microbets. But through those he noticed a problem he thinks Betr can solve: Most online sports-betting apps were designed for sports bettors not sports fans.

This week in food tech: Upside Foods wastes no time debuting its cultivated chicken,Christine Hall,2023/07/01,"
If you’re adventurous with your food, or just like to keep up with the fast-moving food tech industry, here’s a roundup of this week’s stories and some notable news we weren’t able to cover.
Upside Foods gets on the plate
In what is perhaps the first ever sale of cultivated meat in the United States, Upside Foods said it is unveiling its whole-textured product at Chef Dominique Crenn’s restaurant Bar Crenn in San Francisco today. This comes just a week after gaining approval to sell its cell-cultivated chicken product in the U.S.
Upside’s cultivated chicken will be fried in a tempura batter, drizzled with a burnt chili aioli and garnished with edible flowers and greens. Incidentally, this is the first time Bar Crenn is putting meat on its menu since it was removed in 2018, according to the company. The cultivated chicken will be incorporated into additional dishes at the restaurant through a series of ongoing monthly services that will commence later this year.

We’ve officially entered a new era of ‘cultivated’ meat production

As seen on TechCrunch
Bluu Seafood reels in $17.5M to bring cultivated fish products to market
Paul reported on Bluu Seafood’s new €16 million ($17.5 million) Series A round of funding. The German company is creating cultivated fish products and unveiled its first products last August, which included a line of fish sticks and fish balls.
Joyful Ventures debuts with $23M focused on investment in sustainable protein startups
Thriving startups in the alternative protein sector now have a new place to pitch. Venture capital firm Joyful Ventures unveiled its new fund. Joyful was co-founded by Jennifer Stojkovic, Milo Runkle and Blaine Vess. The company has already made two investments from the fund, including New School Foods and Orbillion Bio.
Omeat emerges from stealth with beefy tech approach to cultivated meat growth media
Omeat, a cultivated meat startup out of Los Angeles, believes it has cracked the code on how to reduce the traditionally high costs to scale production of cultivated meat via a process that uses regenerative factors extracted humanely from cow plasma to make growth media.
BetterBrand’s new dough raises company’s valuation to over $170M
BetterBrand, a food tech company known for creating “The Better Bagel,” closed on $6 million of Series A capital at a pre-money valuation of $170 million. BetterBrand’s proprietary “grain-changing” technology combines non-GMO and clean label ingredients to create a line of better-for-you baked goods.
Make way for a new vegan protein on the menu
Natasha writes about Finnish startup Solar Foods’ alternative protein, Solein, which has been blended into a custom (vegan) chocolate gelato at a restaurant in Singapore. It’s not your average scoop, she says.

Time to make the meat
In April, we ran a commentary focused on whether additional capacity for precision fermentation, which is a method that uses bioreactors to make cultivated meat, is what was really needed to advance the industry and bring costs down.
For those in the camp of more biomanufacturing facilities, Liberation Labs is contributing to that. This week, the company broke ground on its first facility in Indiana that, when fully up and running, will have a capacity to make up to 600,000 liters of bio-based proteins.
Impossible vs. Motif, take 20
During the last roundup, I mentioned the year-old lawsuit between Impossible Foods and Motif FoodWorks became interesting when it was uncovered that Motif suspected Impossible hired some private investigators who allegedly used fake identities to get information on Motif products.
Ultimately a court ruled that this strategy by Impossible did not break any rules, according to the story.
While that was a mark for Impossible, the newest thing to come out is a mark for Motif: The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board agreed to review Impossible’s intellectual property related to using heme to create plant-based meat substitutes. More here.

"
Are corporations too influential?,Haje Jan Kamps,2023/06/30,"
Welcome to Startups Weekly. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.
This week, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about how some of the biggest companies in the world have as much — if not more — power than entire countries. Most countries, at least, have some level of democratic oversight, but that isn’t true in the same way for companies. My question, then: In a world where the policies of, say, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter become de facto standards all around the world, should we have a greater degree of say (TC+) in what those policies are?
The other thing that’s kept me busy this week is fundraising. Alex talked with 11 VCs (TC+) about how hard it was for their companies to raise so far this year. Meanwhile, I talked with a number of founders who were really struggling to raise money. The truth is, the founders struggling the most have three things in common (TC+).
Now let’s take a look at what happened in the world of startups this week.
Notes from the security frontlines
Image Credits: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch
The most popular story on TechCrunch in the past week was one of my own, which came with a curious backstory: Flipper Devices was founded in Moscow, Russia, in 2020, by a Ukrainian founder and a largely Russian team. I ran the headline that a “Russian hacking device” had made $80 million worth of sales, only for a bunch of PR people to get very upset with me for calling the company, which was founded in Russia and whose team is still 90% Russian, Russian. Don’t get me wrong, I get why a company making a hacking device might not want to be associated with Russia — and the company has gone to great lengths to scrub any traces of that connection from the internet. The whole story was pretty weird, and concluded with me getting an unsolicited scan of the founder’s (Ukrainian) password in my email inbox. Very curious indeed.
That sounds secure…: In a beacon of “here’s what not to do,” Lorenzo reports that an Illinois high school accidentally changed every student’s password to ‘Ch@ngeme!’. The problem? For a moment there, every student knew every other student’s password. D’oh.
Stupid and pointless: Prosecutors called for the British hacker who was responsible for the 2020 Twitter breach to serve at least seven years. Zack reports that the hacker was sentenced to 5 years behind bars. The convicted hacker described his crimes as “stupid and pointless.” Who am I to disagree?
Watching the watchers: Zack reports that Polish-developed stalkerware LetMeSpy, a phone-tracking app, says it was hacked. The leaked data included years of victims’ call logs and text messages dating back to 2013.
News you can touch. Yep, it’s hardware.

A ton of interesting things happened in startup hardware land this week. Uplift Labs signed an interesting deal with Major League Baseball to use the startup’s 3D motion tracking tech to help scout for promising players.
Fast on the heels of its previous $14 million fundraise, Realtime Robotics raised another $10 million or so, representing the third close on what now seems like a never-ending Series A financing for the manufacturing automation startup.
Apropos robotics, Brian also had a fascinating story today on how robots are learning from watching YouTube videos. If my YouTube recommendations are anything to go by, every robot in the world will very soon be expert woodworkers and do very stupid things with explosives.
Who’s a good bot? That’s right, you’re a good bot: In a, “Geez, I feel safer already” type moment, Brian reports that the House GOP discussed the use of robot dogs to patrol U.S. borders.
It flies and it counts. That’s just what it does: Kate reports that B Garage raised $20 million for its warehouse inventory drones. And as we’re talking about flying inventory drones, Brian reported that Gather AI bought drone inventory competitor Ware.
Walking? Feh, check the webcam: The lazy among us may have pointed a webcam at the oven to keep an eye on a pizza, but Devin reports that Lilz takes the same concept to a whole ‘nother level, bringing its gauge-watching smart cameras to the U.S. and raising $4 million.
Startups that are going places
Image Credits: Joby Aviation
Raise your hand if you saw this one coming (while I sit on my hands, because I really did not) — but it seems like the Tesla charging standard is gaining a foothold very quickly. First, Texas said that state-funded EV chargers had to include Tesla plugs (now known as the North American Charging Standards, or NACS), and it seems like Washington state may be following suit.
Wheeee: You couldn’t force me on board one of these things with a gun, but Joby Aviation has reasons to celebrate, as Rebecca reports that the company received a permit to fly its first eVTOL built on a production line.
Pulling the e-brake: Kate reports that Singapore’s ride-hailing firm Grab lays off over 1,100 employees, representing around 11% of its staff — its first big round of layoffs since 2020.
End of the road for Lordstown: It’s been an uphill battle for Lordstown Motors. Rebecca reports that the company is suing Foxconn, claiming fraudulent conduct that “destroyed” the American company’s business. Over on TC+, Alex ponders that there’s not a lot of SPAC deals left that didn’t come crashing down painfully and spectacularly. Canoo, anyone?
Despite all its rage, it is still just a car in a cage: Even as Lordstown implodes and a lot of the other EV companies are struggling, Faraday Future raises $90 million to keep itself alive.

Foo-wee, it’s been a lively week. My personal favorite was Tim’s story about Forcite launching a $1,100 smart helmet, finally bringing a version of the decade-old Skully dream to fruition.
U so basic: Netflix decided that it had enough of letting its users skate by on the cheap, and Ivan reported that the streaming giant quietly axed its basic plan in Canada.
We totally have lots of users, promise! Some strange dodginess this week — Amanda reported that Unicorn social app IRL is to shut down after admitting 95% of its users were fake.
Yeah, saw that one coming: In my very personal opinion, Shein — and other, similar purveyors of essentially disposable clothing — is the literal worst for the environment. It seems like the company got a sheen of comeuppance, as Amanda reports that an influencer’s highly curated trip to a Chinese factory backfired.
The crowd is going Vilnius: Europe keeps investing huge sums of money into tech ecosystems, and Paul reports that Lithuania’s capital Vilnius is about to invest more than $100 million into “Europe’s largest tech campus.”

Secretive hardware startup Humane’s first product is the Ai Pin,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/30,"
Humane, the startup launched by ex-Apple design and engineering duo Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, today revealed details about its first product: The Humane Ai Pin.
It’s been a long time coming. Humane has kept its work more or less under wraps since 2018, its founding year, unveiling no products but bringing on dozens of ex-Apple employees responsible for the iPhone’s touchscreen keyboard, elements of Apple’s industrial design and infrastructure for Apple services like iCloud, Apple Pay and Home.
Humane’s product, as it turns out, is a wearable gadget with a projected display and AI-powered features. Chaudhri gave a live demo of the device onstage during a TED Talk in April, but a press release issued today provides a few additional details.
“The [AI Pin is a] connected and intelligent clothing-based wearable device uses a range of sensors that enable contextual and ambient compute interactions,” the release reads. “The Ai Pin is a type of standalone device with a software platform that harnesses the power of Ai to enable innovative personal computing experiences.”
Stripping away the marketing jargon, the Ai Pin will be able to — assuming Humane’s claims hold water — perform many of the tasks a smartphone can, but with fewer gestures and voice commands required. Activated with a tap, the Ai Pin, designed to clip to a breast pocket, can offer a summary of emails and calendar invites, translate between languages and answer and place phone calls.
Thanks to a camera and computer vision-powered software, the Ai Pin can also recognize objects around it, such as food nutrition labels. And using a built-in projector and depth sensor, it can project an interactive interface onto nearby surfaces, like the palm of a hand or the surface of a table.

“Our Ai Pin presents an opportunity for people to take AI with them everywhere and to unlock a new era of personal mobile computing which is seamless, screenless, and sensing,” Chaudhri and Bongiorno said in a canned statement.
Humane also revealed today that it’s collaborating with Qualcomm to develop the Ai Pin’s internal hardware. An unnamed chip from Qualcomm’s Snapdragon series will power the wearable; Human’s promising more info to come later in the year ahead of the device’s launch.
“Humane’s Ai Pin will deliver a superior AI experience,” Qualcomm SVP of product management Ziad Asghar was quoted as saying in the release: “With the advent of generative AI, Humane’s Ai Pin and user experience takes excellent advantage of some of the key strengths of on-device AI and uses real-time contextual information to provide the user with exciting, personalized AI use cases.”
Humane previously announced that it’s partnering with SK Networks and Microsoft to bring its platform and services to market, with Microsoft supplying the cloud processing power and SK Networks handling distribution. Meanwhile, Humane’s collaborating with OpenAI to integrate its tech into the startup’s device — whatever form it ends up taking, exactly. LG, for its part, is working with Humane on R&D projects for the next phase of its product life cycle as well as adapting Humane’s tech for smart home devices. And Volvo’s teaming up with Humane on a potential automotive industry offering.
To date, San Francisco-based Humane, which has a more than 200-person workforce, has raised $230 million from investors including Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, Kindred Ventures, SK Networks, LG Technology Ventures, Microsoft, Volvo Cars Tech Fund, Tiger Global, Qualcomm Ventures and OpenAI CEO and co-founder Sam Altman.

"TechCrunch+ roundup: Vertical AI, crypto losses decline, machine learning investor survey",Walter Thompson,2023/06/30,"
According to Paris Heymann, a partner at Index Ventures, the current wave of AI-powered products and services can be sorted into three layers:

Foundational models
AI infrastructure
AI applications

“Some of these applications will be broadly horizontal,” he writes in TC+, “but many AI applications will also be vertical, or industry-focused.”

The generative AI land rush has created a new challenge: How can enterprises use proprietary data to build powerful models while maintaining security and privacy?
“Protecting training data and models must be the top priority,” says Anjuna CEO and co-founder Ayal Yogev.
“It’s no longer sufficient to encrypt fields in databases or rows on a form.”

Generative AI startup Typeface emerged from stealth this year, but the $100 million Series B round that just boosted it to a billion-dollar valuation signals that “big tech companies are busy wielding their most powerful weapons: checkbooks,” writes Alex Wilhelm.
In The Exchange, he examines how companies like Microsoft, Salesforce and other corporate venture entities are buying their way into AI-adjacent products and services.
“So long as your founding team has an AI pedigree and a plan to sell lots of AI tech to big companies, you can expect a flood of cash from big tech funds and traditional venture investors alike.”

Dear Sophie,
Our startup employs about 30 people globally through a combination of direct and co-employment based on their country.
Over the last year and a half or so, we helped several team members relocate from Ukraine and Russia to various non-Schengen countries such as Georgia, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and Uzbekistan.
We realize it’s more expensive if we bring these employees to the U.S., but our startup will be more successful. How do we bring them here?

After reviewing the last few years of declining fund of funds activity, Rebecca Szkutak found that several factors are leading limited partners to look elsewhere.
“There has been way more opportunity to invest in a VC than there has ever been in the past,” said Kyle Stanford, a senior venture analyst at PitchBook.
“For new LPs coming into the market, they didn’t need to go to a fund of funds to get access.”

Voice.ai raises $6M as its real-time voice changer approaches 500K users,Ingrid Lunden,2023/06/30,"
Services like Midjourney and ChatGPT have pushed the boundaries of how AI can create images and text out of basic text prompts. Now, audio appears to be the inevitable next frontier. Music generation based on word prompts, AI tutors for language learning and voice simulators have all seen developments in recent months. Voice.ai hopes to be a part of that conversation (heh) with technology that lets users change (and disguise) their voices in real time, and now it has raised its first outside funding on the heels of early growth.
With more than 480,000 users and a library of more than 50,000 voice filters, Voice.ai has picked up $6 million, funding that it plans to use to take its voice changing tech into new places.
Mucker Capital and M13 are leading the round. Before now, Voice.ai has grown by word of mouth — the startup has a Discord channel with more than 120,000 people — on the back of $3 million in self-funding.
Currently the company’s tools — available as apps for Mac, PC, Android and iOS — are getting adopted by gamers, content creators, Vtubers and others on TikTok, Zoom, Discord, Minecraft, GTA5, Fortnite, Valorant, League of Legends, Among Us, Skype, WhatsApp and other platforms. The Voice.ai interface lets them create a new voice, or select from some 50,000 different pre-created voices (created and shared by users like themselves), which can be used as-is or modified, to use live in supported platforms, or for recordings.
The plan is to use the funding to hire more technical talent and to build new SDKs and APIs to work with further platforms like Meta, Unreal and Unity; bring on multi-language support; and add in new applications like singing where voice is center stage.
The startup doesn’t single it out, but it will be interesting to see if it uses some of the funding also to increase server capacity.
That is no small burden. Anecdotally, we’ve heard that GPU pain is one of the biggest gating factors in how a lot of AI apps are able to scale at the moment. (It’s partly why you’re seeing big deals being made that include strategics providing processing and server capacity.)
For Voice.ai specifically, your voice is processed locally and channeled into wherever it will be used through what founder and CEO Heath Ahrens described to me as a “virtual audio cable.” But when you look at reviews of its apps, a common lament is that when you sign up you are put on a waitlist because “overwhelming demand has our servers at max capacity” with a promise that you’ll be informed when the service increases that capacity.
There are dozens of speech-to-voice and voice-to-speech services in the market today, and already a lot of activity among them: Last year Spotify acquired Sonantic and Snap bought an AI voice assistant even earlier than that; another startup, Sanas, is working on changing your accent and there are the voice simulators Murf and Acapela, among many others. Voice.ai counts itself in the same general category as Respeecher and ElevenLabs, two voice-to-voice AI startups, letting users apply masks to tweak or completely transform their voices — in some cases creating completely synthetic voices in place of the real thing.
Respeecher, founded and based in Ukraine, made a name for itself by helping build a new Darth Vader voice for new Star Wars installments, based on how James Earl Jones sounded 45 years ago when he originated the role. (In keeping with a character hell-bent on destroying worlds, Darth’s voice was delivered to the Hollywood client from its offices in Ukraine as Russia marched into the country.)
ElevenLabs — famously (or infamously as the case may be) — has built a platform that is frighteningly good at cloning voices, and earlier this month it picked up its most recent funding round of $19 million from a group of big-name investors.
Voice.ai is trying, in that mix, to position itself as the AI voice modifying app for Everyman.
“There are plenty of companies that are trying to provide a different flavor of voice tech to businesses,” Ahrens told TechCrunch in an email (ironically, it wasn’t possible to arrange a live interview with him). Ahrens has some experience with the building of B2B AI tech: his two previous companies — iSpeech for text-to-speech and Haystack for face recognition — are built around API offerings.
“What sets Voice.ai apart is that we are focused on bringing tech that was previously reserved for enterprise companies directly into the hands of consumers in an affordable fashion.” Many users, he noted, “come to us from classical DSP voice changers and voice modulators which they had been using in the past and which are still popular among many gamers and streamers.”
“Affordable” comes in two tiers, with most users now on a free service that requires them to opt in to providing computational power to train Voice.ai’s models, with its service built on its own private data set comprised of “millions of unique users.” No pricing is provided on the site: we’re asking for those details.
“We believe in making technology accessible and plan on working together with the open source community to democratize Voice AI technology,” added Ahrens.
Voice.ai also claims it takes what is a fundamentally different approach to the challenge of changing a voice, tapping into some of the ethos that has built up around the use of avatars by Vtubers, gamers and others online.
“Most voice AI companies that are coming into the space try to build scalable enterprise focused text-to-speech solutions or expensive voice-to-voice services for production studios,” Ahrens said. “We start from the opposite spectrum and try to deliver value to individuals who are looking to expand how they sound online. The core value proposition of our speech-to-speech AI isn’t that it can perfectly replicate any given person. It’s that it retains the core elements of a user’s speech: their emotion, pacing and emphasis while replacing the sound of the voice, in order to create a completely unique new end result, in real-time.”
It might be because of how the demographics in interactive platforms like gaming skew, but for now Voice.ai’s audience is 70% male versus 30% female with new categories opening not just around who is using the tech, but why.
That includes not just those using avatars and building voices to match them, or those looking for more privacy protection, but also, he said, “transgender users who can represent themselves with voices that match their identity, as well as users exploring completely new online personas for themselves.”
There is already a base of users tapping into Voice.ai’s direct-to-consumer offerings, but one of the reasons why Mucker is investing in the startup is because it believes that there is an opportunity to build out a network of developers using and integrating its tech.
“Voice.ai is poised to revolutionize the AI developer community in a manner akin to AdMob’s impact on the mobile app developer community,” said Omar Hamoui, a partner at lead investor Mucker Capital. (Hamoui previously founded the mobile ad startup AdMob, eventually acquired by Google, so he has some direct experience building mobile developer tools.) “By offering user-friendly solutions that were once exclusive to large enterprises, Voice.ai aims to democratize access for developers worldwide.”
Karl Alomar, the former COO of Digital Ocean, who led the investment for M13, said investors will be taking an active role in the next stage of development. “At Digital Ocean too we saw the value of building a community of builders by builders,” he said. “We’re excited for creators and developers to build on the Voice.ai platform.”

"Well done, Pismo and Visa! You gave SoftBank a win",Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/30,"

Hello, and welcome back to Equity, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.

All the cool kids are filling out the Equity listener survey. We want to hear from you! 

Mary Ann and Alex are back for another busy news week chock full of deals to chew through.
Here’s the rundown:

Deals of the Week: We think that the idea behind the recently funded Honey Homes is excellent, but we’re split about the cost. We also went over Gusto’s latest financial achievements and its plans to team up with Remote.
Fintech M&A: The biggest deal of the week in fintech was Visa’s purchase of  Pismo. We haven’t had unicorn-level acquisitions lately, so this one was welcome. Elsewhere in the space, Brex has brought on board a former SVB and a16z denizen, and Ramp bought Cohere.io (not this Cohere, the other one).
Other M&A: But those weren’t the only deals. Databricks bought MosaicML, IBM bought Apptio and ThoughtSpot has acquired Mode Analytics.
Help, my unicorn is starving: We closed with Alex’s look at the declining funding to unicorn and web3 startups, as well as Rebecca Szkutak’s latest on the secondary market in the process.

Equity will be back on Wednesday as we head off into yet another holiday weekend here in the U.S. when Alex will finally put his PTO to use. In the meantime, let’s catch up on Twitter @EquityPod. Talk soon!

It’s rare to find a pitch deck that forces me to dig deep to unearth something to criticize. The last time was with Orange’s seed deck, and in this week’s installment, I had to dive deep into the deck that Super.com used for its $60 million equity, plus $25 million venture debt round.

We’re looking for more unique pitch decks to tear down, so if you want to submit your own, here’s how you can do that. 

Slides in this deck
Super.com operated with a deck that tells a great story. It consists of 17 slides:

Cover slide
Mission slide
Traction slide 1
Traction slide 2
Team slide
Customers (interstitial slide)
Customer profile
Target customers / market size
A Savings Super App (interstitial slide)
  Why Now slide
  “Why a super app” slide
  Product slide
  Product road map slide
  User behavior slide
  Solution slide (“SuperCash is core to the experience”)
  Value Proposition slide (“Personalized Experiences”)
  The Ask slide

Three things to love
It’s hard to choose from all the stuff that works in this deck because the Super.com team really knocked it out of the park. But here are three highlights, which, incidentally, are the three most important slides you can have in a pitch deck. I’m utterly unsurprised that the company successfully managed to raise money.
You’ll raise if you’ve got traction…
Super.com starts its pitch with two traction slides in what can only be described as a masterful flex:
[Slide 3] Traction snapshot. Image Credits: Super.com[Slide 4] Traction over time. Image Credits: Super.comIn Slide 3, the company really flexes its stuff: 80 million customers, $1 billion in goods sold, and $150 million in terms of money saved for customers is beyond impressive. But then, in Slide 4, it shows how that growth is accelerating over time.
I’ve said it before: If you can show incredible traction, you don’t really need much else. Super.com does that, but it also has the goods for the rest of its story.
And an incredible team…
Super.com knows its strengths, and it segues from talking about its mission with its traction into a conversation about its team. Co-founders Henry Shi and Hussein Fazal have built a deep bench of incredible team members:
[Slide 5] What a team. Image Credits: Super.com 

			This is what an absolutely world-class team slide looks like.					


Each of the business verticals — travel, finance and the shop — are led by some world-class people, who are all CEO material in their own right. The company’s CFO is ex-Bank of America, and the CMO used to head marketing at Chase.
In addition, the company has attracted Joanne Bradford (president at Honey, COO at SoFi, and head of global partnerships at Pinterest) and Anan Kashyap (ex-CFO at Ethos and Poshmark) as independent board members.
In a huge market
Most of the time, I recommend doing a top-down TAM/SAM/SOM analysis to arrive at your market size, but Super.com chose a bottom-up approach:
[Slide 8] A slightly unusual market size slide in that it expresses it in customers, not dollars. Image Credits: Super.comThe company says that in the U.S. alone, 25% of the population is its target customer, and it can stretch to around 54% of the population if it expands its reach further.
If this were a pre-seed deck, I’d tell the founders to get it together and do better. But for a company that already has 80 million users, I want to know where it is going to grow. This slide does a good job of answering that question.
The company’s CEO, Fazal, gave me some important context:
We serve the customers who need it the most — typically lower household income, with no to low FICO scores, typically looking to save before they buy. There are about 183 million in that customer base. As we are seeing the wealth inequality gap in the U.S. growing, we have a unique opportunity to make a difference in the lives of more than 100 million Americans. We’re really well-positioned to do this given our active customer base: It’s customer-driven expansion.
That’s a hell of a story.
In the rest of this teardown, we’ll look at three things Super.com could have improved or done differently, along with its full pitch deck!
 "
Fidelity deepens valuation cut for Reddit and Discord,Manish Singh,2023/06/30,"
Fidelity has further slashed the estimated worth of its holding in the social platform Reddit and the chat app Discord as well as SaaS startup Gupshup, giving a preview into how one of the world’s largest asset managers sees the impact of the ongoing slowdown in the public market on privately-held startups.
Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund valued its holdings in Reddit at $15.4 million as of May 31, according to the fund’s monthly disclosure released Friday. That’s down 7.36% from the $16.6 million mark at April’s closure and altogether a slide of 45.4% since its investment in August 2021. The updated share value suggests a $5.5 billion valuation for Reddit.
Fidelity marked down the value of its Discord’s holding to $1.7 million, down 13.4% from a month ago and 47% since the $3.3 million initial investment. (Worth noting that the vast majority of markdown in the value of Reddit and Discord holdings by Fidelity predominantly occurred last year.)
Reddit, which is currently grappling a revolt from moderators of some popular subreddits over API cost changes, was valued at $10 billion when the social media giant attracted funds in August 2021. Discord raised funding in September 2021 at a valuation of $15 billion.
The financial giant also readjusted the value of its holding in Twitter to $6.86 million, up from $6.55 million from a month prior, but still down 65% since the original investment. It slashed its holding in SaaS startup Gupshup to $10.15 million, down from $11 million at April’s closure and 38% since the original investment.

Fertifa enables companies to offer fertility and reproductive health benefits,Catherine Shu,2023/06/30,"
The number of workplaces offering fertility and reproductive healthcare benefits are on the rise. Doing so can help companies become more competitive employers and bolster diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, for example by attracting more women and LGBTQ+ people. Based in London, Fertifa wants to enable more companies in Europe to offer reproductive benefits to workers. Its clients already include Lululemon, Meta, Bain Capital and Virgin. Today the startup announced it has raised a £5 million seed round (about $6.3 million USD) led by Notion Capital and Triple Point Ventures.
Other participants included Conviction, Calm/Storm, Tiny.vc, EQT Foundation and angel investors Eamon Jubbawy, Catherine and Jonathan Lenson, Dorothy Chou, Caroline and Mike Hudack and Scott Mackin. Existing investors Passion Capital, Lemonade Stand, Speedinvest, Monzo co-founder Tom Blomfield, Adam Knight and Jeremy Yap also returned for the round.
Fertifa was founded in 2019 by Tony Chen and Nick Kuan, who have since left the company but remain as shareholders. Eileen Burbidge, who led Fertifa’s pre-seed round along with her Passion Capital partner Malin Posern, joined in January 2022 as executive director to lead the startup and take charge of its business development. Fertifa currently has 22 employees.
Burbidge told TechCrunch in an email that she’s committed to Fertifa’s mission because she has been through “many reproductive health journeys,” in different places and stages of her life, while maintaining a career. These include two elective terminations in her 20s in California, two miscarriages in her 30s while living in London and three rounds of IVF in 2017. She is now perimenopausal and on HRT.
“Although I am an example that it’s possible to do (and to just grin and bear it or carry on), I’m also witness to what a difference it could make for employee wellbeing if individuals had support from their workplaces,” she said. “For example, I imagine how it might have helped me if I’d felt able to perhaps take a day off when I knew I was having a miscarriage at work or to tell someone even as GP of my own venture fund that I was going through IVF and having injections every day.” Access to reproductive healthcare was another concern. “As someone who grew up in America and now lives in the UK, I’m intensely sensitive to what appears to be a slow erosion or roll back of reproductive health rights (or even simply access to via public healthcare due to strains on the NHS and providers)—and I’m desperately keen to play a part in ensuring that as many people as possible have access to education and information so they may make the best choices for themselves,” Burbidge said.
Services Fertifa help facilitate include fertility preservation like egg, embryo and sperm freezing, fertility planning, IVF, IUI and ICSI treatment cycles, contraception, surrogacy and adoption, as well as care for menopause, endometriosis, PCOS, fibroids, STIs and men’s sexual health. Fertifa says it has increased revenues 10x over the last year, and also saved patients more than £1.5 million through employer-funded allowances. It’s also saved employers about £250,000 in compliance by identifying ineligible claims.
Other providers in the space include Peppy, which focuses on menopause, endometriosis and PCOS education in the United States, and reproductive health benefits platforms Apryl, Maven Clinic and Carrot. Fertifa says its differentiators are the scope of its offering, which includes educational resources that are available to employees through an app, clinical services from an in-house team lead by medical director Dr. Gidon Lieberman, reimbursement administration, prescription writing and fulfillment.
Burbidge added that one of Fertifa’s main “competitors” is inaction on the part of employers. Fertifa combats that by demonstrating the business case for providing reproductive health and wellbeing support. It is also often requested by employees through their networks or executive sponsors. “Another influence is when corporates see their competitors acting and investing in the space—and they realize they compete for talent with those companies, so need to meet the bar,” she added.
Fertifa works with companies of all sizes and monetizes through a per employee per month pricing model. It also offers reimbursement administration by charging a 5% fee on transaction volume, with an annual minimum.
The new funding will allow Fertifa to launch new services like treatment financing and scale up its enterprise sales. Its goal is to become the market leader in the U.K. within a year, and then the EMEA category leader by the end of 2024.
In a statement about the financing, Notion Capital partner Itxaso del Palacio said, “Although there is 8x more spent on assisted reproductive technology (ART, including IVF, IUI, ICSI, etc.) in Europe over the U.S., there are three unicorn companies in the U.S. [Maven Clinic, Progyny and Kindbody] and none in Europe. It’s clear there is a massive opportunity for a team with commitment to better outcomes to make a significant impact. We believe we have found this in Fertifa and are excited to see what can be achieved.”

Korea’s Alwayz aims to make online shopping fun again with $46M in funding,Kate Park,2023/06/29,"
Seoul-based e-commerce company Levit, an operator of the shopping app Alwayz, wants to make the shopping experience more entertaining and affordable. The two-year-old startup has recently raised $46 million in a Series B round of funding led by DST Global Partners with participation from new investor BOND and existing backers KB Investment, Mirae Asset Capital, Korea Investment Partners, GS Ventures, and Klim Ventures. With the latest round, Levit has raised a total of $67 million since its inception.
Alwayz offers a wide range of products, from daily groceries to home appliances and apparel to cosmetics. But it deviates from typical e-commerce platforms by incorporating social features like short videos and gamification into online shopping to draw customers. 
For example, users can earn rewards by playing games nurturing the pig character Don-Don-E, or receive crops in real life after successfully cultivating crops by playing a game called AI-Farm in its app. In addition, Alwayz recently introduced a “Shorts” feature that allows users to watch short videos and, in return, get discounts when shopping.  
It also attracts customers with low-price products. Users get discounts if they purchase products with other users or their friends on Alwayz. Alwayz’s C2M (consumer-to-manufacturer) model eliminates layers of distributors, including logistics, inventory and other intermediaries, allowing the app to offer high-quality products at lower prices. Most sellers on Alwayz are producers or manufacturers, according to the company.
“Our average product selling price is around 20% cheaper than the lowest prices on other e-commerce platforms,” chief executive officer and co-founder of Levit, Jaeyun Kang, said. “This has been made possible because lesser-known brands, which traditionally spent nearly 30-50% of the selling price on marketing in search-based [e-commerce] platforms, can now sell their products more efficiently on Alwayz through discovery-based shopping.” 
Levit says games and social features help users enter the Alwayz app daily and be exposed to various products, even if they do not immediately intend to buy. 
“As users enjoy the engaging experience on our platform, we leverage their high engagement to expose them to a range of items through our recommendation algorithms. This way, even if items are from lesser-known brands, customers can discover and buy them,” Kang said. Levit describes this user experience as a “discovery shopping experience.” 
When asked about how it ensures low-priced products are high-quality, the company CEO said its recommendation algorithms assess all items on Alwayz, using factors such as conversion and customer repurchase rates. “We ensure an item isn’t widely exposed until it has proven its quality, and this approach allows us to maintain the quality of items,” he said.

Since its launch in September 2021, the startup claims Alwayz has amassed 1 million users within three months and has reached 7 million users, 2.5 million monthly active users (MAUs) and 1.3 million daily active users (DAUs) in one and a half years. Alwayz aims to secure more than 12 million registered users, 5 million MAUs, and 3 million DAUs by the end of 2023, Kang said, adding that it has nearly 20,000 sellers registered on the app. 
Three founders of Levit — Kang, Sangwoo Park and Hyunjik Lee — have set their sights on two ambitious goals: establishing Levit as the leading e-commerce company in South Korea and capturing a significant share of the global discovery shopping market.
Alwayz has to compete with local peers, the likes of Coupang, Naver and Kurly, but its business model is more similar to the U.S.-listed e-commerce Pinduoduo and China-based AliExpress in terms of social features and lower-price products. 
The outfit, which has 20 people on the team, is planning to bring its platform to the U.S. market as early as this year. 
“Disruption in horizontal commerce is rare,” said Daegwon Chae, general partner of BOND. “Dislodging large incumbents requires meaningfully better, faster, cheaper experiences, which are difficult to achieve in a mature and efficient market. Alwayz has broken through with its relentless focus on user experience, engagement and value.”

11 VCs reveal how hard it was for their startups to fundraise in H1 2023,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/29,"
Everyone knows that raising venture capital has been harder for startups lately — unless you are building an AI startup, of course. But instead of only talking to founders, we’re flipping the script today.
We wanted to hear from investors how their portcos are handling a cash-light environment. To that end, TechCrunch+ recently asked 11 VCs how the first half of 2023 bore out for their investments.
From their answers, it appears a startup’s ability to fundraise in today’s climate is based on several key factors, including capital efficiency, the market and its needs.

Q2 failed to bring a funding reprieve for web3 startups and unicorns

How bad was H1 2023?
Menlo Ventures’ Matt Murphy was succinct when we asked how 2023 was shaping up for his firm’s portfolio companies: “Fundraising is challenging, full stop.” [Update: Menlo Ventures reached out to underscore that Matt’s comment here is in reference to the larger industry since less than 10% of their portfolio needed to raise in the last 12 months.]
“Challenging” is a good descriptor. So is “quiet,” which is how Jason Lemkin of SaaStr Fund put it. For Kaitlyn Doyle of TechNexus Venture Collaborative, the year has been mostly “flat rounds with companies trying to delay the valuation discussion.” She added that the second quarter felt a lot like the first, with investors and startups taking a “wait and see” stance.
Other investors had slightly brighter perspectives on H1 2023. Rex Salisbury of Cambrian Ventures felt the narrative that “this is a terrible time to raise” is simply not true, especially at the early stage. That sentiment matches what we’ve seen thus far in the data: The earlier a startup goes out to raise a round, the better its chances of landing a strong valuation. Indeed, the massive repricings of the public market are yet to trickle down to seed and pre-seed deals. "
Fund of funds are starting to play a different role for venture LPs,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/06/29,"
Fund of funds (FoF) were created to serve as a bridge for LPs to get access to managers they couldn’t back otherwise. But in an environment where funds are not seeing consistent support from their existing LPs, and there are more venture funds than ever, is their role still relevant?
Fund of funds fundraising — say that five times fast! — has declined for years. To compare, traditional U.S. venture firm fundraising set a record in 2022 with $162 billion. U.S.-based VC FoF raised just $400 million in the first quarter of 2023, according to PitchBook, and $3 billion in 2022. This compares to $24.4 billion in 2021 and $33.7 billion — the fundraising peak — in 2017.
It’s not surprising why many LPs have soured on the strategy, said Kyle Stanford, a senior venture analyst at PitchBook. For one, backers of these funds pay a mix of fees to both the FoF and the underlying commitments the FoF manager makes.
“LPs have that double layer of fees. And that extra time it takes after [an LP] invests in the fund of funds and then have it deployed is just something that LPs right now just don’t want to deal with,” Stanford told TechCrunch+.
And with there being so many new firms and funds in the market, the issues surrounding LPs not getting access to attractive VC funds is largely moot and that barrier isn’t really an issue anymore, he said. “There has been way more opportunity to invest in a VC than there has ever been in the past,” he said. “For new LPs coming into the market, they didn’t need to go to a fund of funds to get access.”
But to be clear, even if the funding numbers are down, FoF still holds a place in the future of venture — maybe just a different one than they did traditionally. Multiple firms have started innovating on the model, and FoF can still help LPs get access to the managers they can’t invest in otherwise, albeit for different reasons than before.

"Niantic lays off 230 employees, cancels NBA and Marvel games",Amanda Silberling,2023/06/29,"
Pokémon GO maker Niantic laid off 230 employees today, just one year after it laid off around 90 employees.
During last year’s layoffs, Niantic canceled four projects, including a Transformers game. Some Niantic games will meet the same fate this time around. After four months in the App Store, Niantic is shutting down NBA All-World; the company will also cancel production on a game based on the Marvel franchise.
“In the wake of the revenue surge we saw during Covid, we grew our headcount and related expenses in order to pursue growth more aggressively,” CEO John Hanke wrote in an email to employees, cross-posted to the company blog.
This has been a common refrain among the hundreds of tech companies that have conducted layoffs over the last year — companies claimed they overhired during the pandemic and now need to right-size their teams. In Niantic’s case, Hanke said that revenue has returned to pre-pandemic levels, and new projects have not delivered as much revenue as they would have hoped.
One such new project is Peridot, a Tamagotchi-like mobile game. Niantic’s first attempt at original IP since Ingress, Peridot launched in May. But according to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, Peridot has only made $1.4 million in gross in-app purchase revenue thus far.
Peridot is a technologically sophisticated game, complete with a robust breeding system that makes every players’ pets genetically unique. But players were disappointed at launch, since many of the game’s most exciting features are paywalled. The only way to hatch a new Peridot, for example, is to pay $5 for an in-game item. And once you pay to hatch a Peridot, you discover that you also have to pay if you want your new pet to have certain unique fur patterns or styles.
Pokémon GO is Niantic’s cash cow, pulling in more than $1 billion in in-app purchases each year since 2020. But players have also been feeling slighted by Niantic’s in-app purchase system.
At the end of March, Niantic nearly doubled the price of remote raid passes, an extremely popular in-app item. The company’s reasoning is that remote play options were essential during pandemic lockdowns, but they go against Niantic’s vision for the game, which is to get people outside to play together in person. Players don’t feel that way, though. Some even chose to boycott Pokémon GO in protest. While their protest may not have caught Niantic’s attention, its in-app purchase sales likely did.
Between July 2022 and March 2023, Sensor Tower data shows Niantic made an average of $70 million in gross in-app purchase revenue each month. In the three months since the remote raid pass price increase, Niantic has made an average of $53 million per month.
“The top priority is to keep Pokémon GO healthy and growing as a forever game,” Hanke wrote. Some Pokémon GO staff were impacted by these layoffs.
Though games like Peridot have not yet proved financially sustainable, Niantic has an entire business arm separate from its own games. Niantic’s Lightship AR developer kit makes it possible for any developer who knows how to use Unity to make AR games. Developers also have access to Niantic’s impressive visual positioning system (VPS), which lets users interact with local landmarks in their real-world surroundings.
Hanke even mentioned in his note to employees that the company wants to ramp up its focus on building for mixed-reality devices and AR glasses. So, if Niantic can’t seem to make a successful follow-up to Pokémon GO, maybe its developer tools can keep the company on the right track.

"Runway, a startup building generative AI for content creators, raises $141M",Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/29,"
It’s a big day for generative AI funding.
On the heels of Inflection AI landing a $1.3 billion investment, Runway, a startup building generative AI tools for multimedia content creators, today announced a $141 million extension to its Series C round from Google, Nvidia and Salesforce, among others.
Building on the Series C the company announced in December, Runway says that the new capital will be used to scale its in-house research efforts and expand Runway’s headcount.
“We’re focused on how we can continue pushing the boundaries of creativity,” Runway CEO Cris Valenzuela told TechCrunch via email. “The additional funding allows us to double down on this, innovating on new tools for artists and creators.”
Runway was founded in 2018 by Valenzuela, Alejandro Matamala and Anastasis Germanidis. Valenzuela met Matamala and Germanidis while in art school at NYU, where the trio came to realize that they shared a curiosity in AI’s creative potential. From there, Valenzuela, Matamala and Germanidis started building a suite of AI-powered tools geared toward moviemakers, cinematographers and photographers.
Runway’s focus has gradually shifted over the years to generative AI, particularly on the video side. Its current flagship product is Gen-2, an AI model that generates videos from text prompts or an existing image.

We tested Gen-2 and found it to be impressive — if somewhat wanting. But to Runway’s credit, Gen-2 — the follow-up to Runway’s Gen-1 model launched in February — is one of the first commercially available text-to-video models.
Runway has ambitions beyond building a toolset, to be clear. The startup recently founded Runway Studios, an entertainment division that serves as a production partner for enterprise clients. It also launched the AI Film Festival, an event Runway claims is one of the first dedicated to showcasing films produced in whole or in part by AI.
Valenzuela says that Runway’s customer base now spans Fortune 500 and Global 2000 companies, including New Balance and “millions” of individual creators.
The growing enterprise client base isn’t surprising, considering the massive hype around all forms of generative AI. In a recent FreshBooks survey, 25% of businesses said that they’re testing generative AI tools, while around 33% plan to try generative AI for work within the next year.
“Content creation today is very expensive and time consuming,” he added. “We want to help bring those cost and time factors as close to zero as possible, especially as companies’ content needs are only increasing . . . [Our goal is to] reimagine content creation and [build] a new type of creative suite, the generative suite.”
The Series C extension — which values Runway at $1.5 billion, a source familiar with the matter tells TechCrunch — brings the company’s total raised to $237 million. It makes Runway one of the better-funded generative AI startups out there, in league with Cohere, Character.ai ($150 million) and Stability AI (~$100 million).

"Thrive Capital doubles down on Clair, a fintech helping frontline workers get paid instantly",Christine Hall,2023/07/06,"
After developing a free earned-wage advance offering for frontline workers two years ago, fintech company Clair is back with a new tool to help workers get paid after completing a shift and receiving $25 million in new equity funding.
The round was led by Thrive Capital and includes Upfront Ventures and Kairos. Clair’s total venture-backed funds now rise to $45 million, according to Nico Simko, co-founder and CEO of Clair. As part of the investment, Michael Presser, investing partner at Kairos, was appointed as a board observer.

The company also announced $150 million as part of a new consumer lending program from partner bank Pathward, which holds the FDIC-insured accounts for Clair and provides the wage advances to frontline workers. Clair is facilitating loans that Pathward issues directly to Clair’s customers when they take a wage advance, with the lending between Pathward and the customers, according to the company.
Clair currently works with over 10,000 employers, workforce management systems and payroll and over 50,000 workers. Employees will see Clair through those existing employer systems that allow you to select your schedule separate from your payroll system. Employers can onboard employees and see payroll data. Employees can download the Clair app and conduct financial activities, including savings, check printing and the ability to withdraw funds for free through ATMs.
Simko touts the company’s new offering as “the first free on-demand pay solution” where users can withdraw funds immediately for the money they’ve earned but not yet received, instantly into their account.
“We’re the first provider that went to a bank and convinced the bank to do those advances, basically as micro loans, $50 loans,” Simko said. “Most early-stage, on-demand pay companies are the ones advancing the funds. By convincing a bank to do this, it gives regulatory certainty to our partners and consumers because there is a national bank backing it.”
He explained that having a bank make the advances “fueled our growth, which included 10x revenue growth over the past year,” and provided security measures for employers still thinking about the demise of Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank.
Simko intends to deploy the new capital into meeting demand for Clair’s backlog of customers. And while it is focused on workforce management and payroll companies, the company has received some inbound requests from larger businesses that Simko aims to address.
Clair is also launching a new offering for employers called Clair for Employers, which is a way for them to offer free, holistic financial wellness benefits to their employees. The offering integrates with a companies’ payroll providers, and employees of companies using it can also access additional features in their Clair accounts, including 3% cash back on gas and groceries purchased on their Clair Debit Mastercard.
In addition, the company is looking at other offerings, including a dynamic 401(k) and health savings account.
“With financial services tied to payroll and workforce management, the sky’s the limit,” Simko said. “Most of these need to be tied to a bank and payroll system, and since we have these deep kinds of HR integrations, the vision of Clair is to build the best bank for America’s workforce.”
Editor’s note, July 6, 2023, 8:23 a.m.: Story updated to reflect that the $150 million is not debt funding, but a consumer lending program.

As companies fight to retain talent, employee-benefits startups might escape cost cuts

Dear Sophie,
I just found out that I’ve been selected as a trainee in the J-1 exchange program. 
I’m currently in the U.S. on a B-1/B-2 visitor visa. The sponsoring company would like me to start in August. I heard it can take several months to change my status to a J-1. Is there a way to get a J-1 faster? 
Is there anything I should know about the J-1, particularly if I later decide to stay in the U.S. once the J-1 program ends?
— Techie Trainee
Dear Techie,
Congratulations on being selected as a J-1 educational and cultural exchange trainee!
The purpose of the J-1 is to exchange knowledge between countries. Check out my podcast that provides an overview of the J-1 as well as the waiver process. The J-1 visa is intended for people from around the globe to work or study in the U.S. and then take their newly acquired knowledge and skills back to their home country.
The Trainee J-1 usually lasts 18 months. Some J-1 holders are required to return to their home country for at least two years once their J-1 status ends. The waiver process can be particularly tricky. I recommend you consult an immigration attorney before you begin your program to confirm if you are subject to the two-year foreign residency requirement. They can also help you with any J-1 change of status or waiver application as necessary.
Good news: USCIS (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services) just rolled out premium processing for J-1 changes of status, shortening the process for individuals currently inside the United States!

Keep in mind: non-immigrant intent
Most U.S. visas such as the B-1/B-2 for visitors, J-1 for exchange visitors, and F-1 for students require their holders to have non-immigrant intent: it’s your job to prove to the U.S. government that you plan to depart the United States at the end of your program. Evidence of immigrant intent — your intention to live permanently in the U.S. by obtaining a green card — is cause for immigration officials to deny your visa. Other factors, like having a significant other who is a U.S. citizen or stating that you are planning to work in the U.S. long-term, could also be interpreted as evidence of your immigrant intent.
For the J-1, you will need to demonstrate to immigration officials that you intend to eventually return to your home country by maintaining a residence in your country or showing you have ties to your country of residence. The reason the State Department administers this program is to promote the flow of knowledge around the world. (Remember, before the internet, we generally had to physically travel to share knowledge, information, and network with people in other countries!)
How to get a J-1
After you enroll in a program, it will issue you a Form DS-2019, which is the Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor (J-1) Status. Recently, most people have been applying for new J-1 visas at the consulate and receive a multiple-entry visa.

Brinc, the Hong Kong–based accelerator backed by investors like Animoca Brands, is launching a new program for fledgling climate tech startups. The three-month program is tailored for founders who are focused on carbon dioxide removal (CDR). They will receive fundraising support, guidance on how to scale up and introductions to Brinc’s network of follow-on investors, mentors and corporates.
Janina Motter, Brinc’s Climate Tech Program manager, told TechCrunch that the accelerator has focused on climate tech for several years through its food tech vertical. “From those successes, we recognized sector specificity is key to maximize value for founders,” she said. “This is why we plan to have several different climate tech programs over time, with this new program focused on carbon removal, utilization and storage.” She added that Brinc has seen underinvestment in carbon removal relative to its climate impact.
The inaugural cohort includes four startups. Motter said “the strongest applicants understand how their approach fits into the competitive landscape and have compelling answers about ‘why them? why now?’ for the company to grow. Furthermore, for CDR in particular, it’s critical that startups have some initial understanding of how their technology fits into broader context (ecological risk, co-benefits, local communities, etc.) and are willing to develop a robust framework which will help them scale responsibly.”
From the United Kingdom, Airhive is creating geochemical direct air capture (DAC) to scale carbon removal. Its DAC system is modular and based on a fluidized nano-structured sorbent.
Based in the United States, CarbonBridge captures fermentation CO2 — CO2 generated by fermenting plant matter — to make beer, wine and other products, before it enters the atmosphere, and produces eco-friendly methanol through a microbial conversion process. The startup says this is a cost-effective alternative to mainstream methanol made from fossil fuels.
Hong Kong’s Formwork IO wants to reduce carbon emissions in architecture and other parts of the built environment. It does so by creating carbon-negative concrete through the use of waste carbon dioxide and materials as binders. Formwork IO is focused on the Asian market, where it says more than 70% of cement is produced.
Poás Bioenergy, based in Costa Rica, turns agricultural waste, including coffee and pineapple residue, into biochar and syngas, making waste management more efficient and giving farms a source of clean energy.
The Climate Tech Program is supported by organizations like Artesian, Carbon Business Council, CO2CRC, Direct Air Capture Coalition, PML Applications and others.

Crypto funding drops for fifth straight quarter as investors continue to pull back,Jacquelyn Melinek,2023/07/05,"

Funding for crypto startups continues to grow more scarce. Venture capital flowing into the industry dropped for the fifth consecutive quarter since Q1 2022 to $2.34 billion globally as investors withhold their checkbooks, fearing risks from a severe regulatory stance and an uncertain economy.
The second quarter’s $2.34 billion tally was raised across 382 deals, according to PitchBook data, but it’s a stark decline from the $12.14 billion peak the industry hit in the first quarter of 2022. The biggest raises during Q2 2023 were LayerZero’s $120 million Series B round and Worldcoin’s $115 million Series C round.
“It’s a numbers game,” said Lydia Chiu, VP of business development at Ava Labs. In general, investors are seeing lower valuations, so they’re writing “smaller checks,” she told TechCrunch+.
This decline in capital deployment could be attributed to regulatory headwinds in the U.S., which have inclined a lot of crypto-related deal flows in Q2 to be structured like traditional venture structures, like raising equity, opposed to token investments or simple agreement for future tokens (SAFTs), Chiu said.
 

			The Tiger Globals and Softbanks of the world aren’t going to invest in everything anymore.							Lasse Clausen, founding partner, 1kx



Regulations have certainly stifled optimism around the industry, but there are also a number of other factors at play. A handful of popular crypto companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year, squelching confidence in the industry, and a few traditional firms and entrepreneurs left the U.S. ecosystem altogether when the market turned. It also didn’t help when investors suddenly adopted a much more discerning approach that valued profits over growth.
According to Chiu, valuations in the industry dropped a stark 50% from the first half of 2022 to the second half of 2022. Since then, crypto startups’ valuations have dropped an additional 15% to the first half of 2023, totaling almost 70% year over year.
That’s a severe decline — startups that raised money in January 2022, for example, would be hard pressed to raise capital again today without taking a steep discount on their price tags.
But it’s not all doom and gloom, and crypto-native founders and investors are not yet giving up hope. “That trend is not necessarily going to reverse, but it may slow down in Q3 or be less severe,” Chiu said.
Indeed, there’s still “a lot of money being deployed,” said Lasse Clausen, founding partner at early-stage crypto investing firm 1kx. “[Funding] looks like it’s down, and it absolutely is, but comparing it to all time highs, those didn’t even make any sense.”

Announcing the SaaS Stage agenda at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023,Frederic Lardinois,2023/07/05,"
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) has become something akin to the default model for software distribution. But it’s more than a business model. It’s also a way of developing and managing software throughout its life cycle — and that means its underpinnings are forever changing.
We decided to host a special SaaS Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023 to dig deeper into the current state of SaaS, especially now that AI is changing the software landscape once again. We announced the new stage a few weeks ago, and today we’re excited to provide a first look at the agenda. Stay tuned — we’ll add more in the weeks to come!
We’ll examine the current state of SaaS of course but, more importantly, the agenda explores what comes next. We’ll talk to some of the sharpest minds and professionals in the industry — executives from early- and late-stage SaaS companies, leaders from the infrastructure companies that power the industry and the venture capitalists who fund them. The agenda is about 80% complete, so make sure to check back for more updates!
We hope you’ll join us at TechCrunch Disrupt on September 19–21 in San Francisco.
The SaaS Stage Agenda at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023
Selling Your SaaS Startup: The VC View
with Whit Bouck (Insight), Megan Reynolds (Vertex) and Cathy Gao (Sapphire Ventures)
There are many reasons to sell your SaaS startup, but what is the investor perspective? This panel looks at why VCs might support your move to sell, and when they might encourage you to keep going.
What’s Next for GitHub?
with Thomas Dohmke (GitHub CEO)
GitHub has long been at the core of developer workflows, but over the course of the last few years, the company started going well beyond being a code repository and collaboration service. To a large degree, that’s thanks to its Copilot code completion service. In this session, we’ll talk about what’s next for GitHub as it expands beyond its core service under the ownership of Microsoft.
Cloudflare’s Journey from TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield to Public Company
with Michelle Zatlyn and Matthew Prince (Cloudflare co-founders)
Cloudflare launched onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2010. Today it’s a public company. We will chat with the co-founders about their journey and the challenges they face in today’s investment climate.
AI for SaaS
with Ines Chami (Numbers Station AI), David DeSanto (GitLab) and Navrina Singh (Credo AI)
The use cases for generative AI are endless, so it’s no surprise that virtually every new and existing SaaS startup now wants to make it part of their core product. In this session, we’ll talk about how to best do that, no matter whether you have an established product or you’re just starting out — all while doing so responsibly.
The State of Quantum
with Itamar Sivan (Quantum Machines)
Quantum computing is quickly moving from a science-fiction concept to a technology that has the potential to change the state of computing. In this session, we’ll talk about the state of the industry, the challenges ahead and the potential risks involved.

Steering through venture’s global correction with the GPCA’s CEO,Alex Wilhelm,2023/07/05,"

Hello and welcome back to Equity, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines. This is our Wednesday show where we niche down to a single topic and dig deep.

All the cool kids are filling out the Equity listener survey. We want to hear from you! 

Long-time Equity listeners and TechCrunch readers should be familiar with LAVCA, an association of capital managers in the Latin America region. We have reported on its data a number of times. Well, it turns out that LAVCA is part of the larger Global Private Capital Association, which keeps tabs on a host of markets that we’re working to cover more carefully as startup activity becomes an increasingly global phenomenon.
So to cap off the second quarter, and to get our claws into what is going on around the world, we had Cate Ambrose, the CEO of the GPCA on the show to riff with us about Asia and Africa and Latin America and Central and Easter Europe. Here’s what we wanted to find out:

How wild was the 2021-era venture peak in less mature startup markets?
How resilient are smaller startup ecosystems in a more conservative venture and macroeconomic environment?
Are we seeing green shoots anywhere in the world? Or put another way, where is the rebound kicking off?
We closed with a short discussion on the role of government in startup markets and squeezed in an AI question because how could we not!

We have another interview coming your way Friday, so stay tuned!
For episode transcripts and more, head to Equity’s Simplecast website.
Equity drops at 7 a.m. PT every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, so subscribe to us on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify and all the casts. TechCrunch also has a great show on crypto, a show that interviews founders, one that details how our stories come together and more!

"Yes, investors will sign an NDA, but only in this specific circumstance",Haje Jan Kamps,2023/07/05,"
If you’ve tried to get an investor to sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) before you pitch them, you’ll often be waved off with something like, “We don’t do that.”
That is somewhat sensible: Investors talk to a lot of startups, so signing an NDA could open them up to liabilities in many ways. For example, an investor could agree to not share anything you’ve disclosed, but it’s possible they heard another startup doing exactly what you do, with exactly your approach a couple of weeks before they spoke to you. That puts them in an awkward position.
This practice is therefore so widespread it’s become something of a rule.

As a startup founder, you really need to understand how venture capital works

There are times when you should push back against such conventions, though: When you’re discussing the details of your technology.
If an investor says they don’t sign NDAs, here’s what you should do: Take the meeting anyway but move the slides that talk about your technology to another part of the presentation deck, behind an interstitial slide saying, “Beyond this point, an NDA is required.”
Your job as the founder — using the market size, your unique team and traction — is to tell enough of a compelling story that the investors choose to sign an NDA ahead of your next meeting.
Here’s why you might need an NDA

CADDi raises $89M Series C to scale its B2B supply chain marketplace for manufacturing parts ,Kate Park,2023/07/05,"
The pandemic has damaged the entire manufacturing supply chain, which is not likely to return to normal until at least 2024 due to a few challenges, including the ongoing U.S.-China tech battle. According to a recent survey by the Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM), which surveyed more than 150 equipment manufacturing firms and 179 equipment manufacturing executives, 98% of the respondents still are facing the supply chain issue and more than half are experiencing worsening supply chain conditions owing to a labor shortage and access to source intermediate components. 
Today, a startup called CADDi, which operates a business-to-business (B2B) marketplace for the manufacturing industry, said it has raised $89 million in a Series C round, bringing its total capital to $164 million, to scale its business and help those equipment manufacturing players. 
Existing investors Globis Capital Partners, DCM Ventures, Global Brain, World Innovation Lab, JAFCO and Minerva Growth Partners participated in the Series C financing along with four new investors, including SMBC Venture Capital and Mitsubishi UFJ Capital. 
CADDi did not provide its post-valuation but said the valuation had been up from its previous funding. In 2021, TechCrunch reported that its valuation was estimated at $450 million at its Series B funding, citing sources familiar with the deal. 
Since its last fundraising, the number of employees has more than doubled from 250 to 590 globally, and the startup launched a new platform called CADDi Drawer, an artificial intelligence-powered cloud service for managing drawing data, last June. 
Yushiro Kato (CEO), a former consultant at McKinsey & Company, and Aki Kobashi (CTO), who previously worked as an engineer at Lockheed Martin and Apple, co-founded CADDi in 2017. The startup now offers two major solutions: CADDi Manufacturing, a parts procurement platform, and CADDi Drawer. 
CADDi deals with mid-volume production and high-mix, low-volume production manufacturers, also known as make-to-order manufacturing, in which manufacturers produce products after confirmed orders. But the problem is consumers cannot get optimal pricing with low- to mid-volume production manufacturers due to volume constraints.
The outfit says the CAADi Manufacturing platform eliminates some procurement work and aggregates orders to help find similar materials, processes and suitable delivery schedules. It enables customers to access optimal prices with a 99.83% on-time delivery rate and a 99.96% non-defective rate yielding, Kato said in an email interview. It also allows manufacturers’ procurement costs to reduce by nearly 20%. 
CADDi Drawer offers access to “all procurement data” and details that impact quality, cost and delivery (QCD); its platform also enables users to save significant time and costs while allowing manufacturers to improve QCD with more drawings created. Since April, the CADDi Drawer team has worked with the AI team to handle the information. 
“Because of the difficulty of access [drawings], drawings are often recreated or just not found, which means keys to improving QCD, the KPI for manufacturing professionals, are never unlocked,” Kato said. “So, instead of more drawings providing more improvement, it’s almost like the data is never saved, and people are forced to start from scratch every time.” 
CADDi claims it works with 70% of Japan’s top 20 industrial equipment manufacturers (by revenue) for CADDi Manufacturing. For CADDi Drawer, its customers include Tokyo Electron and EBARA. 
It will use the proceeds to enhance CADDi manufacturing and CADDi Drawing and expand its workforce in the U.S., aiming to reach its goals of posting $10 billion in revenue from CADDi manufacturing and $1 billion in revenue from CADDi Drawer by 2030. 
Some of the pains in the procurement industry in the U.S. are similar to those in Japan, Kato said, citing not only labor shortages in the manufacturing sector but also many ongoing mergers and acquisitions. But factories are not integrated well on account of different systems and standards, Kato noted. 
“We can expand into the U.S. by leveraging [our] knowledge and technology that have developed since our inception, primarily in Japan and across a variety of manufacturing industries,” Kato said. 
The Japan-headquartered company recently opened an office in the U.S. and supplier operations in Mexico to cater to clients in the U.S. In Asia, CADDi has offices in Vietnam and Thailand.

Daniel Ek’s Neko Health raises $65M for preventative healthcare through full-body scans,Paul Sawers,2023/07/05,"
Neko Health, the health tech startup co-founded by Spotify co-creator Daniel Ek, has raised €60 million ($65 million) in its first external round of funding.
The Series A round was led by Lakestar, with participation from Atomico and General Catalyst.
Founded out of Sweden in 2018 by Ek and Hjalmar Nilsonne, Neko Health exited stealth back in February with the lofty promise of preventative healthcare via full-body scans backed by AI software that help doctors detect skin conditions including cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, among other metabolic syndromes.
Each scan apparently takes around 10 minutes and costs €250, according to the company, and is followed by an in-person consultation where the results are explained.

The Stockholm-headquartered company claims a team of 35 doctors, researchers and technicians spread across Europe, and it has a waiting list for people seeking full-body scans out of its inaugural clinic in Stockholm.
“Healthcare costs are spiraling out of control — we believe preventive health will be key to reversing this trend,” Neko Health CEO Hjalmar Nilsonne noted in a statement. “Doctors today just don’t have enough time or resources to focus on prevention. This leads to many health problems going unnoticed until they get really serious, causing a lot of pain and putting a massive strain on the healthcare system.”
Unhealthy silence
What’s perhaps most notable about Neko at this juncture is its aversion to interviews, particularly against the backdrop of high-profile health techs such as Theranos’ spectacular fall from grace after making bold claims with little foundation. Indeed, Neko Health declined to give interviews to international media when it formally launched earlier this year, and little opportunity was given to ask questions ahead of today’s funding announcement.
At any rate, Neko Health has amassed a fairly impressive roster of investors spanning the U.S. and Europe, which have collectively backed companies including Spotify, Airbnb, Snap and HubSpot. And as a result of their investments, Lakestar and Atomico’s founders, Klaus Hommels and Niklas Zennström respectively, will join Neko’s board of directors alongside Neko’s two founders.
The company said it will use its fresh cash injection to accelerate its expansion plans, including more clinics across Europe, and investing in R&D, clinical studies and recruitment.

"PharmEasy, once valued at over $5 billion, seeks new funding at a 90% valuation cut",Manish Singh,2023/07/05,"
Indian online pharmacy startup PharmEasy is planning to raise about $300 million in a new round of funding at a 90% markdown from the previous valuation, two people familiar with the matter said, effectively giving in to some investors’ push to sell itself. Should PharmEasy succeed in securing the new funding, its valuation will drop to half of the total capital it has raised over years.
PharmEasy, one of India’s largest pharmacy firms, is racing to raise the new capital to pay its lender Goldman Sachs, the people said, requesting anonymity discussing sensitive information. PharmEasy borrowed about $285 million from Goldman Sachs last year to pay off an earlier debt that it took to move ahead with a majority stake acquisition of Thyrocare for over $600 million.
The firm, which offers a range of services including tools and information on wellness, consultations, diagnostic and radiology tests and treatment deliveries, had filed for an $843 million IPO in November 2021, but later deferred the plan.
PharmEasy’s chief executive did not respond to a request for comment.
Indian newspaper Economic Times first reported the development, while Moneycontrol said separately that healthcare group Manipal was looking to lead the $300 million funding into the startup. Some of the startup’s backers have been pushing it to sell the business for several quarters, according to three people familiar with the matter.
API Holdings, the parent firm of PharmEasy, was valued at $5.6 billion in its most recent funding round in the second half of 2021.
The startup plans to raise new financing through a rights issue that would value the price of its shares at 5 Indian rupees, down from 50 earlier, Economic Times reported, citing internal documents.
At the proposed terms, if the round materializes, PharmEasy will see its valuation plummet to about $500 million to $600 million. The startup, whose stake in Thyrocare itself is worth about $241 million at Wednesday’s closure, has altogether raised over $1.1 billion against equity and in debt. It will also become the first major Indian unicorn to raise a down round.
PharmEasy has been looking to raise a new round for several quarters, but has struggled to find a taker at even $2 billion valuation, TechCrunch reported earlier. The company did not respond at the time.
The firm counts TPG, Prosus, Temasek, B Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, Eight Roads Ventures, Steadview Capital and JM Financial among its backers.

"After bootstrapping for 8 years, accounting startup Dougs raises $27 million",Romain Dillet,2023/07/04,"
Dougs, a French accounting startup, has been around since 2015. It already generates $16.4 million (€15 million) in annual recurring revenue. And it’s a bootstrapped company, meaning that it hasn’t opened its capital and raised any funding from VC firms. But now, the company has decided to raise its first funding round.
Dougs raised $27 million (€25 million) from Expedition Growth Capital, a British VC firm that is looking for investment opportunities in bootstrapped companies that have reached a certain level of maturity. And Dougs seems to fit the bill quite well as the company has 14,000 clients and is already profitable.
At its core, Dougs is an online chartered accountant service for small and medium companies. It handles your financial statements and generates certified tax filings. Behind the scenes, Dougs works with chartered accountants, legal experts, HR professionals, etc. But the company has also designed its own accounting application to improve the relationship between the Dougs team and its clients.
In particular, clients can connect Dougs with their bank accounts so that the accounting platform can automatically fetch transactions. From the customer portal, clients can upload documents, receipts and more. Dougs can also handle expense reports and invoices, which means that you can use Dougs to get an overview of your company’s revenue — past, present and future.
Additionally, Dougs can facilitate the incorporation process. It can also be used for your company’s payroll. Dougs also provides legal advice when needed. In other words, the startup handles all the usual tasks that would be handled by an accountant.
There are 250 people working for Dougs. With today’s funding round, the company expects to reach the next level by doubling the size of its team by 2025. Up next, the startup plans to expand to new countries, such as Germany and the U.K.
Dougs competes with other online chartered accountant services, such as Keobiz, Livli, Wity, etc. Some tech companies like Pennylane are taking a different approach as they work with existing accounting firms to make them switch from a legacy accounting software solution to a modern software-as-a-service platform.
But there’s room for many companies in this space, as accounting firms remain extremely fragmented in France. Existing accounting firms working with old-school accounting applications remain the default option for many small and medium companies.

Deep tech in Latin America and the Caribbean is set to skyrocket,Anna Heim,2023/07/04,"
The Tesla Gigafactory planned to be built in Mexico should be seen, Bloomberg argues, “as a graduation moment for Mexican manufacturing.” And there’s hope that the CHIPS bill, which President Joe Biden promoted to supercharge semiconductor production in the U.S., will benefit its southern neighbor as well.
While the prospect of new factories and more jobs is good news for Mexico, the country and its Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) peers can harbor higher hopes when it comes to deep tech, a new report posits.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

Titled “Deep Tech: The New Wave” and created in collaboration with the Inter-American Development Bank’s innovation laboratory (IDB Lab), the report concludes that there is room for a twentyfold increase in VC investment into LAC deep tech startups over the next decade.
While such projections are always open for debate, the reasoning and data behind this conclusion are worth looking into.
Diving deep
What “deep tech” means changes according to who’s using it. The consulting firm behind this report, Surfing Tsunamis, used this definition by Propel(x) CEO Swati Chaturvedi:
Deep technology companies are built on tangible scientific discoveries or engineering innovations. They are trying to solve big issues that really affect the world around them. For example, a new medical device or technique fighting cancer, data analytics to help farmers grow more food, or a clean energy solution trying to lessen the human impact on climate change.
Based on this definition, the report says LAC’s “most notable deep tech success story to date” is cybersecurity startup Auth0, which Okta acquired for $6.5 billion in 2021.
Despite this fairly broad definition covering everything from cybersecurity to biotech, most LAC startups don’t fit the bill. Inferring from a previous report, Surfing Tsunamis estimates that deep tech companies represent roughly 10% of the regional startup ecosystem.

Making sense of the $6.5B Okta-Auth0 deal

“The vast majority of startups from Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) [regions] focus on product and business model innovation, with limited technology risk,” it said.
Venture capital investment into LAC deep tech represents an even smaller share of overall VC dealmaking in the region. However, it is on the rise, both in absolute numbers and proportionally, growing from $96 million (0.59%) in 2020 to $172 million (2.2%) in 2022.
What do the recipients of this venture capital look like? They are fairly diverse, both in terms of sector and country of origin. "
Plaid will deposit open banking intel on the Fintech Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023,Lauren Simonds,2023/07/04,"
If a cat had a thousand lives, we would name it Plaid — in recognition of the fintech startup giant that moves forward relentlessly, regardless of obstacles along the way. Case in point: When the Department of Justice scuttled a $5 billion acquisition deal with Visa, Plaid barely blinked.
Instead, it continued its quest to make open banking a reality by releasing new features and raising more money. It’s been an impressive performance, considering the challenges presented by the macro-environment — from which Plaid was entirely not immune.
These are just a few reasons why we’re excited that Zach Perret, Plaid’s co-founder and CEO, will join us for the aptly named session “Plaid’s Zach Perret Opens Up on Open Banking.” You’ll find it on the Fintech Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023, which takes place September 19–21 in San Francisco.
We look forward to hearing Perret’s take on the current state and overall future of open banking. We’re also interested in how he, and the company, regrouped after the Visa deal fell through. What did it take to focus and forge ahead?
Plaid has been gradually expanding its offerings over the years — including adding income verification services, facilitating payments and tackling fraud. We wonder whether Perret ever worries about the company trying to do too much at once.
We’ll also ask what’s ahead for Plaid, and, without a doubt, more questions will pop up between now and September. Join us for what’s sure to be an interesting, insightful session.
Zach Perret: Plaid co-founder and CEO
When Zach Perret realized how difficult it was to build a personal finance application, he co-founded Plaid in 2013. The tech platform gives developers easy and secure access to a financial data network capable of powering any digital financial service.
Prior to founding Plaid, Perret was a consultant for Bain and graduated with degrees in physics and chemistry from Duke University.

What’s it like being a Black founder in France?,Dominic-Madori Davis,2023/07/04,"
In France, Shaila Sahai says pitching investors usually goes like this.
She is a woman, Black and a CEO, and when she walks into a meeting with investors, armed with a slide deck for her fintech startup We Take Part, she’s often greeted with bafflement. “They are surprised, and they can’t hide it,” she told me.
She’ll go on to pitch her company, and then: “They usually just leave the conversation,” she said. “I’ve had people say, ‘Oh, okay, nice, very interesting. Thank you. See you soon.’ And we were in the middle of a conversation.”
In France, Sahai isn’t alone in facing this almost systemic avoidance of people who look like her, but you wouldn’t be able to find any proof of it. The French startup ecosystem for Black founders is shrouded in mystery, especially because France’s embrace of universalism and its color-blind approach to economic and social policy has meant that there is little to no data or visibility into the startup and venture capital industry’s racial and ethnic diversity.
The country does not track its racial diversity metrics (former French president Nicolas Sarkozy tried and failed to change that about 14 years ago), meaning that while racism continues to exist in the country like everywhere else in the world, there is no hard evidence of that racism. Many Black founders are reluctant to draw attention to themselves and instead move in silence, contributing to a lack of success stories about them.
 

			We have to fight all these stereotypes to prove we can do interesting things.					


For those looking to break into the tech sector, this lack of information makes it look like there is nothing happening within venture capital for Black founders.
Naturally, that isn’t true: Laura Pallier raised a $20 million Series A for her fintech SaaS platform Regate last September; Alvyn Severien closed a $13 million Series A for his algae products company Algama in January; Nelly Chatue-Diop raised $2 million last year for her web3 investment startup Ejara; Bruno Mendes Da Silva raised $3.5 million last year for his AI-focused data startup Heex Technologies; and Sebastien Luissaint raised $2.4 million last August for Myditek, an agtech startup.
This list isn’t comprehensive, of course, but it’s representative of the fact that Black founders can and do run fast-growing businesses in tech and other fields. “We are invited to speak, we are invited onstage to testify,” Sahai said. “But we have more to bring to the table than just testaments. We should be invited to the decision-making process. We should be funded. And that’s it.”
“It’s impossible that you can be their equal”
Black people in France have faced a long history of discrimination that’s been swept under the rug. Many Black people in France hail from or are descendants of immigrants from its Outremer or “overseas departments” — mostly islands such as Réunion and Martinique — and are legally French citizens. Others have ancestors from former French colonies in Africa, including Côte d’Ivoire, Mali and Senegal.
Sahai, who was born and raised in France, believes the country is still “embarrassed” about its history of enslaving and colonizing Africans and Afro-Caribbeans. Despite that, deep-seated racial stereotypes and prejudices still fester in the country, manifesting in the form of economic discrimination against Black entrepreneurs, a few founders told TechCrunch+.
Compared to the U.K., where there have been more open and honest conversations about racism and colonialism, she said the French don’t want to acknowledge their history.

Google’s Gradient backs YC alum Infisical to solve secret sprawl,Paul Sawers,2023/07/03,"
Secret sprawl, where companies store authentication credentials and similar sensitive data across multiple locations, is a real and growing problem for any company wanting to avert a security breach.
Companies might have hundreds of secrets — such as API keys, passwords or database access tokens — spread across their infrastructure, making it difficult to keep tabs on what is stored where, who has access to it, and whether any of this data has inadvertently found its way into the public realm. By way of example, back in 2017, Uber revealed a major breach that exposed the personal data of some 57 million customers, and while there were many security failures at play, the root cause stemmed from hackers that found an AWS access key in a GitHub repository of an Uber developer.
And it’s against that backdrop that we’ve seen a slew of startups and Big Tech tools go to market designed to help companies manage their secret sprawl. The latest is a San Francisco-based company called Infisical, which today announced it has raised $2.8 million in a seed round of funding led by Google’s Gradient Ventures to help companies of all sizes centralize their secret management.
Top secret
Infisical is pitching itself as a holistic secret-management platform combining all the components a company needs — a bit like what Rippling has been doing in the workforce management space, except for secrets, according to Infisical co-founder Vlad Matsiiako.
“As companies are becoming more digital and integrated with other software, it’s harder to manage all of their application and developer secrets — they have to buy multiple tools and give all of them access to their secrets, which is a security concern on its own,” Matsiiako explained to TechCrunch. “You can think of Infisical as an all-in-one secret management stack that combines all related product verticals for a company.”
This includes a dashboard for managing secrets across different projects and environments; client SDKs; a command line interface (CLI); native integrations with the likes of GitHub, Netlify and Vercel; secret versioning and “point-in-time recovery”; audit logs; and secret scanning.

As for a business model, Infisical attracts revenue through its hosted cloud incarnation, which it sells as a SaaS, and through its self-hosted counterpart by selling enterprise-grade features.
The (sort of) open source factor
While Infisical is pushing itself as an “open source” SecretOps platform, a quick peek at its licensing on GitHub reveals that it’s perhaps more aligned with the open-core or source available realm, than it is the pure open source sphere. That is to say, while much of the platform’s core functionality is apparently available to use under the permissive MIT license, including secret-scanning and infrastructure integrations, it has retained a lot of the features — such as audit logs, single-sign on, recovery and access controls — under a proprietary license under a separate enterprise edition (EE).
“Our entire codebase is available for everyone to view on GitHub, and we keep all core secret management functionalities available under the MIT license,” Matsiiako said. “We strongly believe that solo developers and hobbyists should be able to experiment with most features for free using either Infisical Cloud or Infisical self-hosted.”
The thinking here is that when users start considering Infisical in terms of deploying for critical commercial use cases, they need more features such as advanced security and compliance. So even if a company has chosen to self-host Infisical, they still have to purchase an enterprise license to leverage core proprietary features.
“The goal is really to charge only larger enterprises,” Matsiiako added.
There are a bunch of similar tools on the market already, including the open source Vault project from billion-dollar cloud infrastructure giant HashiCorp, which has pretty much set the standard for the secret-management sector. However, Matsiiako argues that Infisical is aimed more at general developers rather than platform-engineering teams, making it easier to deploy with a flatter learning curve.
“Vault is difficult to adopt for developers without a background in security or infrastructure, and we find it to be more popular amongst security and platform-engineering teams,” he said. “Because of that, companies experience slower development cycles and some even resort to developing fully custom developer-facing solutions on top of — or instead of — Vault.
Other notable alternatives include Doppler and Akeyless, which are substantively proprietary SaaS products, and even tangential products such as secret-scanning tools from the likes of GitGuardian, a feature that Infisical is already supporting as part of its platform.
“By integrating secret scanning inside of Infisical’s bundle offering, we extract synergies between secret management and secret scanning, and a company looking for related secret management solutions now only needs to go through one vendor instead of multiple,” Matsiiako said.
The story so far
The company’s trio of founders — Matsiiako, Maidul Islam and Tuan Dang — met at Cornell University, where they studied a mix of computer and data science subjects, going on to work at various companies such as AWS, Figma and Bung. They then met up to kickstart their new venture together out of San Francisco last August.
“Throughout our past collective experiences and talking to industry peers, we recognized that managing application secrets was cumbersome and that problems in the secret management industry were far from being solved,” Matsiiako said. “It became clear to us that we needed to build an open source solution that’s simple to use for secret management; being open source gives developers the flexibility of using Infisical Cloud or self-hosting it on their own infrastructure which is what larger companies frequently do.”
Infisical went on to raise $500,000 from its participation in Y Combinator’s (YC) winter ’23 program, and it recently made its first engineering hire, who joined them from enterprise software giant Red hat.
Aside from lead backer Gradient Ventures, the company’s seed round included investments from YC, 22 Ventures and angel backers such as Elad Gil and YC’s Diana Hu.

Kenya’s MyDawa aims to be an all-in-one health platform backed by $20 million funding,Annie Njanja,2023/07/03,"
Kenyan e-health startup MyDawa has raised $20 million from private equity investor Alta Semper Capital to expand its regional reach and product offerings with the aim of becoming an all-in-one health platform for users.
MyDawa, which launched in 2016, has diversified from an e-pharmacy to include online and in-person consultations, as well as laboratory services at its expanding network of walk-in pharmacies and health centers.
It has also launched its own branded products, and plans to open up its technology infrastructure from telehealth to fulfillment, helping other businesses in the health sector to scale. It claims to have already inked deals with some of Kenya’s biggest clinic chains, which are looking to expand their reach.
Additionally, MyDawa has acquired Uganda’s Guardian Health, one of the many acquisitions and collaborations it aims to make as it expands beyond Kenya. The growth plans will be steered by new CEO Priscilla Muhiu, formerly of Glovo Kenya.

African health tech startups in the supply chain segment show rapid growth, spurring a $7M investment initiative

Commenting on the funding and newest acquisition, MyDawa co-founder Neil O’Leary said: “Alta Semper’s ambition exactly matches that of MyDawa, and it brings the drive, connections and clout to succeed. Three years ago, AAIC, a Japanese-backed African healthcare fund, joined as our first external investor and now the team has been augmented in the strongest manner possible.”
“MyDawa now has both a solid secure base and a great expansion opportunity based on a great offering which improves health outcomes. Guardian is a great first step on fulfilling our ambition,” O’Leary added.
MyDawa raised $3 million from AAIC’s Africa Healthcare Fund in 2019, and has also received $1.2 million grant funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation to fight the spread of HIV/AIDS by increasing access to PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis) medication.
Alta Semper CEO Afsane Jetha, said the investment marked the PE firm’s first entry into digital healthcare in Africa, regarded as one of the sectors with the potential for great growth in the coming years.
“MyDawa was the logical choice for us as their groundbreaking technology, underpinning a scalable business model, along with regulatory knowhow and market entry experience, mapped so well to our own strategy. The drive to increase the access to good advice and safe and affordable medication is core to our overall mission of democratizing access to health and well-being across the African continent,” said Jetha.
“With consumer spending in Africa projected to reach $2.1 trillion by 2025, this represents one of the continent’s largest business opportunities. Therefore, the investment into MyDawa is part of our strategic aim at meeting this growing demand by investing in locally produced and value-priced consumer goods and services.”

The remote work startups that will last aren’t actually remote work startups,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/07/03,"
Back in 2020 when the pandemic forced people to work from home, entrepreneurs saw an opportunity to build tools to fuel this new transition to remote work. From virtual offices to making it easy to run payroll for a distributed team, founders leaned in hard.
But now, three years later, some companies have remained remote, others have gone back to the office, and most are operating somewhere in the middle. It’s become increasingly unclear if there really is a large market for companies focused on catering exclusively to remote work. It seems that the remote work category has lost steam — but has it?
It’s hard to pin the exact numbers on it — because the category can include companies across various sectors — but there are signs that things aren’t going well for many remote work startups.

"Hello Alice, Global Entrepreneurship Network unveil $70M Equitable Access Fund",Christine Hall,2023/06/28,"
Hello Alice, a fintech helping small businesses access capital, and entrepreneurship ecosystem Global Entrepreneurship Network (GEN) created a $70 million Equitable Access Fund designed to bridge the financing gap experienced by women and BIPOC-owned founders.
“There’s an estimated $40 billion gap among the BIPOC community alone,” Elizabeth Gore, Hello Alice co-founder, told TechCrunch. “Also, the biggest gap we saw to growing businesses was lack of credit history.”
She also noted that many small business owners don’t have the generational wealth or collateral to put up for loans. Some turn to credit; however, just 25% of small business owners have applied for a business credit card, and 85% of those applications were denied due to poor credit or lack of credit.
The Equitable Access Fund will provide those credit enhancements, including guarantees, loan loss reserves and cash collateral deposits to financing partners. It will be deployed over the next five years with aims to improve equitable access to credit and unlock up to $1 billion in credit for small business owners in what Gore called the “new majority,” which includes women, veterans, BIPOC, Latinx, those with disabilities, LGBTQIA+ and other groups.
Initial capital commitments were led by Wells Fargo. Other partners in the program include First National Bank of Omaha, Mastercard and the Kauffman Foundation.
The fund is part of the Equitable Access Program, run by Hello Alice and GEN, which provides increased credit access via a Mastercard secured card and financial education. As part of the program, Hello Alice also launched a business health score tool in April that provides an overview of a business’s financial health and recommendations on how owners can improve their performance.
Meanwhile, Hello Alice serves 1.3 million small business owners, and its loan center has distributed just over $30 million in grants and continues to grow with 92 lenders, Gore said.
“With the economic uncertainty, upheaval in banking and a lot of the fear that things are tightening and interest rates are changing, we’re going to see that it’s even harder for folks to get loans, particularly in the first 24 months of their business,” Gore added. “We really rushed to get out the business health score, which was supposed to come out later, because it is absolutely critical that all business owners are managing their cash flow appropriately right now.”

Here’s why so many fintech startups are loaning to small businesses

"No SSN, no problem, says Maza, a fintech startup aimed at undocumented immigrants",Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/06/28,"
Want more fintech news in your inbox? Sign up here.
While there are a multitude of fintech companies offering digital banking services to a variety of demographics, there has been one segment of the population that historically has been underserved even more than others: the undocumented immigrant.
Because undocumented immigrants don’t have Social Security numbers, it can be difficult to impossible to access traditional banking services. A startup called Maza has set out to help solve that problem.
While several fintech startups set out to serve immigrants generally (Welcome Technologies, Majority, TomoCredit are examples), Maza says its main differentiator is that it provides immigrants with an individual tax identification number (ITIN), plugging in directly with IRS-certified acceptance agents “to make the Tax ID number process automated for customers.” The end goal, notes co-founder and COO Robbie Figueroa, is to unlock access to the rest of the U.S. financial system and avoid non-traditional (and sometimes predatory) approaches to finance, such as loan sharks and pawn brokers.
Maza customers are “immediately” equipped with a U.S. bank account and debit card. The company claims that because its members also have a tax ID number, they can start building a credit history and applying for loans. Having a bank account also allows them to receive payments from employers and file taxes. With Maza, customers without SSNs can access credit and thus, develop a credit history so they can do things like get auto or home loans. The startup also says it offers a robust peer to peer payments functionality.
On the back end, Maza says it “handles” their taxes to ensure they remain compliant, even going as far as automatically renewing their financial identity documentation for them.
Since its 2022 inception, the Los Angeles-based, 15-person startup has grown to having 50,000 users (each paying $150 a year for access) on its platform, enabling $41 million in digital payments to date.
Maza’s unique model caught the attention of Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), which recently led the company’s $8 million seed funding round. Other backers include SV Angel, Box Group, Restive Ventures, Global Founders Capital, Abstract Ventures and a group of angel investors including Anré Williams, CEO of American Express National Bank, and Plaid co-founder William Hockey.
While its total addressable market is the more than 15 million immigrants living in the U.S., Maza says its focus is on the Latino, or Spanish-speaking, population.
“Customers go from undocumented to partially documented,” Maza co-founder and CEO Luciano Arango told TechCrunch in an interview.
Arango and Figueroa teamed up with Siggy Bilstein (CTO) to start Maza after seeing their own parents struggle as immigrants in the U.S. (The trio is a combination of Colombian, Peruvian, Brazilian and Ecuadorian descent.)
Image Credits: Maza
Like many fintechs offering digital banking services, Maza is not itself a bank. It is able to offer its services without requiring an SSN by partnering with Visa and Blue Ridge Bank. The company’s banking product features “broad payment functionality,” it touts, as well as integrations with all major payment platforms, including PayPal, Zelle, Venmo and CashApp. Further, money deposited in Maza, the company claims, earns “one of the highest checking account interest rates,” an effort to help its members “grow their wealth over time.”
Interestingly, while Maza might be a digital bank, its marketing efforts are mostly focused offline. The company has found success targeting high-density, smaller Latino neighborhoods in markets such as South Florida, Washington Heights, New York and east Los Angeles with campaigns including posting bulletins in churches. It also does Google advertising but Arango says most of its growth thus far has been organic.
In the long run, Maza’s goal is to expand into credit building and to outside of the U.S. because as Arango said, “the whole world doesn’t have a Social Security number.”
Image Credits: Maza
“We want to be able to get folks cleared into the U.S. financial system no matter where they are,” added Arango, who also previously co-founded — and then sold — ScopeAI, which got acquired by ObserveAI in 2021.
“We’re doing much more than just providing a bank account — we’re really giving immigrants a stable and legal financial foundation from which to build credit and wealth indefinitely,” Figueroa said. 
Andreessen Horowitz Partner Seema Amble said Maza’s thesis is something that a16z has “been excited about for a long time.” 
Writing via email, she said: “There is a massive gap between mainstream financial access and the Latino population in the US (which is 19% of the U.S.). And the product needs don’t mean just translating existing products into Spanish – it’s offering them a set of products that fits their life and work.” 
Banking products are not accessible to most Latinos, Amble added, but not primarily because of a language barrier. 
She wrote: “They’re blocked from even accessing these products in the first place. Maza has identified the true pain point, lack of SSN, and they have built a product that unblocks everything from payments, to credit and mortgages without leaving the app….Compared to some of the other startups, Maza has focused on this core pain point and wants to continue to offer community-tailored products, rather than just offer another card product marketed towards Latinos.”

Workflow automation startup Parabola raises $24M,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/28,"
Parabola, a San Francisco-based startup that uses AI to help expedite back-office processes, particularly in the logistics and e-commerce sectors, today announced that it raised $24 million in a Series B funding round led by OpenView, with participation from strategic investor Flexport alongside Matrix, Thrive, Good Friends, Webflow, Otherwise Fund, Abstract Ventures and Merus Capital.
Alex Yaseen, Parabola’s founder and CEO, says the new capital will be put toward hiring and product R&D. To date, the company’s raised $34.2 million — inclusive of the latest tranche.
“Most software companies struggled in the pandemic shift, but we’ve found success,” Yaseen said. “2023 is the year of the operator, and Parabola is the go-to platform to empower them.”
So what does Parabola do, exactly? Boiled down to basics, the platform applies AI to automate various workflows. Using Parabola, customers can take documents like PDFs, text message logs, images and emails and have Parabola standardize, enrich or categorize them.
For example, given a list of product names, Parabola can categorize them according to specific departments, such as “clothing,” “home goods,” “grocery” and “electronics.” It also can standardize inconsistently formatted invoices and extract the amount, due date, sender information and line items from each into a table. And it can analyze Amazon keyword rankings within a specific time frame, enabling e-commerce teams to optimize their product listings.
Yaseen describes Parabola as a “collaborative data tool” for nontechnical users who’d otherwise be stuck with arduous manual processes and spreadsheets.
“Our core differentiator is our ability to be owned directly by an operations team to build solutions to their own problems without getting bottlenecked on data and IT.” Yaseen said. “This enables them to automate workflows that otherwise are too fast-changing for engineers to write code on their behalf.”
Business process automation is a growing trend, with 66% of organizations responding to a recent McKinsey survey saying that they’ve experimented with process automation in one or more business functions. The motivation is cost savings, often. A UiPath survey estimates that businesses can save an average of $1.5 million per year by automating at least a portion of their processes.

Lots of vendors have emerged to meet the large addressable market, unsurprisingly, including so-called integration-platform-as-a-service providers like Zapier, Workato, Tray and MuleSoft, as well as internal-tool-building platforms like Retool and Airplane.dev. Retool has done particularly well for itself lately, raising $45 million at a $3.2 billion valuation last July.
Yaseen makes the case that Parabola’s rivals, though — even the well-funded ones — focus less on building logic and more on transferring data between different systems, plus require extensive technical resources to boot.
“Many users choose to stick with their outdated and mundane processes because it’s what they’re familiar with, and they believe that their complex datasets cannot be automated,” he added. “[But] enterprise leaders can no longer exhaust valuable engineering resources on projects that can be achieved otherwise … We’ve built a suite of collaboration features that turn the ‘individual use-case’ into a ‘company use-case,’ allowing operations teams to  align on best practices and ultimately build off one another’s work.”
Parabola claims to have clients in a “wide range of industries,” including e-commerce, retail, consumer packaged goods and shipping and logistics. The 30-employee startup’s current customer base stands at just over 500 brands, and Yaseen says the plan is to expand Parabola’s headcount to 60 people by the end of the year.

Memphis.dev looks to simplify event streaming with open source and SaaS products,Ron Miller,2023/06/28,"
Startups have been looking for ways to disrupt event streaming, popularized in the last decade by Kafka, the open source event streaming platform. Just this week we looked at Redpanda getting a $100 million Series C for its event streaming platform, and today Memphis.dev, an earlier-stage startup, announced a $5.5 million seed investment to support its open source project and SaaS offering called Memphis Cloud, which they are making generally available starting today.
Memphis co-founder and CEO Yaniv Ben Hemo says that the company was founded on the idea that streaming was too complicated, and they wanted to simplify it. He said they came from organizations dealing with massive amounts of data, where they struggled to get insights from it.
“The component that was usually the most challenging one was getting Kafka to absorb the massive amount of data that we ingested, and also what we call the Day 2 operations, which are all about how to take the raw data that we ingested and make it into something that the organization can do something with to create insights from it,” Ben Hemo told TechCrunch.
The company wanted to build a solution that helped solved these kinds of problems for developers building real-time streaming applications, and they built and open sourced this new message broker they called Memphis. He said they wanted to attack two key problems that they saw with streaming large amounts of data and building applications making use of that data.
“So the first part would be the management over the scalability, the maintenance that it requires, the amount of time that it takes and complexity to really implement such a technology or a solution within the organization.” The second part involved how to build applications that really take advantage of the data the engine was processing.
The founders started by building the open source project, and eventually building Memphis Cloud, which is geared toward enterprises with typical features like authentication and permissions, but they are also making it a serverless experience, making it easier to implement without worrying about the underlying resources required to run any particular application, while paying only for what you use. The company has also designed it to work on multiple platforms, including AWS and Google Cloud Platform for starters.
“We try to create as much alignment as we can between the commercial version and Memphis. But the commercial version is definitely more for enterprises, organizations that require serverless experience, and don’t want anything to do with infrastructure and scale and monitoring and stuff like that. So it really made sense for the community, as well as some other features that we simply were not able to deploy through the open source version, technically,” Ben Hemo said.
The company currently has 14 employees with two open recs, and as currently constituted has a pretty diverse group. He says he hopes to continue that along multiple dimensions of diversity, including geographical, as he builds the organization.
Today’s seed investment was led by Angular Ventures and Boldstart Ventures along with several prominent industry angels.

Unaric exits stealth with $35M to buy and consolidate Salesforce-ecosystem startups,Paul Sawers,2023/06/28,"
A new company is emerging out of stealth today with $35 million in funding and a plan to acquire and consolidate startups within the Salesforce ecosystem.
Unaric, as the company is called, has secured $25 million in debt and $10 million in equity from various VCs, angels and growth lenders, as it looks to bring together independent Salesforce-focused SaaS companies help them capture a larger chunk of the gargantuan market that has cropped up around Salesforce these past couple of decades.
Some companies have built megabucks businesses on top of Salesforce, including Salesforce-native DevOps platform Copado; Salesforce data backup platform OwnBackup; and lead-generation platform Qualified. Thousands of smaller companies have cropped up off the back of Salesforce’s rise to the giddy heights of a $200 billion enterprise behemoth, creating an ecosystem that some estimates peg at four times that of Salesforce itself.
However, relatively few companies within that Salesforce ecosystem become massive in their own right, due in part to their narrowly-focused “point solutions” that mean end-users have to combine multiple different tools from various smaller vendors — something that larger enterprises are often reluctant to do. And this is where Unaric enters the fray.
“For enterprise customers it can be painful to purchase and manage small niche solutions,” Unaric co-founder and CEO James Gasteen explained to TechCrunch. “Unaric addresses this by building larger suites, which solve large problems for customers through a single vendor who can provide greater innovation, better service and global support.”
‘By founders, for founders’
Founded out of London in July last year, Unaric is aiming to buy up to 40 companies over the next three years, the first of which it’s announcing today with the acquisition of Salesbolt, a product that automatically keeps CRM contacts up-to-date. Over time, Unaric says that it intends to increase the opportunity for cross-selling and knowledge-sharing across all Salesforce products under its wing, as well as introduce a “shared central infrastructure” including a product and engineering hub.
The Salesbolt deal pegs Unaric’s initial focus firmly in the RevOps realm, an area Gasteen says it will double-down on.
“By acquiring multiple companies in this area we will be able to drive cross-sales,” he said. “This is an area where we already have a pipeline of deals lined up. The next stage is to use our knowledge of industries and existing customers’ needs to build out suites of companies focused on particular industry sectors.”
Unari is the handiwork of Gasteen and chief product officer Neil Crawford, each having previously founded Salesforce-ecosystem companies, and chair Peter Lindholm and CFO Moritz Birke. Gasteen, in fact, already has experience of merging two Salesforce-focused companies, when his previous startup Precursive acquired a “complementary” product called Taskfeed back in 2019.
“There is a mismatch in the Salesforce ISV (independent software vendor) ecosystem which we have experienced personally, and we know how to put it right,” Gasteen said. “We believe that by building suites of products that match more closely the needs of enterprises, we can help companies to significantly increase their sales, scale their businesses and sell to corporate buyers who would not normally buy from individual vendors.”
Such a hefty acquisition spree will, of course, require a lot of capital, which is where Unaric’s external funding comes into play. The $25 million debt segment emanates from Atempo Growth, with the remaining seed equity tranche coming from LocalGlobe, Concentric, FJ Labs and angels such as OwnBackup founder Sam Gutmann, Hotjar founder Johan Malmberg and enterprise software startup investor Dave Kellogg.
Longer term, Gasteen says Unaric is looking to emulate the growth trajectory of a number of established enterprise software companies, such as Veeva Systems, a $32 billion life sciences software company; and Ncino, a $3 billion fintech. Both companies were initially built on top of Salesforce and embraced the cloud from the get-go, but more importantly they have focused their efforts on broad techstacks spanning a single sector.
“They have created a lot of value in the ecosystem through being focused on a single industry techstack,” Gasteen said. “They have built the companies mainly through product development and some M&A. Our idea is to emulate the success of these companies by building many Ncino’s and Veeva’s within Unaric.”

“The pandemic enforced cloud and software-as-a-service (SaaS) adoption, thus increasing third-party adoption and automation — requiring a solution to fit this digital and fast-paced interconnected world,” Jackson told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Astrix was founded to close a significant and unaddressed security gap by allowing security teams to extend access management and threat detection to the non-human identity layer.”
Jackson co-launched Astrix in 2021 alongside Idan Gour, who he met while serving in the Israel Defense Forces. Both say that they saw a need to create a platform that could help companies bring app integrations, which continue to gain in popularity, under firmer control from a security standpoint.
To their points, according to one recent report, company departments use between 40 and 60 different apps, with departments using an average of 200 apps organization-wide. This can amplify the security risk. Another poll, published in 2022 by the Ponemon Institute and Mastercard’s RiskRecon, found that 54% of organizations were breached through third parties over the preceding 12 months.
“Apps are often connected by employees across departments without the security team’s knowledge, making having visibility and governance into every third-party connection virtually impossible,” Jackson said.
Astrix connects to a company’s core systems — including SaaS, integration platform-as-a-service and infrastructure-as-a-service — to attempt to protect against over-privileged and malicious third-party app connections that might expose an organization. Using machine learning-based behavioral analysis engines, Astrix tries to spot deviations from standard app-to-app connectivity behaviors and suggest remediation steps that security teams can take to address the root of the problem.

Beyond detecting threats, Astrix provides a view of all the internal and third-party integrations within a business environment, as well as all access keys in use (e.g. API keys and service accounts) and the permissions and level of access granted to each one.
James Green, a general partner at CRV, said that it was these holistic observability features that caught CRV’s eye.
“Astrix is taking an innovative approach to extending identity and access management and threat detection to all non-human identities, giving unprecedented capabilities to manage the growing API-based third-party attack surface across all environments,” he said in an emailed statement.
Astrix isn’t without rivals in the app connection security space, including Apiiro, which works to help developers and security operators find and solve app-related issues that could result in vulnerabilities. There’s also Valence Security, Wing Security and Kodem, the last of which recently came out of stealth with $25 million in venture backing to tackle app security.
But Jackson, while declining to reveal the size of Astrix’s customer base, noted that Astrix recently brought on high-profile customers, including Figma, Priceline, Bloomreach and Rapyd.
“Cybersecurity is one of the few fields that is traditionally less impacted during down times,” Jackson said. “Moreover, layoffs and down markets create more cybercrime worldwide, and we’ve especially been experiencing this in the past year.”
That first point isn’t necessarily true — Q1 marked lowest VC funding for security in a decade, according to one report. But it seems that Astrix is successfully bucking the trend.

Fairphone CEO Eva Gouwens to step down,Paul Sawers,2023/06/28,"
Fairphone CEO Eva Gouwens has announced that she’s stepping down, some five years after landing in the hotseat.
Founded out of the Netherlands back in 2010, Fairphone has set out to differentiate from other smartphone makers by focusing on sustainability and lowering its environmental footprint — this includes making its devices modular and thus easier to replace parts and minimizing its use of conflict minerals. The company has also expanded into tangential products, including headphones and accessories, and has raised around $94 million in funding, including a $53 million tranche just six months ago.
Stepping down
Gouwens joined Fairphone first as managing director in 2017, before replacing the company’s founder Bas van Abel the following year as CEO.
Quoting former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, Gouwens indicated that her reason for stepping down was simply to her running out of steam: “I know what this job takes, and I know I no longer have enough in the tank to do it justice. It’s as simple as that.”
At the time of writing, it appears that Fairphone has not yet found a successor, with today’s announcement signaling the start of a search process to find the company’s next CEO.
“Now I know it is the right time for me to find someone like-minded yet fresh to take my place,” Gouwens said. “Someone who understands Fairphone’s mission and vision. Someone who can help Fairphone scale even greater heights.”

Dear Sophie, 
Our startup employs about 30 people globally through a combination of direct and co-employment based on their country. 
Over the last year and a half or so, we helped several team members relocate from Ukraine and Russia to various non-Schengen countries such as Georgia, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and Uzbekistan. 
We realize it’s more expensive if we bring these employees to the U.S., but our startup will be more successful. How do we bring them here?
— Meaningful Moneymaking
Dear Meaningful Moneymaking,
Many companies have helped make a meaningful difference in people’s lives, supporting talented team members and their families from countries such as Ukraine and Russia to relocate to safety. Thank you for now considering how to help certain individuals relocate to the U.S. May all humans enjoy peace, prosperity, and freedom.
Many employers are continuing to work with the Ukrainian and Russian professionals who have left their homes since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.
Of the 8 million people who have left Ukraine, more than 270,000 have been admitted to the United States, most of them under the Uniting for Ukraine program, which provides a temporary stay in the United States and a work permit.
Between 500,000 and as many as 1 million people have left Russia and thousands of Russians have sought entry to the U.S. between February 2022 and April 2023. According to Russian government figures, about 100,000 IT specialists (about 10% of the tech workforce) left Russia, which is likely underestimated.
Before I dive into options for bringing Ukrainian and Russian employees to the United States, I recommend you work with an immigration attorney to devise a strategy for each employee you’re seeking to sponsor based on their education, skills, qualifications, location, and situation. Your company has several options for bringing your Ukrainian and Russian employees to live and work in the United States.
Uniting for Ukraine
The Uniting for Ukraine program, which began last year, provides a way for Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members to come to the United States to stay for two years under temporary parole status. Individuals participating in the program must have a U.S.-based supporter or multiple supporters — an individual, organization, or business — who agrees to financially support their stay.
The supporter must fill out Form I-134A (Online Request to be a Supporter and Declaration of Financial Support) and submit it to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The program includes the option for a Employment Authorization Document (EAD) — otherwise known as a work permit.
Right now, parole under the Uniting for Ukraine program cannot be extended beyond two years, but that may change. Your company could consider sponsoring employees on parole for work visas or green cards. I explain in more detail below. "
Bluu Seafood reels in $17.5M to bring cultivated fish products to market,Paul Sawers,2023/06/28,"
Bluu Seafood, a German company creating cultivated (i.e. “lab-grown”) fish products, today announced it has raised €16 million ($17.5 million) in a Series A round of funding.
Founded out of Berlin in 2020 originally as Bluu Biosciences, Bluu Seafood starts with a “one-time” fish biopsy — which, it says, doesn’t require killing any fish — and then uses stem-cell technology to grow entire cell lines (i.e. fish species) inside a lab.
The company unveiled its first products last August, including a line of fish sticks (or “fish fingers”) and fish balls. These are made from cultivated fish cells that are enriched with plant proteins, a process it says helps make their mouth-feel and cooking process more realistic.

Production problems
Bluu Seafood is one of numerous biotech startups that are setting out to address the world’s seafood production problems, which includes overfishing, contamination and cruelty. But the movement is not limited to marine animals, with countless companies raising bucketloads of VC cash to reproduce everything from bacon to burgers and chicken and beyond.
Bluu Seafood, for its part, had raised €7.1 million in funding so far, and with another €16 million in the bank it’s now gearing up to attain regulatory approval in various markets, including Singapore, which is currently the only market in the world where cultured meat (chicken) is available to buy. However, the Food and Drug Association (FDA) also started rubberstamping such edibles as being safe for human consumption, and just this week it approved two companies to begin selling their lab-grown chicken products — so we can expect some commercial activity in the U.S. in the very near future.
First up, Bluu Seafood is aiming to enter Singapore, where it says it expects to receive approval sometime in 2024, while it says it has also kickstarted the approval process with the FDA, and will then set about targeting the European market.
Bluu Seafood’s Series A round was led by Sonae-subsidiary Sparkfood and LBBW VC, with participation from Delivery Hero, SeaX Ventures, Manta Ray Ventures, Norrsken VC, Hamburgische Investitions- und Förderbank and Dr. Oetker.

Flowie wants to make invoices flow freely,Romain Dillet,2023/06/27,"
Meet Flowie, a new French startup that wants to facilitate money movements between companies. The company centralizes everything related to accounts receivable and accounts payable so that everyone in the company can see relevant information when it comes to getting paid by clients and receiving money from suppliers.
Flowie was started by Yann Ravel-Sibillot, Rémi Legorrec and Aurélie Hadida. In particular, the company’s CEO — Yann Ravel-Sibillot — already has plenty of experiences when it comes to managing invoices at scale. He was the CTO of Big Mamma and worked on Sunday, a fast restaurant checkout flow.
With this new startup, the Flowie team wants to improve how companies handle invoices. Flowie acts as a central repository for all your transactional data.
It connects with all your existing tools, such as the ERP system that holds your contracts, order numbers, receipt slips, etc. Flowie also integrates with your CRM so that you can get some context about the relationship with a client or a supplier. Finally, it also connects with your bank account so that it can see if you received a payment and initiate new payments.
For instance, when you receive an invoice from a supplier, usually the person in charge of accounting doesn’t really know if they’re supposed to pay this supplier. Maybe your company never received what you paid for.
Instead of having an internal conversation and creating friction, anybody can validate transactions on Flowie. The platform automatically tries to fetch information from the invoice, and people in the company can add files to provide context.
When a transaction is approved, you can either choose to pay it now or pay it at some point in the future. If you schedule a future payment, you can notify your supplier that the payment has been scheduled and there’s no need to get back to you about that pending invoice.
On the other side of the equation, when it comes to accounts receivables, companies can upload an invoice on Flowie. It is converted into an e-invoice with a QR code. Clients can click on a link and see different payment methods. They can pay with a bank transfer, a card payment or a direct debit. Flowie also lets you offer early payment discounts.
It’s still early days for the startup. The company has raised a bit of money from business angels and there are 11 people working on the product. But the company has already tracked hundreds of millions of euros in invoices on its platform.

Reka emerges from stealth to build custom AI models for the enterprise,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/27,"
Large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT-4 are all the rage these days, owing to their unparalleled ability to analyze and generate text. But for organizations looking to leverage LLMs for specific tasks — say, writing ad copy in a brand’s style — their generalist nature can become a liability.
When the instructions get too precise, even the best LLMs struggle with consistency. Fine-tuning, or narrowing an LLM’s scope, is one solution. But it’s often challenging from a technical standpoint, not to mention costly.
Motivated to find an easier way, a team of researchers from DeepMind, Google, Baidu and Meta founded Reka, which emerged from stealth today with $58 million. DST Global Partners and Radical Ventures led the tranche with participation from strategic partner Snowflake Ventures, alongside a cohort of angel investors that included former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman.
San Francisco–based Reka is the brainchild of Dani Yogatama, Cyprien de Masson d’Autume, Qi Liu Head and Yi Tay. While working on AI systems, including DeepMind’s AlphaCode and Bard, the four co-founders say that they realized it was impractical to expect a large LLM to be deployed for all possible use cases.
“We understand the transformative power of AI and would like to bring the benefits of this technology to the world in a responsible way,” Yogatama told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Reka is a research and product company that develops models to benefit humanity, organizations and enterprises.”
Reka’s first commercial product, Yasa, doesn’t quite meet those lofty ambitions. But it exemplifies the startup’s early approach. Going beyond text, Yasa is a multimodal AI “assistant” trained to understand images, videos and tabular data in addition to words and phrases. It can be used to generate ideas and answer basic questions, Yogatama says, as well as derive insights from a company’s internal data.
In this way, Yasa, which is in closed beta, isn’t dissimilar to models like GPT-4, which can also understand text and images. But the twist is that Yasa can be easily personalized to proprietary data and applications.
“Our technology allows enterprises to benefit from progress in LLMs in a way that satisfies their deployment constraints without requiring a team of in-house expert AI engineers,” Yogatama said.
Yasa is just the start. Next, Reka plans to turn its attention to AI that can accept and generate even more types of data and continuously self-improve, staying up to date without the need for retraining.
To that end, only available to select customers for now, Reka also provides a service to adapt LLMs it developed to custom or proprietary company datasets. Customers can run the “distilled” models on their own infrastructure or via Reka’s API, depending on the application and project constraints.
Reka, it should be noted, isn’t the only startup chasing after models better suited for enterprise use cases. Writer lets customers fine-tune LLMs on their own content and style guides. Contextual AI and LlamaIndex, which recently emerged from stealth, are developing tools to allow companies to add their own data to existing LLMs. And Cohere trains LLMs to customers’ specifications.
Not to be outdone, incumbents like OpenAI now offer tools for fine-tuning models and connecting them to the internet and other sources to ensure that they remain up to date.
But Reka’s sales pitch won over one early customer (and investor), Snowflake, which partnered with the startup to let Snowflake customers deploy Yasa from their accounts. Appen, the big data analytics company, also recently announced that it’s working with Reka to build tailored multimodal model–powered apps for the enterprise.
Rob Toews, a partner at Radical Ventures, had this to say when we asked why he invested in Reka:
What makes Reka unique is how it offers every business the power and potential of an LLM without having to put up with many tradeoffs. Reka’s distilled Yasa models keep the data within the enterprise, they’re incredibly efficient in terms of cost and energy and they don’t require costly research teams building models from scratch. If every business will become an “AI” business, Reka’s ambition is to give each of those businesses its own, production-quality foundation model.
Yogatama says Reka, which currently isn’t generating revenue, will use its funding to date to acquire computing power from Nvidia and build a business team.

"TechCrunch+ roundup: Building growth funnels, HR tech bonanza, secondary market signals",Walter Thompson,2023/06/27,"
Building a durable growth funnel doesn’t just scale your business: it also signals to investors that a team can move directionally, which is a major confidence builder.
“Acquisition, activation and retention are critical,” writes Jonathan Martinez, TC+’s in-house growth expert. “While referral and monetization are also quite important, they won’t make or break a startup.”
He says early-stage teams should push well beyond “vanity metrics” like click-throughs and conversions to develop advanced metrics that are specific to the business they’re building.

For this article, he broke down onboarding and activation processes at several startups, including Postmates, Zoom, Uber and Canva, to show how they shaped messaging that push users deeper into their funnels.
It’s complex work, but don’t be intimidated — a growth analyst or data scientist contractor can easily set up the dashboards you’ll need to run experiments, set goals and track day-to-day progress.
“This isn’t meant to be a teardown of each specific startup, but rather a holistic look into what leading companies are doing, their mindsets when it comes to growth and how to replicate these actions in your own startup,” says Martinez.

Coinbase execs: As global crypto policy grows, US has urgent need for legislation

Crypto maximalists are comfortable making big bets, but ambiguous oversight by U.S. financial agencies is holding back corporate adoption, according to a study conducted by The Block and Coinbase.
“Around 91% of surveyed executives agree that lack of clear regulation on crypto, blockchain or web3 make the space hard to navigate,” reports Jacquelyn Melinek, who interviewed Kara Calvert, head of U.S. policy at Coinbase, and Faryar Shirzad, its chief policy officer.
“It doesn’t matter where lines are drawn, we’ll build to those lines,” said Shirzad. “But we can’t deal with a lack of clarity; the uncertainty is not healthy.”

Most early-stage startups don’t have a dedicated full-time CMO, and that’s OK.
However, it’s still someone’s responsibility to capture user data, which is why growth expert Jonathan Martinez shared a guide with TC+ for developing ideal customer profiles (ICPs).
“By identifying your ideal customer personas first, you will find product-market fit faster and identify the right customers to sell to,” he writes.

“We need to watch this and see that this 17% is sustainable,” said Forge Global CEO Kelly Rodriques.
“If it is, there are a group of market participants that are watching the space and wondering when to jump back in.”

"As Lordstown immolates, SPAC deals that didn’t go to zero feel like the exception",Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/27,"
In 2020 and 2021, we had several months when enthusiasm for new EV manufacturers was crossed with the resurgence of blank-check companies. Also called special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, these listed shell companies promised quick access to capital and a path to the public markets, and a wide array of tech and tech-ish companies took them up on the offer.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

In 2020 and 2021, several electric vehicle companies took the SPAC route to raise quick cash and go public, especially because investors were pretty OK with investing in such experimental transactions. Full of enthusiasm, these companies’ investor presentations showed a clear path to production and stellar profits.
It’s obvious in retrospect, but the results often proved to be messy.
U.S.-based EV company Lordstown Motors is one such example. Today, the company filed for bankruptcy protection and sued its former partner Foxconn at the same time. As TechCrunch reported earlier this morning:
Lordstown Motors has made good on its threat to sue Foxconn, the Taiwanese company best known for manufacturing Apple’s iPhones. The EV company took legal action against Foxconn Tuesday, and simultaneously filed for bankruptcy and put itself up for sale. […]
In its complaint, Lordstown says Foxconn misled the EV maker about collaborating on vehicle development plans and was “not the partner that it promised to be.” The complaint accuses Foxconn of pretending to support the Endurance pickup truck and future joint product development in order to secure ownership over Lordstown’s most valuable asset, the Ohio manufacturing plant, and to poach some of Lordstown’s skilled manufacturing and operational employees.
It would be easy to dismiss Lordstown’s failure as the result of a dispute between the two companies. But that would be wrong. In reality, the Lordstown saga is a blend of pure SPAC nasty. Let’s take into account a few pertinent facts to form our opinions.

Khosla Ventures just doubled down on this handyman-on-demand service for homeowners,Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/06/27,"
If you own a home, you know that there is always something that needs to be repaired, installed or generally addressed. Whether it’s a leaky faucet, a new bed that needs to be assembled or a Nest thermostat that needs to be installed, there is always something.
One startup wants to make that particular part of home ownership less painful by offering up a dedicated handyman to be there to take care of all the random tasks on your to-do list. It’s an interesting model. Honey Homes hires the handyman as part of its staff, as a salaried employee to help ensure consistency in who’s taking care of the work in your home. Homeowners pay Honey Homes a flat fee ($200 per month or $2,000 per year) for the convenience of a membership-based “end-to-end” service using its app.
The way it works is that members are matched with a dedicated handyperson who comes by at least once a month to take care of home improvements and preventative maintenance. Because the employees are salaried, they also receive benefits, including parental leave and paid time off, a rarity in an industry that has historically relied on contractors.
Honey Homes launched the company with its first 10 beta customers in August of 2021 and is currently available to single-family homeowners in all of the San Francisco Bay Area suburbs, although not San Francisco proper. It recently began operations in Dallas.
Husband and wife team Vishwas Prabhakara (Yelp’s first general manager) and Avantika Prabhakara (a former marketing head at Opendoor, Trulia and Zillow) teamed up with Katie Pham and Rory O’Connell to start Honey Homes in 2021.
In the last two years, Honey Homes has grown to more than 500 members and has completed over 20,000 tasks for homeowners, according to Vishwas. The company grew members — and thus revenue — by 8x in 2022, he added, and almost doubled already this year.
Since inception, the company has raised a total of $12.1 million in funding, including more recently $9 million in a Series A led by Khosla Ventures. Khosla and Pear VC co-led Honey Homes’ seed round in 2021. Other backers include Teambuilder Ventures and Moving Capital, along with angel investors such as DoorDash co-founders Tony Xu and Stanley Tang, Lyft co-founder Logan Green, Opendoor co-founder Eric Wu and Mercury co-founder Immad Akhund, among others. 
Vishwas told TechCrunch he began working on the company in earnest after talking to a number of homeowners and concluding that there would be enough people interested in paying for a generalist to come to their house once or twice a month for ongoing maintenance or improvement work. 
“I asked them, ‘would that be interesting to you? Would you pay for that?’ And surprisingly to me, the answer was a resounding yes,” he said. “We seemed to hit a nerve with homeowners.”
The Honey Homes app lets a homeowner create a to-do list and schedule appointments. It also helps pair homeowners with specialists if needed.
But what if, I was curious, you cross all the tasks off your to-do list? What then?
“The one thing that has been really eye-opening is that by offering this as a membership service, all of a sudden you realize you want more,” Vishwas said.”And there are some people who just like the peace of mind.”
Honey Homes employs 45 people, including 25 handy people. Vishwas said the consistency of workers has helped boost its credibility.
“From a homeowner perspective, what you want is somebody you can build a relationship with and trust,” he told TechCrunch. “And so seeing the same person over and over is highly valuable to a homeowner.”
The startup has also launched something called Honey Homes University, or a training facility for people who work in the field so they can build their skills. Looking ahead, Honey Homes eventually plans to expand into urban centers but for now is focused on serving suburban single family homeowners, which Vishwas says tend to have a wider set of upkeep and maintenance needs. 
Khosla Partner Evan Moore, who joined the Honey Homes board as part of the Series A funding round and also is a co-founder of DoorDash, said that while he was VP of product at Opendoor he saw that the company “could get dramatically better service, quality and pricing from home service providers.”
But as an individual homeowner, “it’s hard to reliably get good work done at a reasonable cost.”
Moore wrote via email: “Many startups have attempted to improve this customer experience and failed, but it seems Honey Homes got it right. Rarely does an idea work so well so quickly. I’ve been involved since day one and have been fortunate to see the incredible response from customers.”
He believes that Honey Homes differs from many other consumer startups in the home services space that simply match homeowners with potential vendors or “serve as a concierge.”
Added Moore: “Honey Homes solves the whole problem of home improvement and maintenance, from idea to completion. By doing quality work repeatedly, we build trust with our customers. They then reward us with more work over time.”

"Gusto reaches $500M in trailing revenue, teams up with Remote to support international hires",Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/27,"
Gusto, best known for its American payroll management software and services, is playing in the big leagues.
TechCrunch+ has exclusively learned that Gusto has surpassed a significant revenue milestone: In its most recent fiscal year (the 12 months ended April 30, 2023), it generated revenue of more than $500 million, the company said.
The company also has a key profitability benchmark within reach, anticipating reaching free cash flow positivity in the next few quarters, where it expects to stay thereafter.
Gusto has so far held details regarding its financial performance close to its chest, so these numbers are illuminating. In 2021, the company admitted to recording revenue in the nine figures, but these new details place Gusto among the largest private-market tech companies in terms of scale.
We could better nail down Gusto’s place in the private technology company hierarchy if we had, say, a fourth-quarter revenue figure that we could annualize. But given what we have, Gusto certainly ended its last fiscal year on a greater run rate than $500 million, meaning that it is far and away large enough to go public in its current form.
Gusto declined to share information relating to its recent growth rate, but CEO Josh Reeves told TechCrunch in 2021 that his company was growing around 50% per year.
Reaching cash flow positivity is notable for Gusto in today’s business climate, which has many tech startups and unicorns working to conserve cash. Ending cash burn is not a simple process. “At-scale companies should have a path to be able to fund themselves,” Reeves told TechCrunch+, adding that his company has “been on a path” to cash flow positivity for the past four or five years.
Understandably, Gusto has no plans to raise more outside capital. That said, we don’t expect it to pursue a direct listing when it does go public.

When the tech IPO market reopens, keep an eye on HR unicorns

Partner power
How did Gusto breach the half-billion-dollar revenue milestone? By pursuing a multipart model. Back in mid-2021, the company launched an embedded payroll feature, which allowed other companies to offer its payroll services to their customers inside their app or service.
The work has paid off: The company told TechCrunch this week that since its launch, its embedded payroll service has grown to a partner base of 27. Those partners, in turn, support more than a half-million businesses. Gusto also said that it has agreements with a few “Fortune 250” companies but declined to share their names.
Gusto’s efforts to offer its payroll services to other companies via an API was foreshadowing, to a degree. Reeves indicated at the time of the launch that more of Gusto’s platform would become available via an API over time. That was made possible by the company’s work to use internal APIs to power its own software.
And this prior API-related work stands to pay dividends, given that Gusto announced this morning that it is teaming up with Remote to support international hires.
Remote + Gusto
In the United States, Gusto is best known for its HR tech business, including payroll and benefits management. Remote, in contrast, helps companies hire and support full-time staff around the world.
Gusto powers its American customers’ domestic payroll and supports international contractors, while Remote allows companies to hire internationally, handling the necessary work to do so in a compliant manner.
According to Reeves, demand for Gusto to support full-time international workers was clear — in a more remote-friendly world, this is not a massive shock — which makes the Remote partnership feel contentedly logical. Gusto confirmed that the deal is a revenue-share arrangement.
But why not build instead of partnering with another company? Reeves framed his company’s choice by reaching back in time, explaining that Gusto launched only with support for California before going on to support all U.S. states over the next three years. It chose to leave revenue on the table by being methodical.
He said that Remote has taken a similar approach to international markets, “expanding country by country” by building the “right infrastructure” to do so.
That shared perspective regarding careful compliance and the chance at a quick time to market made the Remote partnership a “no-brainer,” Reeves said. The two companies also share a backer in General Catalyst.
For Remote, the deal took a while to close but left both parties quite happy, its CEO Job van der Voort told TechCrunch+.
Van der Voort said that a few years ago, his company decided to offer its services through APIs, mirroring what we heard from Gusto back in 2021. The result is that Gusto customers will be able to add international talent via Remote inside of the Gusto app. There will be a button, van der Voort explained, which sounds simple enough.
To begin with, Gusto customers can start hiring via Remote in Canada, and more markets will be added shortly thereafter. Van der Voort said he wants to bring his company to as many markets as possible in time, past the 75 or so it currently supports. So, Gusto customers could have the ability to hire nearly anywhere globally when that happens. For both unicorns, that shared capability could unlock a new bloc of growth.
Before we get into the competitive considerations at play in the deal, we should note that both companies were not bowled over when we recommended that they just get it over with and do a merger.
Is Gusto’s $500 million number big?
According to PitchBook data, Gusto’s most recent private valuation was around $9.6 billion, just shy of the decacorn mark. Remote is worth a flat $3 billion, according to Crunchbase. The two companies therefore represent a massive amount of private-market wealth held by dozens of investors. If this deal goes well and allows each to do more total business, it could make a lot of pockets fatter. "
4 VCs illustrate why there’s good reason to be optimistic about the machine learning startup market,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/27,"
When you talk about investments in artificial intelligence startups versus machine learning startups, it’s important to distinguish “AI” from “machine learning.” Those phrases are often used interchangeably, but they carry a slightly different meaning.
Machine learning, or ML, is a method of training AI models so that they can learn to make decisions. Put another way, ML involves training models to solve specific tasks by learning from data and making predictions. AI, on the other hand, is the broader concept for systems that mimic human cognition.
So ML is a subfield of AI but not the same thing.
Lonne Jaffe, managing director at Insight Partners, explains that Insight uses a “three-layer” framework to unpack the definition of an ML startup.

We’re widening our lens, looking for more investors to participate in TechCrunch+ surveys, where we poll top professionals about challenges in their industry.
If you’re an investor and would like to participate in future surveys, fill out this form.

At the first layer, he says, are core infrastructure companies — products with which a person builds an ML system. At the second layer are apps that seek to tackle a particular use case or workflow using ML. The third layer, meanwhile, comprises ML startups that manifest within an industry as an “actual player” in that industry — think startups that become a startup bank, even if the core of the startup is still ML talent.
According to this framework, examples of ML startups range from Weights & Biases, which provides tools to create and monitor AI models, to Iterative Health, a healthcare company that leverages an ML system designed to identify cancerous polyps from a colonoscopy.
The market for ML is quite large, with a report from Grand View Research estimating that it was worth $49.6 billion in 2022 and could grow at a CAGR of 33.5% by 2030. And it’s been building for some time: A 2021 survey by Dresner Advisory Services found that 59% of all large enterprises are deploying ML, with 50% of those organizations claiming to have 25 or more ML models in use today.
Why is this area growing so fast? 451 Research, the tech R&D group within S&P, posited in a recent report that the initial wave of ML adoption focused on making legacy systems and processes smarter — like business intelligence, customer support, sales and marketing and security. But now, as those applications mature, the attention has shifted to more niche, industry-specific and lucrative ML applications, particularly in finance, retail, manufacturing and healthcare.
Jerry Chen, a partner at Greylock, believes we’re just starting to see what the next generation of ML companies will be. “The cycle is going strong,” he told TechCrunch+. “I’m curious to see how incumbent companies and tech players enter, compete or partner with the startups. In particular, I think we will see some interesting go-to-market partnerships in the next few months.”
But what about the broader VC ecosystem? Are VCs in general optimistic about the future of ML?
To get a better sense, TechCrunch+ surveyed investors including Chen and Jaffe about the state of ML investing today. We touched on the health of the ML funding landscape, and whether the hype around ML, which several years ago was quite strong, is beginning to die down. We also asked investors what challenges stand in the way of ML tech adoption and what the next few months might look like in terms of market growth.
We spoke with:

How strong is the ML venture fundraising market today and how has it evolved thus far in 2023?
The release of ChatGPT five months ago sparked the fire of startup innovation around ML, along with a renewed fundraising dynamic. We’ve gone from systems of prediction — like classification or recommendation systems — to systems of creation. While funding has been flowing into generative ML systems, there has also been a lot of progress in more “traditional,” discriminative ML systems, like prediction or classification systems.
We’ve been particularly active recently in applied computer vision ML systems in healthcare, some of which may soon match or even exceed human physician performance across certain domains. For example, dental startup Overjet uses AI to analyze dental X-rays to help dentists decide if a tooth needs a filling or a crown, improving patient outcomes. "
Prosus slashes edtech giant Byju’s valuation to $5.1 billion,Manish Singh,2023/06/27,"
Prosus, the largest non-founder shareholder in Byju’s, has drastically slashed the worth of its stake in the edtech giant, implying a starkly diminished valuation of $5.1 billion to the Indian startup.
Prosus disclosed on Tuesday that it had downsized the value of its 9.6% stake in Byju’s to around $493 million in the financial year ending in March. This figure stands in stark contrast to the $6 billion at which Prosus had valued Byju’s as recently as November of the previous year. More concerningly, that’s a staggering drop from the $22 billion valuation at which Byju’s has raised multiple tranches of funding in the past 18 months.
The markdown comes at a time when the most Indian valuable startup is grappling with a number of challenges — a legal battle with lenders, resignation of board members and departure of global auditing firm Deloitte.
Prosus, Peak XV Partners and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative confirmed late last week that their representatives had resigned from the board of Byju’s. The board members’ resignations came shortly after Deloitte told the startup’s board that it was also resigning from its role.
Deloitte, which was slated to work with Byju’s until 2025, said that the edtech giant had failed to hand over financial results for the year ended March 2022.
In its Tuesday annual report, Prosus said it had lost “significant influence” in Byju’s during the current year “due to the loss of board representation.”
Prosus is not only one of the largest shareholders of Byju’s, it’s also one of the earliest. The investment giant has never sold its stake in the Indian startup, which has raised over $6 billion to date. It’s also not the only Byju’s shareholder to write down the worth of their startup stake.
Byju Raveendran, the co-founder and chief executive of Byju’s, has been working on securing a substantial large funding round to calm his existing investors.
TechCrunch reported last month that Byju’s was in talks with sovereign wealth funds and other investors, aiming to raise up to $950 million.
In a shareholder call last week, the chief financial officer of Byju’s pledged to have the auditing for the financial year ending March 2022 conclude by September this year, and for the financial year ending March 2023 by December, said a person briefed on the minutes of the call.
Raveendran also assured shareholders that he had intended a smoother transition for board members and acknowledged the abrupt departure of Deloitte.
He attempted to assuage the concerns by stating that he was all-in committed to Byju’s, having injected hundreds of millions of dollars of personal funds, taken as loans, into the company.
“Byju’s is not my work; it is my life,” he stated, according to the person briefed.

Glean operational advice from Airbnb and Instacart at TC Disrupt 2023’s Builders Stage,Lauren Simonds,2023/06/26,"
What does it take to turn an unknown startup into a household name? The ability to scale. It’s the Holy Grail that every early-stage startup founder chases. Scaling internal operations may lack the glamor of funding rounds and founder profiles, but it’s essential heavy lifting for startup success.
Founders looking for inspiration need look no further than Airbnb and Instacart. These two respected companies share important similarities. They scaled to massive size, and each added to their initial wins: Airbnb Experiences and Instacart ad network.
We’re thrilled that Naba Banerjee, director of trust product and operations at Airbnb, and Asha Sharma, COO at Instacart, will join us for a session called “How to Build Intelligent Startup Ops that Will Scale with Your Business.” You’ll find it on the Builders Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023, which takes place on September 19–21 in San Francisco.
Scaling is no simple feat — if it were, every startup would be a unicorn. Both Banerjee and Sharma are consummate leaders with visibility into two companies that have practically turned scaling into an art form.
We look forward to hearing their individual perspectives on what it takes to build out operations that support and grow along with your company. We’ll ask questions along the lines of:

How do you know when someone on staff is not up to taking their team or department to the next level, and whether you need to hire someone externally?
How do you handle cultural consistency during periods of rapid hiring, especially in a multi-office model?

And that’s just for starters. If you’re looking for operational tips and insight, you don’t want to miss this session.
Learn more about our expert speakers — and their qualifications for scaling startups into massive companies — below.

BentoML scores $9M funding to expedite AI app development,Rita Liao,2023/06/26,"
The success of large language models like GPT has sparked a frenzy of developers eager to make AI-powered applications. But building AI services can be tricky, especially due to the shortage of skilled developers to meet the rising demand these days.
That’s where Chaoyu Yang, an early software engineer at the data mega-unicorn Databricks, comes in. Along with his co-founders, he’s built the AI development framework BentoML, which just announced a seed financing round.
Yang, in an interview with TechCrunch, explained that today’s AI services are often built on multiple machine learning models, making their management and operation complicated. Many programmers entering the fray are coming from a full-stack or application development background, meaning they often lack the skills to build the required AI infrastructure, resulting in a prolonged development process.
A demo AI app like Microsoft’s Visual ChatGPT, an upgrade to the chatbot that allows it to produce responses from both text and image prompts, for example, can take at least three to six months to make it production-ready, Yang said.
While tech behemoths like Microsoft enjoy the financial prowess and human capital to train AI models and put them to use in the real world, smaller businesses, in Yang’s words, are collecting “valuable data that can benefit tremendously from AI” but “lack the resources to build the infrastructure for development.”
BentoML, which provides a high-level API that abstracts away the details of the infrastructure needed for running AI models on the cloud, belongs to a camp of tools like SageMaker that wants to smooth the path for developing AI services. It’s a so-called AI application framework, a set of tools that make it easier to build, ship and scale AI applications, like a construction tool kit one uses to build a house.
Specifically, BentoML is targeting data scientists who train AI models, DevOp engineers who manage their lifecycle and developers who actually build applications on top of the models.
With BentoML, developers can make Visual ChatGPT scalable and cost-efficient for production use in as short as two days, said Yang. Users have also used the framework to run the art generator Stable Diffusion and open source LLMs on the cloud.
Yang compared his company to Vercel, which focuses on serving front-end developers and was last valued at over $1 billion. BentoML aims to be the Vercel for AI, he said.
While Yang predicted that AI would eventually become more production-ready, he admitted he didn’t think the AI application wave would arrive so soon. The founder expects AI app developers to account for over 90% of the platform’s users in the future.
“If you ask me a year ago, I’d say that probably 90% of the companies would be training their own models, but the foundation models that have recently emerged are so powerful that they can perform well even given a dataset it has never seen before,” he said.
“Rather than focusing on model training, developers now only need to work on finetuning and product engineering, which in themselves present a bottleneck because of the shortage of AI-focused developers.”
BentoML was open sourced in 2019 and later introduced a self-hosted SaaS version to enterprise customers. It’s been acquiring users organically through its open source community, which quadrupled its membership to more than 3,000 over the past year, with Japanese messaging giant Line and South Korean internet conglomerate Naver being among its early adopters.
Yang declined to disclose the company’s revenue size.
Investors are taking note of BentoML’s traction in the developer community. The startup recently raised $9 million from its seed financing round led by DCM Ventures, with Bow Capital also participating. DCM’s general partner, Hurst Lin, has joined BentoML’s board following the round.
The exuberant AI market has been a boon to BentoML, but the rapidly changing industry also makes it tricky for the team to juggle short- and long-term goals, Yang admitted.
“You might have to build things that ride the current trend, but in the long term, we of course want to have our own moat. The question is how we balance our time and human resources between the two.”
Update (June 28, 2023): The article previously stated that Line was a South Korean company. Line is headquartered in Japan and is a subsidiary of Z Holdings, a joint venture between Japan’s SoftBank and South Korea’s Naver.

Vercel raises $150M Series D as it looks to build an end-to-end front-end development platform

French VC firm Frst reaches $80 million first close for its new seed fund,Romain Dillet,2023/06/25,"
Frst, the Paris-based VC firm with no vowel in its name, is in the process of raising its second fund. The firm has already reached a first closing of €72 million (nearly $80 million at today’s exchange rate).
And if there’s one thing to say about this new fund it’s that business is as usual for Frst. As the name suggests, Frst aims to be the first VC firm to invest in a tech startup.
Frst even tells me that around half of the VC firm’s term sheets are sent before the startups are incorporated. The firm has decided to keep the same formula, with some fresh capital to invest over the next few years.
The team, led by Pierre Entremont and Bruno Raillard, originally met when they were working for Otium Venture as part of Pierre-Édouard Stérin’s family office. In 2019, the team created its own VC firm and raised the initial Frst fund (called Frst 2). At the time, Frst raised €90 million (nearly $100 million at today’s exchange rate).
With today’s new fund called Frst 3, the investment firm expects to reach the upper limit of €100 million ($110 million). Frst has secured funding from the European Investment Fund, Bpifrance’s Fonds National d’Amorçage 2, Axa Venture Partners and Isomer. Several individual investors are also investing in the fund itself, such as entrepreneurs working for PayFit, Owkin, Shippeo, Pigment, Electra, Supercell, Wolt, Aiven and Homa Games.
While Frst doesn’t focus on one vertical in particular, the firm believes that there will be plenty of interesting investment opportunities in the coming years due to the rise of artificial intelligence.
“The rapid developments observed in the field of Artificial Intelligence over the past few months and the disruptions they are creating make an extremely favorable context for startups. From work to medicine, defense, education, or natural resource management, the economy and society as a whole are preparing to undergo unprecedented changes,” Entremont said in a statement.
Overall, if you include Otium Venture’s original €44 million fund, the Frst team has more than €200 million of assets managed or advised ($219 million). With this metric, Frst says that it is now the largest seed fund focused on French startups specifically.
“France is particularly well positioned to play a leading role in this upcoming revolution, notably due to its production of top technical talent. This is why Artificial Intelligence has always been a very present theme in our investments, with, for instance, Owkin or Doctrine 7 years ago. We have also already made several investments with Frst 3 in teams with remarkable technical quality,” Raillard said in a statement.
The Frst team has invested in dozens of startups, such as Pigment, Electra, Poolside, Doctrine, PayFit, Shippeo and Owkin. With its new fund, it plans to invest between €1 million and €3 million in around 30 companies.

utu raises $33M to help travelers get more from tax-free shopping,Catherine Shu,2023/06/25,"
utu, a travel tech company that helps flyers get more out of their tax-free shopping, announced today it has raised a $33 million Series B from investors, including SC Ventures. utu also announced it has acquired CardsPal, a Singapore-based fintech that offers deals and promotions nearby to users.
During the pandemic-induced travel hiatus, utu worked to establish partnerships with travel, hotel chain and retail brands. The company notes that even though travel has rebounded, only about 1% of venture funding over the past 15 years has gone to travel, primarily short-term rental hospitality. utu’s goal is to create innovation in the tax-free shopping sector, which allows tourists to reclaim VAT on their purchases.
utu offers customers a Tax Free Card, which has two main offerings. First, tax-free shoppers can opt for frequent flyer miles or hotel points instead of VAT refunds. Or they can select an immediate store voucher that is equal to 120% of the VAT or GST they paid while shopping overseas. utu says that retailers, airlines, hotels and other organizations that partner with them can not only increase customer loyalty, but also grow their revenue from tourist shopping by up to 40%.
utu’s partners include 10 global airlines, like Air France-KLM, Emirates, Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines, as well as Accor, one of Europe’s large hospitality brands. To facilitate payments, utu works with fintech partners with Nium and also uses its own proprietary tech. It plans to announce more partnerships later this year.
Customer pay VAT upfront, and can reclaim it through operators like Planet or Global Blue. But they don’t get back the full amount of VAT, which is where utu comes in.
utu co-founder Asad Jumabhoy spent eight years working in the duty-free business, before another 25 in tax-free shopping. While operating fashion and perfume stores at Changi Airport in Singapore in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Jumabhoy started a tax refund business that evolved into Global Blue. After selling Global Blue in 2012, Jumabhoy decided to take his understanding of retail margins, value-added taxes and customer shopping habits to develop utu.
“The way we think about our work is that we are unbuilding new product layers on top of the existing tax-free shopping infrastructure that unlocks value for all stakeholders connected to tourist shopping — brands, tourists and our VAT refund partners,” he said.
Jumabhoy said even though tax-free shopping is a common practice, there are still two problems. The first is that the process of getting VAT refunds is difficult, and secondly, tourists only get part of their VAT spending back. utu focuses on the second problem and wants to give tourists more value when they shop. For example, they can receive over 90% of their refund value in airline frequent flyer miles.
The CardsPal acquisition will give utu a digital marketplace, a promotions engine and self-service merchant registration portal. It will also expedite utu’s rollout in markets like France and Italy, plus another 50 countries that offer VAT and GST refunds.
utu’s funding will be used to grow its product distribution across all countries that offer a VAT refund service, invest in technology and new products and strengthen its management to execute its growth plan.

There are signs that it will be a hot secondaries summer,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/06/25,"
One of the main reasons we have yet to see a meaningful recovery in late-stage deal activity is the lack of consensus around how startups should be valued. No one wants to pay 2021 prices, but gauging what startups are worth now isn’t easy.
However, there are signs that folks are coming to an agreement.
Last week, Forge Global, a private securities marketplace, released data that shows the average difference between what secondary sellers were looking to sell for and what buyers were looking to buy shares for — also known as the bid/ask spread — had decreased to 17%. This is the lowest percentage in a year, showing that buyers and sellers are starting to get on the same page regarding price.

Did this one feature entice Robinhood to acquire X1?,Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/06/25,"
Welcome back to The Interchange! If you want this in your inbox, sign up here. We’re back after a brief hiatus, with lots of fintech news, including Robinhood’s latest acquisition, Plaid’s newest product and a ChatGPT-powered AI tool that aims to help you save money on bills.
Robinhood’s motives
When Robinhood announced on June 22 that it was acquiring credit card startup X1 for $95 million, it caused all sorts of chatter in the fintech world.
Why would Robinhood want to buy a credit card startup? Did it get a good deal, considering that X1 has raised only $62 million over its lifetime? Did its investors get a good deal or just a return on their investment? Why X1 in particular over the many other credit card startups out there?
Let’s talk about that last point first.
When we talked to X1 in December at the time of its last fundraise, founder and CEO Deepak Rao told us the company was launching a new trading platform that would give its cardholders the ability to buy stocks by using earned reward points. He even singled out Robinhood as a company he was hoping to compete with, telling TechCrunch: “By using credit card points to buy stock instead of cash or their savings, we feel this is a safe way for many consumers to start investing. There is no real downside as their investing is technically free.”
Aha.
Could that be what drew Robinhood to X1??
On this week’s Equity podcast, we chatted about that possibility, with co-host Alex Wilhelm noting that one would have to earn a lot of rewards before being able to buy many stocks. He also pointed out that Robinhood perhaps had some money to burn, as well as the company declaring that it was looking for something new as a way of “broadening [its] product offerings” and “deepening” its relationship with existing customers.
If you’ve been following Robinhood’s performance over the past year, a desire to diversify its business is probably not a surprise. We noted that not only has Robinhood’s crypto trading slowed, but also the company has seen significant user attrition. So an X1 acquisition gets Robinhood into the credit card space and an additional revenue stream.
Still, one observer noted that while X1’s basic premise of offering credit based on income rather than credit score was innovative, since it first formed in 2020 it has not really since delivered anything — other than the new stock feature — that stands out in the market.
Fintech analyst Alex Johnson shared a similar sentiment, tweeting: “The brand alignment is strong. Both companies have a certain unearned machismo about them. Other than that though, I don’t get this for Robinhood. X1 doesn’t have a lot of customers (did it ever even fully launch?) and none of its features are revolutionary.”
It is true that X1 may not have had a lot of customers, especially in comparison to a giant like Robinhood, but the company claimed to be on a growth trajectory, with Rao telling us last December that the company saw $3 million a month in revenue last October, giving it an annual revenue rate of $36 million.
Not everyone is down on the deal, though. Better Tomorrow Ventures’ Sheel Mohnot tweeted that while X1 may not have a lot of customers, Robinhood does. He added: “[T]his seems like a good acquisition to me, cheaper to cross-sell than to sell to new customers.”

Weekly News
Fintech startup Plaid got its start as a company that connects consumer bank accounts to financial applications but has since been gradually expanding its offerings to offer more of a full-stack onboarding experience. And on June 22, Plaid announced even more new product releases that moved the company into a whole new direction while also helping to diversify its revenue streams. At the top of that lies Beacon, which it is describing as a “collaborative anti-fraud network enabling financial institutions and fintech companies to share critical fraud intelligence via API across Plaid.” More here.
Navan (formerly TripActions) offers both a corporate card and a subscription to its software. In a twist, the company announced on June 12 the launch of a new product called Navan Connect, which it describes as a patented card-link technology that gives businesses a way to offer automated expense management and reconciliation without having to change their corporate card provider. For the initial launch, Navan has partnered with Mastercard and Visa, with plans to announce additional network tie-ups in the near future. More here.
Spend management startup Brex was named to Time’s 100 Most Influential Companies list. As it made the recognition, Time wrote: “Co-CEO Henrique Dubugras says think of Brex as a ‘spend platform.’ The company launched its corporate charge card for startups five years ago, and has since grown into a fintech conqueror. Valued at $12.3 billion in 2022, it has made 10 acquisitions, and after Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse, it received $2 billion in deposits and opened 4,000 new accounts. Last year Brex launched Empower, software that links Brex cards and accounts to a custom expense-­management service. The company services startups, helping new businesses get off the ground, as well as enterprise clients, including DoorDash, Indeed, Coinbase, SeatGeek, and Lemonade.” Ramp, another spend management startup, also made the list, with Time writing: “Notching an $8.1 billion valuation just three years after being founded is striking, even for a tech startup. While many fin­tech companies struggled last year, Ramp’s meteoric rise accelerated. The business-expense-software firm saw revenues quadruple as its customers looked to stay lean through inflation. Ramp’s Visa cards are tied to employer-­set policies, so employees instantly know if charges are approved; reports and receipts aren’t always needed. Employers get alerts about duplicate expenses and items they may be overpaying for. ”
Brubank, an Argentina-based digital bank founded by former Citibank executive Juan Bruchou, shared with TechCrunch that since launching in 2019, it has brought in nearly 3 million clients, making Brubank “the largest Spanish-speaking digital bank in Latin America, with a 50% activity rate,” according to the company. It also has been sustaining bottom line profitability for the past 12 months.
At least two companies are poised for a credit card launch this summer: Snowfoll, one of three startups that pitched at TC Early Stage Boston in April, will launch a credit card in July that is tailored to users in the U.S. and India so they can more easily transmit cash cross-border. The company said users in the U.S. are eligible for limits as high as $30,000, and the card reduces the need for having separate bank accounts in the U.S. and India. In addition, the process is instant and cost-free. Meanwhile, Step, the financial platform tailored to teens, their families and young adults, opened up a waitlist for its latest card, Step Black Card. Cardholders will be eligible for perks, including earning 5% on savings balances up to $1 million and up to 8x the points on purchases. Read TechCrunch coverage on Step here and here.

In November of last year, PitchBook made so many predictions on venture capital and private equity in Europe that it is now reexamining them in a fresh report.
The new report, titled “European Private Capital Outlook: H1 Follow-Up,” doesn’t just look at whether PitchBook analysts were right or wrong. It also reevaluates its forecasts and what changed since then to make new assertions.
Several of PitchBook’s new predictions have to do with private equity, but the one that caught my attention relates more directly to startups: the amount of venture capital that may or may not be available to them.
Often referred to as dry powder, the money raised by VC funds that hasn’t been invested yet was expected by PitchBook to reach record levels in Europe this year. Its EMEA Private Capital analyst Nicolas Moura stands by the prediction, but the nuances between then and now are worth exploring.

Deal Dive: Caraway shows what else digital health can do,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/06/24,"
Access to healthcare has long been an issue in the U.S., but the sheer magnitude of the problem became apparent during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Numerous digital health startups stepped in to address the plethora of issues, and for a few quarters, VCs flocked to back them.
Many of those startups are still focusing on the same things, like telehealth primary care or chat-based therapy, but there’s little visibility into the adoption and customer acquisition they’ve seen. It’s clear investors aren’t so sure either: VC investment in digital health dropped to just $3.4 billion in Q1 2023 from a peak of $15.1 billion in Q2 2021, according to CB Insights.
I’m not saying the sector is dead in the water by any means, but the founders still finding success are doing far more than merely building off their peers. A recent fundraise illustrates clearly what VCs are finding attractive in the sector, and the types of startups that may find traction in today’s climate.
On Wednesday, digital health startup Caraway said it had raised an oversubscribed $16.8 million Series A round led by Maveron. The startup looks to offer 24/7 access to physical and mental health resources targeted at Gen Z customers, and its integrated healthcare service has doctors and nurses who are always available for text chats and calls. It also offers tools that help its customers maintain and respond to mental and physical health issues in between appointments or when professionals are offline. The app is licensed to operate in 10 states.
When founder Lori Evans Bernstein started the company in January 2022, she had just left her previous startup, HealthReveal, which used AI to help people manage chronic illnesses. Around the time, Evans Bernstein realized how hard it could be for people to get treatments when talking with her niece: After 15 weeks of fruitlessly waiting for appointments to treat a reaction to an unknown allergy, her niece simply gave up and hoped it wouldn’t come back.
“The more I peeled the onion, the more I couldn’t believe the lack of access to care and the experience they had to go through to get the care they needed,” Evans Bernstein said. That story inspired her to start Caraway, aiming to do away with those barriers to accessing healthcare. "
What happens if regulators nix the $20B Adobe-Figma deal?,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/23,"
When Adobe announced it was putting up $20 billion to buy Figma in September 2022, it didn’t take long before people began assuming it was a blatant attempt to take a competitor off the market. 
It was certainly curious, especially considering the offer was double what the company’s most recent valuation had been and worth around 50x Figma’s revenue. It’s hard to argue that the deal wasn’t a display of brute force on Adobe’s part, the kind of corporate rollup that regulators are trying to put a stop to after years of letting the tech giants run rampant, buying up startups that could eventually erode their market share.
The proposed Adobe-Figma deal has certainly gotten the attention of regulators — and not in a welcoming way. Already, the Justice Department, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) — Britain’s competition watchdog — and the EU are taking long, hard looks at the deal, and it wouldn’t be too much of a stretch to think that any of them could nix the deal for being anticompetitive.
“We are still in preliminary phases of the regulatory process and are having constructive discussions with the CMA, EC and DOJ about the businesses, markets and positive economic impacts this deal will bring to support [customers’ positive] reviews [of the product],” an Adobe spokesperson told TechCrunch+.
It seems pretty obvious even to a casual observer that Adobe is trying to take a potential rival off the board, a move that could stifle both competition and innovation, not a great mix for design software consumers. 
To be sure, the deal would give Adobe an entirely new look, one it has tried to build on its own with a design tool rival, Adobe XD. But XD never gained much traction, which explains why the company was willing to fork over $20 billion to get the cream of the crop.
In an interview at TechCrunch Disrupt last fall, Figma co-founder Dylan Field argued that the two companies would truly be better together. But of course he has 20 billion reasons to think that.
When asked to explain why he decided to join forces with the company that his marketing team had been painting as its biggest rival, he saw two companies marrying creativity and design, and he couldn’t see having the resources to move in that direction on his own, at least not for a long time. “If we want to go and make it so that we’re able to go into all these more productivity areas, that’s gonna take a lot of time. To be able to go and do that in the context of Adobe, I think gives us a huge leg up, and I’m really excited about that,” Field said.
But with regulators looking closely, it’s not a stretch to wonder if that’s ever going to happen. But even if it does, would the deal be a net-positive for Figma and its backers? Let’s talk about it. "
When AI bots pose as humans,Haje Jan Kamps,2023/06/23,"
Welcome to Startups Weekly. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday afternoon.
This week, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about the implications of artificial intelligence. One of the most fragile parts of the puzzle is the training data. We already know that you can see if your images were used to train the datasets and that a lot of the training datasets out there are . . . spurious at best. Some startups are trying to build datasets trained exclusively on licensed data, and human artists are pretty grumpy when big-name studios use AI to generate art.
An interesting curveball is realizing that even evaluating training data may be challenging, as researchers discover that Mechanical Turk workers — who are, in theory, human workers doing tasks that machines can’t do — are reportedly using AI tools themselves. That’s fine for some tasks, but not great if the text they are generating is meant to be used as the rubric that AI-generating text tools are measured against. The old computing adage of “garbage in, garbage out” still stands. If you can’t trust the training data, you can’t trust the output (TC+).
Seen through the lens of startups, AI is continuing to go gangbusters — and Amazon’s AWS is throwing its not inconsiderable weight behind the burgeoning trend, with a $100 million program to fund generative AI initiatives.
The highest highs and deepest lows of transportation

It’s a bad week when a submersible goes missing, followed by a series of reports showing that perhaps the company didn’t have the most solid safety track record. The sub imploded under the ocean’s crushing pressure, killing its five passengers and raising new questions about the role of whistleblowers in startup land. The OceanGate underwater vessel used a carbon fiber hull that “wasn’t rated for Titanic depths,” claimed the operations-director-turned-whistleblower. It goes to show that, while startups famously “move fast and break stuff,” perhaps that tenet doesn’t quite extend to life-or-death critical equipment.
A highlight for transportation this week is a breakthrough in battery manufacturing. It turns out that up to half the energy required to make a lithium-ion cell is used in the process of drying certain components of the battery cell. Volkswagen just came up with a new process (TC+) that does away with that requirement, drastically reducing the cost and time it takes to create the batteries that power our electric vehicles.

Sure, that seems . . . useful?: In what has to be one of the biggest headscratchers of the decade, Mercedes is adding ChatGPT to its infotainment system, Devin reports.
Give us those sleek Tesla plugs: Last week, GM and Ford announced they would be using Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS) very soon. Tim predicted that the company’s Supercharger network will strain as a result. This week, Rivian announced it will adopt the charging standard as well.
More NACS tailwinds: First GM and Ford, then Rivian, and now Texas weighs in, saying state-funded EV chargers must include Tesla plugs.
Bring on the challenger brands: Abu Dhabi pours $740 million into the Chinese EV brand Nio.

Hackers gonna hack

Both in startup land and beyond, we are seeing a tremendous amount of movement in security news over the past couple of weeks. We’ve had a ton of coverage of Reddit slowly imploding over the new API charges the social media giant introduced a little while back. But one story I particularly wanted to highlight is that hackers are threatening to release confidential data stolen from Reddit unless the company pays a ransom demand — and reverses its controversial API price hikes. It seems pretty curious for hackers to demand both policy changes and cash. If they were given one or the other, I wonder which they would choose — and what that says about the power of hack-tivism.
Malicious hacking has long been in the news, but I find it particularly interesting that we are seeing more and more startups trying to help tackle the problem, whether that’s hardening API security, data security at source or Internet of Things devices. As hackers get more sophisticated, and as computer security exploit exploration becomes more prevalent (just last week, a ransomware gang listed its first victims of MOVEit mass-hacks, which included U.S. banks and universities), opportunities for startups also increase. And yet, as Alex explored recently, it seems like a miss that VCs aren’t queuing around the block (TC+) to fund the current generation of cybersecurity companies.

That seems bad. That’s bad, right? Yeah, that’s bad: A simple bug exposed access to thousands of smart security alarm systems.

You’re so money and you don’t even know it

Fintech, what are we going to do with you? Even in an industry that’s all about money, the vertical just continues exploding with investment. Paro raised $25 million to match independent financial experts with firms, open banking fintech company Volt just raised a huge round at a valuation north of $350 million, and Majority, a digital bank for U.S. migrants, closed almost $10 million as it expands operations in Texas.
Sexy it ain’t, but investors know that fintech — once the company gets a soupçon of traction and a fistful of customers — is interesting for two reasons: Money never goes out of fashion, and there are M&A-hungry multinational giants who are standing by to snap up a company that’s on the upswing. At startup scale, the most recent example was that Robinhood just acquired credit card startup X1 for $95 million. At a very different scale indeed, Nasdaq announced it is planning to acquire financial services software company Adenza for $10.5 billion.
There’s money in them money trees, it appears.

Wait, who am I paying?: Catherine reports that Notarize launches Proof and doubles down on ensuring safe(r) online transactions.
That’s it, no more fraud for you: Mary Ann reports that Plaid unveils a new collaboration network aimed at sharing fraud intelligence.

How to identify, interview and hire a head of growth for an early-stage startup
The 3 stages of building world-class growth funnels



Don’t reinvent the growth funnel.
There’s more than a decade of growth marketing now behind us. Thousands of startups have experimented with infinite variations and tweaks to their growth funnel, so why should you try to reinvent the same foundation?
The most important aspects are acquisition, activation and retention. While referral and monetization are also quite important, they won’t make or break a startup like those first three. If you can’t acquire, activate or retain consumers to your startup, your probability of success is practically nil.
In this article I will walk you through world-class setups from several leading companies, broken down by each stage of the funnel, so that you can draw inspiration from what has already been proven over the last decade.
This isn’t meant to be a teardown of each specific startup, but rather a holistic look into what leading companies are doing, their mindsets when it comes to growth and how to replicate these actions in your own startup.
Funnel stage I: Acquisition
Without question, the most advanced acquisition I personally encountered occurred while I was a leader of rider growth at Uber. As you can imagine, at that time we had swarms of product managers, data scientists and all the complementary growth roles you can think of helping us push our growth marketing team forward.
When building the correct approach for acquisition, these are the aspects that will elevate a world-class program above an average one:

Attribution setup
Mindset on metrics
Focus on large levers

In terms of our attribution, I must begin by qualifying that I have never seen an attribution framework that was 100% accurate, as it is essentially impossible to capture all acquisition data without leakage.
At Uber we did still spend a great deal of time working with our attribution partners, such as our mobile measurement partner, and were constantly locating areas of improvement. Before unloading on your acquisition budget, you should first ensure you are capturing all possible data from your paid channels. If you’re acquiring on the web, this means adding UTM parameters to all campaigns.
 

			Acquisition, activation and retention are critical. While referral and monetization are also quite important, they won’t make or break a startup.					


Conversely, if you’re acquiring on a mobile app, this means having a mobile measurement partner fully integrated into your app. I’ve written an entire column on how to set up a proper tech stack that I implore readers to visit if they are starting their own attribution efforts from scratch.
Mindset on acquisition is what separates marketers flashing vanity metrics such as CTR and CVR, while simultaneously losing sight on down-funnel conversion metrics. At Uber, we focused on advanced metrics such as predicted LTV (pLTV) and predicted first trips (pFT) of new riders that we were acquiring in real time. Using methodologies we developed in-house that analyzed various data points, including acquisition channel and geography, we were able to accurately predict the number of trips a new user would make 90 days out.
Whatever your north star metric is, you should always be looking far into the future to understand the value of your acquisition so that you can double down on those channels that bring the highest-value consumers.
Acquisition is ever-changing and the best-in-class marketers work hard to stay in touch with the latest creative trends, new ad formats to test, and those next golden pockets to sell to. When I was on the growth team at Coinbase, we spent a minimum of 10% of our budget testing the new ad formats that TikTok was releasing.
The point here is that you should focus on the largest paid acquisition levers as they come to fruition, with one such example being creative on paid social. I recommend the following sites that keep startup founders up-to-date on the latest growth and marketing trends — SocialMediaToday for paid social or Search Engine Land for paid search.

"TechCrunch+ roundup: AI + travel, fusion investor survey, why you’ll never get funding",Walter Thompson,2023/06/23,"
Most founders won’t realize that they’re on the wrong track until it’s too late.
That’s because failure is something many entrepreneurs can only perceive in hindsight: The day-to-day work of building a startup requires a high degree of confidence — and for some, denial.
Quoting the movie “Grosse Pointe Blank,” perhaps this column by Haje Jan Kamps will be “a swift, spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.”

In his experience, there are three reasons why some startups will never get a thumbs-up from an investor:

the market is too small;
the team is not good enough;
the plan doesn’t make sense.

These are all major problems, but here’s the good news: These are only existential issues for ego-driven founders. People who can accept they don’t have all the answers are able to pivot to success.
On the other hand, those who look in the mirror and see Captain America smiling back tend to make poor CEOs.

When it comes to integrating AI with travel, “even a small lead matters right now,” according to Eric Crowley and Adam Segall of global investment bank GP Bullhound.
Today’s consumers can create their own itineraries, but it still requires guesswork:
Can I walk to the beach from my hotel with a surfboard? Which restaurants near this conference center have vegan options?

According to a report from global venture firm Accel, a “flywheel of inter-generational talent spawning from unicorns” is helping Europe and Israel maintain momentum even as deal flow and funding have slowed globally.
“Our data reveals that 221 of the region’s 353 VC-backed unicorns have fueled 1,171 new tech-enabled startups through their alumni,” writes Harry Nelis, a partner with the London-based company.

Warming public markets are boosting the secondary market for startup shares

Follow-on investment may be harder to obtain, but Alex Wilhelm reports that “the combination of seller pessimism and modest buyer optimism” is driving an “uptick in secondary market activity.”
Interpreting data from Caplight, Forge, Other Information and PitchBook, he concluded that the increase may signal a potential rise in startup valuations.
“It’s becoming clearer how much pain startups will need to endure to raise more capital, but it’s anybody’s guess if they’re willing to accept that fact.”

Black founders based in the United Kingdom have an even harder time than their U.S.-based counterparts when it comes to accessing venture capital, reports Dominic-Madori Davis.
“Between 2009 and 2019 in the U.K., just 30 Black people received VC funding, equating to less than 0.4% of all funds allocated to founders.”
She interviewed multiple investors who are working to expand this community, including Karl Lokko, co-founder of venture firm Black Seed, which recently announced its £5 million inaugural fund.
“The wheels are starting to turn, but we’ve got a long road ahead,” he said.

Byju’s key investors confirm board exits,Manish Singh,2023/06/23,"
Prosus, Peak XV Partners and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative confirmed Friday that their representatives have resigned from the board of Byju’s, India’s most valuable startup that is also reeling from the departure of its auditor Deloitte this week.
The board members’ resignations — which Byju’s vehemently denied on Thursday — came shortly after global auditing giant Deloitte told the startup’s board that it was resigning from its role. Deloitte, which was slated to work with Byju’s until 2025, said that the edtech giant had failed to hand over financial results for the year ended March 2022.
A spokesperson for Peak XV Partners confirmed the departure of GV Ravishankar, a partner at the firm, from Byju’s board and said the investing giant, formerly known as Sequoia India, was “committed to supporting the company for bringing on board an independent director in order to strengthen business processes and internal control mechanisms.”
In a statement, a Prosus spokesperson said:
Prosus confirms that Russell Dreisenstock, the representing Board Director from MIH Edtech Investments, B.V. (a Prosus entity) on the board of Think & Learn Private Limited, resigned from his position. The Company is required to file the resignation letter with the MCA in India within the required time period.
In a statement, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative confirmed that Vivian Wu has quit Byju’s board. The resignations halve the board’s size to just three individuals: Byju’s co-founders — Byju Raveendran and Divya Gokulnath — and Raveendran’s brother Riju.
In a statement, a Byju’s spokesperson said the company’s management is engaging with investors to reconstitute the board and said departing members left because their shareholding had fallen.
“The need for reconstitution arose as few investors had to vacate the board seat due to their shareholding falling below a minimum required threshold as per our SHA. We want to reassure all stakeholders that we are actively working towards constituting a diverse and world-class board commensurate with the company’s size and scale.”
Trouble is mounting at Byju’s, which is also the most valuable edtech globally. India’s corporate affairs ministry ordered an investigation into Byju’s last week after the ministry took cognizance of “various corporate governance lapses” at the startup, television channel CNBC-TV18 reported earlier Friday — another reporting that Byju’s denied.
Deloitte said Thursday that it was resigning because it had not received “any communication” from Byju’s on the status of “audit readiness of the financial statements and the underlying books and records for the year ended March 31 2022.”
It was a déjà vu moment for the auditor. Byju’s attracted intense scrutiny last year from the government, investors and creditors after it repeatedly failed to publish its accounts. In September, Byju’s finally published its accounts for the year ending March 2021, revealing revenue figures that fell short of its own projections.

Reddit vs Redditors and other TC news,Haje Jan Kamps,2023/06/23,"
This week on The TechCrunch Podcast, I’m stepping in for the podcast’s usual host Darrell, and taking a closer look at what’s happening at Reddit. The popular social media company seems to be hell-bent on alienating as much of its user base as possible after introducing a policy that significantly increases the price of access to its API. The move may be a reaction to Fidelity cutting its Reddit valuation by more than 40% since its 2021 investment. In any case, the users ain’t happy.

"While everyone keeps talking about AI, HR tech startups are quietly building toward a $24B market",Anna Heim,2023/06/23,"
While venture capitalists, startup founders and major tech companies compete to see who can say “AI” the most in a week, people are busy building other, more useful stuff.
And one particular group has caught our eye: companies that build software for human resource management.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

TechCrunch+ noted in March that there’s a burgeoning group of HR tech unicorns in the United States that are ripe to go public when that window opens. But our initial scope proved limited, because HR tech is hot in Europe right now as well and it’s worth paying attention to.
It makes sense that HR tech has managed to grow rapidly and still fly under the radar — it’s not going to be hyped as the economic model of the future and neither will it be criticized for having the capability to potentially end civilization.
Still, HR tech companies often find themselves moving hundreds of millions of dollars — if not billions — through their channels and have therefore become large and lucrative.
Today we’re digesting notes from a recent GP Bullhound report on European HR tech to expand our general comprehension of the sector in anticipation of an environment in which IPOs are again a reality.
Morphing into unicorns, one paycheck at a time
Strikingly, GP Bullhound reports there is just as much bullish sentiment around HR tech as around AI and climate tech. “We look for these sectors to produce the next tech giants, with maintained if not increased bull-market funding levels and exponential growth in the number of companies,” the report said.

EvaluAgent raises $20M to build out software that evaluates call center agents,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/23,"
After spending more than a decade in the customer experience industry, three friends, Jaime Scott, Michelle Dinsmore and Alex Richards, decided to launch their own company, EvaluAgent, to develop quality assurance testing software for contact centers.
The three co-founders say they were motivated by a shared desire to find a solution to the problem of contact center manager overwork. Reviewing customer calls and texts for quality assurance calls takes time — so much time, in fact, that it’s rarely done regularly. According to one source, only between 1% and 2% of calls to a contact center actually get evaluated.
“At its heart, the contact center’s role is to serve customers,” Scott, who serves as the company’s CEO, told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Those customers are human beings and, as such, are always going to demand a level of service and experience technology alone won’t be able to offer. Our belief is that the greater the employee experience for agents, the greater the customer experience they’ll be able to offer.”
Scott, Dinsmore and Richards incorporated EvaluAgent in 2012. The team grew quickly, but was largely focused on working with a small number of corporate clients. That changed in 2018 and 2019, when Scott says the leadership recognized a gap in the market for a more flexible software-as-a-service-based quality assurance testing solution.
Today, EvaluAgent’s platform aims to help quality assurance staff analyze conversations — both text and voice — across channels to coach and train customer agents. Via mostly automated workflows, EvaluAgent tries to boost the efficiency of QA teams, showing quality assurance-related stats in a unified dashboard.
Managers can give employee feedback via EvaluAgent’s dedicated tool while employees can find answers to common questions in EvaluAgent’s built-in company knowledge base.
“EvaluAgent not only delivers quality assurance, but also provides customers with tools to ensure that evaluators’ findings convert to ongoing behavior change in the agent base,” Scott said. “Altogether, the platform represents a complete system of record for contact centers’ quality teams.”
EvaluAgent also offers an automated scoring system, driven by a combination of speech recognition technologies and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The system, SmartScore, transcribes conversations if necessary and uses ChatGPT — an AI chatbot that understands text — to summarize them for insights, rating line items and providing coaching tips. 
“Out-of-the-box key moments, such as customer frustration, repeat contact, and complaint escalation, are automatically tagged,” Scott explained. “It … empowers organizations to achieve more interaction coverage and streamline the quality assurance process while keeping quality teams in full control.”

One wonders about bias creeping into the algorithms used to evaluate agents’ actions, though. After all, studies have shown that AI is more likely to classify Black speech as “toxic” or “offensive.” And it’s well-understood that voice recognition tech, too, is racially and ethnically biased. So can SmartScore be trusted?
Scott didn’t elaborate on which measures, if any, EvaluAgent takes to combat bias in its algorithms. But he stressed that they aren’t intended to replace human quality assurance evaluators.
“EvaluAgent has made investments in its technical resources to incorporate the best AI models available for its use cases,” he said. “We are model-agnostic, which we believe is a significant advantage in the modern rapidly-evolving AI landscape. Additional AI-fueled innovation and automation, which incorporate the latest AI models but allow quality assurance teams to remain at the center of key workflows, will follow on the back of this financing.”
The lack of transparency hasn’t gotten in the way of the company’s success, it seems. EvaluAgent claims it’s seen revenue grow nearly fivefold over the last three years, with customers ranging from Fortune 500 enterprises to mid-market business process outsourcers and tech companies.
The momentum captured the attention of major investors, which poured cash into EvaluAgent’s Series A. Announced today, the Series A, led by PeakSpan, closed at $20 million, bringing EvaluAgent’s total raised to $21 million.
PeakSpan’s Phil Dur, the lead partner on the deal, says that he saw “tremendous opportunity” in what he described as the “quality arena.” That’s despite stiff competition in the over-$35.3-billion space, apparently — startups including Invoca offer features similar to — but not exactly the same as — EvaluAgent’s.
“Having spent years studying the category, we believe EvaluAgent is the strongest vendor of quality assurance and performance improvement software,” Dur said via email. “The platform shines for small and mid-market contact centers, while maintaining the capacity to serve enterprise-level businesses with large contact center operations.”
Scott says that the Series A funding will be put toward enriching its products, expanding its remote team and supporting customers in “new and existing geographies.”
“Roughly 25% of the contact center market still runs their QA programs on spreadsheets, while another portion makes the best of in-house legacy tools,” he said. “Contact centers are facing a new dynamic — balance leaner staff and fewer onsite agents with an increasingly demanding customer (call volumes, hold times and escalations have been steadily rising) all while optimizing cost to navigate a potentially choppy macroenvironment.”

"Dropbox hearts AI, the creator-platform wars and why we’re bullish on fake booze",Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/23,"

Hello, and welcome back to Equity, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.
Mary Ann and Alex are back, and once again they tapped the TechCrunch roster for expert input. This week, we’re lucky enough to have Kirsten Korosec back on the podcast. She’s TechCrunch’s mobility lead, hosts a podcast of her own and is one of our favorite humans.

All the cool kids are filling out the Equity listener survey. We want to hear from you! 

The summer slowdown is far from happening yet, so we had a whole raft of stuff to chew through. It was a good thing that we had six hands on deck! Here’s the rundown:

Deals of the Week: Mary Ann wanted to talk about Robinhood buying X1, a deal that seemed inexpensive but we lack enough numbers for full confidence; Alex wanted to riff on Dropbox’s new AI fund, even if it does feel a little small; and Kirsten had notes for the team on Cruise’s latest app rollout. Even if Mary Ann and Alex cannot find a way to agree on self-driving cars, we all thought that the Cruise bus is cute.
Twitch and Reddit try to balance corporate requirements with community power: Building off our recent show digging into the creator economy, the crew tackled the latest from Twitch (a new creator-corporate revenue split of sorts) and Reddit (where the battle between the company and its power-users continues to blaze). It’s feeling more hot war than cold war lately on the internet, with platforms struggling to find a way to keep revenue growth coming while not estranging the folks who make their services tick.
The power of Not Boozing: How big is the market for non-alcoholic drinks? Smaller than the market for vodka, certainly, but we’re curious. Also there’s a new app in the market that is helping folks find non-booze bevies, which we dig.

A big thanks to Kirsten for swinging by, and we’ll chat with you Monday morning!

Forcite seeks the smart helmet success that Skully squandered,Tim Stevens,2023/06/23,"
Whither, Skully? The Indiegogo darling of a smart helmet company made all sorts of promises in 2014 and even shipped a few lids to early backers before getting lost on the way to market and disappearing into a cloud of misplaced hype and undelivered promises.
Nearly a decade later, another company called Forcite is back making many of the same promises: a smart helmet that is more digital companion than safety device, which can deliver integrated navigation with visual and auditory prompts.
Forcite, though, is skipping the ugly crowdfunding bit and is instead working directly with distributors. The company has already shipped thousands of MK1S smart helmets and, yes, its technology actually works.
But that’s just the beginning of a journey for this Australian startup working to create a platform that will, it hopes, become an integral part of motorcycle safety.
Inspired by a crash

Forcite was founded a decade ago, initially dabbling in various wearable technologies like in-helmet cameras for American football players. The move toward smart helmets started in 2019, according to CEO and co-founder Alfred Boyadgis.
“I had a motorcycle accident and wanted to create a technology that wasn’t just about passive safety or impact, something that could predict what was ahead on the road, thus changing the decision,” Boyadgis said in a recent interview.
He was also inspired by the GoPro craze. “Everyone started to use these action cameras on the front of their helmet, com-sets on the side of their helmet,” Boyadgis said. “These things increase the rotational velocity of the helmet.”
In a crash, more rotational velocity on a helmet can mean greater forces transferred to the brain within. Keep everything within the shell of the helmet, and that force is reduced.
Forcite’s in-house team started iterating on design ideas but soon turned to the wisdom of the crowd.
“We put together a group of 8,000 riders, an online test pilot club — it was on a Facebook page,” Boyadgis said. “We got those riders together and started talking about the technology which they use. So, you know, how they use the dash cameras, the things they don’t like about how they use com-sets, how they use audio. And then this new layout, which was, like, how do they receive information in an effective way?”
Motorcycling requires far more concentration than driving a car. A moment’s distraction can be fatal, and so the helmet’s UI had to be minimal.
The Forcite team ultimately nixed early ideas of including an augmented reality display of the sort found in the Skully AR-1.
Nuts and bolts
Image Credits: Forcite
At its simplest, the MK1S is a helmet with an integrated Bluetooth audio connection, including speakers positioned over the ears. This means that riders can take calls, listen to music or get navigation instructions provided to the helmet wirelessly from the phone.
Many manufacturers now sell helmets with integrated Bluetooth functionality. What’s novel in the MK1S is a row of RGB LEDs inside the helmet above the chin bar. These glow upward, providing simple visual cues to the rider, all driven by the smartphone app. A green sweep from left to right means to make a right turn, for example. An inward sweep of orange means an accident ahead. A quick blink of red means the camera is activated.
That 1080p camera is built into the chin and can be used to automatically record incidents. It can also be manually toggled for highlights, which are stored on a microSD card. A separate, wireless controller mounts to the handlebars of the bike and allows the rider to toggle the camera, phone and navigation with a thumb press. For now, that’s the only way to give the helmet commands while on the bike.
While the electronics are within the shell of the helmet, including a rechargeable, ceramic battery, they do not compromise the crucial foam that actually protects the rider’s head. This design not only ensures the maximum possible safety and performance in various international helmet certifications, but it also allows an element of reuse. Should a helmet be damaged in a crash or otherwise, the electronics can be ported over to a replacement.
This could reduce costs for some in the long-term. The upfront cost, however, is significant.
A new Forcite MK1S costs $1,099 in the United States. That compares to about $600 to $800 for a top-shelf helmet made by leading manufacturers like Shoei and Arai — manufacturers that Boyadgis and co tried to partner with.
“So, we actually went around to a lot of manufacturers asking them if they wanted to build one, and all of them were, like, ‘No, we’re very happy with the margins that we make on motorcycle helmets,'” he said.
Predictive aspirations
Most of the MK1S’s functionality is driven by the Forcite app, which for now draws its data from Here Technologies. Developers are reworking the app to use Mapbox (said to offer “a smoother, more polished experience” according to a Forcite rep). The Forcite app provides navigation and gives warnings of debris, crashes and even police, which are communicated to the rider via voice prompts and that strip of LEDs.
Interestingly, those in-helmet alerts work even if the rider isn’t actively navigating.
“It can endeavor to provide you with something that’s coming up on a realistic route ahead, not something that’s on a parallel road or on a road that’s disjunct from your current graph network,” Tom Larcher, Forcite’s senior development manager, said.
That’s just the beginning, according to Larcher. “Predicting a corner that is particularly hazardous is a great one,” he said, indicating that the app will soon look at factors like road conditions, historic incidents and even the motorcycle’s current speed, then warn riders if a given stretch of road is dangerous.
“Predictive AI will be used for that aspect of things,” Larcher said, successfully delivering the hottest buzzword of the moment during our interview.
The ultimate integration
Image Credits: Forcite
The long-term goal is to integrate not just the helmet and smartphone, but also the bike itself. Right now, most motorcycles are raw, simple machines compared to the rolling data factory of a modern car — software-defined vehicles with Ethernet backbones collecting hundreds of data points in real time.
Motorcycles, per Boyadgis, will get there soon.
“There’s definitely more sensors going on to bikes,” he said. “Advanced awareness systems will definitely become a common thing across the entire industry. We want to be that standardized interface.”
Forcite is working to define a new protocol for this kind of connectivity, something more reliable than the typical Bluetooth interfaces used for wireless accessories. Standards, though, are only as useful as those who support them.
For now, Forcite reps declined to identify which manufacturers are onboard for this idea, saying only that they’ve partnered with two brands for “deeper integration.”
Forcite has announced a partnership with Harley-Davidson Australia to “develop a next generation smart helmet and sensing system to preempt and identify hazards, such as debris and other road users and alert riders so they can take evasive action.”
In the world of motorcycling, it doesn’t get much more significant than H-D.
CEO Boyadgis says we won’t see this technology on motorcycles until 2026 at the earliest and hopes to integrate the necessary protocols into Forcite’s helmets as soon as next year.
“What we’re trying to do is work out a way where we get permission from a few manufacturers, both Japanese and Italian, to be able to pair with their bikes without something that they’re selling,” he said.
Next-gen bells and whistles
Other forthcoming advances will be more focused on lifestyle, including an in-helmet voice assistant capable of handling commands like, “Hey, Forcite: contact the first four people I know who ride a Ducati in my area, and then make a route that utilizes that style bike so we all meet up at a Mexican restaurant in time for lunch.”
Boyadgis wants to deploy this “collaborative ride experience” within the next two years, where the helmet becomes a real partner on the bike.
Forcite’s physical offerings will also evolve, including new models optimized for different types of riding, like a retro-styled helmet for cruisers, a flip-up model for the touring crowd and a visored adventure-style helmet.
Markets and money
To get there, the company will need to raise funds. Forcite closed AU$6.6 million in funding in December to drive the expansion into U.S. distribution. The company is now moving into a Series B capital round to raise capital that will fund those future helmet designs as well as the necessary research and development for all those app advancements.
Forcite is focused particularly on the U.S. market and plans to ship more than 10,000 units next year. The brand has already shipped 5,000, roughly 3,000 going to the company’s home Australian market.
But, Boyadgis says, the potential is to go much higher: “Let’s take a brand like an Arai or a Shoei across the United States; they’re selling in excess of, like, 50,000 units. So, that’s where we want to get to.”
The question, though, is whether Forcite’s more high-tech, high-price lids will speak to the same audience as the simple, comfortable, relatively affordable helmets from familiar, respected brands.
Motorcycling is, for many, a rejection of the complexity and claustrophobia of motoring.
Even Boyadgis has simplified his own daily Forcite experience, using it as a dashcam but not using it for navigation. “I do have it connected in the background, but I only have, like, police and speed camera alert — not that I speed or anything. But, they are pretty useful things if I’m going around a bend or something and I need to slow down. So, it really depends on, like, how much you want to use it, right?”
Whether Forcite can challenge the established brands or convince traditional motorcyclists to spend more money remains to be seen. However, there are early indications that Forcite is on the right track. The excitement around the failed Skully AR-1 product showed there’s an appetite for a smarter helmet. And the hunger still appears to be intact; Forcite’s shipments have already outpaced Skully’s.

"Singapore’s ride-hailing firm Grab lays off over 1,100 employees ",Kate Park,2023/06/23,"
On-demand startups in Asia raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors over the last several years to scale and compete heavily in ridesharing, alternative transport, delivery and a supersized range of related and unrelated services. Now comes the reckoning. 
This week, Southeast Asian supper app ride-hailing and food delivery app operator Grab laid off more than a thousand people, or about 11% of its staff, its first big layoffs since 2020.
Grab — which offers services in Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and Myanmar — said it will make severance payments of half a month for every six months of completed service. It also will provide medical insurance coverage through to the end of 2023, as well as career transition consultations, among other measures, for those impacted.
The cuts come about a month after Grab — which trades on the Nasdaq exchange in the U.S. — reported quarterly results that indicated slowing user growth and user spend amid an ongoing net loss, as well as the departure of its co-founder from the business. 
In a memo to staff, CEO and co-founder Anthony Tan downplayed the move as a cost-cutting measure merely aimed at profitability; instead he framed the move as right-sizing in reaction to changes in technology, the state of the capital markets and competition.
“We must adapt to the environment in which we operate,” he wrote in the letter, published online. “Change has never been this fast. Technology such as Generative AI is evolving at breakneck speed. The cost of capital has gone up, directly impacting the competitive landscape.” The group has publicly committed to being “Group Adjusted EBITDA breakeven” by the end of this financial year.
But it’s been aiming for that goal without major cuts to its expenses. Unlike its big competitors in the region Sea and GoTo (the parent company of GoJek), Grab held off from making layoffs in the last year. Last September, its chief operating officer Alex Hungate told Reuters that Grab doubled down on that commitment, despite weakening market conditions. 
Prior to this week’s news, the last time Grab laid off workers was in 2020: It cut 360 jobs during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, when business for all ride-hailing companies globally fell off a cliff. At the time, those cuts worked out to less than 5% of its staff.
By comparison, GoTo laid off 600 employees in March of this year to improve its profitability after cutting 1,300 jobs, or 12% of its workforce, seven months prior to that to preserve cash. 
Although Tan didn’t want to point to profitability as a main goal, the cuts might be seen as a response to some of the lackluster metrics in its last earnings, which have manifested elsewhere: The company has been getting hammered in the markets.
When Grab went public in December 2021 by way of a SPAC, it did so having raised more than $10 billion in outside funding as a startup — with investors including SoftBank’s Vision Fund when its spending exuberance was at its peak, as well as strategic backers like Hyundai — and a valuation of $40 billion. Today, however, the company’s market cap is between $12 and $13 billion.
Another challenge has been heavy, ongoing price competition with rivals, which plays out not just as promotions for consumers, but incentives for drivers, too.
And a third challenge might well be the size of the business. Grab has amassed a large grab-bag of services over the years in its quest to build a “super app” providing any and all services to its consumers. Most recently, the Singapore on-demand firm acquired the Philippine-based motorcycle taxi platform Move It in 2022, a Malaysian supermarket chain Jaya Grocer and Indonesian digital payment platform OVO in 2021.
Grab has not ruled out what else it might do to “adapt” to today’s market, including divestments, sunsetting services or indeed further layoffs.
“The primary goal of this exercise is to strategically reorganize ourselves so that we can move faster, work smarter and rebalance our resources across our portfolio in line with our longer-term strategies,” Tan said.

Joyful Ventures debuts with $23M focused on investment in sustainable protein startups,Christine Hall,2023/06/27,"
The alternative protein sector has seen a lot of movement in the past week, including U.S. regulators approving both Upside Foods and Good Meat to sell their cultivated chicken products for the first time in the country.
Poised to help thriving startups in this sector is a new venture capital fund called Joyful Ventures, which just closed $23 million of its $25 million fund. Advisors and investors include Björn Öste, co-founder of Oatly; Dr. Sandhya Sriram, CEO of Shiok Meats; Ryan Bethencourt, co-founder of Indie Bio and CEO of Wild Earth; and Arturo Elizondo, CEO of EVERY.
The woman and LGBTQIA+-led fund is co-founded by Jennifer Stojkovic, founder of the Vegan Women Summit; Milo Runkle, co-founder of The Good Food Institute; and Blaine Vess, co-founder of edtech startup Student Brands. All are general partners of Los Angeles–based Joyful Ventures.
To learn more about the fund and how the trio plan to drive climate solutions, we spoke with Stojkovic, who told TechCrunch that the fund will invest at the pre-seed and seed stages into startups that have strong B2B opportunities and are innovating technologies, including plant-based, precision fermentation, mycoproteins, molecular agriculture and cultivated technologies.
The company has already made two investments from the fund, including New School Foods, which raised $12 million earlier this year to make plant-based salmon, and Orbillion Bio, a company making cultivated Wagyu beef and other products.
The following conversation was lightly edited for length and clarity.
TC: What inspired the three of you to start Joyful Ventures?
JS: There is still a lack of awareness when it comes to the impact of food. We’re going to build the next big era of great startups, in my opinion, by unlocking the investment potential. There’s billions and billions of dollars of VC dry powder out there. I read about 50% is earmarked for climate, and some VCs are very interested in climate, but most of the ones I speak to don’t know the connection.
Why focus specifically on sustainable proteins?
When we say sustainable protein, we’re really talking about the broader food ecosystem and how it relates to it. We’re looking at everything from how to reduce the water footprint or improve the texturing of the plant protein crop, all the way to the end product on the grocery shelf. The protein aspects are where the driver of emissions is, but the type of widespread change that’s going to need to happen in the system to support transitioning toward, it’s myriad.
We need to be thinking holistically: What are the different mechanisms and levers that need to be pulled to actually transform the system? It’s not as simple as making a product and they’ll show up. How do we get the cost down? That’s going to be investing in the larger agriculture system.
What was the fundraising environment like? How long did it take you to raise the fund?
Terrible! It is June and we started our close in November. That gives you an idea of how long it took to get the first bit of investments in. It’s been tough. We are feeling incredibly elated to be able to even have a double-digit fund like this. That is such a rarity these days. And then of course, there has been back-and-forth about the future of the (alternative protein) space.
The Cargills of the world and the bigger entities, the ones with hundreds of years of scale on how we produce food on the planet, are coming to the table now and saying, “No, this wasn’t just a blip during the pandemic.” Those are the types of folks that we’re talking to, and that is the type of viewpoint that we have. This is a long game. If you’re looking to make a quick buck, food is not it, but if you are looking to make enduring sustainable change that could quite literally save the planet, we’re your team.

VCs remain confident alternative protein has a real future despite public-market woes

What were some of the concerns your LPs had?
Inflation has been a big part of it. There’s very real challenges at the grocery store. There’s going to be an unfortunate reality where brands are not going to be able to sell at the price point that consumers are able to pay right now. If you’re a widespread protein manufacturer, you have a massive portfolio and can play with the numbers. But if you’re a newer startup, you don’t have that kind of ability to change your exposure.
With Upside Foods and Good Meat moving kind of to the next stage, do you feel like this is continuing to move in the right direction?
Absolutely. This is huge. We’ve got the products being sold in Singapore for the last two years. Now we’ve got the United States, which is arguably the biggest, depending on which metric to use, meat market in the world, ready to serve to consumers potentially by the end of 2023. You need a market like America to shake things up. You’re going to see a lot more countries coming as soon as America does that. Things could start snowballing pretty quickly.
What are you looking for in an investment?
We’re investing in founders that are in it for the long haul. We’re not investing in founders that just heard that the alternative protein was a hot space to be in. We look for people that understand what it takes to disrupt a 100-year-old system, and for companies that are not only making food ingredients that can eliminate animals, but, for example, also can serve high-end cosmetic companies. I believe that for this industry, one of the most important things that we do is build companies that have multiple revenue streams. The margins you can make on a high-end cosmetic could be 90%, which allows for you to build in the pricing for the food commodity that you also need to serve.
Why should founders pick you as their investment partner?
We are geographically agnostic and looking at companies all over the world. We are also very conscious to avoid the hype. We have looked at hundreds of deals since we closed the round, and we are extremely thorough with our process and what types of opportunities we’re looking at.
In addition, Blaine is a two-time exited founder who built his own company from the ground up as CEO, so we have the chops to really understand who are the founders that take it to the finish line.

Unshackled Ventures secures another $35M to invest in immigrant founders,Christine Hall,2023/06/27,"
Despite a challenging fundraising environment, venture funds able to prove their thesis are continuing to see interest from limited partners.
Unshackled Ventures is the latest venture capital firm to close on a new fund, its third, with $35 million in capital commitments toward pre-seed investments in immigrant founders. It’s been a while since TechCrunch profiled the firm, founded by Manan Mehta and Nitin Pachisia, and boy has the firm been busy. In addition to deploying over $35 million into 80 companies, Unshackled Ventures has provided over 200 founders with visa sponsorship, immigration support and resources.
When talking about the fundraising environment today versus 2019 when the second fund was announced, Pachisia said it took 18 months to secure capital for the third fund compared to around six months for each of the previous funds. He noted that the environment shifted about halfway after he and Mehta began speaking with LPs “but that it brought us closer to the right kind of LPs that we aligned with.”
Indeed, Fund III more than doubles the firm’s assets under management, Mehta and Pachisia told TechCrunch, and garnered 73% of its funding from institutional investors, including Cambridge Associates, Cendana, Emerson Collective, California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank and Sorenson Impact Advisory.
“A lot of Fund III represents what Fund I was founded for, which are the problems that we faced nine years ago,” Mehta said. “If we provide immigrants with friends-and-family capital support, we believe that we can preserve the American promise and honestly as a venture capital firm, invest in a talent pool that otherwise was overlooked. Immigrants are some of the greatest job creators, and in this country, that’s why we keep on believing as a national advantage, this population is in the American best interest.”

Unshackled Ventures has $20M to invest exclusively in immigrant founders

In 2023, 781,000 foreign workers registered for 85,000 H-1B visa lottery slots, more than double the registrations for the previous year. Unshackled Ventures wants to be able to help more immigrants in this situation, and along with the fund, will begin a program called Eighteen150, a founder-in-residence program, on July 18 to support more immigrant entrepreneurs regardless of their immigration status.
Though Mehta and Pachisia didn’t want to disclose much more on the program just yet, they did say the firm is dedicating $5 million out of Fund III for the program to provide complete immigration and employment support, offering founders $150,000 or 18 months of runway, for 10% ownership.
Meanwhile, Unshackled Ventures has already made 18 investments with Fund III, including Masa Finance, a web3 identify infrastructure layer; Cache Energy, a long-duration energy storage company; and Formally, a generative AI legal tech company.
“The core of it all is backing people when they are ready to jump into their entrepreneurial journeys,” Pachisia said. “One of the trends that we might be bucking a little bit in VC is, as funds get larger, usually investors move later-stage and want to write bigger checks. We’re moving earlier to realize our true advantage lies in that earliest phase of joining the founder when they’re ready to go.”

Y Combinator-backed 0pass seeks to replace passwords in the enterprise,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/27,"
Several years ago, Noah Stanford teamed up with Michael Melone to found 0pass, a startup that aims to make it easier for companies to replace usernames and passwords with biometrics, like Touch ID and Face ID.
Relatively quickly, 0pass gained the attention of investors, including Y Combinator, recently closing a $3.5 million seed round led by Brett Gibson at Initialized Capital with participation from Y Combinator, Box Group, 645 Ventures and angel investors.
Prior to starting 0pass, Stanford joined SpaceX as a security engineer, leading the identity and authentication team. After helping to roll out authentication across SpaceX, he sought to commercialize the tooling he’d built at his previous employer.
“The primary difference between 0pass and other passwordless solutions is that 0pass is able to address passwordless login for all systems under one umbrella rather than just a subset,” Stanford explained. “This means that 0pass is able to handle passwordless login for Windows, Linux, Mac, remote access and websites — fully within the cloud or completely air-gapped.”
0pass’ products, which are available in on-premise and fully managed flavors, enable companies to enroll their employees into hardware authentication devices and biometric authentication such as Windows Hello and Touch ID. The company’s tooling, which uses private keys stored in secure hardware modules, enforces biometrics for access to workstations, apps and web apps and servers — allowing admins to manage authentication methods and tie user identity to security keys.

“0pass can integrate with private infrastructure, operating systems, identity providers and any user directories or certificate authorities,” Stanford explained. “Keys are tied to certificates to connect employee identity for authorization.”
0pass competes with a growing number of startups in the passwordless authentication market, which Statista projects will be worth $53.6 billion in 2030. Descope, a “developer-first” authentication and user management platform, recently emerged from stealth with $53 million in funding. There’s also Stytch, an API-first passwordless startup, and Magic, which offers “plug and play,” enterprise-oriented passwordless tech.
Fortunately for 0pass, demand remains strong for passwordless technologies. In a recent survey by Axiad, 82% of respondents — developers and IT and cybersecurity professionals — say that moving to passwordless authentication is in their top five priorities. One motivation? The potential cost savings. According to one source, organizations can save millions by switching to passwordless authentication — thanks to fewer data breaches and password resets, to name a few possible plusses.
As of May 2020, 150 million people were using passwordless logins each month, per a Microsoft report.
“Senior leadership is having to rethink how to secure accounts as traditional methods are repeatedly compromised,” Stanford said. “Taking a completely different approach and changing how every individual at the company logs in is a C-suite directive. Instead of adding more steps and complexity to employee logins, passwordless represents a new paradigm and addresses one of the largest security risks an organization faces.”
0pass moved out of private beta recently, and plans to onboard its first batch of enterprise customers in the coming weeks. Stanford says the company, which has four employees (possibly eight by the end of the year), has at least “several years” of runway, and will spend the proceeds from the round on product development and customer acquisition.

Data security startup Cyera lands a $100M investment,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/27,"
A trend accelerated by the mass move to digital during the pandemic, enterprises are having to handle an increasing amount of proprietary data. According to one survey, the average company deals with 63% growth in data volume per month, with 12% of respondents reporting a whopping 100% growth.
As the amount of data grows, it becomes tougher for organizations to keep track of it — and ensure that it remains secure. Seeking to protect it, Yotam Segev and Tamar Bar-Ilan, who met several years ago in the Israel Defense Forces, co-founded Cyera, a platform intended to provide companies greater visibility over their sensitive data.
Demonstrating the enthusiasm around such solutions, Cyera today closed a $100 million Series B funding round led by Accel, with participation from Sequoia, Cyberstarts and Redpoint Ventures. The round brings Cyera’s total raised to $160 million, which Segev, who serves as Cyera’s CEO, says will be put toward investing in engineering talent and R&D.
The funding is all the more impressive in the context of the broader cybersecurity landscape, which — once bright — has been dimming slightly, at least in terms of the VC investments floating around. Funding for cybersecurity startups dropped 58% in Q1 2023 compared to Q1 2022, with deal flow dipping to 149 deals — the lowest in years and down 45% year-over-year, according to CrunchBase.
“The move to distributed work and software-as-a-service (SaaS) collaboration platforms during the pandemic has accelerated the need for effective data security, and highlighted the shortcomings of legacy solutions to keep pace with data creation, sprawl and evolution in the cloud era,” Segev told TechCrunch in an email interview. “By providing that deep context and understanding of the data a company manages, and providing detailed insight and remediations for security, privacy and compliance exposures, Cyera is revolutionizing data security.”
Cyera falls into the category of platforms known as data security posture management (DSPM), which attempt to abstract away and automate common data detection and protection practices — particularly in the cloud. The past several years have seen a fair number of DSPM startups emerge from stealth, like Laminar Security, Dig Security, Sentra, BigID and Varonis.
The rise has coincided not only with the growth in data under enterprise management, but with the climbing adoption of the cloud and cloud technologies. According to a recent O’Reilly poll, 90% of organizations reported using cloud computing in 2021 — an increase from 88% in 2020. Gartner predicts, meanwhile, that by 2027, more than 50% of enterprises will adopt industry cloud platforms — platforms with features and services tailored to industries such as healthcare, logistics and retail — to accelerate their business initiatives.

So what makes Cyera stand apart from the sea of DSPM vendors out there? Segev asserts that the platform has a wider — and more holistic — focus than most.
“DSPM startups … have limited capabilities,” Segev said. “Legacy vendors attempting to ‘bolt on’ DSPM capability are architecturally flawed and can’t scale the way Cyera does. Cyera has differentiated itself from the slew of DSPM vendors in the space by focusing on an AI-powered data security platform to protect all of a company’s data, everywhere.”
To that end, Cyera leverages an OpenAI large language model (via OpenAI’s API) to deliver context around the data that a company manages. (In recent weeks, Microsoft and Google have similarly launched products that tap language models to help contextualize security issues.) The model can discover, classify and identify different types of data, providing an understanding of what a company’s data represents (e.g. the role is serves and the region where it’s from).
At a higher level, Cyera spotlights exposures, posture issues and risks associated with overly permissive access to data.
A recent addition to the suite, Cyera offers a browser extension that anonymizes sensitive data typed into OpenAI’s AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT — timely in light of company bans of ChatGPT over privacy concerns. SafeType attempts to automatically detect sensitive data in prompts, stopping it (at least in theory) from being sent to ChatGPT.
“We provide complete cloud data security coverage across software-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service and infrastructure-as-a-service environments, with on-prem support coming in 2024,” Segev added. “The result is cloud data security that enables businesses to be more agile and innovative while mitigating risk to reputation, customer loyalty and compliance stemming from data theft.”
Impressively, despite its relatively small (100-person) team, Cyera claims that it’s managed to gain “strong traction” among the S&P 500 in the two years since it launched. Cyera secured “double digit” new customers in Q4 2022 alone and an astounding 800% in revenue growth in 2022.
By the end of the year, Segev expects that the staff will grow to 150 people.
“Cyera’s agentless technology and novel technical innovations to streamline and accelerate data store inventory creation and data classification ensure that businesses will have the confidence that they always know what data they have, where it is located and what it represents,” Segev said. “Because Cyera’s process is automatic and continuous, security teams are empowered with up-to-date context and understanding of sensitive data exposure, as well as insight into how to best partner with the business to address and remediate risk.”

Socure acquires identity verification startup Berbix for $70M,Frederic Lardinois,2023/06/27,"
Socure, the identity verification service that raised a massive $450 million Series E round at a $4.5 billion valuation during the heady fundraising days of late 2021 (and $100 million earlier in 2021), today announced that it has acquired identity verification service Berbix for $70 million in cash and stock transactions. Berbix previously raised a total of $11.6 million, including a $9 million Series A round led by Mayfield in 2020.
This marks Socure’s first acquisition.
Founded in 2018, Berbix focuses on verifying users’ identities by checking scanned IDs in real time. Using its patent-pending forensics engine, Berbix can help businesses detect fake IDs to reduce fraud and ensure compliance with local regulations.
Socure’s platform, meanwhile, takes a slightly broader and multi-dimensional approach that includes both active and passive means to deter fraud in a wide range of sectors, ranging from e-commerce to healthcare.
“From a product perspective, Socure is moving with a high velocity into new markets and new geographies, covering e-commerce marketplaces, gig economy, public sector and healthcare, among others,” Socure founder and CEO Johnny Ayers said. “We are finding repeatedly that there is a need for best-in-class active and passive — documentary and non-documentary — identity verification and fraud controls to solve very complex fraud and customer acquisition challenges.”
He noted that Socure’s customers are asking for the ability to check IDs online that, combined with the company’s existing tools, can help them ensure that, for example, a driver applying to a grocery delivery service is who they say they are.
“Our combined solution is easily quantifiable in terms of speed, accuracy and fraud capture which equate to immediate revenue lift and spend reduction,” said Ayers.
He also noted that Socure is in a good position to make an acquisition like this. He noted that Socure’s revenue grew over 50% in 2022, all while other companies in the space were flat to down. “We are looking to be offensive where it makes sense,” he said. “There are a number of companies that made some very interesting investments in innovation in the past couple of years, but unfortunately don’t have the runway or access to capital to continue independently. It makes sense to continue assessing what is in the market.”
Socure already integrated Berbix in its existing Predictive Document Verification service, which is launching version 3.0 today. The updated service combines Berbix’s forensics engine for spotting fake IDs with Socure’s image capture app and user experience. The company notes that while users can use the document verification service as a stand-alone application, it’s also integrated into the overall Socure platform.
This acquisition is part of a wider trend we’ve been seeing, with well-funded startups capitalizing on their ability to acquire companies that may have a hard time raising the next funding round and/or justifying their previous valuations.
“The cost of capital in the last 18 months for most companies has gone from single digit to 20-30% or more, which we expect will mean a lot of really great assets are coming to market trying to find a home in the winner in a given space,” said Ayers. “We are seeing that every venture fund is bucketing their portfolio into categories of ‘great,’ ‘good,’ ‘ok’ or ‘not good’ — and anything that’s good or less, they’re going to be more open to trade previously overpriced private stock to a much higher quality stock with higher upside and shorter-term liquidity within the winner of a market. We expect there to be individual point solutions that are just never going to get big enough to be a long-term independent company.”

"Zenarate, an AI-powered agent coaching platform, raises $15M",Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/27,"
While running a 5,000-agent contact center, Brian Tuite often experienced the problem of having to train new agents on the basics. The way he tells it, they weren’t prepared for success — and drained the contact center’s resources.
That gave Tuite the idea of creating what he describes as “simulation training” for customer service agents. After pitching it to Rab Govil, he and Govil decided to turn the concept into a company — Zenarate.
“Zenarate is an AI simulation training platform,” Tuite explained to me in an email interview. “It’s a ‘flight simulator’ for customer and prospect-facing agents, where agents in training are immersed in life-like conversation, screen and chat simulations to master high-impact topics they’ll face with live customers and prospects.”
Using Zenarate’s AWS-hosted platform, service agents engage with an “AI coach” that gives them feedback on their tone and soft skills — making suggestions where appropriate. Agents get a scorecard showing that they’ve mastered certain areas and met baseline requirements, like transitioning from service to sales, juggling multiple chats at once and addressing a customer by name.
The AI coach can present random call scenarios, forcing agents to think on their feet. Or customer service managers can assign particular scenarios to particular agents and teams.
“There’s no IT integration for agents to roleplay with the AI coach from the home or office,” Tuite said, touting what he sees as the benefits of Zenarate’s platform. “The only IT requirements are a Chrome or Edge browser and a headset. And there’s no personal or account information for testing or implementation, as all the content is fictitious training data.”
Of course, Zenarate isn’t particularly unique in the market for sales and agent training software — a market that Polaris Research predicts will be worth $7.74 billion by 2032. Rival Vervoe similarly provides “AI-powered” software that agents can use to prep for different types of live calls. So does Second Nature, which attracted an investment from Zoom’s Apps Fund early last year.
I’m also wary of the ways in which companies like Zenarate apply AI, which could open the door to bias — intentional or no. For example, studies have shown that some AI trained to detect toxicity sees phrases in African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) — the informal grammar used by some Black Americans — as disproportionately “toxic.” It’s not tough to imagine a scenario in which a Black customer service agent repeatedly scores lower than a white agent on a certification test because of the vernacular they use. (No need to imagine; it happens.)
Zenarate claims that its AI isn’t biased. But beyond assuring me that the platform’s AI models are trained with each client’s “best and required practice” data and that clients are charged with overseeing the model training, Tuite didn’t offer much in the way of details about Zenarate’s bias mitigation measures — assuming that it takes any.

If investors share these concerns, they aren’t showing it. Zenarate today announced that it raised $15 million in a funding round led by Volition Capital with participation from a number of undisclosed angel investors.
According to Volition’s Sean Cantwell, Zenarate’s positive unit economics were the winning factor; annual recurring revenue is sitting at “double digits,” currently, driven by an over-80-company-strong customer base with “over a million” users.
“There’s a significant growth opportunity to disrupt legacy passive training methods with the power of simulation training,” Cantwell added. “AI-powered simulation is the new standard in customer service and sales training, and Zenarate is leading the trend.”
Palo Alto-based Zenarate plans to spend the bulk of the new capital — which brings its total capital raised to $18 million — on expanding its workforce from 92 employees to 110 by the end of the year.

Redpanda nabs $100M Series C as streaming service experiences significant growth,Ron Miller,2023/06/27,"
Redpanda helps companies capture data in real time in a modern context, providing a new way to stream data while maintaining backwards compatibility with Kafka, the popular open source streaming project.
Today, the company announced a $100 million Series C, just 16 months after announcing a $50 million Series B. This kind of trajectory was common a couple of years ago, but seeing a company raise $150 million in such a quick succession these days has become far more rare.
CEO Alex Gallego says the company has been performing so well that existing investors stepped up with the additional investment, seizing the opportunity to capitalize on the startup’s startling growth.
“We’re basically oversubscribed on this round, and I know you mentioned that in this climate, it’s been hard to raise money, but the reason for this is that we quintupled our revenue last year and doubled the size of the company — and we literally haven’t lost the deal in seven months against all the competitors,” Gallego told TechCrunch.
At the time of the Series B, Gallego described the appeal of the product his startup has created this way:
“What’s happened in the market is that streaming is now the foundational part of how to build new modern applications. It sits as the bottom layer on which to build new applications. And for that you need unification, and what I mean by that is you need limitless data retention. And so that feature alone actually changed how the market perceived and how developers think about real-time data.”
He says that it turned out that this idea has resonated with the market, perhaps even better than he envisioned when he launched the company in 2019. “We’re one of the few technologies where the CIO looks great, because they cut their bill in half, developers love the technology and there’s basically zero cost to migrate from Kafka into Redpanda,” he said.
He says as the company has been growing so quickly, he needs the capital infusion to begin to expand in three areas, including go-to-market, scaling to meet the needs of larger customers and customer support. What’s more, the infinite data retention that the platform allows becomes more important as companies are building large language models, which has also pushed the company’s growth.
Customers currently include Cisco, Akamai, Lacework and Vodafone, among others.
The company had around 60 employees in February 2022. Today, it has 160 and is actively hiring, according to Gallego. He says as a Latino leader, he is cognizant of the need to build a diverse workforce and is working to do so as he scales the company, starting with the leadership team and working from there.
Today’s round was led by a trio of returning investors: Lightspeed Venture Partners, GV and Haystack VC.
"
CalypsoAI raises $23M to add guardrails to generative AI models,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/27,"
Companies are increasingly embracing generative AI. But they’re not necessarily considering all the blockers and challenges that come along with folding the tech into their existing workflows.
In one recent survey by KPMG, 90% of businesses said that they had “moderate to highly significant” concerns about the risks of using generative AI and doubts about how to mitigate those risks. Only 6%, meanwhile, said that they felt that their company had a mature AI governance program in place.
It’s partly for these reasons that Neil Serebryany founded CalypsoAI, a startup developing software to test, validate and monitor internally developed as well as third-party AI apps prior to their deployment.
“CalypsoAI’s platform promotes the power and competitive advantage that using AI can bring but within a safe, secure and reliable way,” Serebryany told TechCrunch in an email interview.
That’s setting the bar high. But investors evidently believe in CalypsoAI’s ability to deliver. The startup today announced that it raised $23 million in a Series A-1 round led by Paladin Capital Group with participation from Lockheed Martin Ventures, Hakluyt Capital and Expeditions Fund.
Notable angels contributed to the A-1 tranche as well, including former YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki and her sister, 23andMe co-founder Anne Wojcicki. To date, CalypsoAI has raised $38.2 million.
CalypsoAI claims that its tools — deployed as a container within an organization’s infrastructure — allow businesses to monitor and shape the usage of large language models such as ChatGPT via dashboards that show stats related to the toxicity of the models, user engagement and more. Serebryany says that CalypsoAI can prevent sensitive company data from being shared on models while identifying attacks coming from generative AI tools.
“While every company wants to reap the benefits of generative AI solutions — namely the clear productivity gains — they also want to make sure they aren’t subject to cyberattacks and that employees don’t expose sensitive information to public models,” Serebryany added. “By implementing CalypsoAI, CISOs and IT leaders can start to seriously consider implementing generative AI solutions across their organizations in a safe and secure manner — allowing them to introduce efficiencies into their business without the added risk.”
Certainly, there’s demand in the corporate sector for some sort of generative AI guardrail solution. Out of fear that employees might accidentally expose proprietary info, companies including Apple, JPMorgan Chase and Verizon have banned or restricted the use of ChatGPT-like tools internally. Many of these same companies are wary of generative AI’s toxicity and misinformation issues, which continue to plague even the best models available today.
The industry, eyeing the huge potential addressable market, has risen to meet the demand. Microsoft offers the Azure OpenAI Service, which provides governance and compliance capabilities on top of generative AI models from OpenAI, including ChatGPT. Elsewhere, Salesforce recently launched the Einstein Trust Layer, which attempts to prevent text-generating models from retaining sensitive data.
How well these guardrails work in practice is an open question, however. Putting one vendor’s claims into question, researchers recently uncovered flaws in NeMo Guardrails, Nvidia’s toolkit aimed at making AI-powered apps more accurate and secure, that allows the toolkit’s protections to be bypassed.
Serebryany insisted — for what it’s worth — that CalypsoAI’s products are robust to attack. In the same breath, he stressed that CalypsoAI doesn’t hold any data from its customers, instead only facilitating the info flow from employees into the model of a company’s choice.
“Securing LLMs in the enterprise has become a critical venture, which has led to CalypsoAI’s strategic shift to address the needs of enterprises looking to use AI solutions,” Serebryany said. “With many organizations looking to securely use generative AI solutions to propel their business forward, CalypsoAI feels confident about our ability to develop the best possible product and attract the best talent to secure enterprise organizations.”
Serebryany says that CalypsoAI will use the funding from the latest tranche to drive product development, hiring and the company’s go-to-market initiatives. CalypsoAI’s current headcount stands at 35 employees, and the startup recently opened an office in Dublin — a part of CalypsoAI’s plan to double its workforce over the next two years.
“As our company continues to grow and expand, we recognize the value of bringing on new investors to support our growth,” he continued. “By partnering with investors who share our vision and goals, we can continue to innovate and drive our business forward.”

Faros AI raises $20M to bring visibility to software engineering teams,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/27,"
Three years ago, Vitaly Gordon, one of the founding members of Salesforce’s Einstein research division, started Faros AI, a platform for software engineers designed to bring key operational data into one place. Alongside Shubha Nabar and Matthew Tovbin, two fellow ex-Salesforce employees and Einstein co-founders, Gordon sought to help developers better navigate common workflow challenges by shining a light on top bottlenecks.
“Our background was in building machine learning products and engineering teams, and we were motivated by our frustration with the black-box that was engineering operations,” Gordon told TechCrunch via email. “We found that while we were helping Salesforce customers harness AI to improve business outcomes, our visibility and insight into our own engineering processes was sorely lacking. And it wasn’t just us. Most sizable software engineering organizations today are largely flying blind.”
Word spread — and investors flocked. Faros today announced it raised $20 million in a Series A funding round led by Lobby Capital with participation from SignalFire, Salesforce Ventures and Operator Collective. Gordon says that the round, which brings Faros’ total raised to $36 million, will be put toward bolstering Faros’ go-to-market strategy, R&D and customer success initiatives.

According to Gordon, Faros “hadn’t touched” most of the cash from its previous fundraise. But the company ended up hitting milestones sooner than expected, tripling its customer base and quadrupling revenue over the past 12 months.
“Given the unprecedented opportunity to tap top talent and expand our go-to-market footprint, while everyone else is cutting costs and scaling back, we decided to move forward and raise additional capital,” Gordon said.
Faros as it exists today aims to provide a “single-pane” view across a software engineering team’s work, goals and velocity. Customers can connect various data sources to the platform, starting with out-of-the-box modules and benchmarks and then customizing and building their own analytics.
The idea behind Faros is to allow engineers, engineering team managers and the C-suite to measure an organization’s health and tech debt, as well as things like the dependencies between departments and bottlenecks in processes. The platform can break down time spent on feature development versus tech debt and measure the efficacy of onboarding processes, Gordon points out — plus track seniority and tenure by team, location and other dimensions.
“Software is eating the world and engineering becomes the highest budget item for every company,” Gordon said. “With Faros AI, companies no longer have to fly blind and teams can do more with less.”
I can’t speak to Faros’ effectiveness. But there’s some evidence to suggest that today’s software engineering teams do, indeed, lack visibility, to Gordon’s larger point.
Engineering management platform Jellyfish — not the most unbiased of sources in this area, granted — found in a recent survey that engineering and technical leaders underestimate the amount of time their teams end up spending on unplanned work by 81%. According to the same survey — which, again, must be taken with a grain of salt — teams using engineering management platforms dedicate 25% more time to innovation while spending 18% less time on customer support issues and bugs.
Another look at Faros’ platform capabilities. Image Credits: Faros
“While every tech company is seriously affected by the current market conditions, we are experiencing significant tailwinds from companies exploring how they can do more with less, and shifting their engineering resources to core functionality while looking to partner with vendors that can offload this undifferentiated work,” Gordon said.
A portion of the funding from Faros’ recent tranche will support the rollout of Lighthouse AI, Faros’ newly unveiled AI engine that allows users to gather insights about engineering operations from disparate systems — tapping natural language for data analysis. Gordon sees it as the natural evolution of Faros’ platform, enabling engineers to make sense of the vast amounts of data that their organizations generate each day.
“The AI revolution has only just begun,” Gordon said. “We anticipate that every aspect of software engineering is going to be transformed by AI in the next five years, and at Faros, we are making sure that operational intelligence keeps pace, allowing engineering organizations to make that transition with confidence.”
Faros currently has 35 employees and anticipates that number doubling in the next 12 months.

ShopZetu raises pre-seed funding to fuel growth of its fashion marketplace beyond Kenya,Annie Njanja,2023/06/27,"
Kenyan fashion e-commerce startup ShopZetu is set to add beauty and home décor categories to its portfolio, in response to the growing needs of the young and style-conscious women in Africa. This is as it currently scales regionally over the next few months while working to attract international fashion brands, and more than triple the number of vendors on its platform to 1,000.
The startup plans to trial regional delivery services in Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, scaling beyond Kenya, where it launched in 2021, on the backing of a $1 million pre-seed funding it has just closed.
“The goal is for ShopZetu to become the leading lifestyle platform. We are looking to expand our beauty, skincare, hair and home décor offerings, which are all expressions of one’s identity. We want to become a one-stop shop,” said Marvin Kiragu, ShopZetu CEO, who co-founded the startup with Wandia Gichuru, also co-founder of the popular Kenyan fashion brand Vivo.
The pre-seed round was led by Chui Ventures, with participation from Launch Africa, Roselake Ventures and Logos Ventures. Angel investors that took part in the round include Kendall Tang, the CEO of RT Knits; Ben Munoz, the co-founder and CEO of Nadine West; Sumit Bhasin of Estée Lauder Inc.; Patricia Ithau, the CEO of WPP Scangroup; and Peter Njonjo, the co-founder and CEO of Twiga Foods.

Jendaya raises funding to scale its Africa-focused luxury e-commerce platform

Kiragu told TechCrunch that ShopZetu was born out of the need for a multibrand marketplace to bridge a highly fragmented industry that has “hundreds of thousands of sellers” offline and online including on Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp. This, he noted, makes the shopping process cumbersome, lacking price visibility and customer trust.
He added that the infinite number of possible stock-keeping units makes it nearly impossible for any one player to house the available assortment under one physical location.
“ShopZetu seeks to solve this problem by aggregating the available supply of fashion and lifestyle products under one roof,” he said.
ShopZetu’s over 300 vendors, mainly made up of large and small local manufacturers, and traders of imported fashion products, have currently listed more than 20,000 products on the ShopZetu marketplace. Vendor onboarding is free, however, they pay a commission for sales generated on the platform, and for other additional services, including delivery.
“We also offer vendors a variety of services such as content, digital marketing, warehousing, last-mile delivery and returns management. These services are offered at a cost but are largely subsidized to ensure vendor success online,” said Kiragu.
“Our goal is to lower the barrier for anyone to start and scale a fashion brand leveraging ShopZetu’s reach and resources. We have good case studies of brands incubated and launched on ShopZetu and then go on to scale online and establish physical stores,” he said.
The startup requires vendors selling on the marketplace to, amongst other conditions, be well stocked, have high-quality products and inclusive-sizing.
The startup says it has in the past two years served over 30,000 customers, and sold more than 100,000 products, while achieving over 400% increase in monthly orders since January 2021.
ShopZetu says it is eyeing the growing fashion industry in sub-Saharan Africa, which is currently dominated by second-hand clothing. However, startups like ShopZetu are banking their growth on affordable new clothing options, and the growing fashion-conscious, tech savvy population in Africa.
“We believe the market for fashion is huge as clothing is a basic human need. While a big percentage of this is currently serviced by secondhand clothing, we are seeing a gradual shift to new clothing as more affordable options are introduced into the market,” said Kiragu.
“We believe that online fashion retail will leapfrog formal retail and become the largest e-commerce category in Africa.”

Dust uses large language models on internal data to improve team productivity,Romain Dillet,2023/06/27,"
Dust is a new AI startup based in France that is working on improving team productivity by breaking down internal silos, surfacing important knowledge and providing tools to build custom internal apps. At its core, Dust is using large language models (LLMs) on internal company data to give new superpowers to team members.
The company was co-founded by Gabriel Hubert and Stanislas Polu, who have known each other for more than a decade. Their first startup was called Totems and was acquired by Stripe in 2015. After that, they both spent a few years working for Stripe before parting ways.
Stanislas Polu joined OpenAI, where he spent three years working on LLMs’ reasoning capabilities while Gabriel Hubert became the head of product at Alan.
They teamed up once again to create Dust. Unlike many AI startups, Dust isn’t focused on creating new large language models. Instead, the company wants to build applications on top of LLMs developed by OpenAI, Cohere, AI21, etc.
The team first worked on a platform that can be used to design and deploy large language model apps. It has then focused its efforts on one use case in particular — centralizing and indexing internal data so that it can be used by LLMs.
From an internal ChatGPT to next-gen software
There are a handful of connectors that constantly fetch internal data from Notion, Slack, GitHub and Google Drive. This data is then indexed and can be used for semantic search queries. When a user wants to do something with a Dust-powered app, Dust will find the relevant internal data, use it as the context of an LLM and return an answer.
For example, let’s say you just joined a company and you’re working on a project that was started a while back. If your company fosters communication transparency, you will want to find information in existing internal data. But the internal knowledge base might not be up to date. Or it might be hard to find the reason why something is done this way, as it’s been discussed in an archived Slack channel.
Dust isn’t just a better internal search tool, as it doesn’t just return search results. It can find information across multiple data sources and format answers in a way that is much more useful to you. It can be used as a sort of internal ChatGPT, but it could also be used as the basis of new internal tools.
“We’re convinced that natural language interface is going to disrupt software,” Gabriel Hubert told me. “In five years’ time, it would be disappointing if you still have to go and click on edit, settings, preferences, to decide that your software should behave differently. We see a lot more of our software adapting to your individual needs, because that’s the way you are, but also because that’s the way your team is — because that’s the way your company is.”
The company is working with design partners on several ways to implement and package the Dust platform. “We think there are a lot of different products that can be created in this area of enterprise data, knowledge workers and models that could be used to support them,” Polu told me.
It’s still early days for Dust, but the startup is exploring an interesting problem. There are many challenges ahead when it comes to data retention, hallucination and all of the issues that come with LLMs. Maybe hallucination will become less of an issue as LLMs evolve. Maybe Dust will end up creating its own LLM for data privacy reasons.
Dust has raised $5.5 million (€5 million) in a seed round led by Sequoia with XYZ, GG1, Seedcamp, Connect, Motier Ventures, Tiny Supercomputer, and AI Grant. Several business angels also participated, such as Olivier Pomel from Datadog, Julien Codorniou, Julien Chaumond from Hugging Face, Mathilde Collin from Front, Charles Gorintin and Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve from Alan, Eléonore Crespo and Romain Niccoli from Pigment, Nicolas Brusson from BlaBlaCar, Howie Liu from Airtable, Matthieu Rouif from PhotoRoom, Igor Babuschkin and Irwan Bello.
If you take a step back, Dust is betting that LLMs will greatly change how companies work. A product like Dust works even better in a company that fosters radical transparency instead of information retention, written communication instead of endless meetings, autonomy instead of top-down management.
If LLMs deliver on their promise and greatly improve productivity, some companies will gain an unfair advantage by adopting these values as Dust will unlock a lot of untapped potential for knowledge workers.

Dexory nabs $19M to bring visibility to warehouses through analytics and autonomous robots,Paul Sawers,2023/06/27,"
Dexory, a company that serves warehouses with real-time inventory management data using AI software and autonomous robots, has raised $19 million in a Series A round of funding led by European VC Atomico.
Founded in London in 2015, Dexory’s product can be split into two segments. On the hardware side, the company develops robots replete with sensors and cameras to capture data as they traverse a particular warehouse, taking continuous photos of racks as they move at something akin to normal walking speed (e.g., a half-meter/second). The robots capture 3D scans of the site, which can give insights into things like dimensions, shapes and sizes, and volumes of goods sitting on shelves.
Dexory then uses computer vision and machine learning to process the captured data, while tying it to the physical location of the stock but inside a digital twin — that is, a complete virtual equivalent of its real-world counterpart.
“The robots can be deployed multiple times a day or once a day around their shift patterns, including overnight,” Dexory co-founder and CEO Andrei Danescu told TechCrunch over email. “The collection of data insights over a short space of time, all the time, allows analysis for identifying issues on-the-spot and decision making in driving warehouse operational efficiencies.”

Dexory says that its customers use its platform for any number of use cases, such as carrying out autonomous stock checks throughout the day, reducing the need for labor-intensive manual inventory counts. This can also be helpful for solving some of the common warehouse pain points, such as identifying misplaced pallets or other goods that have gone AWOL.
Instinctively, this will never be a perfect solution in every scenario, as it surely isn’t possible to see every item on a shelf, particularly if they’re stacked in rows or located high on shelves. But Danescu reckons that it will go most of the way toward solving at least some of the stock-check problems.
“If the goods are behind one another, the solution might not be able to identify exactly what the goods are — no label to read means nothing to identify of course,” Danescu said. “But due to the 3D scans, it will let the operators know that something else is there, and show them a picture of what that is, solving more than 80% of the problem.”
Moreover, stock checks aren’t the entire purpose for Dexory’s platform. It can also be used to keep tabs on space optimization — for instance, where there may be large gaps with nothing in it. Or it could be used to forecast capacity, or even as part of a company’s safety regulation compliance workflow, where it can spot any dangerous situations arising.
While there are countless robotics companies already infiltrating the retail sphere with similar smarts, including the likes of Bossa Nova, Simbe, and Zippedi, Danescu says they’re setting out to differentiate from the pack through its focus on larger warehouse-style environments, rather than retail stores — its robots can scan up to 15 meters (50 feet) high by physically expanding.
“We have new solutions on the roadmap to go beyond that (19–20m-plus), but that’s barely 2–3% of the market,” Danescu said.

Scaling
For now, Dexory operates in the U.K. and Ireland across the logistics and supply chain sectors; air cargo; retail and e-commerce; and manufacturing, with clients such as Menzies Aviation; Denso Manufacturing U.K., Huboo, and Maersk. Indeed, today’s news comes a week after Maersk revealed it was extending its partnership with Dexory to include more warehouses in the U.K. and Ireland area, after entering into an initial proof-of-concept partnership back in January shortly after Dexory had rebranded from BotsAndUs.
With its fresh cash injection, Dexory has now raised a total of $37.9 million across its various rounds, and it’s planning to scale its platform into new markets, including the U.S., Germany, and the Netherlands.
Aside from lead investor Atomico, Dexory’s Series A round included participation from early Facebook and Spotify investor Lakestar; Maersk Growth, the investment arm of Danish shipping and logistics giant (and Dexory customer) Maersk; London-based early-stage VC Kindred Capital; and Capnamic.

DePoly keeps hard-to-recycle plastic from ending up in landfills,Catherine Shu,2023/06/26,"
About 400 million tons of plastic are produced each year, but less than 10% is recycled, with most of the rest ending up incinerated or in landfills. One reason is that it is difficult for conventional recycling processes to handle contaminated plastics, like those that are made up of several different types of plastics, combined with other materials or those that are just plain dirty. DePoly, a deep tech startup, has developed a process that is able to tackle complex plastic streams and turn plastics back into raw material without affecting quality. The Swiss-based startup announced today it has raised $13.8 million in seed funding.
The round was co-led by BASF Venture Capital and Wingman Ventures, with participation from other investors like Beiersdorf, Infinity Recycling, CIECH Ventures and Angel Invest.
DePoly’s chemical recycling tech converts all PET plastics and polyester textiles back into their main raw chemical components, which are then sold back to the industry to make new items. DePoly says items made from its raw material are virgin quality.
The company currently operates a pilot plant that can process 50 tons per year of complex PET or polyester plastic streams. It serves such industries as post-consumer packaging, textiles, fashion and post-industrial streams. DePoly is building a showcase plant with a capacity of 500 tons to demonstrate its tech at commercial scale, and it already has five customers, ranging from fast-fashion brands, to sporting good brands and packaging users to resin producers.
DePoly was founded in 2020 by CEO Samantha Anderson, CTO Bardiya Valizadeh and CSO Christopher Ireland, and now has a team of 13 people. In the years before launching DePoly, the three moved to Switzerland to work on their PhDs and post-docs. Anderson told TechCrunch that there were a lot of articles being published about issues like microplastics in people, growing plastic patches in the ocean and animals washing up on shore with microplastics in their stomachs.

“For us, all this was quite alarming, particularly that companies seemed not to care about solving the problem now, not in 10 to 15 years,” Anderson said. “So we decided that we wanted to tackle the plastic problem, using chemistry and the skills we had developed during our degrees, with the aim of if we could make it work, to spin a company out and tackle the problem faster than others were moving.”
Conventional plastic recycling means things like bottles and food packaging made of PET and other plastics are brought to a recycling facility, then sorted into colors, cleaned, melted and turned into rPET pellets. But if they are too dirty, mixed with other plastics or in fabric or fiber form, they usually get incinerated or dumped into a landfill, Anderson said. There are also limits to what can be recycled because of health and food safety standards, which means the majority of plastic produced is destroyed or thrown away, and new plastic has to be made from crude oil.
DePloy’s chemical recycling tech operates at room temperature and standard pressure and does not need plastics and materials to be washed, pre-sorted, pre-melted or separated. This means it can be used to recycle PET and polyester materials that don’t make it into conventional recycling systems, including mixed plastics, mixed colors, dirty plastic waste streams, fabrics and fibers. PET is converted back into PTA and MEG, its original two monomers.
Anderson explained that DePoly has a B2B model, connecting users of complex plastic waste, like blended polyesters, multilayered PET items or PET items that are too dirty or chemically contaminated to be introduced into the mechanical recycling process, with people who produce virgin-quality PET items from oil because of limited accessibility to sustainable chemicals like PTA and MEG. DePoly’s tech allows one side to get rid of PET and other plastic waste, and the other side (or the producers) to have access to the original, sustainable chemicals that make up those items, creating a circular economy for plastics.
DePoly can also do content recovery. For example, it can recover PP or cotton from PP/PET combos or cotton/polyester blends. Anderson said this is because of the low temperature of its system, because it doesn’t melt polymers. The startup is also scaling tech for polyurethanes (PU), polylactic acid (PLA) and similar polymers like PBT.
As an example of how DePoly’s chemical recycling process has been used, Anderson said it’s worked with customers in the sporting goods industry that have polyurethane blended polyester items. The polyurethane content means those items would usually be discarded, but DePoly is able to fully recycle them and is now scaling its tech to recover the polyurethane portion.
Anderson cites startups Carbios, Gr3n and Ioniqa as other companies that are doing similar work with plastics, and says she thinks “the tech they’ve developed is really neat.” The main way DePoly differentiates itself is the reaction that occurs during its recycling process, the product output in Ioniqa’s case, the temperature required for the reaction and the contamination threshold allowed. “In our case, we’re lower temperature, produce the same monomers that make up PET and to our understanding have a higher contamination threshold versus others.”
In a statement about the investment, Wingman Ventures principal Antonia Albert said, “We are extremely proud to support DePoly since day one on their journey to tackle this planetary crisis to clean our oceans and landfills from plastic waste and to welcome leading investors from the chemicals, recycling, climate- and deep tech space on board to build the global leader for the sustainable plastics recycling.”

Supply chain startup Baskit supports Indonesia’s middlemen,Catherine Shu,2023/06/26,"
Large brand distributors dominate the top of the supply chain, but toward the bottom, there are thousands of middlemen, including wholesalers, who are the ones creating relationships with retailers. Founded last year, Baskit wants to provide them with tools to digitize the management of their inventory and services to help them get better prices. The Indonesia-based startup announced today it has raised $3.3 million for its seed round, from investors including Betatron, Forge, 1982, Investible, DS/X, Orvel and Michael Sampoerna. This follows a $1.5 million seed round three months ago.
Founder Yann Schuermans said he is a “very big believer in the space. Supply chains are fundamental to the economies of every major economy in Southeast Asia, as anywhere from 40% to 50% of their GDP are dependent on supply chains. Eventually they have to modernize and digitize.”
Baskit currently works with more than 50 wholesalers, predominantly in West Java. Schuermans noted that supply chains in emerging markets are very fragmented, especially in Indonesia, which has a complicated geography with thousands of islands. As a result, a supply chain is not as simple as getting goods from point A to point B. Middlemen are necessary, he said, because supply chains start with a manufacturer and distributors, then the smaller distributors and wholesalers who sell to retailers.
“All of these guys in the middle are so critical with their relationships and connectivity to their communities,” he added. “Their kids go to school with the kids of shop owners who are buying their product.”
Wholesalers often don’t have exclusivity to brands, operating more like traders by buying products they can sell at higher prices. Instead of striving to cut out the role of middlemen from supply chains, Baskit provides them with several layers of tools to grow their businesses. This includes software that helps them digitize their operations and bring inventory online.

Schuermans said Baskit differentiates from other supply chain startups because those often focus on creating ERP software for the upper enterprise part of supply chains, like big brand distributors who do tens of millions of dollars a month in turnover. In contrast, Baskit’s software helps middlemen by organizing their warehouses and inventory, giving them visibility into pricing, missing goods or items that are aging. Then their inventory is connected to an ordering system, so customers who were previously buying goods through offline processes can do so online through a catalog.
Baskit also offers customer service that helps wholesalers source better products and pricing from manufacturers.
“The best way to describe our business is a hybrid between software digitization partner, but with a very commercial kind of service provider angle where we provide in that respect, we almost look like a marketplace,” Schuermans said. “We help to connect the buyers and sellers, but it’s a very tightly managed marketplace.” Ultimately, Baskit’s goal is to make the middlemen in supply chains more attractive partners to the organizations at the top, including big manufacturers and brand owners.
“Inventory is the gold standard here, because when I have the data, I have information on pricing, I know how much product there is available. I know what products are moving fast. That is the centerpiece to our entire stack. Once we have inventory visibility, we can do a lot of magic in how we help them sell, but also in helping that wholesaler optimize their margins,” he added. This is important because wholesalers often operate on thin margins of 3% to 7%, and are also dealing with inflation. By helping middlemen get a handle on their inventory, Baskit is also able to help them decide what suppliers to purchase from and price it correctly for the people they are selling goods to.
Baskit also offers financing services to middlemen, who often struggle to get working capital from traditional financial institutions. It is able to do so because its software has data on how much turnover a business has, and how much money is going and coming in. Baskit is currently working with several P2P lenders, and some traditional banks, including one of which is on its cap table.
Baskit’s plan is to expand into more cities, with the goal of reaching double-digit penetration of the wholesaler base in each one, which Schuermans says will make it an indispensable player. “That gives us a very broad distribution because these 50 wholesalers can cover the entire territory and it also gives us access to a very important supply base, a share of wallet. It’s interesting how very few suppliers, very few wholesalers, can do so much in covering the overall needs of retailers that they serve.”

SignalFire’s State of Talent report 2023,Heather Doshay,2023/06/26,"

Heather Doshay is partner, People + Talent, at early-stage venture firm SignalFire, where she leads recruiting programs for the portfolio and advises founders on applying the firm's Beacon AI for hiring. She's spent 15+ years as a people and talent executive at Webflow, RainforestQA and Hired.	

The era of tech giants overstaffing and overpaying has ended, at least for now. But talent is flooding the market, and those still employed have been left to shoulder all the work — there’s a huge opportunity for savvy recruiters to scoop up top performers.
Today’s job market is a confusing paradox. While unemployment is at a record low and there’s a labor shortage in healthcare and hospitality, tech has seen nonstop layoffs that hit 166,044 workers in Q1 2023 alone. That’s more than all of 2022’s then-record 161,411 tech layoffs.
What’s most unprecedented is that these layoffs are hitting software engineers, including top talent at FAANG companies that were previously considered untouchable. This is in sharp contrast to the 2008 recession, when the U.S. high-tech industry gained about 77,000 jobs in Q4, most in software development, despite the overall U.S. labor market losing 38,000 jobs.

The reversal of fortunes for engineers is particularly brutal coming off of 2021’s startup fundraising boom and relentless optimism. Companies preempted growth with hiring sprees far ahead of their metrics in hopes of continued growth.
But by the summer of 2022, the Great Resignation and “quiet quitting” gave way to mass layoffs by four of the big five in tech — Meta (Facebook), Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet (Google), known as FAANG. All but Apple made sizable cuts, including deeper cuts for software developers.

Executive summary
SignalFire’s State of Talent Report explores macro conditions and top-talent movement trends in tech to identify practical strategies for winning in the current hiring market. Top findings include:

Hiring power is shifting to startups as post-pandemic layoffs and budget cuts cause a “Great Restart” of compensation norms at Big Tech companies that can no longer overpay to win the best talent.
An unprecedented 166,000 tech layoffs happened in Q1 2023 — more than in all of 2022 — and included formerly untouchable software engineers.
Big Tech talent has flooded the market — 69% of FAANG engineers who were laid off or left after May 15, 2022 still listed no current job as of March 15, 2023.
28% of rehired FAANG engineers played musical chairs and switched to another tech giant, while 6% went to early-stage startups — an 82% increase over 2021.
Startups can capitalize on this power shift by recruiting passive talent who have survived Big Tech layoffs — they’re often loyal top performers who are overworked after teammates were cut.
SignalFire can help startups find and hire top passive talent with its Beacon AI engine and recruiting team.

Mass layoffs and the “Great Restart”
To explain the tech talent market’s sudden implosion, here’s the timeline that led to an imbalance in talent supply and demand.
 

			Tech has seen nonstop layoffs that hit 166,044 workers in Q1 2023 alone. That’s more than all of 2022’s then-record 161,411 tech layoffs.					



The 2020 pandemic accelerated the move of commerce, collaboration and entertainment online, causing a boom for many tech companies through 2021.
Hiring accelerated in 2021, creating a candidate-centric market that, coupled with the Great Resignation, drove many companies to use above-market compensation to attract and retain top talent.
Entering 2022, the cost to do business in general steadily began to rise with inflation, coupled with a return to in-person activities, disrupting demand for online services that had fueled pandemic tech growth.
Midyear 2022, tech valuations and cryptocurrency prices recalibrated down.
Ambitious hiring ahead had been a strategic lever to hit ambitious revenue targets, and as those targets were missed, both public and private companies adjusted to decrease burn and extend their runway.

The result: Companies chose to equalize the decreased demand for their products and services by reducing their workforce. Notably, top engineers were not spared.

In this report, we share a data-based analysis of the shifting talent landscape starting May 15, 2022 — when some of the most significant changes were starting to take place — through March 15, 2023, which captures the bulk of relevant data but is not inclusive of all activity to date.
We demystify the talent market on behalf of top engineers, as well as the companies where that top talent might find a new home. We specifically looked at engineers who are in the top 25% relative to their peers — as calculated by SignalFire’s Beacon AI data platform, which leverages a proprietary machine learning algorithm we developed to gauge the quality of engineers — both individually and collectively at their companies.
We used a cohort data approach encompassing the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Layoffs.fyi to capture a point in time when tech layoffs peaked, sticking with the data long enough to understand outcomes for that impacted cohort. More on our methodology can be found in the appendix at the end of the report.
How we got here
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the number of U.S. workers who quit their jobs during the Great Resignation between January and December 2021 made it a record-breaking year, with nearly 47.8 million total workers quitting their jobs. That is twice as many as left or were laid off during the Great Recession of 2009 and 2010.

Over the years leading up to the implosion, fundraising grew in both velocity and size. Pitchbook NVCA Venture Monitor highlights that 2021 saw a peak in the number of deals closed (18,521) and dollars invested ($344.7 billion) followed by a substantial drop in 2022, with four consecutive quarters of declining deal counts. The conjecture is that investor demand went down in both early- and late-stage investments.
To avoid a down round — or perhaps due to a lack of new funding available altogether — companies began to focus on extending their runway by reducing burn. Headcount and salaries are almost always the biggest line item on a company budget. Many companies had used capital to hire in advance of expected revenue growth and then missed revenue targets. They were suddenly strapped with unsustainable burn due to payroll increases.
Cue layoffs.
As the chart below highlights, layoffs in tech nearly doubled in 2022 compared with 2020; and after just the first quarter of 2023, this is already another record-breaking year for layoffs.

FAANGs out
For the past decade, FAANG companies were seen as the safe bet for job seekers, known for rich compensation packages and high job security. Starting in the summer of 2022, a new reality set in with hiring freezes and layoffs. "
Unicorn social app IRL to shut down after admitting 95% of its users were fake,Amanda Silberling,2023/06/26,"
Ironically, the social app IRL‘s users do not exist in real life.
An internal investigation by IRL’s board of directors found that 95% of the app’s reported 20 million users were “automated or from bots,” The Information first reported. So, after raising more than $200 million in venture capital, IRL is shutting down.
IRL was poised to become an event organizing alternative for Gen Z, who are using Facebook less and less. But after raising its SoftBank-led $170 million Series C round at a $1.17 billion valuation, the company’s internal troubles became more obvious.
Last year, IRL laid off 25% of its team, or around 25 employees. During the year prior, IRL had more than tripled its head count, so these cuts came as a surprise. In a note to employees, obtained by TechCrunch, former CEO and founder Abraham Shafi encouraged employees to “adapt” and “be disciplined,” citing that WhatsApp grew to 450 million users with a team of just 55.
“Becoming one of these iconic, impactful companies is akin to winning a gold medal in the Olympics. In fact, probably more challenging,” Shafi wrote in the memo, which was full of similarly outlandish analogies. “Like the Olympics, we know most people don’t want to be Olympians. In the same way, not everyone will want to walk the path we are walking. But for those that want to push their limits and find out what they are capable of, this culture is for you.”
In that same memo, Shafi said the company had “more than enough cash to last well into 2024.” An IRL employee told TechCrunch then that the company had more than $100 million in the bank. Though it’s unknown how much money IRL has left now, a company spokesperson told The Information that it would return its capital to shareholders.
Around the same time as these layoffs, IRL employees started doubting Shafi’s claim that the app had 20 million monthly active users; then the SEC began investigating whether IRL violated securities laws. By April, IRL’s board of directors suspended Shafi and appointed an acting CEO.
TechCrunch attempted to contact Shafi, as well as another IRL employee. Both of their IRL email addresses have been disabled.

Lilz brings its gauge-watching smart cameras to the US and raises $4M,Devin Coldewey,2023/06/26,"
When you run big real-life industrial operations, there’s always a gauge or readout somewhere deep in the facility that your engineers or field teams need to check in person. Lilz is a Japanese startup that builds devices you can set up to read these meters remotely, and the company just raised $4.1 million as they enter the North American market.
Lilz’s devices are basically battery-powered smart cameras that can last for years between charges, while monitoring something like a pressure gauge 24/7.
It may sound a little odd in this modern era — why not just have a smart steam gauge in the first place? The simple truth is much infrastructure and heavy industry doesn’t have that option, or retrofitting may be prohibitively expensive. Yet for safety or efficiency reasons, some simple readout needs to be looked at regularly.
Sending a human down is the simplest solution, or was until Lilz made its devices available a couple years ago. Their robust but low-power computer vision stack analyzes images of the gauge and relays that information digitally.
Now the Okinawa-based company has about 3,500 active cameras at 500 locations and has raised 590 million yen (approximately $4.1 million today) to fuel the next phase of their business. Its investors include JIC Venture Growth Investments, Mitsubishi UFJ Capital, Tokyo Century, Dimension Fund, Okinawa Development Finance Corporation, Okinawa’s Science and Technology Development Center, and Dogan Beta. That’s a Series B round, about twice their $2.2 million Series A round in 2021.
The company has received FCC and ISED certification for its devices and is preparing to launch in the U.S. and Canada. They plan to double their camera deployments and then rapidly expand afterward.

As far as the hardware, Lilz has been working on getting “intrinsically safe” certification as well, meaning the cameras pose no risk of creating safety issues — for example, shorting out and causing a spark that could ignite inflammable fumes. This frequently involves large enclosures for devices, but Lilz designed for it from the start, and its intrinsically safe cameras will only weigh 550 grams.
They’re also planning on releasing a thermal camera with similar qualities to the RGB one; thermal monitoring is important in uncrewed power stations, where a person would simply have to visit with a handheld thermal camera to check. Naturally automating this process is desirable. As with other widely distributed businesses like gas storage and delivery, removing the need for these checks is not only safer, but also saves money, time, and fuel.
Although it would be a stretch to call Lilz an AI company, it’s certainly close enough to claim kinship while the AI market continues to expand. Though it regularly improves its computer vision algorithms and the methods of accessing the data, Jakub Kolodziejczyk, the company’s CTO, said they’ve seen interest beyond meter-reading, since the devices are often at key locations in facilities.
“While we focus on analog gauges, with our cameras, clients can also capture other aspects of their processes they couldn’t track before, and are asking us for capabilities to detect events of interest,” he told TechCrunch. “Some examples we see now are abnormal temperature changes (which ties back to our thermal vision camera offering) and leaks, for both equipment and surrounding environment.”
Lilz devices could learn to detect outliers with very sparse data, he said, but cautioned that “this project is still in exploration phase.”

How to identify, interview and hire a head of growth for an early-stage startup
Don’t wait to identify your startup’s ideal customer personas



One of the biggest mistakes startups can make at an early stage is not identifying their ideal customer personas (ICP). It is perfectly sensible though, as all your efforts at this stage of growth are usually being consumed with finding product-market fit and acquiring anyone and anything that walks through your front door.
By identifying your ICPs first, you will find product-market fit faster and identify the right customers to sell to.
To start, an ICP is simply a depiction of who your customer segments are — whether they are creative agencies of more than 10 employees or corporations with 100+ employees, or both.
Startups using ICPs tend to acquire more leads with higher quality and are able to shorten their sales cycles. Ideally, you have already identified a handful of ICPs, but no more than five, as that will lead to a dilution of efforts among your teams.
To begin leveraging ICPs in your growth marketing, we’ll dive into methods that will first help identify your ICPs efficiently, then examine how to use their newfound segmentation.
Identifying your ICPs
I’m a big fan of surveys that measure net promoter scores and overall customer feedback, but I don’t believe these are the best formats for identifying ICPs. In the early days of your startup, you should be speaking with every customer you possibly can to better identify your ICPs.
 

			By identifying your ideal customer personas first, you will find product-market fit faster and identify the right customers to sell to.					


Obtaining such information requires more than a simple multiselect answer, or a ranking score from 1-10. Rest assured, I’ve created a three-tiered methodology (conveniently dubbed ICP!) for guiding the conversational and questioning themes you should be using with your customers:

I: Individual (e.g., age, gender, etc.)
C: Current solution
P: Pain points

When speaking with customers, if you follow the general principle of understanding pain points and what an ideal solution looks like to them, you’ll have a pretty good idea of which ICP they fall into. Instead of providing a generic script for your conversations with customers, which can often come across as robotic, I’ve laid out a few questions that fall into each category:
Individual

What is your age range?
What is your gender?
What is your occupation or job title?

Current solution

What are you currently using to solve this problem?
How long have you been using your current solution?
What do you like/dislike about your current solution?

Q2 failed to bring a funding reprieve for web3 startups and unicorns,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/26,"
Lo and behold, we’re already halfway into 2023, which means we’re only a couple weeks away from brand new, sizzling data on the second quarter. However, it’s always wise to keep an eye on the horizon, so we’ve decided to draw the few conclusions about web3 and unicorn funding trends that we can from early data on the past three months.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

I think it’s fair to call the fervor that drove investors to throw money web3 startups a feature unique to the last venture boom. Neither capital nor enthusiasm around fintech were in short supply in those months, and investors poured tens of billions of dollars into blockchain-focused startups that wanted to shake up the world of money and value management.
Firm believers in crypto are resolutely holding the line, but early data on the second quarter indicates that many venture investors are running for cover.
Going by the early numbers, there’s been a decline in the value of venture investment in unicorns and companies close to growing a horn. Indeed, that metric is close to record lows. "
"ThoughtSpot acquires Mode Analytics, a BI platform, for $200M in cash and stock",Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/26,"
ThoughtSpot, an AI-powered analytics platform last valued at $4.5 billion, today announced that it’s entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Mode Analytics, a business intelligence startup, for $200 million in cash and stock.
Mode will become a wholly owned subsidiary of ThoughtSpot once the deal closes later this year, subject to customary closing conditions and the approval of Mode’s shareholders.
It’s ThoughtSpot’s fourth acquisition following (most recently) the company’s purchases of SQL-based analytics firm SeekWell in March 2021 and data integration company Diyotta in May of that same year. Enabling all the deals is ThoughtSpot’s massive war chest, which totaled over $663 million as of August 2019.
As for the Mode acquisition, ThoughtSpot CEO Sudheesh Nair says that it’ll bolster ThoughtSpot’s generative AI apps while doubling the company’s customer base and growing its annual recurring revenue to more than $150 million.
“With this acquisition, we’re giving both data teams and business users the tools they need to efficiently and quickly turn data into insights and those insights into actions,” Nair said in a press release issued this morning.
San Francisco-based Mode, which TechCrunch last covered in August 2020, was co-founded by Derek Steer, Benn Stancil and Josh Ferguson in 2013. All three previously worked at Yammer (they were early employees and stayed on after the Microsoft acquisition), where they were a part of a larger team building custom data analytics tools for the Yammer platform.
Steer told my colleague Ingrid Lunden that the impetus for Mode came out of gaps in the market that the three had found through years of experience at other companies. Specifically, they saw an opportunity to build a product that could provide business intelligence and big data analytics capabilities to help data scientists improve their employers’ decision making.
Mode indeed managed to find a foothold in the vast and growing business intelligence market (worth an estimated $27.11 billion in 2022, according to Fortune), raising $81 million in venture capital prior to the ThoughtSpot acquisition from investors including H.I.G. Growth Partners, Valor Equity Partners and Rev.
At one point, Mode claimed that its customer base covered more than 50% of the Forbes 500, including brands such as Anheuser-Busch, Zillow, Lyft, Bloomberg, Capital One, VMware and Conde Nast.
“At Mode, we’ve always focused on helping data analysts, and worked hard to remove the frustrations that interfered with their day-to-day workflows,” Stancil, who serves as Mode’s CTO, said in a statement via email. “By providing data teams with an integrated, code-first experience, we’ve enabled our customers to move far more quickly and find much more value in their data than they previously could.”
For Mountain View, California-based ThoughtSpot, which was founded in 2012 by a team of engineers who previously worked for Google, Oracle and other Silicon Valley companies, the deal makes perfect logistical sense.
ThoughtSpot’s platform is designed to allow “non-technical” users to conduct data analyses, leveraging tools that monitor information for changing patterns and trends from sources such as Snowflake and Databricks. Tapped by companies including Walmart and Apple, ThoughtSpot’s products focus on self-service analytics, primarily — with a dash of AI and machine learning thrown in for good measure.
What Mode brings to the table is a complementary product set, then. Nair sees the acquisition creating “new ways” for ThoughtSpot customers to provide value to data teams, for example enabling them to create analytics applications and modeled or visualized data in Mode that can then be served up through ThoughtSpot’s dashboards.
“For too long, data teams have been held back by the last generation of archaic data visualization tools like Tableau that forced them to endlessly tweak and update dashboards,” Nair said in a press release. “Whether you want to be code-free for your business users or code-first for your analytics engineers, now is the time to rethink business intelligence if you want to maximize value from your investments in the modern data stack.”
ThoughtSpot’s acquisition, along with other big exits in the big data analytics space, could be a sign of consolidation in the sector ahead of tough macroeconomic conditions to come. Also today, Databricks snatched up MosaicML, a startup developing open source AI tools, for $1.3 billion. And a month ago, Snowflake picked up Neeva, a firm that aimed to build out a new approach to search across consumer and enterprise using AI innovations. (The consumer part never took off, and Neeva sold up.)

We’ve officially entered a new era of ‘cultivated’ meat production,Christine Hall,2023/06/21,"
U.S. regulators met another alternative protein milestone Wednesday when they approved both Upside Foods and Good Meat to sell their cultivated chicken products within the country.
Known as “cell-cultivated” or “cultured meat,” these proteins are made from animal cells rather than slaughtered animals and are often developed using a fermentation process involving bioreactors.
Upside Foods and Good Meat, both based in California, will now be able to serve their food, initially in restaurants. Upside has already taken its first restaurant order and will provide limited quantities to Bar Crenn in San Francisco, while Good Meat has a partnership with a restaurant in Washington, DC, run by chef and owner José Andrés.
Today’s approval follows the U.S. Department of Agriculture last week approving the way both companies were going to label their products.
Both companies also received a grant of inspection from the USDA, Upside for its engineering, production, and innovation center, and Good Meat for its demonstration plant in Alameda, along with its contract manufacturing partner, JOINN Biologics. The inspection process includes examination of facilities and equipment; standard operating procedure for sanitation; and the systematic approach to identification, evaluation and control of food safety hazards, according to Good Meat.

Upside’s cell-cultured chicken is first to receive FDA blessing for its production method

Prior to today, Singapore was the only country allowing sales of cultivated chicken. Good Meat was the first company to get approval to sell its cultivated chicken product there and received a U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance in March, joining Upside Foods as the only two companies to move to that next stage of commercializing their products in the U.S.
Cultivated meat is a complex process that traditionally is expensive and takes time. There’s also consumer tastes involved. In addition to Singapore and the U.S., some regions, like the United Kingdom, are supporting this industry, while others (e.g., Italy) are questioning it.
Globally, there are dozens of companies not far behind in getting cultivated, or cell-cultured, meat products on the market, and following today’s announcement, we will likely see more companies fast-track their products through the regulatory process. In the U.S., companies have to receive approval from both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the USDA before commercializing their products in this country.
Despite the challenges, some venture capitalists investing in the space remain confident. SOSV/IndieBio general partner Po Bronson said via email that the new approvals were “great for the cell-cultivated meat sector.” He explained that much of the “cell-cultivated products coming to market are hybrid products” and that “as cell-cultivated meat grows, this will shape and alter the alternative protein sector, impacting who aggregates and who gets aggregated, where only companies with genuine technological advancements will survive and become part of the larger supply chain. Needless to say, the days of just buying some pea protein, an extruder, some vegetable oil and some methylcellulose — and hoping to print money — are long gone.”
He also noted that the cultivated meat industry is shifting, and it will be difficult for new startups to compete against early companies that have scaled, saying, “We’ve seen some acquisitions but not high value ones. More money will flow, absolutely, but only to companies who can demonstrate their technology is meaningfully different and not imitative or interchangeable. Those are the companies to watch.”
Meanwhile, in a TechCrunch+ investor survey last week, the investors specifically discussed companies working with the U.S. government.
One investor, Johnny Ream, partner at Stray Dog Capital, noted that his firm encourages portfolio companies to engage with regulators early and be transparent in their process.
“Having that open dialogue is critical to identify regulatory risk factors that might be present and should inform the product development strategy,” Ream said. “Without that engagement will be a greater chance of significant regulatory barriers and/or regulator education as a company approaches market entry.”

VCs remain confident alternative protein has a real future despite public-market woes

Dear Sophie,
I’m in the U.S. on an H-1B visa, but I want to leave my current job and pursue a couple of startup ideas: One with a few friends, and the other on my own. 
Do I need to get two separate visas to work at both companies at the same time? Can I transfer my H-1B to one or both companies?
— Energetic Entrepreneur
Dear Energetic,
Wow! Founding two startups and bringing them both to fruition will certainly keep you busy! I admire your drive and applaud you for your gusto and determination!
Let’s first provide some context on work visas versus work permits, and then offer up a few suggestions and alternatives.
Work visas vs. work permits
A work visa, such as the H-1B specialty occupation visa and the O-1A extraordinary ability visa, enables its holder to temporarily live in the U.S. and work only in the engagements included on the original visa petition, Form I-129.
Certain categories of people, such as F-1 students, some dependent spouses of work visa holders, and people pursuing green cards, may be eligible to apply for a work permit that is not tied to any specific employer. (Examples include F-1 OPT, F-1 STEM OPT, E-2 and L-1 spouses, and individuals who have been approved for a green card and have a pending Form I-485, the Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status.) Also known as an Employment Authorization Document (EAD), a work permit provides proof of authorization to work in the U.S. and enables its holder to get a job or jobs.
Compared to a work visa, an EAD offers wide flexibility to entrepreneurs and founders. That’s one reason we often ask our married entrepreneur clients whether their spouse is eligible for a work visa that offers an EAD to a dependent spouse.
H-1B transfer and concurrent H-1Bs
You can transfer your H-1B from your current employer to another employer for part-time or full-time work. You can also hold two or more concurrent H-1Bs from different employers at the same time.
Although an H-1B visa petition is tied to a specific job with a specific employer, there are no limits on the number of H-1B jobs an individual can hold and no standard minimum — or maximum—number of hours a person can work in any given H-1B position.
Since you’re currently on an H-1B — and already went through the annual H-1B lottery process — you can transfer your H-1B to another company and avoid having to go through the lottery process again. However, you should keep in mind that the maximum stay allowed under an H-1B visa is typically six years unless you apply for a green card.
So, if you’ve been inside the U.S. on H-1B status for a cumulative period of four years, transferring your H-1B to your startups would mean you can live and work in the U.S. for two more years in this status.
H-1B transfers and concurrent H-1Bs can be tricky, particularly for early-stage startups, so it’s important to create a compliant foundation for immigration sponsorship. You will need to structure your startups so that they are eligible to sponsor you for a position and that clear lines are drawn between the two startup entities. I recommend you work with both a corporate attorney and an immigration attorney. "
Quick commerce startup Getir plans to exit France amid regulatory issues,Romain Dillet,2023/06/21,"
In a press release sent to AFP, Getir has announced that it plans to exit France. As a reminder, Getir pioneered the concept of quick commerce. Those services allow you to order groceries without picking a delivery slot. Instead, companies like Getir start working on your order right away and can usually deliver your groceries in less than 30 minutes.
Originally from Turkey, Getir is one of the biggest players in this relatively new space. At the height of the instant grocery bubble, Getir reached a valuation of $11.8 billion and expanded to several European countries. Quick commerce requires some steep upfront costs as companies need to build a network of dark stores in big cities so that customers live just a few minutes away from the nearest dark store.
But funding dried up and many quick commerce startups couldn’t reach profitability in time. That’s why Getir acquired Gorillas in late 2022. Gorillas itself had already acquired Frichti, a French startup that delivered both ready-to-eat meals and groceries.
“The complex legal environment and regulations imposed by local authorities made the company’s success very difficult,” a Getir spokesperson told AFP in a statement. In particular, in March, the French government decided that dark stores should be considered as warehouses — not stores. This way, local governments can decide whether they allow warehouses in city centers or not.
It’s unclear what’s going to happen next. While Getir says that it plans to exit the French market altogether, the company has also filed for bankruptcy. Court-appointed administrators are still looking for another company that would be willing to take over some of Getir’s activities in France. In the meantime, Getir’s 1,800 employees in France don’t know if they’ll have a job in a few weeks as it depends on the result of this bankruptcy process.
Flink, one of Getir’s competitors, has also filed for bankruptcy in France. Flink had previously snapped up its French competitor Cajoo.
As for Gopuff, the company has already left the country in January. In other words, it sounds like the entire instant grocery delivery industry is disappearing in France… quick commerce indeed.

Databricks is proof that strong unicorns can grow their way out of a market correction,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/21,"
Databricks recently revealed that it recorded revenue of more than $1 billion in the financial year ended January 31. The company also said it grew more than 60% last year and its data warehousing product crossed the $100 million annual recurring revenue (ARR) threshold in April.
Databricks has always grown quickly, so it’s not surprising to hear that it has surpassed new revenue milestones, but these numbers are impressive even though we’ve been tracking this company for a while.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

Databricks reached ARR of $600 million when it raised a massive round in August 2021, reached $800 million in ARR at the end of 2021, and last August, crossed the $1 billion ARR threshold. However, as ARR is more of a forward-looking metric, the fact that Databricks managed to generate a full billion dollars in revenue is indeed a feat.
Today, we’re nearly half-a-year behind the company’s actual growth curve. Since Databricks saw revenue of $1 billion last year, it must have closed the year with higher ARR, and it has grown for nearly two quarters since then. It’s not easy to nail down how much revenue the company would be making today, but that’s not going to stop us from having a little fun with big numbers.
Databricks has been in the news lately for other reasons as well. Last month, it acquired Okera, a data governance platform with a focus on AI, and Bloomberg recently reported it bought Rubicon, a startup focused on data storage for AI-related work. Given that Databricks deals with corporate data, it makes sense that it is working with AI-related data services — in fact, the company open-sourced its own LLM in April.
But that’s all related to product. Today, we’re just talking about revenue, growth and how close Databricks is to harmonizing its private-market worth with what the public markets might afford it. Spoiler: The fact that it is deep in the AI trenches is not going to hurt its path to an eventual IPO, even if CEO Ali Ghodsi is in no hurry to go public.
The path to $1 billion
Rewinding through all our Databricks financial coverage takes a moment, but it’s worth our time. Here’s a rundown of what we have learned through time: "
20SALES closes $5M inaugural fund to invest in early-stage B2B SaaS startups,Dominic-Madori Davis,2023/06/21,"
20SALES, a venture capital fund led by eight women, said it has closed its $5 million inaugural fund, which it will invest mainly in early-stage, business-to-business SaaS companies.
The newly launched fund is an offshoot of venture firm 20VC, which was founded by Harry Stebbings, but it is a separate vehicle entirely. The fund plans to write checks of $100,000 and above for pre-seed, seed and Series A companies. It currently does not have any reserves for follow-on investments and instead will optimize for ownership on the first check.
The fund hopes to invest in at least 50 companies over the next two years. Although the focus of the fund is not just to solely back women, it hopes to focus its efforts there when possible.
20SALES’ founding partners are Jessica Arnold, Stevie Case, Kelly Bray, Liat Bycel, Kim Graves, Renu Gupta, Maggie Hott and Lauren Schwartz. All will be staying at their jobs and working at this fund part-time.
Stebbings, as a limited partner and advisor to the fund, managed its fundraising process and said the capital came from the LPs of 20VC. “They rarely do first-time funds, if ever,” he said of his own LP base. “However, they immediately saw the unique positioning of the fund and the immense quality of the partnership. Given both these elements, it took a very short time to raise.”
Other LPs include Harvard Management Company and Stewart Butterfield.
Speaking to TechCrunch, Hott said the fund hopes to inspire the next generation of women investors and have a material impact on the number of women operators in the space.
The fund also aims to help build a founder community for women. Female entrepreneurs receive less than 3% of all VC funds allocated in any given year. “We want to fund more of them,” Hott said. “Simple.”

Danti uses natural language processing to make searching Earth data simple,Aria Alamalhodaei,2023/06/21,"
Commercial and defense organizations have an Earth data overload problem: They collect vast amounts of heavily siloed data, with few ways to quickly synthesize insights and deliver them to the people who most need it.
Danti, a startup emerging from stealth today with $2.75 million in funding, wants to solve this problem with a powerful natural language search engine for location-based data. This should enable non-experts to quickly sort through huge amounts of diverse data and find the answers they need.
The search engine could completely change how location-based data is used and understood. On its website, Danti provides a number of possible queries an end user could pose. These span the mundane queries of an insurance underwriter (“What are the risks for property at 2340 River Bend Rd.”), to the more urgent questions of a warfighter (“battle damage assessment in Irpin in last 48 hours”).
The startup is headed by Jesse Kallman, whose career has spanned unmanned aerial systems, satellite data and geospatial intelligence. He eventually landed at Airbus, where he led a new business unit focused on developing geospatial market software, before moving to autonomous aviation startup Xwing, where he was VP of commercialization and strategy.
“I’ve learned the same lessons over and over and over again,” he said. “It was never about the drone, it was never about the satellite. It was always about, ‘what is the question that the user is trying to answer, and how do you get the right information [to them] based on what it is?’”
The solution to the problem, he says, is in the search layer. Just as the first search engines revolutionized the ability for the non-expert to find useful information online, Danti could similarly unlock Earth data end users — so its founder hopes, anyway.
“That’s where we were really inspired and what we really want to try to accomplish,” Kallman said. “How can you build something just purely at the search layer, not going into […] the really nitty-gritty geospatial work, for the [National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency] analyst or even better, the downstream deployed army user who’s just trying to answer a simple question about a property?”
To accelerate development of the search engine technology, Danti closed a $2.75 million pre-seed funding round led by Tech Square Ventures with participation from Radius Capital. The round also included Philip Krim and Raven One Ventures, SpaceVC, Overline, Tareyton Ventures, Jordan Noone, Keith Masback and Jeff Crusey.
Danti’s team stands at less than 15 people and is scarcely four months old, but the startup is moving fast. In April, Danti won an open challenge from the National Security Innovation Network, which asked competitors to pitch solutions to reduce the time-intensive data search process for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. Kallman said the follow-on feedback from NGA, as well as commercial customers, through the open challenge and other beta testing has been “incredible.”
“That’s where we are at this stage. It’s really, really getting deep with many different types of users to really understand what’s valuable to them.”

BetterBrand’s new dough raises company’s valuation to over $170M,Christine Hall,2023/06/21,"
BetterBrand, a food tech company known for creating “The Better Bagel,” closed on $6 million of Series A capital at a pre-money valuation of $170 million.
The company, citing Crunchbase data, also touts that the raise puts founder Aimee Yang among just 150 solo female founders to raise a Series A over $5 million from institutional investors and to achieve that valuation.
“The valuation reflects a combination of our growth, product differentiation, innovative technology and large-scale market potential,” Yang told TechCrunch via email. “There is a tremendous $10-plus trillion market that is largely untapped, for us to be able to dominate. With the results we have achieved at an unprecedented scale and speed, our vision to design the future of food is already being actualized — at this point, our biggest challenge is a race against the clock. We want to get there as quickly as possible to build the brand, and deliver on consumer demand.”
Founded in 2021, BetterBrand’s proprietary “grain-changing” technology combines non-GMO and clean label ingredients to create a line of better-for-you baked goods. For example, the company has created the traditionally carb-heavy bagel into “the net carb equivalent of two banana slices,” with “The Better Bagel” featuring 250% more protein, 90% fewer carbs and no added sugar.
In the past two years, the company has created new bagel flavors, most recently launching “The Pretzel” and “The Sesame.” Other flavors include  “The Classic,” “The Everything,” “The Cinnamon” and “The Chocolate Chip.” BetterBrand is also getting into new categories, and Yang expects to triple the SKU count by the end of this year with the launch of 16 new products.
The products have caught on with consumers. First starting as a direct-to-consumer offering, the products can now be found in more than 1,000 stores in the United States, including Whole Foods, Sprouts, Fresh Market, Gelson’s and Bristol Farms.

Between 2021 and 2022, the company saw over 800% growth, and in late 2022, Yang said BetterBrand “drove more than $1 million in gross sales at Whole Foods Market alone during our first five months on shelves.”
The company is on track to see a similar increase between 2022 and 2023, which is why Yang said it was a good opportunity to go after additional funding.
“Investors can see our results,” Yang said. “Our velocities on shelf have organically outperformed our best-case estimates. Product market fit had been proven, and the foundation had been laid out, so it was a good time to start adding fuel to drive additional innovation and distribution.”
The Series A gives the company nearly $10 million in total venture-backed funding to date. Verso Capital led the new round and was joined by existing investors, including Gaingels Fund, Seven Seven Six, Craft Lane and a group of individual investors, including Cruise founder and CEO Kyle Vogt, Chris Hollod and Jeff and Glenne Azoff. Existing investors Sean Thomas, of the Wendy’s family, and actors Patrick Schwarzenegger and Emmy Rossum, were part of BetterBrand’s earlier fund raises in 2021.
Meanwhile, the company is focused on growth, so the funds will be used to expand into new markets across North America and Europe and on continued innovation and product development poised to begin rolling out in coming months, Yang said.
Investors are also eager to see what’s next. Vogt said in a written statement that, “Aimee Yang is an incredible entrepreneur and a solid operator. Her company offers life-changing, clean, functional products for those who previously felt they had to give up some of their favorite foods to fit their nutritional needs. It’s an exciting journey to be a part of.”

Notarize launches Proof to ensure safe online transactions,Catherine Shu,2023/06/21,"
Notarize, the world’s largest online notary network, is launching Proof, a new company and platform for digital identity verifications. Beginning in August, Notarize’s business tools will be rebranded to Proof, and it is also changing its company name to Proof. Notarize will continue serving its online notary network, which is used by companies like Adobe and FedEx, and the two brands and platforms will exist side-by-side, said founder Patrick Kinsel.
Created in response to the rise in online transactions, Proof is an enterprise-grade platform, designed to serve large banks and real estate companies. It will continue to have all the main components of Notarize’s online notary service, which has been used by millions of users to process transactions like real estate e-closings, vehicle bills of sales and documents like affidavits of identity and power of attorneys. What’s new in Proof is an identity-assured transaction management platform meant to address gaps in online identity verification.
Some examples of the services it offers include verification identity using biometric tech (for example, scanning selfies to make sure they match ID photos), 24/7 human verification of identity and signature verification to ensure that the person signing is who they actually say they are. Proof also looks out for fraud risk in each transaction, the same way credit cards are monitored. For example, if a signature looks like it might be forged, Proof flags it for review.

Proof monitors fraud signals with a risk score based on data like location, device fingerprint, carrier network and prior rejections. All of its transactions are protected with encryption and are NIST IAL-2 compliant, and will be AATL compliant later this year. NIST is the National Institute for Science and Technology and it publishes standards used by government agencies and industries. For example, the National Highway Transportation Administration requires an IAL2 standard for electronic auto sales, which means consumers must provide a combination of identity evidence.
AATL, meanwhile, is the Adobe Approved Trust List, which dictates how PDF documents are cryptographically signed. Kinsel said that by meeting this, Proof will the first platform whose documents are tied to a valid legal identity in accordance with Adobe’s standards. “Our vision is that everything should be cryptographically signed with identity and Acrobat is the trusted reader to instantly confirm the authenticity of every action online,” he added.
If a signer fails to pass Proof’s digital safeguard for automated verification, they will be matched with one of Notarize’s more than 4,000 notaries to complete the document and transaction.
Kinsel told TechCrunch that Proof’s ability to confirm identity and flag risk leverages Notarize’s innovation in identity verification, including its ability to verify photo IDs like driver licenses and passports, present identity challenge questions, perform biometric selfie verification and confirm data attributes from information like consumer addresses and phone numbers. “When we swipe a credit card we know it’s being protected with active fraud monitoring and Proof will deliver the same for the agreements we enter,” he said.
Some examples of how Proof can be used include securing the seller in a real estate transaction, who don’t require notarization but are still at risk with only a basic e-signature, Kinsel said. Proof is also being used by the retirement industry to protect large withdrawals from fraud, and in the auto industry to notarize forms in some states and meet IAL2 standards elsewhere.
Since its launch in 2015, Notarize has been adopted by 2,200 companies, including First American, iPostal, Guaranteed Rate, Salesforce, SimpleNexus, SnapDocs, USAA and Zillow. Notarize says that almost 80% of those transactions were identity affirmations, as e-signatures are becoming increasing targets for fraud as online agreements become more common. Proof was created to expand Notarize’s services beyond notarization and create verifications of consumer identity with each transaction that it says are impossible to forge.
Notarize raised a $130 million Series D in 2021, at a valuation of more than $760 million, which it used to build Proof. Its investors include Camber Creek, Polaris Ventures and Realogy.

A whistleblower raised safety concerns about OceanGate’s submersible in 2018. Then he was fired.,Mark Harris,2023/06/20,"
The director of marine operations at OceanGate, the company whose submersible went missing Sunday on an expedition to the Titanic in the North Atlantic, was fired after raising concerns about its first-of-a-kind carbon fiber hull and other systems before its maiden voyage, according to a filing in a 2018 lawsuit first reported by Insider and New Republic.
David Lochridge was terminated in January 2018 after presenting a scathing quality control report on the vessel to OceanGate’s senior management, including founder and CEO Stockton Rush, who is on board the missing vessel.
According to a court filing by Lochridge, the preamble to his report read: “Now is the time to properly address items that may pose a safety risk to personnel. Verbal communication of the key items I have addressed in my attached document have been dismissed on several occasions, so I feel now I must make this report so there is an official record in place.”
The report detailed “numerous issues that posed serious safety concerns,” according to the filing. These included Lochridge’s worry that “visible flaws” in the carbon fiber supplied to OceanGate raised the risk of small flaws expanding into larger tears during “pressure cycling.” These are the huge pressure changes that the submersible would experience as it made its way and from the deep ocean floor. He noted that a previously tested scale model of the hull had “prevalent flaws.”
Carbon fiber composites can be stronger and lighter than steel, making a submersible naturally buoyant. But they can also be prone to sudden failure under stress. The hull that Lochridge was writing about was made by Spencer Composites, the only company to have previously made a carbon fiber hull for a manned submersible. (That submersible was commissioned by explorer Steve Fossett for a record-breaking dive, but he died in a light aircraft crash before it could be used.)
Lochridge’s recommendation was that non-destructive testing of the Titan’s hull was necessary to ensure a “solid and safe product.” The filing states that Lochridge was told that such testing was impossible, and that OceanGate would instead rely on its much touted acoustic monitoring system.
The company claims this technology, developed in-house, uses acoustic sensors to listen for the tell-tale sounds of carbon fibers in the hull deteriorating to provide “early warning detection for the pilot with enough time to arrest the descent and safely return to surface.”
Lochridge, however, worried in the lawsuit that the system would not reveal flaws until the vessel was descending, and then might only provide “milliseconds” of warning before a catastrophic implosion.

OceanGate plans an expedition to 3D scan the Titanic

Russell McDuff, a veteran oceanographer and chairman of OceanGate’s scientific and research foundation for three years, noted that contact with the Titan was lost on Sunday after only an hour and 45 minutes. “This suggests to me that they might have still been in the water column, descending to the Titanic,” told TechCrunch in a phone interview.
Lochridge also strongly encouraged OceanGate to have a classification agency, such as the American Bureau of Shipping, inspect and certify the Titan.
A day after filing his report, Lochridge was summoned to a meeting with Rush and company’s human resources, engineering and operations directors. There, the filing states, he was also informed that the manufacturer of the Titan’s forward viewport would only certify it to a depth of 1,300 meters due to OceanGate’s experimental design. The filing states that OceanGate refused to pay for the manufacturer to build a viewport that would meet the Titan’s intended depth of 4,000 meters. The Titanic lies about 3,800 meters below the surface.
The filing also claims that hazardous flammable materials were being used within the submersible.
At the end of the meeting, after saying that he would not authorize any manned tests of Titan without a scan of the hull, Lochridge was fired and escorted from the building.
Lochridge, who claimed he was discharged in retaliation for being a whistleblower, made his filing after OceanGate sued him in federal court in Seattle that June. OceanGate has accused him of sharing confidential information with two individuals, as well as with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). In the lawsuit, OceanGate characterized Lochridge’s report as false, and  accused him of committing fraud by manufacturing a reason to be fired.
The lawsuit was settled in November 2018. Neither OceanGate nor Lochridge responded to requests for comment. OSHA could not immediately provide details of the alleged report. A routine OSHA inspection of OceanGate in 2021 found only three minor workplace safety violations resulting in no financial penalties.
A few months after Lochridge’s dismissal, the company published a blog post that laid out its reasons for not having Titan certified by the American Bureau of Shipping or a similar organization.
 “The vast majority of marine (and aviation) accidents are a result of operator error, not mechanical failure,” it reads. “As a result, simply focusing on classing the vessel does not address the operational risks. Maintaining high-level operational safety requires constant, committed effort and a focused corporate culture – two things that OceanGate takes very seriously and that are not assessed during classification.”
In 2019, Rush gave an interview to Smithsonian magazine, in which he said: “There hasn’t been an injury in the commercial sub industry in over 35 years. It’s obscenely safe, because they have all these regulations. But it also hasn’t innovated or grown—because they have all these regulations.”
Following Lochridge’s departure, the Titan was tested safely on increasingly deep dives, including to 4,000 meters in the Bahamas. However, it seems one of Lochridge’s concerns would soon be borne out. In January 2020, Rush gave an interview to GeekWire in which he admitted that the Titan’s hull “showed signs of cyclic fatigue.” Because of this, the hull’s depth rating had been reduced to 3,000 meters. “Not enough to get to the Titanic,” Rush said.
During 2020 and 2021, the Titan’s hull was either repaired or rebuilt by two Washington state companies, Electroimpact and Janicki Industries, that largely work in aerospace. In late 2021, the Titan made its first trip down to the wreck of the Titanic.
Spencer Composites says that the Titan was not using its carbon fiber hull on Sunday’s dive. Presumably apart from the hull work, one source familiar with the company told TechCrunch that not much with Titan had changed at all since 2018.
At the time of publication, the Titan remains missing, with Rush, French diver Paul-Henri Nargeolet, British billionaire Hamish Harding, Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son reportedly on board. A massive search and rescue operation is underway.
“They’re doing everything that they logically can,” McDuff said. “But I’m a little pessimistic because of the amount of time that’s gone by.”

Tiger Global’s search for liquidity illustrates how busted the late-stage market is,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/20,"
The late-stage market is whacked. You only need to look at how Tiger Global Management, previously one of the most active investors in all of startup-dom, has failed to find a buyer for a large basket of its stakes in private tech companies.
The fact that Tiger did not, as PitchBook wrote, find a buyer for “a percentage of its stakes in about 30 companies [packaged in a] strip sale” implies the issue here was that Tiger did not find a buyer willing to pay however much it wanted for those stakes.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

LPs in venture funds put their money into an aggregated pool that is then used by the venture firm to purchase a number of stakes in a variety of companies. The difference between an LP in a new fund and Tiger, which is looking to sell a wide swath of stakes, is that the traditional LP can’t know where its pledged capital will end up.
Tiger, on the other hand, reportedly was looking to sell a basket of its stakes to what we presume is a similar customer base. Its failing to find a buyer for that collection implies that, in this case, more information is not helping move those shares.
PitchBook reports that Tiger is now looking to sell individual stakes in some of its portfolio companies to generate liquidity. Other investors are also struggling to sell collections of stakes, but they’re not seeing bids either, the report said.
Oof.
Tiger did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In the race for dominance in the AI travel industry, even a small lead matters right now.
Every player in the space trying to capitalize on the promise of new AI/LLM (large language model) technologies is struggling with the fact that major platforms like ChatGPT are limited by data that is outdated or not real time. In an industry like travel, where fickle plans and itineraries literally change with the weather, this is particularly problematic.
As both investors in AI travel and advisors coordinating deals for startups in this space with other investors, we like to see companies pushing boundaries and providing value for users in new, concrete ways.
For instance, Kayak and Expedia have launched ChatGPT plugins, but GuideGeek from travel publisher Matador Network provides real-time flight data (GP Bullhound has provided financial advisory services to Matador Network). Meanwhile, Roam Around has a strong visual element to its interface.
But travel information is complex, and incorrect information — or AI “hallucinations” — are a challenge. Roam Around sometimes recommends one site while showing a photo of another (and potentially linking to a third), and in one of our queries, GuideGeek conjured a cleverly named pub that simply doesn’t exist.
 

			Other than Airbnb, there really hasn’t been a major shift in how we plan and book travel online in decades.					


At this early stage, our firm and other investors in the space we work with don’t have an expectation of perfection. The advances between GPT-3 and GPT-4 are so apparent that it’s easy enough to look at the underlying technology and say, “Eh, they’ll figure it out.”
We’re more focused on how companies are shaping and augmenting this technology for travelers and the market segments within the travel industry they are positioned to capture.
Differentiation is key — you need more than a skin for ChatGPT
Most AI products seem to be built on ChatGPT. While each travel company may start with the same baseline, we really like to see proprietary data that can train the AI to produce superior outputs. OTAs (online travel agencies) like Expedia and Booking.com have an advantage here with massive amounts of information about their customers and how people plan and book trips.
Small agile teams have an opportunity to adopt this technology and rapidly scale up before the big guys can effectively implement or risk disrupting their existing business. If consumers can use an AI tool to search all airlines instantly, why does an OTA need to be in the loop?
The OTAs are built on recommending what the masses want, but the whole point of AI is that the answer is now customized to the individual. An average ranking of 8 for a hotel doesn’t apply to a specific person whose main priority is to be close to a lesser-known local surf spot an AI surfaced for them.
To try to drive utilization, startup players have to get more creative with product design. Getaiway and Roam Around have focused specifically on itineraries, with the latter simplifying the user input down to one word — type in a place and get an itinerary, then refine from there. Matador says it plans to include influencer videos from its wide range of content creators in the GuideGeek messaging interface. "
"Shaquille O’Neal will discuss investing in Edsoma, life as a mogul and more at Disrupt",Lauren Simonds,2023/06/20,"
Talk about a slam dunk. Shaquille O’Neal, 15-time NBA All-Star, four-time NBA Champion and three-time NBA Finals MVP, will join us at TC Disrupt 2023, which takes place September 19-21.
Following nearly two decades in the NBA, Shaq has built an estimated $400 million business empire — moving easily from superstar to mogul. He’ll join us in his role as lead investor in Edsoma, an AI-powered reading, education and communication platform for children. Kyle Wallgren, the company’s founder and CEO, will also take part in this fireside chat.
A committed advocate for children’s literacy, O’Neal has participated in charity basketball events and founded the Shaquille O’Neal Foundation to support underserved youth. It’s not surprising to find him adding edtech to his portfolio, but we’re eager to hear why he chose Edsoma. 
Wallgren is a visionary leader committed to making a positive impact through his work, with the ultimate mission to stamp out illiteracy around the world. As a parent, he experienced the challenges of Covid-related school closures, and he founded Edsoma to help parents instill the love of reading in their children and as a way to address decreased reading performance brought on by the pandemic. 
The app helps children learn correct pronunciation as they read aloud, and it also lets parents read with their children from any location — think parents who live separately or travel for work, deployed military personnel or far-flung grandparents.
A bona fide business mogul — Shaq earned his MBA in 2005 —  O’Neal has invested in companies like Google, Apple and Ring. He’s the second-largest individual shareholder of Authentic Brands Group, and he owns multiple franchising storefronts, including Big Chicken, Papa Johns, Krispy Kreme and many other entrepreneurial ventures.
Kyle Wallgren is a successful entrepreneur with a proven track record of building and selling multiple small businesses. He has sold 10 of the 13 companies he’s launched. 
We look forward to learning what qualities Shaq looks for in a founder and how he and Wallgren plan to grow and scale the company.

Startup Battlefield winner Render raises $50M series B led by Bessemer Venture Partners,Neesha A. Tambe,2023/06/20,"
Cloud platform startup Render closed a $50 million series B round led by Bessemer Venture Partners. Additional participation in the round includes General Catalyst, South Park Common Fund, and Addition – all existing investors.
In contrast to its competitors, Render’s DevOps cloud platform aims to offer flexible, cheaper and simpler infrastructure. Render allows developers to focus less on server setup, deployment and scaling and more on core product development. Since launch, Render’s customer base now includes companies like Watershed and Fortune 500 companies such as Red Bull.
The SF-based company won TechCrunch Startup Battlefield at TC Disrupt 2019. The Series B has brought Render’s total raised to a total of $77.5 million.
“Funding from this round will be used to expand the platform to support the needs of larger engineering teams and double down on best-in-class workflow and tooling,” says CEO Anurag Goel.

Jane Technologies launches innovative point-of-sale platform for cannabis dispensaries,Matt Burns,2023/06/20,"
Jane Technologies today announced the launch of its new point-of-sale (POS) platform that it says will improve the overall cannabis shopping experience with reliable online listings and in-store curated shopping recommendations.
Everyone knows the pain. You find your favorite strain on your dispensary’s online menu, only to go to the shop and discover it’s out of stock. You can either pick another strain at random or rely on the questionable advice of the local budtender. Jane’s new POS system aims to change that bummer of a situation, and it’s using its massive e-commerce data catalog to tackle in-store retail.
The new POS integrates with Jane Technologies’ existing e-commerce and advertising solutions product lines. The company started by building the back end for dispensaries’ e-commerce operations. To Jane Technologies, the future of cannabis isn’t a single destination like Amazon; the future of cannabis is the neighborhood dispensary that sells weed online. Jane wants to power their online store — and now the company wants to power their brick-and-mortar locations, too.
Jane’s POS platform includes a debit card payment system, custom hardware, and a personalized shopping experience. But the secret sauce comes from Jane Technologies’ long dedication to providing clean data assets. The company already tracks 1.5 million SKUs, and when new products are launched (or old products modified), Jane’s system pushes the data to its customer base. Shop owners can focus on selling weed while Jane’s platform does the heavy lifting around inventory management.
This new system provides dispensaries with a deep level of customer personalization. As Jane Technologies’ CEO Socrates Rosenfeld explained to me, the regulation around cannabis presents retailers with a unique opportunity. Before entering a dispensary, shoppers must scan their government-issued ID, and suddenly, the retailer knows who’s shopping and what they like to purchase. Jane’s new POS takes advantage of this process, and the system serves the budtender with a list of products previously purchased by the customer and a list of recommended products backed by verified reviews.
“In-store displays can be curated specifically for you,” Rosenfeld said. “Think about the Budtender who will know your preferences and purchase history, and they can recommend more curated personal items.”
This system has long been a staple of online e-commerce, including on Jane Technologies’ e-commerce platform, but now the same platform works in a retail environment that depends heavily on recommendations.
Jane Technologies says integrating the platform with a dispensary’s inventory takes just a couple of hours. They say competitors can take weeks to complete a transition because of the work associated with exporting important product information, imagery, and government tracking IDs.
The system also allows for stand-alone, vending machine–type kiosks that are designed for speed and efficiency, allowing customers to browse and purchase products using a large touchscreen instead of speaking with a retail associate.
Jane Technologies has been testing this system at three dozen partners across the Pacific Northwest, New Mexico, California and Colorado. The company expects its new POS platform to be in 400 retail locations by the end of the year.

Oso sees huge opportunity in simplifying authorization for developers,Ron Miller,2023/06/20,"
We all know what authentication is. You enter a username and password or use your face or your fingerprint, and you can access a device or an application, but what you can do with that application or device falls under the realm of authorization, authentication’s close cousin. For years, developers have been forced to build their own authorization tooling, and unless you’re one of the bigger companies, that takes resources that a lot of organizations simply don’t have.
Oso’s mission is to make it easier to add authorization to any application. “Authorization is a $25 billion market. It’s a problem that every company has to solve. But no one got out of bed to think about it except for my team and me,” company CEO Graham Neray told TechCrunch.
Investors see the same potential, and today the company announced a $15 million round led by Felicis with participation from Sequoia and Harpoon Ventures. While it was at it, the company also announced that a new version of the Oso tooling is now available.
Neray points out that companies like Slack, Google and Airbnb have spent a lot of time and engineering resources building authorization tooling. “The problem is most companies don’t have the resources of a company like Google or Slack, so they limp along. Their systems are terrible and the engineers’ experience is kind of like a Groundhog Day scenario of building these systems over and over again, even though no one wants to. And Oso solves that problem,” he said.
Part of the company’s approach to this is to educate people on the nature of the problem, and how important it is to solve, which has the added benefit of acting as a marketing driver to the open source version of the product, which can in turn lead to sales of the cloud product.
“We’ve also built an extensive library of technical documentation, not specific to Oso, to educate developers on the domain. And as part of that what we’re doing is we’re providing vocabulary and mental models to understand their own authorization problems. So we published a series called Authorization Academy. It’s a series of technical guides on how to build application authorization,” he explained.
In addition to the open source product, which Neray says has been downloaded millions of times, the company added Oso Cloud last year with ARR from that product growing 20% month over month. He says they are doing this without any outbound sales to this point.
“On top of that, our motion is entirely product led and inbound. So what I mean by that is we’re not doing outbound [sales and marketing]. We don’t currently have salespeople, though I’m sure we will in the future. And all of our paid customers started on the free tier, which is no small feat, especially given the microscope under which businesses are being put about how they spend their money and how efficient they are,” Neray said.
And being efficient has meant keeping the company lean with just 13 employees so far. But with the $15 million investment, the startup does plan to start hiring more people this year, and as he does, he is considering how to build a diverse workforce.
“So it starts from the top. It is much more common to find people who are interested in working for a leadership team with which they can identify, and so I think that’s a core part of the strategy,” he said. And that means making sure the leadership team is diverse as the company grows.
As the company puts the additional $15 million in capital to work, Neray is focused on the opportunity he sees in the authorization space.
“I think the combination of the size of the opportunity, and the strength of the business and the growth that we’re seeing is what led the team at Felicis to lead this round. We also have Sequoia who led prior rounds and Harpoon Ventures also participated. That puts our total funding raised over $25 million, which makes us the best capitalized authorization company,” he said.

Diabetes management startup Clivi wants to be ‘Livongo of Latin America’,Christine Hall,2023/06/20,"
Over 422 million people around the world have diabetes, with the World Health Organization noting that the majority of those with the disease are living in low-income and middle-income countries.
In Latin America, there are over 40 million adults with diabetes, according to Statista. And with the global digital health market poised to reach $1.5 trillion in the next seven years, Clivi, a Mexico-based diabetes management startup, wants to help control the disease through its comprehensive, technological and personalized approach to diabetes healthcare delivery.
“In Mexico, there is an average of one endocrinologist per almost 10,000 patients,” Clivi founder and CEO Ricardo Moguel told TechCrunch. “You might see a doctor every three months, but for chronic conditions, patients need to be making decisions every day.”
Clivi is making a balance between humans and technology by connecting patients with endocrinologists, nutritionists and psychologists and enabling users to access monitoring and treatment plans via their communication channel of choice (e.g., WhatsApp) so they can better achieve their treatment goals and adhere to lifestyle changes.
The company also provides all of the supplies, like glucometer, test strips and blood testing kits, as well as medication. Though health plans start at MX$790 per month, the average patient will pay MX$40 per month with private insurance, Moguel said.
He explained that people living with diabetes in Latin America often begin treating their disease late, which can lower their life expectancy by 10 years. Clivi’s goal is to help patients get back four of those years.
Since going live in October 2021, Clivi’s platform has helped thousands of patients so far, 94% of whom have achieved diabetes control within six months, Moguel said. The company is currently seeing an average of 2,000 new patients join the platform each month. It also reached $2 million in annual recurring revenue over the past 15 months, and Moguel expects 10x that growth within the next 12 months.
Over the next five years, the company intends to serve 1 million people through its digital clinic and diabetes remote monitoring service, Moguel said.
Today, it announced $10 million in seed funding toward that goal. The investment was co-led by Dalus Capital and Foundation Capital, with participation from a group of investors, including Cathay Innovation via its C. Entrepreneurs fund; Femsa Ventures; Quiet Capital; 500; Next Billion Ventures; and Conexo. There was also a group of angel investors, including Jüsto founder and CEO Ricardo Weder, Kueski founder and CEO Adalberto Flores, Trust Networks co-founder Suresh Batchu, 99 and Mara founder and CEO Ariel Lambrecht, Meta executive Tara Syed and Reina Madre co-founders Vicente Aristegui and Juan Moctezuma.
The new funding will be used to finish out the product, including its artificial intelligence technology, so that more of the functions are automated and doctors can increase their capacity for treating patients, Moguel said. The company is also going to expand its work with enterprises and public health organizations in Mexico. He expects to “dominate the Mexican market and become the No. 1 diabetes clinic in Mexico within the next year.”
“This will help us to prepare the ground before we start expanding our solution to other Spanish-speaking territories across the region,” Moguel said. “This is the master plan to become not just the Livongo of Latin America, but the largest player in terms of diabetes and chronic conditions in the whole of Latin America.”

"Parrot, an AI-powered transcription platform that turns speech into text, raises $11M Series A",Kate Park,2023/06/20,"
Artificial intelligence touches many aspects of professional industries, including medicine, legal, business, information technology and more. AI-powered transcription service is one example that has become an integral part of those fields.
Parrot, a transcription platform offering speech-to-text depositions for the legal and insurance industry, said Tuesday it has raised $11 million in a Series A round. It also unveiled a new feature that summarizes deposition in mere seconds for legal experts.
Amplify Partners and XYZ Venture Capital co-led the latest capital, bringing its total raised to $14 million since its inception. The company declined to reveal its valuation when asked.
Attorney Eric Baum, his brother Bryan Baum and a team of engineers with expertise in AI and speech-to-text transcription founded Parrot in 2019. Eric, a long-time prosecutor who conducted depositions for the special victims unit of the state attorney’s office of Florida, saw firsthand the shortage of court reporters as demand for the deposition service continues to grow every year. He wanted to streamline the deposition process by using large language models (LLMs), not only for the legal industry but also for other sectors.
“The improvements in LLMs are the next paradigm shift, akin to the internet and mobile,” Amplify Partners general partner Mike Dauber said in a statement.
The CEO of Parrot, Aaron O’Brien, who has been in the tech space for more than 15 years and previously worked at tech firms like Flexport, Uber and Facebook, told TechCrunch that Parrot’s founding team saw an opportunity to bring much-needed technology to the legal industry that has been overlooked and underserved for a long time.
“You’ll often hear that lawyers are resistant to tech, but this hasn’t been our experience,” O’Brien told TechCrunch. “Attorneys are eager to adopt new technologies, but the solutions need to be trustworthy and purpose-built for their workflow.”
O’Brien met the Parrot founding team in 2021, introduced by Parrot’s early investors. The CEO has since helped the AI startup scale a growing deposition provider with global insurance carriers.
Parrot AI’s ultimate goal is to allow users to gather and synthesize information more efficiently in order to achieve better and faster outcomes by leveraging AI.
The startup plans to use the proceeds to ramp up investment in artificial intelligence for the legal and insurance domains and continue developing tools to address the industry’s challenges.
Customers in need of court transcription services typically must call or email a court-reporting vendor and wait days for confirmation, O’Brien said. Parrot lets users book a deposition and secure capacity with one click, and meeting-ready calendar links will be sent to all parties, O’Brien explained.
Another challenge Parrot wants to address is related to deposition review: After a deposition concludes, attorneys must request an expensive transcript, which takes more than ten days to receive. Parrot’s deposition review tools help attorneys access a fully searchable, highly accurate rough draft transcript synced with video and audio, which is one of the company’s highest-value features, O’Brien continued. In addition, Parrot securely stores a comprehensive archive of deposition transcripts, video and audio recordings, and more in its cloud-based platform, he noted.
“At the core of Parrot’s differentiated model is our highly specialized models that are trained extensively on proprietary and domain-specific data,” O’Brien said. “Parrot’s approach is not another enterprise’s solution built on top of generic API — it’s a suite of highly customized models, infrastructure and domain expertise years in the making that offers unprecedented accuracy for legal professionals.”
One customer, Aaron Warner, attorney at Warner & Fitzmartin, described the experience of Parrot as like “going from a Nokia to an iPhone.” According to the startup, once customers begin working with Parrot — from C-suite executives focused on budget and outcomes to the support staff responsible for scheduling depositions — they’re saying there’s no going back.
Hundreds of enterprises’ customers, including law firms, insurance companies, law enforcement and corporations, use Parrot for depositions, witness statements, examinations under oath and more. The outfit didn’t share its business metrics but noted that the four-year-old company generates revenue in the millions.

Hyperline is a billing platform for SaaS products,Romain Dillet,2023/06/20,"
Meet Hyperline, a new product that handles pricing and billing for software-as-a-service companies. The company provides integrations so that you can quickly start billing. It then supports different scenarios, such as recurring subscriptions, usage-based billing, custom discounts and more.
This isn’t the first company that focuses on pricing and billing — examples include Recurly and Chargebee. But these are complex revenue management platforms that don’t necessarily work well for small SaaS startups that are just getting started.
Alternatively, some companies choose to develop these pricing and billing features in house. But B2B software has changed quite a lot with sales negotiation processes and usage-based pricing. It can lead to mistakes.
When you have configured Hyperline, the company handles all things related to revenue. You can import your customer data from your database, configure your pricing rules, connect the platform with your CRM and leverage popular payment providers, such as Stripe or GoCardless.
After that, Hyperline generates invoices directly. It handles different VAT rates — this isn’t a paid add-on like on some platforms. The product then orchestrates payment requests, which means that it can automatically charge a card or a bank account.
Finally, Hyperline provides a monitoring dashboard so that you can see if there is any failed payment. You can also perform billing actions from there.
The startup raised a $4.4 million (€4 million) funding round led by Index Ventures a few months ago. Kima Ventures and Cocoa also participated in the round. Several business angels invested in the company as well, such as Rodolphe Ardant, Guilhem Bellion, Steve Avani, Thibaud Elziere, Quentin Nickmans, Alexandre Berriche and Nico Rosberg.
Iterating on pricing more regularly
By default, tech teams can interact with Hyperline using the company’s API. But “if companies want to configure it and use it in a ‘no-code’ way, they can do so. If you want to tweak your usage-based pricing, you don’t have to through the tech team,” founder Lucas Bédout told me.
And this is key to understanding Hyperline’s appeal. Many SaaS companies define their pricing strategy and then work on the product roadmap. Pricing and product features don’t necessarily evolve at the same time.
“There are discrepancies between pricing and the product team. Pricing is a project that companies do every couple of years. The company brings in consultants and we put everything back in place – it takes six months to a year to implement everything,” Index Ventures partner Julia Andre told me. “But pricing has an impact on acquisition and churn.”
With a product like Hyperline, pricing can become a continuous project. At the same time, Index Ventures is betting on a next-generation pricing and billing startup that could potentially perform better than legacy products.
Dozens of companies are already using the product, such as Gladia, a startup I covered earlier today and is running a usage-based pricing. As Hyperline starts scaling, it will have more data on SaaS revenue strategies and it will be able to make some recommendations to reduce churn, improve the average revenue per customer, etc. And that should also increase Hyperline’s bottom line as the company takes a small cut on each transaction.

"India ordered an investigation into Byju’s days before auditor and board members resigned, report says",Manish Singh,2023/06/22,"
India’s corporate affairs ministry ordered an investigation into edtech startup Byju’s last week, television news channel CNBC-TV18 reported Friday, further complicating matters at the most valuable Indian startup that lost its auditor and three board members on Thursday.
The ministry has taken cognizance of “various corporate governance lapses” at Byju’s, the television channel reported, citing unnamed sources.
The new probe follows the ministry asking Byju’s last year to explain why it hadn’t filed its audited financials. In late April, India’s crime-fighting agency searched three premises of edtech giant Byju’s and its founder Byju Raveendran, it said Saturday, and seized various “incriminating” documents and digital data.
Byju’s attracted intense scrutiny last year from the government, investors and creditors after it repeatedly failed to publish its accounts. In September, Byju’s finally published its accounts for the year ending March 2021, revealing revenue figures that fell short of its own projections.
Global giant Deloitte quit as the auditor of Byju’s and three board members resigned from the startup on Thursday, sending a shockwave through the industry. In a letter to the board on Thursday, Deloitte said that it had not undertaken the auditing of the edtech giant’s accounts for the year ending March 2022 and cited the delay as a reason for its resignation.
The Bengaluru-headquartered startup, also the world’s most valuable education technology company, is grappling with a series of challenges. It refused to make a $40 million payment earlier this month and counter-sued its lenders. Byju’s said its lenders were operating in “bad-faith negotiating tactics.” Lenders allege that Byju’s has technically defaulted on the loan.
The startup is also cutting about 1,000 jobs as it pushes to improve its finances. BlackRock cut Byju’s valuation by nearly two-thirds to $8.4 billion at the end of March this year, TechCrunch first reported.

"Lithuania’s capital Vilnius to get ‘Europe’s largest tech campus,’ costing €100M",Paul Sawers,2023/06/22,"
Lithuania is vying to become one of the major European tech hubs, bolstered by a growing number of so-called “unicorn” startups and governmental efforts to attract a high-profile accelerator to the country. At the same time, a new €100 million private initiative announced today is setting out to create what would be Europe’s largest tech campus, situated in the heart of Lithuania’s capital Vilnius.
Building on the site of an old Soviet-era sewing factory in the city’s New Town, Tech Zity, as the project is called, is touted to open in 2024 with office space for 5,000 workers, auditoriums for meetings and events, and more. In addition, a core selling point will be its focus on hybrid working, with a 24/7 ethos supported by co-living spaces, restaurants and bars for out-of-work socializing.
At 55,000 square metres (592,015 square feet), Tech Zity would be nearly two-thirds bigger than Station F in Paris, which opened back in 2017.
Zity slickers
Lithuania doesn’t always fall on the mainstream tech startup radar, but there has been some notable activity there these past few years. Second-hand clothes marketplace Vinted, for example, hit unicorn status back in 2019, going on to raise some $562 million at a $4.5 billion valuation with notable backers including Accel, Insight Partners and Lightspeed Venture Partners.
Then there’s Nord Security of NordVPN fame, which hit a $1.6 billion valuation last year off the back of its first institutional fundraise from the likes of private equity firm Novator, VC firm General Catalyst and WordPress co-creator Matt Mullenweg. Elsewhere, fledgling Vilnius-based fintech Kevin scooped a $65 million Series A last year from big-name backers including Accel.
To capitalize on this, Lithuania’s Ministry of the Economy and Innovation announced a €13 million open tender back in March to attract an “internationally acclaimed startup accelerator” to the country. So now would seem as good a time as any for the private realm to take up the mantle and build what Tech Zity touts as an “infrastructure first” campus replete with all the amenities a tech company might need.
The Tech Zity project’s funding hails from several sources. Of the planned €100 million fund required to fulfil the project, some €30 million has been committed so far, with Vinted co-founder and chief operating officer Mantas Mikuckas contributing around 80% of the initial tranche and Tech Zity founder Darius Žakaitis making up the remainder. This “primary” phase has involved buying the land and buildings, and laying the groundwork for the reconstruction required to transform the site. For the next phase, Tech Zity is looking to secure the additional €70 million from various sources, including banks and private investors.
“Our main goal is to foster the startup community,” Žakaitis explained to TechCrunch. “Currently, this community is scattered in different locations. Startups and tech companies highly value the opportunity to be together, exchange knowledge and experience. Most of them go through similar stages, face similar challenges and problems, such as growth hacking and bootstrapping with limited budgets, entering larger markets, leveraging AI capabilities, attracting investments and developing funds and more. The best answers to these questions can come from those who have already walked this path and have built successful startups.”
It’s worth noting that the “Tech Zity” brand already exists, as it is the name of the overarching real estate company behind the project which has already launched four smaller hubs across the Lithuanian capital and surrounding area. These include Tech Park, which was converted from an old hospital back in 2016 and is now home to a number of businesses, including Google’s main regional hub; Tech Loft, which is primarily targeted at seed-stage startups; Tech Arts, a hybrid co-working and events space; and Tech Spa, a work-resort crossover about an hour away from Vilnius.
Collectively, Tech Zity’s four existing locations amount to some 20,000 square meters, meaning that with its eponymous flagship campus opening next year, Tech Zity’s sprawling footprint will hit the 75,000-square-meters mark across the region.
A “Lithuanian Silicon Valley”
The Tech Zity Vilnius site is located less than two miles from the city center, and just a 10-minute walk from Vinted’s HQ and Nord Security, which recently moved into its new HQ in the new Cyber City complex. At first glance, the two initiatives seem fairly similar; however, Cyber City appears to be centred largely around companies affiliated with Lithuanian incubator and accelerator Tesonet, which helped birth the likes of Nord and Surfshark, which merged last year, as well as startups such as Oxylabs and CyberCare.
“We are not competing,” Žakaitis said. “On the contrary, we will collaborate to make this part of Vilnius a kind of Lithuanian Silicon Valley.”

One of the main goals during the conversion is to upcycle much of the original materials at the site, including adapting old sewing machine parts for chairs and phone booths, and repurposing old ventilation systems for boardroom tables and kitting out new kitchens.

As for living spaces, well, the current plan for Tech Zity Vilnius is to build 70 to 80 co-living loft spaces above the offices.
“These lofts will be designed for both short-term and long-term rentals, as we see the demand for such accommodation,” Žakaitis said. “They will not only serve the needs of companies operating within the project who receive guests, but also contribute to the project’s vitality 24/7. Additionally, we also plan to provide various services for employees and residents, such as a sports club, beauty services, restaurants and more.”
While startups will be a major target market for Tech Zity, it’s ultimately aimed at everyone from individual freelancers who can work from cafes or other shared working spaces, to companies ranging from five to 300 employees.
“We estimate that there are currently 18,000 employees working in Lithuania’s startup ecosystem,” Žakaitis said. “We aim to have a diverse audience that fosters connections within Lithuania’s startup ecosystem and drives the creation of new products. We are also open to and engaged in discussions not only with local companies but also with international companies interested in establishing a presence in Vilnius through the Invest Lithuania program or invited by the Bank of Lithuania, particularly in fintech.”

Inflection debuts its own foundation AI model to rival Google and OpenAI LLMs,Devin Coldewey,2023/06/22,"
Inflection, a well-funded AI startup aiming to create “personal AI for everyone,” has taken the wraps off the large language model powering its Pi conversational agent. It’s hard to evaluate the quality of these things in any way, let alone objectively and systematically, but a little competition is a good thing.
Inflection-1, as the model is called, is of roughly GPT-3.5 (AKA ChatGPT) size and capabilities — as measured in the computing power used to train them. The company claims that it’s competitive or superior with other models on this tier, backing it up with a “technical memo” describing some benchmarks it ran on its model, GPT-3.5, LLaMA, Chinchilla and PaLM-540B.
According to the results they published, Inflection-1 indeed performs well on various measures, like middle- and high school-level exam tasks (think biology 101) and “common sense” benchmarks (things like “if Jack throws the ball on the roof, and Jill throws it back down, where is the ball?”). It mainly falls behind on coding, where GPT-3.5 beats it handily and, for comparison, GPT-4 smokes the competition; OpenAI’s biggest model is well known to have been a huge leap in quality there, so it’s no surprise.
Inflection notes that it expects to publish results for a larger model comparable to GPT-4 and PaLM-2(L), but no doubt they are waiting until the results are worth publishing. At any rate, Inflection-2 or Inflection-1-XL or whatever is in the oven but not quite baked.
So far the community hasn’t formally divided AI models into the machine learning equivalent of boxing weight classes, but the concepts do map to one another quite well. You don’t expect a flyweight to go up against a heavyweight, they’re practically different sports. Same with AI models: a small one isn’t as capable as a large one, but the small one runs efficiently on a phone while the large one requires a data center. It’s an apples to oranges thing.
It’s still too early to attempt such a thing, since the field is still comparatively young and there’s no real consensus on what sizes and shapes of AI model should be considered of a feather.
Ultimately for most of these models the proof of the pudding is in the tasting, of course, and until Inflection opens up its model to widespread use and independent evaluation, all its vaunted benchmarks must be taken with a grain of salt. If you want to give Pi a shot, you can just add it on one of your messaging apps, or chat with it online here.

Falling into these 3 traps means you will never raise VC funding,Haje Jan Kamps,2023/06/22,"
Over the years, I’ve spoken with a quite a few startup founders. Many of them are smart, likable and have really great ideas that they’re able to convey in a pitch deck. Yet many of them struggle to get funded. Why is it so hard to get a term sheet?
If everything seems to be going well, but you’re not getting the traction you think you need for your fundraise, it’s probably because you’ve run into one of these three problems.
The market is too small
There are a number of incredibly cool products that just don’t have a market that’s big enough for general adoption. For example, it’s possible that you are building an accessory that makes crop-dusting fields 30% more efficient. On the surface, this may seem like a good product in a great market. The people who want to buy your product are excited about it, and you make sales pretty easily.
The problem, however: There are only so many crop-dusting planes in the world, which means that once you’ve reached market saturation — that is, every crop-dusting plane in the world is using your product — you are unlikely to make additional sales.
Crop dusting is obviously niche, but there are less obvious examples, too.
I recently spoke with a founder who had a really elegant solution for how to help people optimize their meal planning so the produce in the fridge that goes bad the soonest gets eaten first. On the surface, it’s an important problem: Reducing food waste is objectively good. The founders had spoken to a lot of potential customers, and everybody agreed — food waste is a problem, and they would love to have a solution. The pitfall was that the startup hadn’t asked its customers what they were willing to pay for the product. It turns out that this was a $100 piece of hardware, and that was the problem: The Venn diagram showing people who care enough about the problem to spend $100 on a piece of equipment to fix it and didn’t just throw the food out and buy new food when it went bad turned out to be almost nonexistent. "
AWS launches $100M program to fund generative AI initiatives,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/22,"
Amazon, keen to avoid being left behind in the hyper-competitive AI race, is launching a new program to bolster customers and partners focused on generative AI.
Called the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center, the program will put $100 million toward connecting AWS-affiliated data scientists, strategists, engineers and solutions architects with customers and partners to — as Amazon puts it in a press release — “accelerate enterprise innovation and success with generative AI.”
“Through free workshops, engagements and training, AWS will help customers imagine and scope the use cases that will create the greatest value for their businesses, based on best practices and industry expertise,” Amazon writes in a press release.
What’s that mean, exactly? I asked Sri Elaprolu, the head of the Generative AI Innovation Center and a senior data science manager at AWS, to explain in a little more detail.
Via email, Elaprolu clarified that the $100 million investment will specifically fund “people, technology and processes” around generative AI. That’s still a bit vague. But the idea, he said, will be to support work with AWS customers that helps them ideate, design and launch new generative AI products and services.
“We’ve been hearing from our enterprise customers that they’re very interested in generative AI — and they’re looking to AWS for help and guidance,” Elaprolu added. “The Innovation Center will help them build their plan for generative AI, identify and prioritize generative AI use cases that are aligned to business value, and develop proof-of-concept solutions and a path to bring solutions to a production-ready state, along with steps to scale.”
Participants in the Generative AI Innovation Center program will benefit from free workshops, engagements and training, plus access to AWS products such as the code-generating service CodeWhisperer and Bedrock platform for text-generating models.
As for who can participate, Elaprolu says that the Generative AI Innovation Center will initially prioritize working with customers who’ve previously reached out to AWS with “plans, goals or requests for assistance” with generative AI. Beyond that, the program will give precedence to organizations in the financial services, healthcare and life sciences, media and entertainment, automotive and manufacturing, energy and utilities and telecommunications sectors.
“Strategy and science experts from the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center will work with customers on brainstorming and problem formulation, help them identify best use cases for generative AI, work through challenges involved and define a clear path to success,” Elaprolu said. “It’ll also provide a wide range of expert services from advisory functions, such as exploring the best foundation model candidates to meet business objectives, and hands-on engagements, such as fine-tuning foundation models to meet specific needs.”
The launch of the Generative AI Innovation Center comes months after AWS kicked off a 10-week program for generative AI startups and debuted Bedrock, a platform to build generative AI-powered apps via pretrained third- and first-party models. AWS also recently announced that it would work with Nvidia to build “next-generation” infrastructure for training AI models — complementing its in-house Trainium hardware.
With these moves, AWS is trying — hard — to make the case that its platform is the one to beat where it concerns building and hosting generative AI apps. Can it? That remains to be seen, particularly in light of Bedrock’s… well, rocky start. Bloomberg reported in May that six weeks after Amazon demoed the tech with an unusually vague presser and just one testimonial, most cloud customers still didn’t have access.
To Amazon’s credit, though, AWS has managed to nab a number of high-profile customers in the generative AI space, including Stability AI (which selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider) and AI21 Labs. That counters — but perhaps doesn’t quite best, depending on who you ask — Google Cloud’s partnerships with Cohere and Anthropic and Microsoft’s tie-up with OpenAI.
Fortunately for Amazon, the market’s large — and growing. Grand View Research estimates that generative AI products and solutions could be worth close to $110 billion by 2030.
“Generative AI will be one of the most transformational technologies of our generation, tackling some of humanity’s most challenging problems, augmenting human performance and maximizing productivity,” Elaprolu said. “Our customers have always been at the forefront of innovation, and there are nearly endless possibilities and use cases for generative AI. It’s only just beginning.”
Amazon is only the latest to pledge substantial resources toward generative AI initiatives, it’s worth noting.
Salesforce Ventures, Salesforce’s VC division, plans to pour $500 million into startups developing generative AI technologies. Workday recently added $250 million to its existing VC fund specifically to back AI and machine learning startups. OpenAI, the company behind the viral chatbot ChatGPT, has raised a $175 million fund to invest in AI startups. And just this week, Dropbox launched a $50 million AI-focused venture fund.
Accenture and PwC, meanwhile, have announced that they plan to invest $3 billion and $1 billion, respectively, in AI.
Funds have steadily increased their positions in AI over the past few years, spurred recently by the growth in generative AI. According to GlobalData, AI startups received over $52 billion in funding across more than 3,300 deals in the last year alone.

Kibsi raises $9.3M for its no-code computer vision platform,Frederic Lardinois,2023/06/22,"
Kibsi is an Irvine, California-based startup that is building a no-code computer vision platform that allows businesses to build and deploy computer vision applications. Among the things that set Kibsi apart from many other players in this space is that it lets businesses reuse their existing cameras to create insights into virtually anything they want to track, be that in a warehouse, restaurant or on an airport ramp.
The company today announced that it has raised a total of $9.3 million in pre-seed and seed funding. The participants in these rounds were GTMfund, NTTVC (which led the $4 million pre-seed round), Preface Ventures, Ridge Ventures, Secure Octane and Wipro Ventures.
Image Credits: Kibsi
Tolga Tarhan, who is now Kibsi’s CEO, joined Rackspace in 2019 after the founding team sold AWS-focused consulting business Onica to Rackspace. He later became the company’s CTO. After the Rackspace IPO, he decided that his journey in the company had come full circle. Together with co-founders and former Onica execs Amanda McQueen, Amir Kashani and Eric Miller, the team looked at what they could build next.
“I wanted to go get out and go create again,” Tarhan told me. “We wanted something that had an IoT orientation to it — because we’ve done a lot of IoT at Onica, was a big part of our business. We wanted it to be software — we had done enough consulting for multiple lifetimes. And we wanted it to be something involving AI, because we thought IoT by itself was almost old news. How do we combine these things? And as we thought about that space and our experience and where we got into roadblocks with customers, we realized that many customers are having trouble implementing computer vision.”
Image Credits: Kibsi
He noted that too often, computer vision projects in large enterprises fail even though they have the cameras and the talent to work on models. But to ingest stream from their cameras to then run the models takes a lot of undifferentiated work — and integrating all of this with downstream applications presents another set of integration challenges. So the team decided to build a computer vision platform that enables businesses to use their existing cameras and then combine that with a user experience that quickly enables users to gain real business value from this data. The platform lets users run their own computer vision models or Kibsi’s own and it then presents the results in a way that matches the business intent, both in Kibsi’s own user interface and through an API.
“We don’t return X and Y coordinates of people and objects,” said Tarhan. “If you’re thinking about a business analyst’s job, they don’t really care that a person is standing at this coordinate — what they want to know is: did that person interact with that merchandise?”
Image Credits: Kibsi
Kibsi has already attracted attention from customers like Owens Corning. Yet while manufacturing is a natural environment for computer vision, the Kibsi team also counts the likes of Whisker, which is embedding Kibsi’s tech into their litter robot, and the Woodland Park Zoo among its customers.
“Tracking animal behavior and interactions requires our professionals to sift through hours of camera footage,” said Bonnie Baird, animal welfare scientist at Woodland Park Zoo. “We are excited to add Kibsi’s computer vision capabilities to our existing cameras to gain valuable
insights about our animals and their well-being.”
While there are also obvious use cases for Kibsi in the smart city space (and its investor NTT is a major player there), Tarhan noted that the sales cycles there are quite slow. “As a startup, it’s not the best place to play day one,” he said.
Kibsi offers a free trial of their platform for developers, with a more comprehensive developer plan starting at $99/month. For premium and enterprise pricing plans, potential customers need to contact the company directly.

Warming public markets are boosting the secondary market for startup shares,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/22,"
The late-stage startup market is sorting out how to value startups that had raised capital during the previous venture boom — Tiger Global Management recently resorted to selling individual stakes in its portfolio companies after failing to sell a basket of its stakes.
Frankly, it wasn’t shocking to hear that happening in this climate — when you can buy stakes in startups for cheap, why not pick and choose?

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

More interestingly, it appears certain venture investors are snapping up secondary shares in startups. According to a report by Insider, some VCs are even turning to secondary markets to buy shares in the hottest AI startups.
This uptick in secondary market activity is not new. PitchBook wrote last December that while “volume of shares being offered by sellers continues to greatly outweigh interest from buyers […] institutional buyers are slowly coming back to scoop up secondary stakes.”
And according to data from secondary exchange Caplight, bids for secondary shares perked up after tech stocks plummeted in early 2023. In turn, that led to a smaller bid-ask spread between buyers and sellers of secondary shares.
All we had to do was wait for late-stage startup shareholders to capitulate to new valuation realities and tech valuations to perk up slightly. The combination of seller pessimism and modest buyer optimism has seemingly done the trick.

Robinhood acquires credit card startup X1 for $95M,Christine Hall,2023/06/22,"
Robinhood announced on Thursday that it was acquiring X1, a no-fee credit card startup, for $95 million in cash.
X1, which offers an income-based credit card with rewards, raised a total of $62 million in venture-backed funding from investors like Soma Capital, FPV, Craft Ventures and Spark Capital since its 2020 inception. The company announced its most recent raise of $15 million in December, when it also touted a 50% boost in its valuation.
On the one hand, while X1’s valuation is not known, it looks like Robinhood is getting a good deal with $95 million. If you take a look at recent raises by other credit card companies, you might say that X1 raising $62 million should yield a high valuation in the hundreds of millions. So, the purchase price may reflect the dip in fintech valuations we’ve seen in the past six months. 
For example, Petal raised $140 million in 2022 at an $800 million valuation. Granted, Petal has been around longer and raised more. A better example might be Yonder, a U.K.-based credit card startup that raised $15.4 million in April at an $89 million post-money valuation, converted in today’s U.S. dollar from the pound. 
On the other hand, Robinhood noted in its announcement that this move is “an important step in our journey toward broadening our product offerings and deepening our relationship with existing customers.” Not only has crypto trading slowed down, but its core trading business overall saw declines in May, most likely prompting that desire to diversify its business. 
Indeed, the acquisition of X1 gets Robinhood into the credit card business with the interchange fee revenue that comes with it. Robinhood currently earns interchange fees from its debit card. The startup first made headlines for its unique model, which allows it to underwrite customers based on their income rather than their credit scores. (Since then, other players have emerged with similar models — such as Tomo Credit, which offers credit based on cash flow rather than credit). X1 doesn’t charge an annual fee for its stainless steel Visa card, has no late or foreign transaction fees and rewards users with “points.” The company also claims that its card is “smart” in that it has built software features that work with the credit card.
X1 co-founders Deepak Rao and Siddharth Batra will oversee the new business for Robinhood, and Rao will serve as general manager of credit cards. 
Robinhood said it expects the deal to close in the third quarter of this year.

Plaid unveils new collaboration network aimed at giving fintechs a way to share fraud intelligence,Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/06/22,"
Want more fintech news in your inbox? Sign up here.
Fintech startup Plaid got its start as a company that connects consumer bank accounts to financial applications, but has since been gradually expanding its offerings to offer more of a full-stack onboarding experience.
And today, Plaid is announcing even more new product releases that moves the company into a whole new direction while also helping to diversify its revenue streams.
At the top of that lies Beacon, which it is describing as a “collaborative anti-fraud network enabling financial institutions and fintech companies to share critical fraud intelligence via API across Plaid.”
Plaid is launching Beacon today with 10 founding members, including Tally, Credit Genie, Veridian Credit Union and Promise Finance. Its argument for the need for such a network is that banks today already have access to shared fraud intelligence networks, but most companies don’t have access to the same types of tools.
“The idea behind Beacon is that the vast majority of fraud that any one fintech sees has been seen by another fintech before,” Alain Meier, former Cognito CEO and current head of identity at Plaid, told TechCrunch in an interview. “So essentially, what that means is that everyone is rebuilding the same anti-fraud mechanisms in order to try to catch what is frequently the exact same fraud, which means there’s a lot of wasted money and there’s a lot of wasted time.” 
Beacon represents Plaid’s effort to give fintechs a way to report fraud instances to each other. Participating members of the network will contribute by reporting instances of fraud — including stolen, synthetic and account takeovers — to Plaid. From there, they can then screen new signups or users against the Beacon network to detect if a specific identity has been associated with fraud on other Plaid-powered platforms or already within their own organization. For example, a fintech can share that a particular stolen identity was just used to sign up for one of their accounts. When that same stolen identity is used to sign up for a different fintech, the business is able to “properly look at the transaction, protect the business and the consumers associated with that identity,” Meier said.
Image Credits: Plaid
Beacon is now available to fintechs and financial institutions of all sizes and Plaid’s 8,000+ customers. A business will pay Plaid to become a member of the network.
The goal of the new offering is twofold, according to Meier. 
“One, it’s to help the businesses to more efficiently and accurately find fraud that’s going on in their systems and to stop it from having this chain reaction of moving between different fintechs,” he said. “And then, secondarily, we also want to give consumers a mechanism by which they’re able to protect their identities.”
It is also significant, in Plaid’s view, considering that regulators are giving increased scrutiny to fintechs, in an effort to make sure that they’re “adhering to the same levels of security and compliance that the banks have for many years.”
Plaid spent about a year building out the product, which Meier acknowledged was “a very hard product to launch.”
When it comes to mitigating its own risk, Plaid says that it is operating the network with the same goal of securing sensitive information in the same way it works to secure financial account data. Beacon, it says, does not share personal identifiable information back to participating companies, only whether the identity information they are screening has been associated with fraud on other platforms. The company also emphasizes that is not used for decisioning, noting that “what Beacon does is offer customers an additional layer of fraud intelligence that customers can then use to do step up verifications or other security checks.”
The company also last week announced a new feature called Remember Me, which allows a user who has completed verification of their identity to opt in and have their identity remembered the next time they are asked for verification.
In January of 2022, it acquired Cognito, which offered identity verification and help with issues like know your customer (KYC) rules, and anti-money laundering requirements, for $250 million. The company then moved into offerings related to what it called “onboarding optimization” and risk and fraud mitigation.
Plaid also made a push on the payments side, with products such as Transfer and Signal, which allow the movement of money and the evaluation of the risk of moving money, respectively. (It now claims to analyze more than $2 billion in transactions each month.)
“We’ve had really great success with having very high attach rates for our new products so we’re feeling good about our multi-product strategy right now,” said Meier.

Omeat emerges from stealth with beefy tech approach to cultivated meat growth media,Christine Hall,2023/06/22,"
If you’ve been paying attention to the food tech industry lately, you saw a lot of movement in the past week around both Good Meat and Upside Foods receiving U.S. Department of Agriculture approval to commercially sell their respective cultivated chicken products in the U.S.
Omeat, a cultivated meat startup out of Los Angeles, not only wants to be the next one to achieve similar regulatory approval, it believes it has cracked the code on how to reduce the traditionally high costs to scale production of cultivated meat that can run thousands of dollars per liter.
The company, founded by Ali Khademhosseini four years ago, was developed at the Terasaki Institute for Biomedical Innovation. Prior to starting Omeat, Khademhosseini was growing human tissues for medical applications after studying at MIT. As he learned more about animal agricultural practices, he shifted his focus to developing a scalable method for growing cultivated meat.
Omeat has a patent-pending technological approach that “enables the cultivation of any meat in a way that is orders-of-magnitude more sustainable and humane than the conventional approach,” CEO Khademhosseini told TechCrunch.
He explained that the process uses regenerative factors extracted humanely from cow plasma to make growth media, which is a big driver of the high cost of cultivated meat, and why some companies choose to make their own.
Plasma collection from the cows happens weekly and is similar to how humans donate plasma, Khademhosseini said. And not just from any cow, but Omeat specifically sources growth media from free-roaming herd cows that graze on its regenerative farm in California designed in collaboration with Kristina Horback at UC Davis.
It is then developed into the growth media, and that one type of media can then be used to grow any kind of meat, including beef, pork, chicken or fish. Omeat is starting with beef.
The company is currently building a pilot plant and expanding its team toward commercial readiness after raising $40 million of Series A capital in 2022 from investors, including S2G Ventures, Google Ventures, Bold Capital Partners, Tyson Ventures, Rethink Food, Trailhead Capital and Cavallo Ventures.
Omeat scaled its current plant capacity to 200-liter bioreactors, and the pilot plant will have the ability to scale bioreactors to 2,000 liters and 10,000 liters, which Khademhosseini said are the sizes needed, based on global demand, to generate meat at cost parity with traditional beef.
“One cow providing plasma weekly can create many cows’ worth of meat annually,” Khademhosseini said. “Our vision is to make this so economically viable that we will have lots of people from the existing food supply world actually encouraged to partner with us in order to raise profits and address the razor-thin margins that exist right now.”

We’ve officially entered a new era of ‘cultivated’ meat production

Acryl Data raises $21M to grow its enterprise data catalog platform,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/22,"
With the explosion of different kinds of data, companies are struggling to realize meaningful value from their stored data. Data teams are overworked — forced to cater to the needs of disparate departments within an organization while trying to maintain data policies consistently.
That’s the shared thesis of Shirshanka Das and Swaroop Jagadish, at least, the co-founders of Acryl Data, a startup providing tools to help companies organize and ostensibly better manage their data. Acryl today announced that it raised $21 million in a Series A round led by 8VC with participation from Sherpalo Ventures and Guillermo Rauch, founder and CEO of Vercel, bringing its total raised to $30 million.
Prior to launching Acryl Data, Das was a principal staff software engineer at LinkedIn and, before that, a member of the technical teams first at PayPal and then at Yahoo! (full disclosure: TechCrunch’s owner). Jagadish came to Acryl by way of Airbnb as well as LinkedIn and Yahoo!
“Acryl Data is a community-driven metadata platform that delivers central controls across the decentralized data stack,” Jagadish, the CEO, told TechCrunch in an email interview. “With a mission to bring clarity to data, Acryl offers a data catalog with solutions for data discovery, governance, lineage and observability.”
What exactly is a data catalog? Well, it’s an inventory of data assets in an organization. Data catalogs consist of metadata in which definitions of database objects are stored, such as base tables, indexes, users and user groups.
Data catalogs are a dime a dozen — see startups such as Castor, Stemma, Select Star and Alation offer them, to name a few. But Jagadish argues that Acryl’s approach offers several key advantages over rivals.
Chief among them, Acryl’s platform — which is built on the open source framework DataHub — operates on “event-driven” metadata. By only performing operations when triggered, Acryl can reduce the cost of data catalog maintenance while enabling a range of trigger-based workflows, Jagadish claims.
“The explosion of data over the past decade has led companies to embrace a range of new technologies, but has created a fragmented data landscape as well,” he added. “Some problems got easier, like data orchestration, transformation, storage, movement and visualization — but other problems re-emerged as challenges, like data discovery, data quality and data management. Attempts to solve the problem — like traditional governance and observability tools — have been unnecessarily siloed, leading to further inefficiencies and inconsistent solutions … Acryl is designed to help teams move from simple data visibility to data insight, from insight to action and from action to automation.”
Beyond this, Acryl offers an “observability” module designed for monitoring data quality in real time. The module, aptly dubbed Observe, monitors and attempts to spot data quality issues — in theory helping to prevent data breakages and drive faster resolutions where they do occur.
Using Acryl, customers can also perform metadata tests, which surface areas for cost optimization, like expensive or underused data assets. The configurable monitors driving these tests let users define and continuously evaluate a set of conditions on the data assets in an organization.
“Our most common ‘competitor’ is the status quo of custom development, as data engineers establish manual processes and protocols on their own rather than implement a more automated solution,” Jagadish said.
Acryl has ambitious plans for the future, including AI features that’ll “intelligently curate” metadata and suggest business glossary tags and terms to more thoroughly document data catalogs. In addition, the company aims to launch an AI-powered tool to generate summaries that describe the key characteristics of a given data catalog, like its reliability and usage.
Acryl, which has a 25-person workforce, isn’t disclosing too much about its customer base. But the startup did reveal that it counts Notion, Zendesk, Robinhood, OVO Energy, BetterUp and Riskified among its clients.
Das added that DataHub, which he founded while at LinkedIn and which Acryl’s staff maintains, is used by companies like Pinterest, Stripe, Optum, Expedia, Saxo Bank and Peloton. He’s optimistic that the features Acryl’s building on top of DataHub will convince at least a few of those to convert.
“The fast rate of change in the data ecosystem presents a challenge for businesses and vendors alike,” Jagadish said. “As issues inevitably arise, Acryl increases productivity for data teams. Business users have a central resource to ask and address questions, rather than ad hoc processes for each issue, while data professionals can use Acryl’s lineage and impact analysis features to reduce time to resolution of data issues significantly.”

Heard Technologies grabs another $15M to develop therapist accounting tools,Christine Hall,2023/06/22,"
It’s hard to run a business and help customers at the same time. And with more people seeking mental health practitioners these days, therapists are feeling a similar struggle to balance patients and paperwork.
Victoria Li and Andrew Riesen started Heard Technologies in 2019 to reduce the burden from all of that back-end office work, like bookkeeping, taxes and payroll, so therapists can spend more time with patients.
“There still remains a lot of opportunity to build provider-first and provider-focused solutions,” CEO Riesen told TechCrunch. “Much of the innovation has been around care accessibility or at the intersection of payers or employers. We’re building a solution that gives providers a bit more time and space back, both physically and emotionally, given the work that they do.”
Solo practitioners pay $199 per month to be a part of Heard, while group practices pay $299 per month. Annual subscriptions are discounted. There is also a payroll add-on for $40 per month.
Seattle-based Heard began in 2019 like some of those other companies — for example, Frame, Alma and Headway — helping provide access to care. The company had about 100 therapists paying for the solution, said Riesen, who saw this play out firsthand through his therapist wife.
However, after seeing how difficult it was to even start a practice, the team spent 2020 looking at pain points and challenges, which included integrating telehealth as the global pandemic surged.
Riesen explained that at the time, many therapists shifted from being part of a large group to starting independent practices, which presented new challenges of forming a business entity, tracking income and expenses, billing, payroll and taxes — things they may not have done before.

“We help them really understand their practice as a small business,” Riesen said. “Among the companies providing medical billing, electronic health record systems and care accessibility solutions, we’re slotted into that accounting back office, supporting them with those core bookkeeping, payroll and tax needs.”
Heard raised $1.3 million in seed funding to launch its general ledger offering in 2021 and then raised another $10 million in Series A funding in 2022. In the past year, the company saw both its customer base and revenue grow by five times, Riesen said. Meanwhile, employee count grew from 20 to 35.
Today, the company announced $15 million in new funding, which Riesen is calling an extension of its Series A round. It was led by Headline with participation from GGV Capital and follow-on from investors, including Footwork, Founders’ Co-Op, Act One and Heron Rock. The new investment gives Heard $26.3 million in total funding to date.
With the new funding, Heard will tackle automation and scaling technologies as it also expands its offerings in the areas of practice formation, banking and retirement.
The company also recently rounded out its leadership team with the addition of chief operating officer KK Mulligan and head of support Brandon Wolf. Heard is also hiring for a vice president of engineering and head of tax operations, Riesen said.
“There’s a lot of opportunity in the accounting space to both improve and automate the annual tax filing experience and build on our core accounting features,” Riesen added. “Our ultimate goal is to be the financial back office for therapists in private practice. We’ve also seen a lot of requests from our clinicians around financial planning and retirement planning, so we’re spending time on delivering a more effective and seamless solution there.”

SoulCycle to offer trainer-guided virtual work sessions with the FLOWN startup,Mike Butcher,2023/06/22,"
FLOWN is a startup that took the idea of “virtual co-working” some of us did during the pandemic and created a model of guided “deep work” sessions with actual coaches. Billing itself as a “Twitch for work,” the platform says it works best with remote workers, of which there are now millions, of course. Last year it raised a seed round to take the idea to the next level.
It’s now partnering with iconic exercise brand SoulCycle to bring its “energizing workout” methodology to the masses.
SoulCycle-led focus sessions — called “Flocks” — will be available to all SoulCycle and FLOWN members starting June 26.
One of the most recognized wellness brands globally — best known for its spin classes that border on a religious experience for some — SoulCycle is clearly tapping into a new area where charismatic “trainers” can motivate a group in a new setting.
FLOWN already runs 50+ live focus sessions a week, led by their own facilitators, where professionals and students work silently together, on-camera, using a technique called “body doubling.”
If you’ve ever preferred to work in a library, café or co-working space alongside other human beings, you’re doing something that comes pretty naturally, and is often more motivating that working at home on your own. Indeed, during the pandemic, many of us found ourselves switching on Zoom to work silently alongside friends or colleagues, just for the company.
This natural behavior has now evolved into a burgeoning new area for startups, and even now has it’s own nomenclature. So-called “body doubling” is the act of working alongside someone else, and is said to provides focus, accountability and feeling of community.
This trend of virtual, guided coaching seems to be gaining momentum and is morphing from fitness and exercise (witness SoulCycle’s move with FLOWN) into other forms. Peoplehood, led by SoulCycle founders Elizabeth Cutler and Julie Rice, is poised to launch “gathers,” where strangers discuss their deepest hopes and fears.
Body doubling has also become popular over the last few years as a way to alleviate the effects of ADHD, the rates of diagnoses for which have skyrocketed post-pandemic.
Although body doubling has ben recommended to people with ADHD, others are picking up on the technique. FLOWN claims its subscribers report a “5x increase” in their productivity as a result of a session — although it was not able to independently verify this claim.
SoulCycle instructors will now join FLOWN’s “Flocks,” injecting SoulCycle’s brand of motivation into the platform. These communal experiences can range from decluttering one’s home, to completing tax returns or practicing an instrument.
Alicia Navarro, founder and CEO of FLOWN, said in a statement: “In a post-COVID, AI-saturated world, there is a deep need for accountability structures that leverage real humans and secular rituals. I started FLOWN to bring these structures into how we focus at work, and SoulCycle’s approach was an inspiration to me at the time.”
I asked Evelyn Webster, CEO of SoulCycle, what the tipping point was that secured her decision to work with Flown.
“When Alicia and I were chatting about each of our respective businesses it became quickly apparent that we share a common purpose — to help our community live their best lives. With so much overlap in our purpose — and at a point when SoulCycle was looking to more actively engage our community in ways that move beyond the bike — the partnership seemed a natural one,” she said.
What does she make of this new “body-doubling” trend?
“I think whatever helps people succeed is great! As I have learned more about how body doubling has helped many people gain greater focus and therefore productivity, it’s clearly a tool that works. And of course when we ride as a community at Soul, what is keeping us accountable? It’s the instructor guiding us through a class, together with 60 other riders in the room keeping you focused, on beat and fired up…so we know it works.”
And why does she think Soul Cycle customers will gravitate toward FLOWN’s product?
“Wellness is so much more than just physical fitness. Our community is always looking for ways in which to make themselves stronger, whether that’s on the bike or in other parts of their lives. We believe this is a great addition to our offering, and a natural extension for the brand,” she added.

Avatar startup Genies launches $1M fund for developers building AR experiences,Lauren Forristal,2023/06/22,"
Genies, the Bob Iger-backed avatar tech company, announced Thursday the launch of its Developer Engagement Fund to reward developers that build AR experiences via Genies’ recently announced developer kit. The total fund size is $1 million.
Genies will reward certain developers based on the level of traction, such as how many users are participating in the avatar experience, how frequently they’re engaging and how many users are interacting with the digital items within the experience.
The startup introduced its developer kit in May, which gives select developers access to Genies’ full tech stack, allowing them to launch mini-apps, customize avatars to fit their aesthetic and create experiences from mini-games to virtual “social worlds,” according to the company.

Avatar startup Genies hits $1 billion valuation in latest raise

The mini-apps will launch within Genies’ upcoming super app, which is expected to roll out this fall. The network includes Genies’ Silver Studio, a DIY digital fashion app (still in beta) where users dress up and personalize their avatars.
The developer kit also includes XR (extended reality) compatibility, which means the avatar experiences have the potential to perform well in mobile AR, AR glasses and VR headsets. However, at the start, the experiences will launch on mobile.
“We think this is really important, especially in the context of Apple Vision Pro,” Genies CEO Akash Nigam told TechCrunch in an interview. “In 2017, when we were building this, we knew that at one point we were going to live in an augmented world. And when that did happen, any type of social or interactive experience that you wanted to do with your friends, whether it was a mini-game or some type of social network, or use case, you’re going to need an avatar as a prerequisite… The XR compatibility tech makes it so that any of these avatars or creations can spawn effectively and performantly in an AR world.”
The new engagement fund and the developer kit are by application only. The first batch of developers to be accepted for the fund will mainly be college students and other beginners that are selected for Genies’ Developer Incubator, which provide mentorship and tips for how to launch their own AR experiences.
The company will launch the first cohort this summer. Developers can submit their applications through the Genies website.
“We want to be able to work hands-on with each of the developers to be able to cultivate their experiences through the dev kit,” Nigam told us. “We really want to make sure that people are leveraging these avatars in a way that’s going to be additive to the entire ecosystem…We want to make sure that we can incentivize them to build experiences the right way.”
Nigam said Genies is selective about the developers they accept. The developers are required to have a few years of coding experience to fully understand the technology.
“We have built it in a way that, over time, you can have almost little to no technical expertise to be able to create an avatar experience,” he added.
Initially, the company plans on accepting hundreds of developers to participate in the million-dollar pool and be rewarded on a monthly basis. By early 2024, Genies will accept thousands of developers.
“It’s really based on how many developers we can best support in the very beginning,” Nigam said.

"Deloitte, three board members quit edtech giant Byju’s",Manish Singh,2023/06/22,"
Global giant Deloitte quit as the auditor of Byju’s and three board members resigned from the most valuable Indian startup on Thursday, sending a shockwave through the industry, a year after the Indian firm’s tardy financial reporting attracted global scrutiny.
Byju’s, valued at $22 billion, in a statement termed Deloitte’s resignation as a “planned transition” and refuted resignations of its board members. Deloitte, which fanned concerns as it submitted its resignation to Byju’s board, was slated to work with the Indian startup until 2025. The startup said it has appointed BDO (MSKA & Associates) as its statutory auditor.
In a letter to Byju’s board on Thursday, Deloitte said that it had not undertaken the auditing of the edtech giant’s accounts for the year ending March 2022 and cited the delay as a reason for its resignation.
It added:
The financial statements of the company for the year ended March 31, 2022 are long delayed. In accordance with the Companies Act, 2013, the audited financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2022 were due to be laid before shareholders in the Annual General Meeting by September 30, 2022.
We have also not received any communication on the resolution of the audit report modifications in respect of the year ended March 31, 2021, status of the audit readiness of the financial statements and the underlying books and records for the year ended March 31, 2022 and we have not been able to commence the audit as on date.
As a result, there will be significant impact on our ability to plan, design, perform and complete the audit in accordance with the applicable auditing standards. In view of the aforesaid, we are tendering our resignation as statutory auditors of the company with immediate effect.
Byju’s attracted intense scrutiny last year from the government, investors and creditors after it repeatedly failed to publish its accounts. In September, Byju’s finally published its accounts for the year ending March 2021, revealing revenue figures that fell short of its own projections.
The company did not address the concerns raised by Deloitte but said it extends its “sincere gratitude” to the outgoing auditor.
GV Ravishankar of Peak XV Partners (formerly known as Sequoia India and Southeast Asia), Vivian Wu of Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and Russell Dreisenstock of Prosus have stepped down from the board, a person familiar with the matter said.
In response, Byju’s said: “A recent media report suggesting the resignations of board members from Byju’s is entirely speculative. Byju’s firmly denies these claims and urges media publications to refrain from spreading unverified information or engaging in baseless speculation.”
Byju’s co-founders — Byju Raveendran and Divya Gokulnath — and Riju Raveendran continue to sit at the startup’s board.
The startup, also the world’s most valuable education technology company, is grappling with a series of challenges. It refused to make a $40 million payment earlier this month and counter-sued its lenders. Byju’s said its lenders were operating in “bad-faith negotiating tactics.” Lenders allege that Byju’s has technically defaulted on the loan.
The startup is also cutting about 1,000 jobs as it pushes to improve its finances. BlackRock cut Byju’s valuation by nearly two-thirds to $8.4 billion at the end of March this year, TechCrunch first reported.

Bridge 2 Technologies is making it easier for companies to find diverse vendors,Ron Miller,2023/06/22,"
Bridge 2 Technologies began with the notion that it should be easier for companies to find a diverse set of vendors. The company formed three years ago with the idea of bringing these two groups together in a two-way marketplace.
Today, the company announced the official launch of the Bridge 2 Technologies vendor marketplace with around 500 corporations and 3,000 vendors on an AI-fueled platform. It had been in beta for a couple of years.
Founder and CEO Eric Kelly says that he has been working to bring people together for years, but at a diversity conference a few years ago, he became enamored with the idea of creating a digital platform where corporations could find a curated set of diverse vendors.
It’s really about networking and communications. “If Slack and LinkedIn had a baby this is what it would look like,” Kelly told TechCrunch, but the platform was built with a focus on finding diverse vendors. “It really was the development efforts of the large corporations, the diverse companies, the leaders in that industry, saying what are the things that we need to do to actually connect everyone together,” he said.
Kelly said the idea for the platform was born at a one-day conference in New York a few years ago, which brought together corporate leaders and the leaders from diverse companies. It went so well, they wanted a way to keep these groups connected.
“As we talked about it, [the participants] said we don’t have a way of connecting in a meaningful way to find the corporations that are ready to scale, finding the talent. And so I raised my hand and said, ‘OK guys, I’ll build a platform if you help me build the ecosystem.’ And that’s how it started,” Kelly recalled.
While many companies such as government contractors have a mandate to work with a diverse group of vendors, it’s often a challenge to find and vet them. That’s why it was a goal for the platform to be highly curated, so the corporations looking for vendors would be working with a set of companies that have passed some sort of diversity certification from a vendor perspective, and can handle the needs of a large corporation.
“So that’s why it’s invitation-only. So when they go to the platform, they know that company has already been curated either by them or by one of the large certification bodies that they’ve already done business with,” Kelly said.
The plan was originally to launch with just 250 vendors, but they are actually launching today with ,ore than 3,000. Kelly said they took a very deliberate approach to building the platform, not taking any venture capital, so that they could take their time and get it right before launching.
The AI on the back end helps deliver the right content to the right person or company, while translating and taking care of other tasks that can make the platform easier to use.
While the platform is intended to help companies find diverse vendors, an altruistic goal to be sure, it’s still a for-profit venture, says Kelly. As such, both vendors and corporations pay for the privilege of being on the platform, driving revenue from both sides of the house. Pricing is still being worked out.

Plastic upcycling startup Kubik closes $3.34M seed to scale production in Ethiopia,Annie Njanja,2023/06/22,"
The amount of plastic waste produced globally is on track to triple to over 1,000 million tons by 2060. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report predicts that developed countries will continue to produce the most plastic waste per person, although emerging regions like Africa and Asia are expected to experience the fastest growth owing to rapid population growth and urbanization.
Plastic pollution is already a menace said to be altering environments and endangering lives, but there is a glimmer of hope as the share of recycled plastic is expected to nearly double over the same period to 17% as plastic going through waste management systems increases.
In Africa, Kubik, an upcycling startup with operations in Kenya and Ethiopia, is among the companies that are leading plastic waste reuse and sustainability efforts in the continent’s nascent recycling sector, which currently salvages only 4% of the waste produced.
The startup turns hard-to-recycle plastic waste (polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene) into affordable building materials, removing 45,000 kg of plastic waste from landfills every day. The startup is now planning to double down on the production of building materials in Ethiopia before scaling to other countries within Africa, against the backdrop of a recently closed $3.34 million seed funding round.
Founded by Kidus Asfaw and Penda Marre in 2021, Kubik plans to scale production at its plant in Ethiopia later this year, saying it has the capacity to build over a quarter million square meters of wall surface area every year.
“This can build anywhere up to 10,000 affordable homes per year, for example. Speaking of affordable housing, there is a 300M+ deficit of housing units globally that are considered affordable to the poor. This is a $2T+ market we have an opportunity to address, and we are just getting started,” said Asfaw, the CEO of the company, which won Startup of the Year at the 2023 Global Startup Awards and was declared the leading climate tech startup in Africa at last week’s VivaTech conference.
Investors that took part in the round include Plug and Play, Bestseller Foundation, GIIG Africa Fund, Satgana, Unruly Capital, Savannah Fund, African Renaissance Partners, Kazana Fund, Princeton Alumni Angels, and Andav Capital.
“We are thrilled to invest and partner with Kubik on their transformative journey. Their purpose-driven vision, exceptional team, and unique business model — combining positive social impact, circular economy, and low-carbon construction — positions Kubik as a scalable and sustainable solution to Africa’s most pressing challenges,” said climate tech VC Satgana co-founder Romain Diaz.
Kubik develops interlocking building materials, which include bricks, columns, beams and jambs, allowing developers to erect walls without the need for cement, aggregates, and steel. Asfaw says this does not compromise the building’s integrity and that the strength of walls built with its products is at par with cement-based walls.
He added that Kubik’s products cost at least 40% less per square meter and have chemical properties that make them safe, anti-flammable and nondegradable. Besides, he says, these products are low carbon, with a greenhouse gas emission of “at least 5x less than cement-based products.”
Asfaw says the materials’ affordability can play a role in bridging the current housing deficit that is partly driven by a growing urban population and hefty costs of construction. The startup is driving this change even as global appeals continue for governments to introduce policies that lessen plastic waste and encourage a more circular use of the plastics.
“The world is urbanizing dramatically fast today, and cities are feeling the burden of unmanaged plastic waste, unaffordable living conditions (especially in housing), and the impact of climate change. Our company plays a role in addressing all three of these challenges through a lower-carbon, lower-cost building solution that removes plastic waste from the environment. We believe this is why there is a lot of excitement in our company and its mission,” said Asfaw.
“We have a product that is transforming how we build sustainably and more affordably, and we see ourselves becoming a company that will continue to drive technology into the materials used for decarbonizing the built environment faster.”

"Sequoia debuts Atlas, an interactive guide to the European tech talent landscape",Paul Sawers,2023/06/21,"
There is an estimated 3 million software engineers in Europe, depending on what report you want to believe, but finding the right engineers for the job at hand isn’t all that straightforward. London or Paris might well have the highest concentration of software engineers, but knowing what locales offer the best access to specific disciplines is an entirely different ballgame, particularly in such a geographically distributed continent as Europe.
This is something that venture capital (VC) juggernaut Sequoia is seeking to address with a new online interactive tool called Atlas, which, while built primarily with its own portfolio founders in mind, it’s releasing to the general public today too.
Atlas meshes various qualitative and quantitative data collection methods, including a talent survey of 1,035 participants; a survey of 125 recruiters from European tech companies; 17 “in-depth” interviews with founders and recruiters; and aggregated data from third-party sources such as Dealroom, SeekOut, Remote, Ledgy, and GitHub. At its core, Atlas attempts to present a picture of the current European technical talent landscape, incorporating the 27 members states of the European union plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway (collectively known as the European Economic Area [EEA]), in addition to Switzerland, Ukraine, and the U.K.
Talent density spikes
London comes out on top both overall (i.e., “all disciplines”) and in each individual discipline (e.g., AI, DevOps, security) in terms of volume of engineers. However, Atlas comes at this from the perspective that cities with the highest talent volume aren’t necessarily the best place to go looking for specific skills. As such, Atlas shows the densest per capita (i.e., per the broader software engineering population) concentration for a given speciality among the local talent pool, highlighting two dozen cities across Europe and their respective density spikes in 14 specialization areas.
“So this is cities that are punching above their weight for a certain type of engineering specialism,” Sequoia’s European talent director, Zoe Jervier Hewitt, explained to TechCrunch in an interview.
Sequoia’s Atlas in action. Image Credits: Sequoia
For example, Atlas data suggests that Dublin’s general engineering quality across all specialities sits at just 37% in terms of the number of engineers with four- or five-star GitHub ratings. But when filtered down to engineers with an AI specialism, this figure jumps up to 60%. This positions the Irish capital as one of the hottest places for AI talent, along with several other key hubs across Europe, which tallies with separate reports from recent years that position Dublin as a top AI talent hub.

A curious omission from Atlas is that while it gives a percentage of GitHub users in a city with four- or five-star ratings, it doesn’t do this at a top level for the overall talent density of skill-specific engineers in the city — regardless of their level of experience, what their GitHub rating is, or whether they even use GitHub at all.
Indeed, while the circles serve as useful visual indicators of the biggest outliers in talent density — the bigger the circle, the bigger the talent density — it’s impossible to know how they actually compare to each other. How much higher is Dublin’s AI talent density than Zurich, or Paris, or Berlin, or Edinburgh? It turns out this was a deliberate design decision, according to a Sequoia spokesperson, who said that percentages wouldn’t do a good enough job of conveying the contrast between the densities, whereas splitting them into broad “Notable,” “Standout” and “Top city” made it easier to parse the differences.
Speciality densities. Image Credits: Sequoia
Moreover, it’s also worth considering why a higher density of engineers with a particular talent in one location is more useful than another city with a lower density but higher overall number. The Sequoia spokesperson said that the correlation between specialization density and the quality of the engineers, as defined by their GitHub star ratings, is one reason why this matters — evidenced by the jump in four- and five-star GitHub ratings for Dublin when filtered by AI as their specialism.
“We see this pattern repeated across different specializations,” the spokesperson said. “[Also], outlier talent density in a particular city means a relative abundance of available talent for a specific skill set to recruit from. For instance, Amsterdam has the highest density of DevOps engineers, which means on a local basis it has the richest supply of DevOps talent. While London may have more DevOps engineers in total, they are in relatively short supply as a proportion of London’s overall talent pool, which may make recruiting them more difficult, particularly for early-stage startups competing against established tech giants.”
Other notable tidbits to emerge from the research provided in Atlas is that Germany (Stuttgart and Munich, specifically) is a hotbed for engineers focused on robotics, drones and autonomous vehicles, while Gothenburg in Sweden is something of an outlier for systems engineers.
Helsinki, meanwhile, is big for top gaming and graphics engineers.

Of course, if a fledgling startup really is just looking for the high-volume hubs, they can use Atlas to pick out places that might not be instantly obvious, such as Madrid, which apparently has the highest number of engineers outside of London and Paris across all specialities.

Users can also drill down into specific hubs and see what the lay of the land is in terms of volume of engineers; primary and secondary skills; percentage of female engineers; number of accelerators; and the “tech ecosystem value.”
While these various data points may prove useful, Atlas perhaps could benefit from proper data sourcing. For instance, Lithuania’s capital Vilnius apparently has a “tech ecosystem value” of €9.3 billion, but without knowing where this figure was derived from, it’s difficult to know precisely what it means. In this instance, Sequoia did confirm to TechCrunch that this was garnered as part of its integration with tech data provider Dealroom, which defines the “ecosystem value” as such:
[The] sum of the valuations of all startups in the ecosystem. Using estimated valuations based on most recent VC rounds, public markets and publicly disclosed valuations.
However, it perhaps would be more useful if Atlas showed exactly where its various data points have come from, using little clickable on-screen icons.

Use cases
While knowing where to find the best robotics or hardware or systems engineers is an important selling point of this tool, it could also be used by remote-first companies looking to set up satellite offices, for instance, or even base their entire HQ.
The founder of one of Sequoia’s portfolio companies, Robco — a German robotics startup that recently raised $14 million — apparently moved from Boston back to Munich because of its abundance of robotics talent. And this is the type of scenario that Hewitt reckons that startups, scale-ups, or even Big Tech recruiters might use Atlas for, which is particularly pertinent at a time when the remote-work trend is showing little sign of easing.
“I think founders can use Atlas as a lens for things like ‘where should we put our HQ‘ or ‘where should we put our main office,'” Hewitt said. “I think the other use case will be around how founders want to think about and evolve their philosophies around remote and hybrid work. I think it will help founders inform whether they choose to operate a fully remote engineering team or a hybrid. So we hope that it will be useful as many companies are trying to strike that balance of hybrid and in-person.”
A year in the making, Atlas is available for anyone to use today. But all this leaves us with at least one lingering question. According to Hewitt, they detected shifts in attitudes toward remote, hybrid, and office-based working during the course of developing Atlas, which leads us to wonder how useful this tool will be, say, a year or two from now as Europe’s diverse and distributed tech workforce continues to evolve.
Put simply, is the plan to make Atlas a living, breathing reflection of the European tech talent ecosystem?
“I think we want to see the response from founders,” Hewitt said. “I mean, we think it’s a really great tool, and I hope it’s going to create value for lots of hiring teams. Whether we will update it every year, I think we’ll wait to see what the initial reception is.”

"Supercritical, a carbon removal marketplace aimed at tech firms, raises $13M Series A led by Lightspeed",Mike Butcher,2023/06/21,"
Supercritical, the carbon removal marketplace aimed (at the moment) mainly at tech companies that want to hit “net zero,” has raised a $13 million Series A funding round, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners.
The round includes funding from RTP Global, Greencode Ventures, MMC Ventures and others. We covered Supercritical’s launch back in August 2021, when it pointed out that the carbon footprint of the technology sector had — embarrassingly — been proven to be greater than the entire aviation industry.
The startup aggregates business demand for cutting-edge carbon removal technologies. So in a similar scenario to Tesla starting out with an electric sports car so that it could eventually launch a family saloon, Supercritical gives companies access to these innovative technologies which have the potential to scale far beyond just planting some forests etc., allowing this new wave of carbon removers to scale up.
Supercritical’s marketplace allows companies to purchase so-called “fully-vetted and qualified” carbon removal credits, to the level of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) industry standard.
The funding will be used to scale its offering to tech companies, but, as co-founder and CEO Michelle You told me: “We are continuing to focus on tech companies but also will use the funding to broaden the offering. Every company in the world will have to get to net zero emissions if we’re going to stay below 1.5C of warming. There is no way of getting to net zero without buying permanent carbon removal to net out the remaining emissions.”
Clients for Supercritical’s approach include banking platform Tide, algorithmic trading firm XTX Markets, as well as Veriff, Multiverse and IMC.
She pointed out that there is already momentum in the market: “Already one-third of global market cap have made a voluntary commitment to net zero via the Science Based Targets initiative. Every single business will have to buy permanent carbon removal so the opportunity to scale CDR by serving other verticals is huge.”
Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) refers to approaches that remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. The alternative, carbon offsets, has frequently been found to be at best ineffective, and even fraudulent, at its worst.
In June an investigation by the Guardian newspaper, the German weekly Die Zeit and SourceMaterial, found that more than 90% of rainforest carbon offsets by the largest global certifier, Verra, were allegedly worthless.
By contrast, Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) offsets are the only offsets recognized internationally that count toward net zero, by actually taking carbon out of the atmosphere and storing it away permanently.
However, CDR capacity is disappointing to date, to put it mildly. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that only around 600,000 tonnes of CDR were purchased in 2022 — less than 0.01% of the 10 gigatonnes which we need to take out of the atmosphere annually by 2050.
As a marketplace, Supercritical says it focuses on “high-quality, vetted, durable CDR projects,” including biochar, direct air capture (DAC) and enhanced weathering, as well as afforestation. Because it aggregates demand from buyers, Supercritical says it acts as a market-maker, which means CDR projects can then scale up. It also buys from cutting-edge climate startups (see the Tesla analogy above) which have new approaches to sequestering CO2.
This last May, Supercritical went into a long-term agreement with Carbo Culture, a startup that converts carbon-containing biomass into biochar at a commercial scale. In 2021, Carbo Culture raised $6.2 million in a seed financing round led by Silicon Valley VC True Ventures.
In a statement, Paul Murphy, partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners said: “Supercritical is doing something unique. By focusing exclusively on carbon removal offsets, they are helping businesses invest in the places that will actually deliver climate impact while they work in parallel to decarbonize.”
Supercritical is backed by Lightspeed Venture Partners, GreenCode Ventures and MMC Ventures. It was previously backed by LocalGlobe and angel investors including Peter Reinhardt (Twilio Segment and Charm Industrial), Yancey Strickler (Kickstarter), Alice Bentinck (Entrepreneur First), Gustaf Alströmer (Y Combinator) and Evelyn Bourke (Bupa).
The market for startups either taking a marketplace or a market-maker approach is heating up. In May, I reported on climate startup CUR8, which had raised $6.5 million from GV for its market-making platform for carbon removals. While Supercritical is both a marketplace and does carbon accounting and removal sales, CUR8 only focuses on removals and driving demand and access to finance for the suppliers.
The fact that both these startups have come out of the U.K. is also testament to the fact that the U.K. is seen to be leading the way internationally on carbon pricing and regulation.

"Southeast Asia–focused Go-Ventures closes $240M second fund, rebrands as Argor Capital ",Kate Park,2023/06/19,"
Go-Ventures, backed by Indonesia’s GoTo, announced Tuesday it has raised a second fund at $240 million and rebranded as Argor Capital “to reinforce the investment firm’s independence and expanded capabilities to drive growth” for its portfolios.
Argor Capital started in 2018 with GoTo backing to invest in startups in Southeast Asia. Though GoTo will remain one of the investors in Argor’s latest fund, Argor’s investment decisions will continue to be independent of GoTo and other limited partners, according to the VC firm. The limited partners for Argo’s second fund include sovereign wealth funds, institutional investors, corporations, and family offices across the globe, from Asia to the Middle East, Australia, Europe and the U.S.
“While we are rebranding at a time of expansion, the word ‘Go’ embedded in our name is an important reminder for us of the strong support we have received from GoTo and our other investors since we started this journey back in 2018,” said Aditya Kamath, partner of Argor Capital.
The VC, which will continue to invest in early-stage and midstage companies in Southeast Asia, plans to construct a portfolio of 15 to 20 companies in its second fund. Argor’s initial investments are typically $2 million -$10 million, according to a spokesperson of Argor Capital.  So far, Argor has invested from the second fund in sectors such as B2B marketplaces, consumer, environmental tech, fintech and digital transformation platforms for SMEs.
“Argor focuses on companies that operate in or are expanding into Southeast Asia, with an emphasis on Indonesia and Vietnam as the key countries of focus,” the spokesperson of Argo told TechCrunch. In addition, the company will continue to make investments in countries such as the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, the spokesperson said.
In 2020, Argor closed on its Fund I with $175 million invested in 19 companies in Southeast Asia. Two partners, Siddharth Pisharody and Adrian Foo, have joined the VC outfit, which has expanded its team size threefold over the last two years.
The firm has made investments from the first fund in companies such as Vara, a Singapore-based staff management platform for small businesses; KitaBeli, an Indonesian social commerce app; Food Market Hub, a Malaysian cloud-based platform that connects food and beverage (F&B) outlets directly to suppliers; Juragan Material, a construction tech platform in Indonesia; eFishery, an Indonesian agtech startup; and SafeBoda, an Uganda-based ride-hailing app.
“Despite the challenging macro environment globally, we remain excited about the potential of Southeast Asia’s technology ecosystem, which is underpinned by secular consumption and technology adoption across both consumers and businesses,” said Kamath.

Gladia turns any audio into text in near real time,Romain Dillet,2023/06/19,"
Meet Gladia, a French AI startup that wants to change how companies interact with audio data. The company develops an audio transcription application programming interface (API) that you can integrate with other products and is supposed to work much better than what’s available out there. And this tech foundation unlocks new use cases around audio.
If you’re familiar with audio transcription APIs, you know that big cloud providers already have their own APIs. There’s Google’s speech-to-text API, Amazon Transcribe, Microsoft’s Speech to Text, etc. They work well, but they are expensive, slow and don’t have a ton of features.
Gladia’s co-founder and CEO Jean-Louis Quéguiner, who was the former head of AI for OVHcloud and co-founded the company with Jonathan Soto, told me about some of the limitations with existing APIs. According to him, there are three pain points with existing products. First, when it comes to prices, transcribing an hour of audio generally costs $1.50 to $2 an hour.
Second, the output isn’t always very reliable as some languages work well while others are barely supported. When it comes to advanced features, if people speak in multiple languages, chances are the API simply won’t be able to notice the language change and transcribe the audio in more than one language.
Third, transcription APIs are slow. It can take more than 15 minutes to transcribe an hour of audio. That’s fine if you don’t need transcriptions right away, but it means that you won’t be able to use these APIs in some industries.
Whisper’s whisperer
Gladia is based on Whisper, OpenAI’s open source transcription model. “We started from Whisper. We haven’t reinvented the wheel, but we listened to our customers and they told us: ‘What I want is something that works as well as Whisper,’” Jean-Louis Quéguiner told me.
But Whisper isn’t perfect. The vanilla version is still quite slow, so Gladia has spent a lot of time turning Whisper into a fast and responsive transcription model. That’s not the only issue.
“Half of Whisper is GPT-2. You’ve seen LLMs and ChatGPT, it tends to hallucinate. We’ve done a lot of work to avoid hallucination problems too,” Quéguiner said.
In particular, he told me that Whisper has been trained on closed captions that you can find on the internet, such as on YouTube. OpenAI’s model tends to hear common phrases that you can hear in online videos, such as “if you enjoyed this video, please like and subscribe.” There is a mathematical overrepresentation of some sentences like this one and Gladia tries to fix those shortcomings.
In addition to these modifications to Whisper and its implementation, Gladia also has some pre-processing and post-processing algorithms that improve the end results.
Gladia promises that it can transcribe an hour of audio for $0.61. And the transcription process takes roughly 60 seconds. Its API can detect when there are multiple speakers, add timestamps, detect languages and switch from one language to another if needed. Gladia also automatically adds punctuation and casing.
Like most APIs, the end result is in JSON format. But Gladia also supports SRT and VTT files for companies that want to generate subtitles.
I created an account and uploaded an audio recording of an interview to see how Gladia works. It took a bit more time than expected but it was definitely much faster than Google’s or Azure’s speech-to-text APIs.
The result wasn’t flawless, but it was extremely good — it understood acronyms and technical terms. I opened the same audio file in Aiko, a Mac app developed by Sindre Sorhus that lets you transcribe audio file locally using Whisper. As expected, the output was close to Gladia’s output — but Gladia was much faster than running Aiko on my MacBook Pro.
Overall, Gladia was the best transcription API I’ve ever used.
Becoming an audio intelligence API
The company currently works with call center companies, virtual meeting services, and video publishers, including Claap, Livestorm and Selectra.
Gladia raised a $4 million seed round in a funding round led by New Wave. Other investors include Sequoia, Cocoa and business angels, such as Solomon Hykes, Pierre Betouin, Miroslaw Klaba and Alexandre Berriche.
Having a rock-solid transcription API is just step one for Gladia. The company hopes that it can then build features on top of this strong technical foundation.
For instance, after an audio file has been transcribed, Gladia can translate text into another language. Combined with word-level timestamps, it means that a company can upload an audio file and get subtitles in dozens of languages in just a few minutes.
In the future, the company hopes that it can summarize the content of an audio file, categorize content into multiple topic categories, create chapters automatically, conduct sentiment analysis and more.
“Our longer-term vision is to move from 2D to 3D data. Audio is pretty flat, and the idea is to augment it with intelligence,” Quéguiner said. “We think that transcription will become a commodity. But we think that what’s going to matter more is the options we’re going to add.”

Philippines startup Shoppable Business smooths bumps in the business procurement process,Catherine Shu,2023/06/19,"
Shoppable Business Chris Blanquera, Sam Blanquera and Carlo Silva
Shoppable Business wants to make it easier for businesses in the Philippines to source and procure branded products and other inventory, with an emphasis on making sure products are authentic. The B2B e-commerce marketplace announced it has closed what it says was an oversubscribed pre-seed funding round of $1.15 million.
The round was co-led by Foxmont Capital Partners and Seedstars International Ventures, along with angel investors. Shoppable Business previously got backing from AHG Lab.
Shoppable Business was founded in 2022 by a team including Carlo Silva, who previously started and exited e-commerce business process outsourcing company 2ndOffice. The founders also include Sam Blanquera and Chris Blanquera, who co-founded and existed Openovate Labs and Galleon.ph.
Silva told TechCrunch that after working at startups and conglomerates in the Philippines since 2013, Shoppable Business’ founding team noticed that there was a huge gap in the marketplace for a efficient digital procurement process. “The traditional methods were slow, opaque and painstakingly manual and it was hard to find trusted suppliers,” he said.
One problem that businesses face when procuring online is not knowing if goods are authentic. While there have been a lot of e-commerce innovations in the Philippines, like social commerce, a lot of them are targeted toward consumers. But businesses often have to rely on Facebook Marketplace and classified ads for procurement, which means processing orders is a time consuming business.
Silva said that in the Philippines, the traditional procurement process is manual, with orders usually processed through messaging apps, email or in person. Quotations are sent through word documents or spreadsheets. “It’s also difficult to search for authentic products online, and to compare quotations as they are funneled through messenger apps and email, making it an inefficient process,” he said.
Shoppable Business is aimed at businesses that want to procure goods quickly and more cheaply, but don’t have a dedicated procurement team. It also works with companies that manufacture their own brands and distributors. The platform specializes in branded products and services for resellers.
Shoppable Business helps them by operating as a horizontal B2B marketplace for products and services from multiple categories. In addition to using the platform to find products, businesses can also access services like marketing, sales support, procurement outsourcing, logistics, financing and payment infrastructure. Shoppable Business also issues official BIR (Bureau of Internal Revenue)-certified sales invoices and receipts, which companies need in the Philippines to claim the full purchase. To ensure authentic products, Shoppable Business is a marketplace partner of GS1 Philippines (GS1 is the standard for barcodes and product identification in 116 countries, and has 2 million member companies).
In terms of convincing sellers and businesses to move off Facebook Marketplace and the other platforms they are currently using, Shoppable Business makes the process easier by providing a single product listing catalog feature, which means if a product is already in its catalog, sellers don’t need to recreate the product listing. Instead, they can start selling it with a few clicks, by inputting their selling price, stock and any bulk discounts they would like to offer.
Sellers also get their own store on Shoppable Business that enables them to accept payments from different options like Gcash, Maya, credit cards, bank transfers and even check or manual bank deposits. Shopppable Business also does away with the hassle of shipping by arranging deliveries through third-party logistic partners.
To make it easier for sellers to move their current customer base to Shoppable Business, the platform offers a program called Shoppable Direct which enables them to refer existing customers to become buyers. Shoppable will tag seller’s customers as their direct customers if they buy something from the seller that referred them. It also waives marketplace fees for the buyer.
Silva said the wide array of services Shoppable Business offers sellers and buyers, like sales support, procurement outsourcing and logistics, helps it compete with other B2B marketplaces. In addition, it guarantees the issuance of BIR-certified sales invoices and receipts for every transaction, and also protects product authenticity through its partnership with GS1 Philippines.
The funding will be used to hire for Shoppable Business’ business development team, product and feature development and expanding into new markets in Southeast Asia. Silva said the startup will target new markets by the first half of 2024.
In a statement about the investment, Foxmont Capital Partners managing partner Franco Varona said, “Sourcing and procurement have traditionally been a very manual and a very challenging experience in the Philippines. The lack of transparency in pricing and difficulty in finding goods at scale and quickly is something Filipino companies have had to deal with for too long.  Shoppable Business helps to directly solve that problem, and we believe Carlo and his team are exactly the right team to do it.”

"India’s Byju’s to cut up to 1,000 more jobs",Manish Singh,2023/06/19,"
Byju’s is cutting 500 to 1,000 more jobs at the firm, this time eliminating several non-sales roles as well, as the Indian edtech giant pushes to improve its finances, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The Bengaluru-headquartered startup, which has cut over 3,000 jobs in the past year, declined to comment.
The new wave of layoffs is aimed at improving the finances at the firm as it pushes to become profitable, the person familiar with the matter said, requesting anonymity discussing nonpublic matters.
Byju’s, valued at $22 billion, is the most valuable Indian startup. The firm, which employs over 40,000 individuals, is the largest edtech startup globally with one of the most expansive workforces of teachers.
The startup had planned to go public as early as last year, but delayed the deliberations as the market nosedived amid the weakening global economy. Byju’s said earlier this month that it plans to list its subsidiary, Aakash, next year.
Byju’s reported a gross revenue of $1.258 billion (unaudited) in the financial year that ended in March last year. Between April and July, the startup logged revenue of $570 million, it said earlier.
Byju’s counts Prosus Ventures, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Sequoia Capital India, Silver Lake, Owl Ventures, UBS and Blackrock among its backers and has raised over $6 billion to date.

PayGo solar startup Yellow raises $14 million to scale in Africa,Annie Njanja,2023/06/19,"
Yellow, an asset financier for solar energy and digital devices in Africa, has raised $14 million series B funding in a round led by Convergence Partners with participation from the Energy Entrepreneurs Growth Fund, managed by Triple Jump, in addition to follow-on investment from Platform Investment Partners.
Yellow was founded and launched in Malawi in 2018 by Mike Heyink and Maya Stewart, to initially bring solar energy to the country, which is among those with the lowest access to electricity in the world. It has since grown its footprint across Africa and increased its product offering to include electronics like smartphones.
Following the new funding, Yellow plans to deepen its reach in its current markets Malawi, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia and Madagascar, launch digital and financial products in the near-term, and prepare for future debt funding rounds to ramp up its growth. The new round brings total debt and equity funding raised by Yellow to $45 million.

Seven scaleups hog over 70% of funding to Africa’s solar pay-go ventures

“The newly injected capital is being used to leverage more debt finance to reach more customers with financed smartphones and solar systems. While the business will broaden its product offering to include other mobile financial services, growth will be fueled primarily by deepening our expertise in our existing product categories,” said Yellow founder and CEO, Heyink.
Yellow claims to be profitable having recorded a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 265% over the last four-year period. The startup says its network of 1,100 agents, who source and make applications for the asset finance on behalf of customers through its proprietary Ofeefee app, have enabled it to penetrate and reach over 400,000 customers in its five markets.
The startup’s small home solar system, comprising a 6W-10W panel, 20-50Wh battery, 4 lights, cellphone charger and radio, remains its most popular product. It also sells solar systems with bigger capacities, and smartphones.
For the small and large solar home systems, users pay a deposit of $10 and $68, respectively, and remit the balance through monthly payments spread over six and 24 months.
“It’s incredibly exciting to see the early stages of sustained growth in Africa. The team at Yellow is thrilled to be on the multi-decade journey with the African consumer, to a better life. We have a front-row seat to witness millions of people prospering as a result of joining the digital global economy for the first time,” said Heyink.
Yellow is among the asset financiers that have attracted VC funding this year indicating a sustained appetite for deals in startups making solar energy accessible, following last year’s trend that saw clean tech emerge as the second most-funded sector after fintech. Clean techs attracted $863M in equity or 18% of the total funding raised by African startups, according to 2022 Partech Africa report.
Overall, in the last 10 years startups in Africa’s off-grid solar sector have attracted over $2.3 billion in funding, according to the biennial Gogla-World Bank report released in October last year.
Commenting on the Yellow investment, Convergence Partner CEO, Brandon Doyle, said, “we are excited to be backing the Yellow team. We have been tracking the off-grid solar power asset finance space for many years but have failed to find a business model and team that we felt we could back until now.”
“Yellow’s offering also sits well with our promise to our investors of strong investment returns married with solid social development impact; in this case by tackling the triple challenge of financial inclusion, green energy distribution, and broadband penetration, and doing so profitably while servicing the unbanked communities of the lowest income countries of Africa,” said Doyle.
Asset financiers like Yellow, Sun King and M-Kopa operate pay-go models that offer asset-based financing (pay-to-own) for solar kits and lanterns, products that are hugely popular in Sub-Saharan Africa, where millions of people are off-grid, as national power grids remain underdeveloped. It is estimated that sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 75% of the world’s population without access to electricity.
These companies, some of which offer financing for other assets, have also been quick to add new revenue streams, and to tap debt-financing to further tap and increase their clientele base.

"Seedstars, Fondation Botnar partner to back African startups focused on youth wellbeing",Annie Njanja,2023/06/18,"
Seedstars Capital and Swiss philanthropic foundation Fondation Botnar have launched Seedstars Youth Wellbeing Ventures, a $20 million investment vehicle targeting early-stage startups in Africa that are focused on improving the wellbeing of people below 30 years in low-and-middle-income countries.
The evergreen investment vehicle will back pre-seed to Series A startups including those that advance health services, environmental sustainability and ecological resilience (like access to clean energy), local food security, water and sanitation, waste management, affordable housing, access to employment and safe and sustainable transportation in Tanzania, Ghana, Senegal, Morocco, and Egypt.
Seedstars told TechCrunch that startups will get an initial capital injection of $250,000 and follow-on investments of up to $500,000. It plans to make four initial investments, and two follow-on backing annually, over the next five years.

Seedstars Capital launches to support new fund managers around the world

Seedstars Youth Wellbeing Ventures will make co-investments alongside like-minded investors with the hope of encouraging more capital inflow into Africa. Alongside its co-investor network, it will identify, invest and scale startups with the potential to transform the lives of young people across its target markets.
“There is a major gap in the wellbeing of youth if we compare developed countries with emerging markets. Our goal is to transform cities by creating inclusive urban environments and systems that are truly fit and ready to support the health and wellbeing of the young people who live in emerging markets through the transformational power of digital technology,” said Benjamin Langer, partner at Seedstars Capital, an alternative investment platform launched last year to back new fund managers in emerging and frontier markets.
Langer added that, “by investing in purpose-related venture-backed companies, we can accelerate our target outcome to improve the wellbeing of young people in emerging markets. We are comparing the “acceleration” with some other actions that the partners are pursuing like grants or donations in emerging markets.”
Seedstars and Fondation Botnar have already made their first joint investment in Senegal-based logistics startup Chargel, which matches shippers with transporters. In addition to being a platform for owners of large fleets of trucks, Chargel also pools together independent shippers, giving them new earning opportunities.
Commenting on the launch of the Youth Wellbeing Ventures, Antoine Veyrassat, the venture philanthropy lead at Fondation Botnar said: “Fondation Botnar is excited to join Seedstars in supporting companies that are making a difference.”
“Our shared commitment to improving the health and wellbeing of young people aligns strongly with our investment strategy that takes a market-based approach to philanthropy in addition to our other philanthropic funding, especially as rapid urbanization and the increasing number of young people living in cities present both unique challenges and opportunities,” said Veyrassat.
Fondation Botnar is dedicated to improving the health and wellbeing of young people living in urban areas worldwide.
Seedstars Youth Wellbeing Ventures adds to the growing list of funds under the Seedstars Group, an accelerator and VC that is active globally in more than 30 emerging markets. Its other funds include Seedstars International Ventures I (SIV I), its first global fund for emerging markets with a focus on the pre-seed stage, SIV II, a fund launched last year in collaboration with Patricia Sosrodjojo targeting 100 startups in emerging markets, and Seedstars Africa Ventures, a pan-African early-stage fund.
It also adds to the increasing number of purpose driven funds that have been launched recently in Africa including the Africa People + Planet Fund, by pan-African venture firm Novastar, which is raising over $200 million to invest in startups developing agriculture and climate solutions on the continent, and another one by climate tech VC Equator, targeting startups alleviating the impact of climate change.
Updated to note that Seedstars Youth Wellbeing Ventures is a partnership between Seedstars and Fondation Botnar.

You.com looks to innovation to chip away at Google’s search dominance,Ron Miller,2023/06/18,"
You.com CEO Richard Socher may not be a household name, but if you travel in AI circles, chances are you know who he is. Beginning in 2014 when he wrote his influential doctoral thesis about natural language processing, he has helped pave the way for today’s headline-grabbing AI technology, a fact that doesn’t escape him as he tries to build his next-generation search engine.
He launched MetaMind, shortly after that paper was published, a startup that Salesforce acquired two years later. In fact, as chief scientist at Salesforce, he helped build the AI layer that the company calls Einstein.
After he left Salesforce, he started You.com, a consumer search engine, in 2020. Obviously he’s up for a challenge, but he also recognizes that with time on his side, and an ability to innovate, he has two advantages that could allow his company to begin to chip away at Google’s search hegemony.
He’s not intimidated by the fact that fellow search engine startup Neeva, launched by two Google veterans, was acquired recently by Snowflake after failing to find product-market fit. He says his search engine is already much larger in terms of users than Neeva ever was.
But he also understands that what he is doing is more than theoretical; it’s a business, and he has to look to a future where he is not just burning money but also bringing it in. He has reached the point, three years into his startup journey, where he has to switch focus from growth and start concentrating on revenue, having raised a modest $45 million.
We helped get this party started
While AI research has been ongoing for decades, Socher and his peers at Stanford helped open the door to today’s breakthroughs with their groundbreaking research in 2014. He has continued his research and has published papers as recently as 2020 when he began putting all his efforts into his current company.
He says as a scientist, it’s been amazing to see his research put to work in the ways that it has. “I had this realization the other week, which is as a researcher, if you’re ahead of your time, you’re a visionary. And you get a lot of credit for people using your ideas later, and you’re like ‘Oh, wow, we invented word vectors and contextual vectors, and then prompt engineering and the single model for all of NLP and LLMs for protein design,” Socher told TechCrunch+.

Still leading
VC firm Atomico projects that the amount of venture capital invested in European startups this year will be 52% lower than in 2021. I already wrote about these findings, but there’s a key nuance to the information that we haven’t unpacked yet: discrepancies between countries.
While the slowdown is visible across Europe, Atomico noted that Dealroom and Crunchbase data on capital invested during the first half of this year shows a steeper year-on-year decline in the U.K. than in other leading European countries.
Compared to France and Germany, where tallies are respectively 55% and 44% lower than in H1 2022, the U.K. fell further: 57%.

Deal Dive: Maybe venture debt works for asset managers after all,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/06/17,"
Blackstone last August was looking to put $2 billion toward lending to startups and tech companies, according to The Information. But venture debt lenders remain skeptical that the asset class’s small checks are worth it for asset managers and their large LPs. Recently, a few lenders told me they didn’t think we’d ever see the large credit shops add a venture debt strategy.
Now, BlackRock is saying, “Hold my beer!”
Last week the absolutely sprawling asset manager BlackRock, with its $106 billion market cap, announced that it was going to acquire Kreos Capital, a London-based venture debt lender. Kreos lends to startups across Europe and Israel and has originated €5.2 billion (around $5.68 billion) worth of loans across more than 750 transactions. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, and BlackRock said that the Kreos team would be absorbed into its existing credit group.
BlackRock declined to comment for this story beyond the release, and Kreos could not be reached for comment.
As someone who used to cover corporate debt, this news shocked me. If any of the credit asset managers were to move into venture debt, BlackRock wouldn’t have been my first choice, my second or even in my top 10, really. The firm is just so large and spread across so many asset classes already, I thought it would likely be a pure-play credit shop first. "

In other words: Some of the most powerful money people believe they will see a return on their investments in the next 10 years. In a nutshell, as I wrote in my TC+ column this week, that scares the crap out of me.
Social media dramaaaaaaaaaa
I’m sure Twitter is relieved to see that Reddit is taking many of the headlines this week. The Reddit leadership team seems to have hit the slow-mo button and taken control of a couple of trains before hitting the “full steam ahead” button and pointing the trains at each other.
This slow-motion train crash is quite a thing, and it’s all related to Reddit’s new API pricing. Popular third-party Reddit app Apollo announced it was shutting down, and Reddit’s CEO wasn’t a big fan of how that went down, giving the Apollo developer both barrels in a drama-filled AMA. Reddit goes down briefly, subreddits and moderators were protesting — thousands of them, in fact — and it seems like a lot of them are planning to stay shut down indefinitely. Good heavens, that’s a one-way ticket to Yikes City all around.
Elon shouldn’t be too relieved, though; the bird sanctuary got its own headlines, and most of them were … not super encouraging. On the bright side, Elon didn’t have to CEO anymore, as  Linda Yaccarino officially took the big chair as Twitter CEO. The very next news story was Twitter is being evicted from its Boulder office over unpaid rent. Whoops. Alex broke down how far Twitter’s advertising revenues have fallen. TL;DR: It ain’t pretty.

Dark clouds in the blue sky: Morgan reports that Bluesky’s growing pains strain its relationship with Black users.
LOL just kidding, as you were: Taylor reports that Twitch backtracks on changes to branded content rules after streamer backlash.

The robots are coming! The robots are coming!
AI keeps dominating our news coverage, as there’s a lot of movement in that space.
France’s Mistral AI blows raised a $113 million seed round to take on OpenAI. It may prove to have an advantage in the notoriously privacy-focused EU — but, not gonna lie, I also raised an eyebrow at the company’s $260 million valuation — that’s a lot of equity to give up in a seed round.
There was a whole bunch of corporate AI news, not all of which is relevant to startups, but the recap is that Meta open sources an AI-powered music generator, while Itoka wants to license AI-generated music via the blockchain. I have made little secret of my disdain for blockchain tech in general (and the painful irony of blockchain for climate in particular), but that one seems like a particularly potent nonstarter. Prove me wrong, Itoka, prove me wrong.
Apropos potent — Morgan argues that Blush, the AI lover from the same team as Replika, is more than just a sexbot. I’m kind of into it, actually — sexting is fun, and I’m intrigued by the creative possibilities of getting saucy with a robot. As long as I don’t get a textually transmitted infection. Ahem.

Dude, where’s my … do we even call ‘em cars anymore?
Carvana was on an incredible share-price rally, until it hit the guard rails. Harri and Alex pick apart the soaring heights, the crushing depths and the weird, in-between bounce-back the company seems to find itself in. The used-car platform saw an epic stock surge where the shorted stock surged 56%, as the company predicts record profits. Sucks if you were one of the WallStreetBets bros sure of the company’s demise, but I’m sure the startup itself was relieved.
The other big story that’s been on our radar is Tesla and its charging standard. We reported that GM and Ford could help spark a charging standards war and concluded that EV charger networks are turning to the Tesla standard, as support for it accelerates. On TC+, Tim wonders whether Tesla’s Supercharger network will strain under the weight of GM and Ford deals — but also that Tesla has a winner on its hands. Back in February, Google added EV chargers to its Google Maps product, and this week, Apple followed suit — Apple Maps will show open spots near you.
Also this week, I lamented that EVs are going backward, in that they are getting bigger, heavier and stupider — only for Harri to report on two counterpoints: Telo bets America is ready for a dreamy little pickup and Fiat’s little Topolino concept that looks totes adorbs. Yass.

BuzzCutt steers the sober curious toward booze-free bar and restaurant options,Taylor Hatmaker,2023/06/16,"
If you don’t drink, navigating nightlife, bars and even eating out can be an exercise in frustration. Non-alcoholic options are popping up everywhere, but for every neighborhood haunt with a booze-free beer, there are 10 spots where you’ll be left high and dry — usually with a flat soda water plus sad lime in hand.
BuzzCutt, a new app out of Portland, Ore., might not change that overnight, but it does aim to shepherd non-drinkers, mindful drinkers and the sober-curious toward their best local options. The app, available nationwide now for iOS and Android, collects local hotspots with non-alcoholic options, all in a sunny, egg yolk yellow, map-based interface that’s easy to use.
BuzzCutt was created by Olivia and Sarah Sears, a queer married couple who started pining for more robust non-alcoholic options after the pandemic prompted some soul searching around their relationship with alcohol. Both Olivia and Sarah work full-time jobs in ad tech and launched the app together — their first — to create a tool they knew would be really useful for a lot of people.
Americans are drinking less than ever (prohibition notwithstanding) for reasons ranging from health and wellness to a more open dialogue around addiction to broader society-wide shifts in social habits. More people are becoming sober now, but a lot more people are either reducing their alcohol consumption or just becoming more thoughtful about how and when they drink. BuzzCutt is designed to capture the full spectrum of that experience.

“What has been really important to us from the beginning of the brand is like, we haven’t used language that exclusively implies ‘you have to be sober to do this,’” Olivia Sears told TechCrunch in an interview. “We like to think of it as like ‘access points’ for people; BuzzCutt is an access point to choosing non-alcoholic drinks for whatever reason.”
Those reasons have converged in recent years to prompt a parallel explosion in non-alcoholic drink options, with fancy bitters, canned mocktails, NA liquor and alcohol-free beer popping up everywhere. And by now, mercifully, a lot of it is getting pretty good.
BuzzCutt relies on all of those products to map out local non-alcoholic options, a trick it pulls off by sifting through distribution data and tracking what bars, restaurants, groceries and venues are stocking prominent N/A brands. This method sweeps quite a few options into the app’s directory, but wouldn’t catch a bar that specializes in bespoke mocktails, for example, if that spot doesn’t also stock a popular N/A brand like Athletic beer, Wilderton spirits or something else in BuzzCutt’s data flow.
The app launched this week with its core functionality, but BuzzCutt’s endgame is more involved. As it stands, an enthusiastic user could flag a missing entry from the app’s directory, like in the case of the database-eluding legendary mocktail menu, but the app generally plans to add a lot more community features across the board.
Sarah and Olivia Sears, BuzzCutt founders
“Right now, it is pretty bare bones; we wanted to make sure that we got a really solid tool framework out there for people to have in the palm of their hand,” Sears said.
BuzzCutt users can also rate different locations collected in the app and leave tips. The team initially planned to pull in external reviews for the listings it indexes but quickly realized that someone who doesn’t drink would have a “totally different” lens on a bar or restaurant’s selection. Now, the app only collects reviews from BuzzCutt’s own community — a smart way to build trust and avoid diluting its much-needed utility.
“[A local bar] might be really cool, but for somebody who isn’t comfortable being around like a giant wall of fucking whiskey, that might not be the vibe,” Sears said. “And that could be captured in user-generated reports about the place.”
As funding allows, BuzzCutt plans to add user profiles and other social features, as well as news and deals that would be of interest to sober and sober-adjacent users who are increasingly building community around a no-alcohol or low-alcohol lifestyle.
“Community is huge, especially for sober, sober-curious [and] mindful drinkers — you know, like having sources and support in that way,” Sears told TechCrunch. “So that’s definitely our next phase.”
Within BuzzCutt, users can filter local results by category (sports bars, wine bars, etc.), beverage type (spirits, bitters, canned mocktails and the like) and popular N/A brands, which they’ve been working closely with. The brand filter option in particular is useful since not all N/A options are created equal and sober people, this author included, will go to great lengths to find their favorites.
Personally, I’d drive halfway across the state if it meant I could enjoy my favorite alcohol-free wine by the glass out in a restaurant rather than in my kitchen. The luxury of abundant, good drink options is one that I definitely took for granted before I quit drinking years ago and it’s something that a surprising amount of social rituals are tied up in when you really get down to it.
Due to a relative dearth of alcohol-free options, sober and sober-ish people are often very motivated and enthusiastic when it comes to finding products they like and reestablishing social rituals that they may have been missing out on (happy hour, pre-gaming, wine tastings…. it’s a big list!).
That same passion, and the desire to unlock more non-alcoholic options — and thus more activities that people can enjoy without drinking – drives the BuzzCutt team, and ultimately the community it plans to serve.
“That kind of stuff is so powerful to us,” Sears said. “I definitely want to ride the wave of people getting curious and thinking about it as an exploration.”

Revolut sees its valuation reconsidered as public markets stir the fintech pot,Anna Heim,2023/06/16,"
What are neobanks worth? That’s a question on many people’s minds, especially the investors and employees of the richly valued fintechs that have been waiting for IPOs to make a comeback.
Overall, neobanks mostly seem to be doing OK, especially those across the pond. But new data from a venture capital firm indicates that at least some investors are still sorting out how to value them: U.K.-based Revolut saw its valuation being reduced earlier this year, and the company is once again in the headlines for reasons that it won’t like. One of Revolut’s backers, Molten Ventures recently reported its own financial performance and the data indicates that Revolut’s valuation is yet again being reexamined.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

Formerly known as Draper Esprit, Molten Ventures is listed on the London Stock Exchange and shares more information about its holdings than most VC firms thanks to its corporate structure. Importantly, this gives us good visibility into its portfolio companies’ changing worth as well. Molten notes that its fair market values for portfolio companies are set by its Audit, Risk and Valuations Committee and are sensitive to public comps.
The latest from Molten contains a wealth of useful data that we’ll dive deeper into in the coming days, but today, let’s focus on Revolut and try to sort the company more neatly with its peers.
Revolut by the numbers
As far as we’re aware, Revolut’s last major funding round was a massive $800 million Series E that afforded it a post-money valuation of $33 billion, per Crunchbase data. That round marked the neobank as not only one of the most valuable fintech startups in the world, but one of the most richly valued private tech companies, period. "

Can emerging managers do a better job of expanding access to capital than established VC firms?
Because many funds with less than $50M under management “are led by those from underrepresented backgrounds,” there’s “an opportunity for less experienced managers to step in and back the founders being overlooked and ignored on a higher level,” reports Dominic Madori-Davis.

Smaller VCs are having an impact on diverse investors and founders

Rejoice, for startup valuations are slowly recovering

A song by Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood came to mind when I read that public SaaS companies have reached their highest valuations so far this year:
I’ve been down so long
It looks like up to me
Weaving data from the Bessemer Cloud Index and Altimeter Capital Partner Jamin Ball together with recent news coverage, Alex Wilhelm found reason for guarded optimism:
“Startups are hardly out of the woods, but the market is no longer moving away from their valuation marks and is instead bolstering the value of their public comparables.”

Some founders may expect investors to stop them mid-presentation by shouting “shut up and take my money!” but life is not an episode of Futurama.
No one literally sells their pitch in the room, but a tight deck is a strong signal that the founders understand their market, however.
Netmaker, an infrastructure startup that helps customers create and manage virtual overlay networks, raised a $2.3M round with this slightly redacted presentation:

How two founders approach building ethical AI startups in health care
Image Credits: Getty Images
On recent episodes of TechCrunch’s Found podcast, two founders of AI-related health care companies talked about how they’re working to create ethical algorithms.
“If done in haste, or done poorly, AI models have the potential to cause real harm,” reports Rebecca Szkutak, who interviewed Amy Brown, founder and CEO of Authenticx, and Eli Ben-Joseph, co-founder and CEO of Regard.

How two founders approach building ethical AI startups in health care

"
"It’s not just hype, corporate America is making huge bets on AI transforming their businesses",Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/16,"
Hype or not, the potential of AI has tech companies enamored, and businesses large and small have begun betting heavily on efforts that leverage AI in some fashion to spur their growth to new heights.
These wagers have come in many forms. Firms like PwC and Accenture have promised to spend heavily on the sector, while others are creating new AI-focused capital pools and directly investing in AI-focused startups. A large number of tech companies today are also tapping their operating cash flow to add AI to their existing products and services.
There’s an all-out race to leverage AI to add more utility and value to products, and to reap a portion of the resulting demand in AI-powered products and services.

For tech titans, AI prominence is the new measuring stick

It appears this sector is resilient to the broader macroeconomic headwinds that have been affecting deal-making and fundraising in the tech world. If trends in deal-making continue, this year could go on to see the third-highest number of deals completed by AI startups in the expansion stage, according to Deloitte’s latest Road to Next report.
Investors are paying attention, too, and nearly every tech company’s quarterly results conference call has been full of analysts asking how the company in question will find growth or operating leverage with AI-related tooling.
TechCrunch wrote earlier this year that a tech company’s AI posture was among the most important measures of their present worth. That has only become more true since.

VCs continue to pour dollars into generative AI

This afternoon, we’re sorting through major promises, investments and some product news to underscore how broad the AI push has been in the larger enterprise software space.
Is the current AI boom a startup story? Yes. It is a Big Tech story? Yes. Are we seeing an entirely new generation of software being built and sold? Yes. Let’s get our heads around just how broad the AI moment truly is.
Big checks, big bets
Today, it seems nearly pedestrian that Microsoft in 2019 put $1 billion into OpenAI for licensing its tech and built a custom supercomputer in the Azure cloud. The figure was later dwarfed by $10 billion arrangement between the companies, but Redmond did help set the tone for how much capital was going to flow — and perhaps how much the sector would need — into AI-related work. "
Mistral AI’s mega fundraise is a red flag for many concerned about inclusivity,Dominic-Madori Davis,2023/06/16,"
Often, when people ask me how the venture and startup market is doing, I have to take a moment. The easy answer is that we’re seeing a downturn. The correct answer is more nuanced: There is indeed a downturn, but it is impacting some much more than others.
One example of this as clear as day is Mistral AI’s recent $113 million seed fundraise. The company, founded by three French white men, was started just four weeks ago and doesn’t even have a product yet. That round, which values the company at $260 million, is being hailed as Europe’s largest seed round to date.
Mistral AI’s fundraise is, in some ways, unique to this point in time. There is much frenzy around AI right now, and this round did see some U.S. and international investors participating, which you don’t often see happening for many French startups.
But there are some things that don’t change, regardless of what’s hyped. The market may be improving for AI startups, but we’ve yet to see much money going to women or people of color. Don’t get me wrong, women are receiving money for building in AI (Black founders, not so much), but not at the rates at which men appear to be. Of course, these three French men fit the profile of those who are likely to receive a $113 million pre-seed check: ambitious Google’s Deep Mind and Meta alums, two of whom have diplomas from the École Polytechnique, practically the MIT of France.
Sure, there is more of an effort to back women in France today, but the fundraising environment for some French Black founders remains both obviously and discreetly discriminatory, which is unsurprising given the overall treatment of Black individuals in the country. There isn’t enough data on how many women and people of color are even looking for funding in France (tracking minority metrics in France is illegal, so such data does not exist), making it hard to gauge how much underrepresented founders raise. "
Pitch Deck Teardown: Netmaker’s $2.3M seed deck,Haje Jan Kamps,2023/06/16,"
In a world where people working from home still need access to networks and a ton of other use cases, Netmaker lets users create and manage VPN connections without the learning curve, as Romain wrote last year when the company announced its seed round.
Netmaker submitted its pitch deck to TechCrunch+, and today we’re taking a close look at the deck the company used to raise its $2.3 million round.

We’re looking for more unique pitch decks to tear down, so if you want to submit your own, here’s how you can do that. 

Slides in this deck
Netmaker has a tight, 14-slide deck. The company tells me it redacted certain sensitive data (such as financial information), but those parts have been marked clearly so the deck still makes sense in context.

Three things to love
Netmaker is sharing a lot of information in just a handful of slides about what could be perceived to be a pretty complex, technical space. The company has done an incredible job of keeping things accessible.
Traction is king
[Slide 8] Great traction forgives all other sins, and this graph is pointed in the right direction. Image Credits: NetmakerHaving powerful traction is great for any startup, as rapid growth implies a company has found something important in the market and can attract new customers.
That said, some of these stats seem like vanity metrics to me. For example, why is it important to have 5,500 stars on GitHub? Does that translate into customers? Why is the 1,000 community members number important? Netmaker could have tried to connect the dots: Why are these metrics important to the company and how do they show rapid growth?
I did find myself stumbling on the claim of “50% MoM growth for 6 months.” It’s hard to overstate how impressive that is, and as an investor, I’m finding myself itching to learn what the growth engine is here. How much did the company have to spend to acquire those customers? How can it continue along this trajectory?
How it works
[Slide 7] How it works. Image Credits: NetmakerWhen your target audience is people who design, implement and maintain network infrastructure, you can bet that most investors you’re speaking to will not be fully au fait with the intricacies of the market. I do know VCs who have deep domain knowledge, but even the ones who are experienced may have pretty out of date information. The landscape in this space, like in so many others, changes nearly every day.
This “How it works” slide may be a little too simple, to be honest. I’d have loved to see screenshots of the actual provisioning/set-up screens to understand how hard it is to configure a network or add machines. Having said that, this is a great base-level introduction to explain the “Here’s what we do and why it matters” part of the story.
A clear vision of the future
I love how Netmaker pulls no punches in its vision for the future of its industry. This vision may prove to be inaccurate, but the company is not confused. It’s refreshing to see such clarity and the company’s ability to hook into its vision:
[Slide 3] Clarity of its vision of the future. This is one of my favorite slides in this deck. Image Credits: Netmaker 

			The company does something very right here: It paints a clear, bold and differentiated view of the future.					


Now, you could argue whether this is correct. Will nobody at all own their own networking hardware? Will there be no need to configure complex networks? I’m not a network architect, but that sounds like a bit of a stretch. At the very least, the internet itself and the underpinning technologies that support Netmaker will presumably need some amount of hardware.
Nonetheless, I think the company does something right here: It paints a clear, bold and differentiated view of the future and backs that up with the steps it must take to put itself at the forefront of this movement.
In the rest of this teardown, we’ll take a look at three things Netmaker could have improved or done differently — along with its full pitch deck!
 "
Smaller VCs are having an impact on diverse investors and founders,Dominic-Madori Davis,2023/06/16,"
Smaller funds, those that have $50 million or less in assets under management, are helping to usher in a new wave of diversity within venture capital. And the reasons for this are simple.
The latest crop of investors stems from historically overlooked or marginalized communities that are setting up funds and then investing back in those funds. “Small funds operate with a sense of purpose, leveraging their limited resources to drive positive change and foster diversity in the entrepreneurial landscape,” B. Pagels-Minor, the founder of DVRGNT Ventures, told TechCrunch+.
Emerging managers often target early-stage companies with diversity in mind, which is important because many of these companies do not last long enough to make it to, say, a Series B. The dearth of later-stage Black companies is in part tied to a lack of early support at the pre-seed and seed-stage levels.
Though many small funds do not explicitly have a diversity mandate, a considerable number of these funds are led by those from underrepresented backgrounds; larger funds, on the other hand, are lacking talent from diverse communities. This in itself creates an opportunity for smaller fund managers to step in and back the founders being overlooked and ignored on a higher level.
Ramzi Rafih, the founder of the London-based No Label Ventures, has a fund that focuses on backing immigrant founders within Europe. He says that the community is still undervalued in the startup ecosystem compared to the U.S., where such immigrants account for more than 50% of all unicorns. “If we can focus on solving obstacles faced by immigrant founders and make them more visible to VCs, we think we can deliver outsized returns to our investors,” he told TechCrunch+. This means often being the first investor in a round and connecting a founder with other investors and corporate clients, as well as helping with visa issues.
 

			“It is crucial to recognize that a wealth of data supports the notion that embracing diversity can de-risk investments and lead to better financial outcomes.”							B. Pagels-Minor



No Label is trying to fill the gap left by some larger funds, which often don’t support diverse talent and instead leverage the network they’ve built over the years. Many larger funds also simply do not know how to diversify their network, or they don’t know or agree that investing with diversity in mind can create outsized returns. "
How two founders approach building ethical AI startups in health care,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/06/15,"
The speed at which AI companies are evolving is making a lot of people nervous. That’s because moving fast could lead to potential ethical issues that aren’t able to be addressed.
Building ethical algorithms takes time. Models that were built quickly are more likely to have ingrained bias while lacking the necessary guardrails in place to keep them from causing unnecessary damage. If done in haste, or done poorly, AI models have the potential to cause real harm in certain sensitive industries, such as health care.
But, of course, many of the worries center around new founders riding into the space on the hype train as opposed to the numerous entrepreneurs who started building models with care years before the current market dynamics.
Amy Brown, the founder and CEO of Authenticx, a startup that helps health care companies gain insights from their customer call center data using AI, said on TechCrunch’s Found podcast that those looking to build AI algorithms should recognize the potential negative consequences of models being built incorrectly.
 "
VCs joining the climate race should scare the daylights out of you,Haje Jan Kamps,2023/06/15,"
Venture capital, as an asset class, is an industry of short-term wins. Most funds have a 10-year cycle: two years of initial investments; then two to three years of company building and follow-on investments; after that, five or six years of thumb-twiddling and waiting for the ship to come in, and maybe placing a last bet on the most promising companies in the fund portfolio.
This model forms part of a VC’s investment thesis; it also includes where the leads for potential investment come from (known as “sourcing”), along with the investment stage (pre-seed, seed, Series A, etc.), and any geographic or vertical or market limitations to the fund. The investment cycle has remained remarkably consistent over the history of venture capital: Wait 10 years, and the funds invested have (hopefully) multiplied.

Your investor has an investment thesis. Here’s why you should care

The upshot of these investment cycles is that venture capital is best positioned to invest in the type of companies that are in a hot market, with predictably high user and revenue growth, and a somewhat obvious liquidity event outcome, whether through acquisition or IPO. All of this is why subscription-based companies — and in particular cloud-based subscription software companies — are so well suited to VC investment. B2B SaaS companies that know the market, know how to leverage data-driven growth and have a clear customer acquisition funnel are as close as it gets to a safe bet in venture.
Another “sure-fire bet” for venture capitalists is when the future can be predicted, even a little bit. Big shifts in legislation is one example: Build software that helps companies stay in compliance with certain laws likely to pass soon, and you know you have a guaranteed customer base. Another sure-fire bet with a guaranteed user base: Watching the population curve and realizing there are a lot of people about to retire and need support. None of this is new; VC firms have built specialized theses around these types of huge moves.
A recent McKinsey report suggests that “investments in climate technology are still increasing, defying the headwinds that affected most capital markets.”
Both VCs and founders alike love to talk about how they want to make the world a better place. That’s lovely and all, and it may even be true for some of them. But make no mistake: Venture capital is an asset class like any other, and general partners have a fiduciary responsibility to their limited partners. Everyone may agree that it’s lovely to make the world better, but unless the investors start to see a return on their investments, that firehose of investment very quickly gets reduced to a trickle.

Luminoah’s quest to reinvent tube feeding attracts new funding,Devin Coldewey,2023/06/15,"
When someone is very ill or has had surgery that interrupts ordinary ways of eating and drinking, tube feeding is a life-saving necessity, but it’s cumbersome and uncomfortable to use. Luminoah aims to change this with a reinvented tube-feeding device that’s more portable, discreet and easy to use, and it has raised $6 million to bring its design to market.
Ordinary tube feeding setups are generally found in hospitals and are wheeled around like IVs and other gear. That makes sense in a controlled medical environment, but what if you or your loved one has to do it for months in and out of the hospital? Wheeling a tube feeding mechanism around a home or school is much more difficult and probably quite unpleasant.
Luminoah founder Neal Piper was confronted with this issue when his toddler required tube feeding during treatment for cancer (he is fine now, by the way).
“During his treatment, Noah was tethered to a pole-mounted tube feeding system for up to 15 hours per day. This outdated technology limited his mobility, reduced his quality of life, and presented numerous well-documented health risks,” explained Piper in a news release.
This is often the case with medical devices: The old way works fine but hasn’t been updated in years or decades due to the cost of development and complexity of entering the medical device market. Piper and Luminoah seem to have struck a chord with investors, however, leading to this $6 million A round led by Fry’s Path Capital, with participation from Sands Capital, CAV Angels, Virginia Venture Partners and 757 Angels.
“Our system has made substantial improvements to the size of the hardware allowing our engineering team to redefine the traditional approach to IV-pole bound infusion pumps,” Piper told TechCrunch. “Users will enjoy a modern UI/UX that affords them discretion while feeding paired with a device that allows them to go about their day unencumbered.” (As the design of the device is not final, the company is not yet publishing images of it.)
Being a connected device, it would also collect metrics for medical providers to check akin to what they would learn if the patient were in a hospital room with a traditional pole-mounted system.
The plan is to make the device reimbursable by insurance, though it’s a long road to get there. The funding should at least take it to prototype stage.
“With our newly raised round, we will rapidly advance development and prepare for the commercialization of our system. We are excited to grow our team further as we continue to march towards these exciting milestones,” he said.
Quality of life is a genuinely important factor in recovery, especially among young people who have yet to develop the kind of coping mechanisms adults use to get through tough times like cancer treatment. Reducing the discomfort and increasing the dignity of live-preserving treatments isn’t just a “nice to have” — it will likely contribute to better patient outcomes.

Psychedelics startup Nue Life Health rolls out free version of its ketamine therapy tracking app,Mike Butcher,2023/06/15,"
Nue Life Health is a U.S.-based telemedicine startup that combines psychedelic-assisted therapies and a health tracking app. Previously, the app was only offered as part of its own internal service. However, the startup is now opening up its “Nue app” and its “Nue score” available for free to any patient undergoing ketamine therapy, not just its own. The FDA has approved a variant of Ketamine called “Esketamine” as a medication for depression.
The Nue Life app allows patients undergoing ketamine therapy in the U.S. to join Nue Life’s membership services to complement their drug therapy. The app has biometric data integration (Apple Healthkit and Google Fit), and accesses the ‘Nue Score’ progress tracking. The at-home ketamine therapy combines music therapies and a data-led, ‘quantified self’ approach.
All users in the United States who are undergoing ketamine therapy across all treatment modalities, including via lozenges, intramuscular (IM) and intravenous (IV), will be able to access the Nue Life app.
As a result, it’s likely that this will expand Nue Life’s market reach, as it rolls out these new services.
Last year Nue Life said raised a $23 million Series A equity financing led by Obvious Ventures (co-founded by Ev Williams, co-founder of Twitter), which was part venture debt and part equity. This followed a seed round in 2021.
The company has also now completed an extra $1.9m financing round from existing investors to back the app roll-out for free.
Nue Life says it now delivers “at-home” ketamine therapy to over eight thousand patients across the U.S. combined with libraries, apps, and aftercare programs.
In a statement, Nue Life co-founder and CEO Juan Pablo Cappello said: “We have seen that patients who take advantage of our full program experience a 20-30% improvement over the baseline of drug-only therapy. We are now excited to make all these tools, content and preparation and after-care programs available to all users that may be undergoing ketamine treatment with providers across the US, including at-home or within clinics or offices.”
Nue Life has also appointed Dr. Frank Drummond as its new Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Drummond was formerly the national CMO of HCA’s behavioral health practice.
Nue Life competes with Mindbloom, as well as Field Trip Health, which also has physical treatment centers.
In March this year, TechCrunch interviewed Mindbloom’s CEO Dylan Beynon about how he saw the future of psychedelic mental health.

Glystn lets creators bulk reply to multiple followers across social media platforms,Lauren Forristal,2023/06/15,"
Founded by Google AdMob and Yahoo alums, Glystn is a tool for content creators that allows them to engage with followers, gather insights and read/answer comments from multiple social media platforms all in one place. The startup announced the public launch of the web app, as well as $4 million in seed funding.
The seed round was led by Eniac Ventures, Hannah Grey VC and Future Perfect Ventures. Glystn is also backed by angels Michael Spiegelman, Netflix’s VP of content and business product innovation, and Craig Sherman, managing director of Meritech.
“We really believe that Glystn and their multi-platform creator analytics is building that infrastructure and platform to solve the problem in this next phase of growth, customer acquisition, brand awareness and authenticity in the coming years,” Jessica Peltz-Zatulove, partner at Hannah Grey, told TechCrunch.
Glystn, dubbed a “community engagement engine,” uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to scan thousands of comments and threads from Discord and YouTube and categorizes them, giving influencers the ability to learn what the trending topics are within their community. Users have access to insights and analytics, such as top messages, repeat engagers and trending segments or videos.
Notably, influencers can individually and bulk-respond to subscribers, sending customized responses to multiple followers that comment about the same topic.
However, co-founder and CEO Ethan Fassett told us, “We do not enable creators to simply message their entire communities in mass direct replies… this keeps messaging targeted to relevant recipients at all times.”
Creators can also invite followers to their Discord, launch polls and more.
Image Credits: Glystn
Currently, the platform only integrates across Discord and YouTube—at least for now. However, the company plans to add others soon, Fassett explained, who previously worked at Yahoo as a senior product manager. Fassett declined to name which social media platforms it plans to add.
If the platform manages to combine most of the popular platforms like Instagram, Twitter and TikTok, we could see this being a relevant tool for creators. Influencers are increasingly relying on multiple social media channels to engage with audiences and earn enough revenue. YouTube ad revenue — which declined 2.6% year over year — arguably isn’t enough on its own for full-time creators to comfortably make a living. YouTube recently lowered the requirements for its YouTube Partner Program, giving smaller creators (500 subs or more) access to monetization tools.
The recent funding will mainly go toward the product, which will eventually adopt a tiered subscription model for solo creators, larger creators (over one million followers) and brands. Glystn is currently offering a free trial to users.
Founded in 2021 by Fassett and co-founder Michael Rowehl, former director of technology at Google AdMob, Glystn has over 20 pilot partners, including Louis Weisz, Steve Mould, EmperorLemon, AJ Rafael, Podcast Junkies, RollingLive Studios and Fox Sports, among others.
Weisz, a YouTuber with nearly 730,000 subscribers and over 4,000 Discord members, spoke with TechCrunch about Glystn, expressing how connected he feels to his followers since using the platform. From a brand perspective, Weisz also mentioned how helpful Glystn is for sponsors to get a better idea of the target audience and what products they’ll respond to.
“The biggest time save is how easy it is to see what your audience is talking about on the whole at a glance,” Weisz said. “[Glystn] is a way to get a hold of your audience in real-time as opposed to just making assumptions based on what videos your audience clicks on.”
Updated 6/15/23 at 11:30 a.m. ET with the correction to launch date (it launched today) and removal of the statement that the total funding raised was $4.75 million.

"Wargraphs, a gaming startup with only one employee and no outside funding, sells for $54M",Ingrid Lunden,2023/06/15,"
While the U.K. and U.S. try to block Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision over concerns it will kill competition in games distribution, competition appears to be alive and well in another (smaller) area of gaming: modding and analytics.
Wargraphs, a one-man-band startup behind a popular companion app for League of Legends called Porofessor, which helps players track and improve their playing stats, is getting acquired for up to €50 million ($54 million), half up front and half based on meeting certain earnings and growth targets.
MOBA Networks, a company founded out of Sweden that buys, grows and runs online gaming communities (MOBA is short for “multiplayer online battle arena”), is buying the startup and its existing products. The plan is to expand them to more markets, in particular across Asia, and to build analytics for more titles.
I write “startup”, but that might be with the loosest interpretation of the term. There is only a single employee, the mild-mannered Jean-Nicholas, and he has also entirely bootstrapped the business on his own. But that hasn’t held him back.
Wargraphs currently also builds analytics for Legends of Runeterra and Teamfight Tactics, but the League of Legends business has been its biggest it by far. Porofessor has had 10 million downloads of its app on Overwolf — which is where Porofessor was built — and more than 1.25 million daily active users if you combine traffic both from that platform and its own direct website.
The company, such as it is, has been around for some 10 years, has pretty much always been profitable with revenues of €12.3 million in its last fiscal year.
The acquisition underscores an interesting leitmotif in the current world of startups. We’re coming out of a particularly bullish 10 years, where startups raised huge amounts of funding at vertiginous valuations, sometimes (okay, let’s be honest, OFTEN) with very little in the way of revenues or sound business models behind them, sometimes without even legitimate products to their name.
Now, valuations are definitely lower, and funding is not as easy to raise, especially for consumer-focused products. But in that context, Wargraphs and Jean-Nicholas are examples of how a completely different approach can be just as lucrative, if not more, in the consumer segment.
The deal also speaks to an interesting evolution in consumer technology.
Gaming is huge business these days. At $68.7 billion Microsoft’s contested Activision acquisition would be not just the biggest in gaming but the biggest deal in the technology sector overall.
But companies like MOBA, Overwolf — last valued, in 2021, at a more modest-sounding $515 million, according to PitchBook data — and Wargraphs are examples of how that’s evolving: Games are at the center of larger ecosystems of products and services that can in themselves also become significant areas of value, even if they’re not the blockbusters at the center of those ecosystems.
(Case in point: The transaction closed a month ago, but Overwolf is trumpeting it at the moment to shine some light on its own platform as a ripe place to grow new avenues in gaming.)
Beyond that, new chapters in gaming — courtesy of new interactive headsets like the Vision Pro, and advances in areas like generative AI — will open the door to even more of that ecosystem development, I suspect.
Having said all that, Jean-Nicholas knows what he wants to build next — “a game,” he told me. Specifically, a card game that will compete against Hearthstone, coincidentally published by Activision Blizzard. He has no plans to raise outside funding for this, but he might hire an employee or two.

European startups still have a long way to go to achieve gender parity,Romain Dillet,2023/06/15,"
According to a new study from Sista and the Boston Consulting Group, women are still underrepresented in the European tech ecosystem. Only 22% of startups created in 2022 included a woman on the founding team. And when you look at women-only founding teams, that number drops to 10%. That means that, yes, 78% of European startups founded in 2022 only had male founders.
To put it another way, one in two women partner with men to create a startup, but only one in 10 men partner with women when it’s time to launch a startup.
This year’s study focused on five European countries in particular — France, the U.K., Germany, Spain and Sweden. While women are still very much underrepresented in France, the U.K., Germany and Spain, Swedish startups are faring better — at least slightly. In Sweden, nearly one in three startups have at least one woman on the founding team.
This is what it looks like:
Image Credits: Sista, BCG
In the U.S., startups with all-women founding teams received 1.9% of VC funds that were invested in 2022. In Europe, women-only teams capture 7% of angel and pre-seed funding. But that number drops drastically as you look at late-stage startups. Only 2% of Series D rounds (or later) were raised by startups founded by women only.
That means that the financing gap increases as startups become more mature. That also means that there are less role models even though role models play a critical part when it comes to inspiring newcomers to start a startup.
Startups with at least one women founder fare better. In 2022, mixed teams raised €12.1 million on average while men-only teams raised €17 million. As for women-only teams, investors only chose to invest an average of €4.2 million on those companies.

Those funding discrepancies could be explained with the original and main issue in the European tech ecosystem — women are underrepresented across the board, from startup founders to investors and tech executives.
That’s why Sista has a charter for investors and VC firms to enhance gender parity. By 2025, Sista hopes that 25% of startups funded by “investor allies” will have at least one woman co-founder. And that number should rise to 30% by 2030 in order to reach 50% by 2050.

Women-founded startups raised 1.9% of all VC funds in 2022, a drop from 2021

Deepchecks snags $14M seed to continuously validate ML models,Ron Miller,2023/06/15,"
As companies increasingly rely on machine learning models, it’s imperative that they continuously check the models to make sure they are working as intended and that the data is valid, unbiased and not corrupted in any way.
Deepchecks, an Israeli startup has come up with a solution to continuously test models from development through production. Today, the company announced a $14 million seed investment and the general availability of the open source version of the solution. The company also has a commercial product, Deepchecks Hub, that it began testing earlier this year.
CEO Philip Tannor and CTO Shir Chorev spent time in the Israeli military where they worked on machine learning. Chorev said they learned firsthand about the power and limitations of the technology, and that’s why they decided to start a company to work on quality-checking models.
“So both Philip and I were both in positions of leading AI research and bringing models to production. And we both saw the huge value potential that the algorithms in AI in general have, but alongside that we also noticed that they do face some quite significant challenges, specifically being able to actually do what they’re supposed to be doing and doing it properly,” Chorev told TechCrunch.
She says it’s hard to know what’s going on inside these models without tools like Deepchecks, which help data scientists make sure the data they are using are not biased, misinformed or based on corrupt input data – and generally performing well over time.
She and Tannor, being practitioners, realized that what was lacking was a tool to help continuously check these models throughout the process to test and validate different aspects of the model like the data’s integrity. So like any good entrepreneurs, they built the tool they wanted and open sourced it. More recently they also built a commercial version of the product, one that provides standard enterprise features like strong security and authentication.
“We brought quite a lot of understanding and hands-on experience in the field and also knowing the problem and what we would have wanted,” she said. Those experiences were relevant and helpful as they built the company. The company reports the open source product has been downloaded over 500,000 times and is being used by the likes of AWS, Booking.com and Wix, as well as regulated companies they can’t name publicly.
The company launched in 2020 and took about a year and a half to launch the first version of the open source tool.
Chorev recognizes that she is a relative rarity as a female co-founder, but she says she has always been interested in fields dominated by males and that has only driven her throughout her career. “Personally, I do feel that from a young age that this wasn’t something that was going to stop me. Instead, it’s like okay, it’s harder, so I’m gonna push and get it,” she said.
“I mean, it’s a challenging route, any way you choose it, but I do try to be accessible to help others to encourage people, whether they’re females or males, to take this path if that’s what they want.”
Today, the company has about 15 employees with plans to grow that number by 25-30% this year. She is concerned about building a diverse workforce, even while recognizing it can be a challenge for a young company. “It is a big challenge and we do put the effort in order to encourage diversity now, and also going forward as we grow,” she said.
Today’s funding round is really the combination of two tranches of money, a $4.4 million pre-seed round when they launched and $9.5 million, which closed at the end of last year. The investment was led by Alpha Wave Ventures with participation from Hetz Ventures and Grove Ventures.

"An investor, an operator, and their plan to upskill Africa’s workforce",Tage Kene-Okafor,2023/06/15,"
One out of three tech jobs globally are filled by necessary skilled labor, and according to the World Economic Forum (WEF), this is one of the biggest concerns of global business leaders.
Over 50% of the organizations that these leaders manage, in a survey, say they have lost competitive advantage due to talent shortages. The bad news is that the situation might not improve for these companies in the coming years, as the WEF projects that 77% of the 150 million new jobs created by 2030 will require digital skills and young people might not be prepared to fill them.
In Africa, hundreds of millions of youths are expected to join the continent’s workforce in the next decade. Over 200 million jobs will require digital skills in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the International Finance Corporation. But the challenge with Africa’s talent shortage, unlike the rest of the world, is that while the barriers to gaining these digital skills, such as the digital divide and unequal access to quality education, are conspicuous, what’s gone on the radar for so long is upskilling those with digital skills.
Upskilling employees (from soft skills such as communication, decision making and problem-solving to hard skills showing technical knowledge and foundational skills like teamwork) is a headache that most executives, managers and HR operators across small- to large- African enterprises have had to deal with for several years. And it’s a first-hand frustration that Seni Sulyman and Kayode Oyewole, both investors and operators, have seen founders complain about during extensive conversations.
Online courses and mentorship with a local context
A few years back, Sulyman was the vice president of Global Operations at Andela, where he helped scale the company across Africa and had teams in the U.S. With a decade of experience working at Andela, some Fortune 500 companies in the U.S. and angel investing (including as a venture partner at Ventures Platform) Sulyman clearly understands the role that deliberate growth and development played in improving tech talent. 
Same with Oyewole. As a partner at Ventures Platform, a $46 million fund where he helped back many of Africa’s most prominent venture-funded startups — and as an operator before Ventures Platform, Oyewole is familiar with the difficulty founders and senior leaders face when trying to scale their team’s capabilities to meet evolving needs.
“We had independently been working on overlapping ideas in this space when Kola Aina (founding partner, Ventures Platform) introduced us to each other to have a conversation,” Oyewole said in an interview with TechCrunch. “We talked to each other extensively for weeks and quickly realized that we share the deeply held belief that investing in upskilling talent to scale companies regionally or globally, with an end goal of creating more jobs and economic output, is Africa’s most important opportunity over the next three decades.”

India’s UpGrad enters unicorn club with $185 million fundraise

The operators-cum-investors-cum-founders left their roles to build Talstack, an all-in-one platform that enables businesses to upskill their employees with competency- and gap-assessment tools, content, courses and insights from Africa’s well-known professionals and entrepreneurs. 
Typically, most African businesses resort to training agencies when upskilling their employees. However, this limits their access to tailored and specific training programs from top experts, primarily seen in foreign upskilling products, including Udemy, Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, Go1, or verticalized offerings like Masterclass.
For Oyewole and Sulyman, both options are short-term fixes for Africa’s labor market because they are expensive, lack contextual relevance, and are difficult to connect to specific growth or development outcomes in Africa. 
The reasons are spot on. Even in this age of globalization, where the pandemic increased the appetite for online learning, an African employee working in a B2B e-commerce market cannot learn about the dynamics of that industry from, say, Udemy. In essence, though platforms based in the U.S. have tried to make generalized content and explainers on various skill sets, they miss many nuances concerning operating within different markets. That’s why startups like Platzi and UpGrad have capitalized on this, creating more curated growth and development products for emerging markets such as Latin America and India, respectively. Talstack, an abstraction from talent stack, aims to replicate the B2B elements of these platforms in Africa; it might explore a B2C offering similar to other local upskill platforms, including GOMYCODE and AltSchool, in the future.
“Our customers and those in the pipeline are telling us that the current learning options they have are not engaging enough for their employees, that the content and insights are not contextually relevant to their people, and that their feedback is not prioritized given Africa is not a priority for global upskilling companies,” said CEO Sulyman, who ran Black Ops, an Andela for operators over the last three years. “We are building Talstack with insights from the markets where our customers and their employees operate; we are in our customers’ offices, their WhatsApp messages, and their Twitter threads, learning about what drives the most value, iterating and building, quite literally, with them.”

Platzi picks up $62 million Series B to re-skill Latin American professionals

Talstack is currently running a closed pilot with eight paying customers (businesses), with at least three employees in each company taking the platform’s “self-paced courses and engaging in the learner community.” Currently, employees in its pilot have access to five courses on soft skills, including “Communicating Effectively in the Workplace,” “Giving and Receiving Feedback,” “Time Management,” “Goal Setting,” and “Problem-Solving.” 
Sulyman said the startup launched with soft skills because it was a pressing need for the companies in its closed pilot and through their research, “soft skills are the bigger problem for companies today.” He also stated that because these skills are necessary regardless of a company’s department and cut across roles, it was faster to deploy and test some hypotheses. The three-month-old upstart will shortly onboard more professionals as it develops a more robust course catalog to address Africa’s most sought-after cross-functional and domain skills and competencies. The upstart also plans to open access to a broader set of employers in the second half of this year.
Backing from local investors to drive experimentation
Talstack courses are taught by African professionals and operators with operating experience in Africa, working for prominent startups and multinationals such as Andela, MAX, Paystack and Google. Each course has several modules in video format (five minutes or less). While Talstack pays these instructors a flat fee per course, it might explore sharing its revenue (which it gets from currently charging businesses a monthly subscription of N10,000 (~$13.33) per employee) as it engages a broader set of instructors upon launch. 
“Many of our current instructors are experienced professionals who already have an appetite for sharing their knowledge and are being viewed as thought leaders. However, there is no scalable way for them to create and deliver courses to a large, engaged audience, which Talstack provides,” said Sulyman, adding that other companies and traditional training agencies can monetize their content on platforms like these professionals. 
On the other hand, employees can access tools and a journey map for self-assessment, an active community of other learners and opportunities to interact with these African operators through live Q&As. 
L-R: Kayode Oyewole and Seni Sulyman (Talstack co-founders)
The size of Africa’s workforce today is close to 400 million people and leaders of the continent’s most prominent companies have the same fears as their global counterparts. In PwC’s annual CEO survey, 87% of African business leaders expressed concern about the impact of talent gaps on their company’s productivity and ability to deliver on business outcomes, and 47% of them would like to prioritize training and upskilling to bridge skill gaps. 
Therefore, though Talstack is starting with small startups with tens to hundreds of employees, helping legacy companies such as banks, telcos and large consumer-facing companies deliver outcomes for thousands of their employees is critical to seeing exponential growth and adoption. For now, though, Talstack, buoyed by founders-market fit and an $850,000 pre-seed, will first experiment, then wait and see if Africa, which has the youngest population globally, wants what it’s selling. 
“We’ll continue running our ongoing closed pilot, fill a few important roles, launch more courses and tools, iterate on tech/product and open up the platform to more companies. Our pre-seed round aims to prove our thesis with customers ahead of our seed,” Oyewole noted. “The only way we build hundreds and thousands of regionally and globally competitive companies on the continent is for us to have a highly competent workforce across all levels and that’s the need Talstack addresses.”
Pan-African early-stage investor Ventures Platform led the pre-seed round while Voltron Capital and Golden Palm Investments participated. TLcom Capital, an Africa-focused growth fund, also backed the startup, its first pre-seed investment from the firm’s second fund (TIDE Africa Fund II), according to partner Eloho Omame.

ChrysCapital invests $100 million in India’s Lenskart,Manish Singh,2023/06/14,"
ChrysCapital has invested $100 million in Lenskart, the two said Thursday, pushing the Asian eyewear startup’s raise in the past year to $850 million as it expands its offerings and reach in international markets.
The Indian private equity firm is buying shares worth $100 million in Lenskart through both primary and secondary transactions, the two said. The new investment follows Abu Dhabi Investment Authority announcing plans to invest $500 million in Lenskart. That investment, like the capital infusion from ChrysCapital, is an extension to last year’s round. About 450 million of the $600 million fundraise this year is secondary transaction.
“ChrysCapital is one of the most esteemed Indian equity partners, and it is my privilege to have them by our side. Incidences of myopia are rapidly growing globally, especially in Asia, including India, with big unsolved problems of access, affordability, and awareness. We believe that with the help of technology, customer centricity, and big investments in supply chain and talent, we can eradicate the problem of vision correction,” said Peyush Bansal, founder and chief executive of Lenskart, in a statement.
The 12-year-old Indian eyewear startup, which counts SoftBank and Alpha Wave Global among its backers, sells eyeglasses, sunglasses, contact lenses and other eyewear accessories. It has become one of the largest eyewear players in India by undercutting the competition, offering premium glasses at affordable prices.
Lenskart has been able to keep the prices low because it’s bringing more efficiency into the eyewear sector, Bansal told TechCrunch in a recent interview. The firm has built the expertise to manufacture its own eyeglasses and contact lenses and for many technologies, it’s the exclusive licensing partner for global firms in India, he said.
The startup, which currently has operations in India, Southeast Asia and the Middle East, sells its eye products online and through over 2,000 stores, three-fourths of which are in India. The startup is opening more than seven stores a week and plans to manufacture 20 million pairs of glasses next year.
Hundreds of millions of Indians need vision correction, but only a fraction of this population is currently wearing glasses or contact lenses. Bansal said the company will continue to scale its operations in India and existing international markets where it has operations because they remain highly underserved.
But what has helped Lenskart, and the eyewear industry at large, is just how quickly Indians are adopting glasses, he said. People are buying as many as four pairs of glasses every two years, a figure that is closely growing to five, he said, pointing to a similar popularity in sneaker purchases.
The startup is also slowly expanding its premium offerings, thanks to the acquisition of Japanese eyewear brand OwnDays and its new in-house brands such as John Jacobs.
“ChrysCapital is excited to back a strong execution-focused management team that has established dominant market leadership in the eyewear segment. Lenskart has been instrumental in developing this market, driven by its unwavering commitment to exceptional customer satisfaction, affordability, and reliability. With the acquisition of Owndays, there is an opportunity for Lenskart to expand across 10+ Asian countries in addition to the already large Indian market,” said Rajiv Batra, SVP at ChrysCapital, in a statement.

Dear Sophie,
My startup is hiring and many excellent engineers need H-1B transfers, but I haven’t done one yet.
Approximately how much time and money will we need to set aside for the process? Are there alternatives?
— Careful Co-Founder
Dear Careful,
Congrats on making it to the next stage: hiring!
Working with an experienced immigration attorney can help you save time and money in the process so you can onboard your new hires rapidly and continue to build. It’s important that your attorney understands your startup’s vision and goals.
Transferring an H-1B
To start, it’s important to take the required steps to qualify your startup for sponsoring the H-1B visa before proceeding with the transfer. If you’re transferring the H-1B of an individual who was recently laid off and is still in the U.S., it’s important to take these steps quickly since that person’s 60-day grace period has already started counting down.
Your attorney will help you determine the best strategy and assist your company with petitioning for the new hire.
Most immigration attorneys charge flat fees for their services, but those fees can vary substantially, so consider your options. According to a National Foundation for American Policy report issued a few years ago, the government filing fees and attorney legal fees for preparing and filing an H-1B transfer range in the market from $5,000 to $30,000 (rare but apparently possible!).
An H-1B specialty occupation visa transfer for a startup can typically be accomplished in a month or so, and usually for less than $10,000 all in — often much less than a recruiter. Check out this podcast episode on how to save money in the immigration process.

How the process works
For a brand-new startup, your attorney will first get your startup’s Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) verified by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Foreign Labor Certification, which takes about a week.
Next, your attorney needs to file a Labor Condition Application (LCA) with the Labor Department to basically verify your startup will pay the H-1B transfer candidate the prevailing wage based on the job and geographical location of the job and that no qualified American worker is available to fill it.
The LCA has a dual purpose of protecting both American and foreign workers. There are posting requirements of various documents that can be accomplished digitally and/or physically depending on if you have a remote or physical office. The Labor Department normally processes LCAs in less than two weeks. "
Former SEC chair Jay Clayton feels ‘vast majority’ of crypto tokens are securities,Jacquelyn Melinek,2023/06/14,"

Former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has reiterated his position that many cryptocurrencies could be defined as securities, even as the crypto industry continues to combat the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over the regulator’s prohibitive stance toward the industry.
“I’ve said this for a long time: I think the market has evolved, but many, if not the vast majority, of the tokens that were sold for cash would fall within the definition of a security in America,” Clayton, now a senior policy advisor and counsel at Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, said at the R3 CordaDay conference on Wednesday.
The definition of a security is “intentionally broad and flexible,” Clayton noted. But, he added that there’s a chance that something once labeled a security, “might not always be a security.”
So what could cause that shift? Present utility versus future utility, Clayton said.
Clayton pointed to Broadway tickets as an example: If someone bought 1,000 tickets for $10 and told their friends and family they would be able to resell those tickets for $100 or $1,000, then it’s a security, he said. “But if you just buy the ticket 10 years later, it’s just a ticket.”
“The confusion around that, and the horrible legal advice [that’s been] given has led to bitter, emotional fights over classification,” Clayton said.
For the former SEC chair, the bigger question is how to trade those tickets when they’re not securities. For example, Taylor Swift tickets, which have caused a bit of chaos for fans and Ticketmaster in recent months, can resell for thousands of dollars more than initially bought, but that would not be securities trading, Clayton said. “But we should have a digitized market for it.”

Synthesia secures $90M for AI that generates custom avatars,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/14,"
Once the pandemic normalized virtual meetups, the concept of “personalized AI” began to gain steam.
Startups creating “AI-driven” avatars — realistic-looking characters with synthetic voices that star in pre-recorded or live videos — have raised hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital over the past few years. As such avatars improve, they promise to deliver more personalized digital marketing and training experiences while reducing the costs typically associated with video production.
That’s at least the sales pitch from Synthesia, one of the startups using AI to create synthetic videos for advertising and other use cases. The company yesterday announced that it raised $90 million in a Series C round led by Accel with a strategic investment from Nvidia and participation from Kleiner Perkins, GV, Firstmark Capital and MMC. The round brings Synthesia’s total raised to date to $156.6 million, and it values the startup at $1 billion post-money (up from $300 million in December 2021).
Co-founder and CEO Victor Riparbelli tells TechCrunch that Synthesia is a “sustainable business” and wasn’t looking for an additional investment, but that Accel and Nvidia approached the company with a compelling offer.
“We now have over 50,000 customers,” Riparbelli said via email. “We don’t disclose revenue figures at this time, but the company has a year-over-year user growth rate of 456% and over 15 million videos generated on the platform to date.”
Founded in 2017 by a team of AI researchers and entrepreneurs from University College London, Stanford, Technical University of Munich and Cambridge, Synthesia, which now employs around 200 people, is developing AI tech that lets customers create instructional videos featuring stock or custom AI avatars. Users type in text, select an avatar and choose a language to generate videos.
Image Credits: Synthesia
Synthesia’s AI is trained on real actors, and actors are paid per video that’s generated with their image and voice.
Among Synthesia’s clients are Tiffany’s, IHG, Teleperformance, BSH, Moody’s Analytics and entities of the United Nations. According to Riparbelli, 35% of the Fortune 100 is using the startup’s for training and marketing purposes
“Synthesia is transforming physical video production into an entirely digital process that will enable creators to bring their ideas … to life with just a Synthesia account,” Riparbelli said. “Our mission is to make video easy for everyone.”
Some experts have expressed concern that tools like Synthesia’s could be used to create deepfakes, or AI-generated videos that take a person in an existing video and replace them with someone else’s likeness. The fear is that these fakes might be used to do things like sway opinion during an election or implicate a person in a crime.
Tech developed by Synthesia has also been misused to produce propaganda in Venezuela and false news reports promoted by pro-China social media accounts.
Synthesia, for its part, says that it vets its customers and their scripts and requires formal consent from a person before it’ll synthesize their appearance. Its disinformation team suspends accounts found to have violated its terms of service, which prohibit the use of its tech for “political, sexual, personal, criminal and discriminatory content.”
Riparbelli says that the investment from the Series C will be put toward making Synthesia’s avatars more expressive and the Synthesia platform faster and “more collaborative.”

"Rejoice, for startup valuations are slowly recovering",Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/14,"
We have good news for tech companies big and small this fine Wednesday morning: valuations are heading higher, though at a modest pace.
New public market data indicates that software stocks are rising to their highest points so far this year. To make it sweeter, the underlying revenue multiples at public companies are expanding as well, especially at the faster growing subset of software companies.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

Investors today seem to think public software companies are worth more per dollar of revenue in aggregate. That will lift some pressure from startups struggling to raise new capital at attractive prices or harmonize legacy private-market companies’ valuations with their hoped-for IPOs. Clearing the massive startup liquidity backlog will take more than a modest reinflation of software valuations, but it’s a start.
Starting with high-level numbers, here’s a look at the Bessemer Cloud Index’s performance this year. Note that the value of the constituent companies kicked off the year strong, gave back most of those gains, and then starting in May, began to pick up steam once again (YCharts data):

"Majority, a digital bank for US migrants, grabs $9.75M amid expansion in Texas",Christine Hall,2023/06/14,"
Majority, a mobile banking company offering financial services to U.S. migrants, closed on its fourth funding round in two years as it opens a community meetup space in Laredo, Texas.
The new location positions the company close to The Gateway to the Americas International Bridge that crosses the Rio Grande, Magnus Larsson, founder and CEO at Majority, told TechCrunch. Majority already has physical locations across Florida, in Miami, Hialeah and Orlando, and in Houston.
“We started off in Texas and Florida,” Larsson said. “Florida has been our main focus for a period of time now, however, our business is about trust, and there is an opportunity to be the first banking product that you can open when you enter the country. As an immigrant myself, I experienced how hard it can be to seek out the services and support you need.”
For a $5.99 per month membership fee, the company, founded in 2019, offers migrants a bank account and debit card, community discounts, fee-free international money transfer and discounted international calling.
Accounts don’t require a Social Security number or U.S. documentation, just an international government-issued ID and proof of U.S. residence, and don’t have overdraft fees or minimum balance requirements. There is also access to Majority’s “Advisor Program,” a network of over 250 trained support staff nationwide, who are immigrants themselves.

Majority, a mobile bank for migrants, closes third venture round in just over a year

Larsson didn’t provide specifics on the company’s customer base or revenue beyond saying that Majority’s transaction volume is growing 6x per year.
The $9.75 million in new capital is an extension to Majority’s $37.5 million Series B, announced last September. Existing investors Valar Ventures and Heartcore Capital were involved in this round. Majority has now raised over $86 million in equity, including $19 million seed and $27 million Series A rounds.
The new funding will support the expansion into Laredo and additional growth along the United States-Mexico border.
Along with the new presence in Laredo, Majority will release a “Financial Handbook for Mexicans” later this year that is a specialized version of its “Migrant Handbook” that provides information on starting a life in the U.S.
“The main thing for us is to continue following the plan and structure that we started at the beginning, which is to take a step-by-step approach, starting with one community at a time, then adding another and another,” Larsson said. “This funding is more of a step for us to continue the momentum and start doing more.”

Editor’s note: June 20, 9:32 a.m. PST, updated to note that the service includes “fee-free” international money transfers. The company said “This is the most competitive rate among remittances services, only charging mandatory production costs with no markups or extra fees.”

Dear Sophie: Does it make sense to sponsor immigrant talent to work remotely?

"Bootstrapped to 800,000 users, online programming community JDoodle lands funding",Catherine Shu,2023/06/14,"
Started as a side project, JDoodle, which lets developers practice more than six dozen programming languages on one website, hit 800,000 users while being bootstrapped. Now the Australia-based startup has set a goal of 8 million users within the next 24 months after getting $3.2 million AUD (about $2.2 million USD) in new funding. The round was led by Main Sequence, the venture firm founded by Australia’s national science agency.
JDoodle has tools aimed at software developers of all levels, ranging from students to professionals. These include zero-set up IDEs (integrated development environments) for more than 76 coding languages, including Java CloudIDE, that lets users write and run code in their browsers without having to set up local software or libraries.
Over the past year, JDoodle hit 800,000 users, including 3,000 educational institutions. JDoodle was started by software developer Gokul Chandrasekaran, who spent seven years working on it and reached 500,000 users before quitting his job to focus on it full-time. It grew out of a side project with one page and programming language that Chandrasekaran set up for $20, before spending evenings and weekends adding new features based on user feedback.
Chandrasekaran told TechCrunch that he wanted to start JDoodle because of the inefficiencies he encountered, like expensive and complicated development tools, while working on his bachelors and masters degrees in computer science.
“Those tools force every developer to waste so much of their time just getting the software environment ready for us to do our jobs. Even running one line of program is a headache,” he said. “You need sophisticated hardware and hours to set up a development environment with libraries, compilers, editors and more,” only to risk everything breaking if there’s an update to their operating systems.
For teachers and students, this means wasting time fixing development environment issues and manually verifying programming assignments. For professionals, this means time spent away from actually developing and instead used to manage their software development environments. By using JDoodle, Chandrasekaran said, they can get inexpensive access to programming environments and practice programming in a browser even on basic smartphones.
Main Sequence partner Mike Nicholls and JDoodle founder Gokul Chandrasekaran
“Software developers spend so much time setting up and managing their software development environments and focusing on small, unimportant tasks like changing the color of a button,” he said. “We need to free up developers to focus on the tasks that really matter because I’d say that organizations are currently wasting 20% of their software development budget.”
JDoodle’s growth to 800,000 users was organic, and it didn’t spend time or money on marketing until recently. “I believe the reason we’ve amassed so many users so far is because I listen to them,” said Chandrasekaran. “Over the years, I’ve taken so much feedback on board from developers and built the platform according to their needs. Every single feature in JDoodle exists as a result of a user request or feedback.”
Some examples of JDoodle’s customers include edtech Outlier, which offers accredited college courses. JDoodle’s plugins are embedded into its computer science courses, so students don’t need to switch between the class and a local practice environment. Another example is South American recruitment platform GeekHunter, which has used JDoodle since 2018 in its vetting process. Candidates pass coding exams produced by JDoodle before they are approved.
JDoodle monetizes through a freemium SaaS subscription model. Chandrasekaran said most of its revenue comes from its API and plugin solutions, which include standard and custom plans, but the startup is planning more income streams, including premium IDEs, hosting, courses, assignments and a talent marketplace.
The new funding will go toward JDoodle’s plans to scale up to 8 million users, including marketing, product development and hiring for its team in Australia.
Main Sequence met JDoodle while the startup was participating in The University of New South Wales’ 10x Accelerator Founders Program. Partner Mike Nicholls told TechCrunch about the investment that “Main Sequence has invested in more than 50 deep-tech startups and almost every one of them ends up hiring large numbers of developers and software engineers. Every startup is looking for a competitive edge and higher productivity from their software and hardware team. Essentially we want to turbocharge how companies and developers create the next generation of business systems.”

"With Equifax in its sights, TransUnion invests $24M in income verification platform Truework",Paul Sawers,2023/06/14,"
Truework, an income and employment verification platform used by banks, lenders, property managers and employers, today announced a strategic partnership and $24 million in equity funding from consumer credit reporting giant TransUnion.
Founded in 2017, San Francisco-based Truework integrates with third-party services, such as payroll providers, to help mortgage providers and similar lenders verify users and approve loans directly from within their own applications. It can also be used by landlords or would-be employers to carry out background checks.
With its latest partnership, which quietly went live a few weeks ago, TransUnion will effectively be selling Truework’s income verification product alongside its main credit product, meaning that a TransUnion customer such as a bank will be able to access both credit and income data through a single API.
“Having both data sets accessible via the same API and vendor is powerful for the lender and customer,” Truework co-founder and CEO Ryan Sandler explained to TechCrunch. “Especially for the thousands of customers who already use TransUnion for credit data.”
The Equifax factor
Today’s announcement comes some 10 months after Truework closed a $50 million Series C round of funding, and the fact that TransUnion has now made a direct $24 million equity investment is indicative of how deep the partnership between the two companies is. Although it’s far too early to make any wild predictions, it would not be all that surprising if this investment served as a pre-cursor to a full-on acquisition given the synergies between the duo. Indeed, TransUnion is no stranger to the world of M&A, having bought some 10 companies, including venture-backed startups, in the past five years alone.
In the nearer term, however, this partnership puts TransUnion in a stronger position to compete with the likes of industry heavyweight Equifax, which already offers income verification alongside its credit reporting toolset.
“Until recently, Equifax was the only [credit reporting] bureau that had an income verification product, and they were able to maximize distribution of this product through established credit channels,” Sandler said. “This advantage was especially apparent in mortgage, where income and employment verification has become required for conforming loans since the Dodd-Frank Act came into effect. This partnership now allows TransUnion to provide income data through Truework and compete directly in the multi-billion dollar income verification business.”
From Truework’s vantage point, meanwhile, the partnership helps it gain significantly more exposure among some of the world’s biggest companies.
“We are already in many mortgage lenders, and the product drives a ton of value for these customers,” Sandler continued. “Now, TransUnion will be distributing the product to new verticals and use cases, from property management to credit card applications.”

"Backed by Google’s Gradient, Versed wants to help storytellers create video games using generative AI",Paul Sawers,2023/06/14,"
Generative AI has undoubtedly been the big buzzword of the past year, driven in large part by Microsoft-backed OpenAI and ChatGPT. But while the ability to create all manner of fresh content from a simple prompt raises various societal and ethical questions, it also opens the door to myriad businesses that simply would not have been possible just 12 months ago.
Venture Capitalists (VCs) have been pouring bucketloads of cash into generative AI startups, with some investors launching dedicated funds specifically for it — just this week, Salesforce Ventures revealed it was upping its generative AI investment fund, announced in March, from $250 million to $500 million.
It’s against this backdrop that fledgling European startup Versed is looking to make its mark by allowing anyone to create their own role-playing game (RPG) simply by writing text-based stories and instructions. Versed claims that its AI interprets the narrative and assigns characters and locations from an in-house database to create immersive worlds.
Founded out of the Netherlands just four months ago, Versed is the handiwork of CTO and former Unity developer Cat Burton, and CEO Robert Gaal, a former Googler and entrepreneur with several startups to his name. In the intervening months, Versed has grown its remote-first team to seven people spread across the U.K., Denmark, Bulgaria, and the U.S. Now, in preparation for scaling the business from early-alpha to a full-fledged commercial product next year, the company today revealed that it has raised €1.6 ($1.7 million) in a pre-seed round of funding led by Google’s Gradient Ventures.
The generation game
Generative AI is already making inroads into the gaming sphere. Developers have shown how they can generate original visual assets, with the likes of San Francisco-based Scenario recently raising $6 million in seed funding to do just that. Gaming giant Roblox also announced new tools to let game developer generate entire virtual worlds through natural language prompts, while Microsoft is working on similar generative AI smarts for its hugely popular Minecraft franchise.
While Versed certainly runs tangential to these efforts, its attempt to let creators generate an entire RPG through story alone — zero coding — could take things to the next level.
“I would say that most of our competitors are more on the developer side, and that is not who we’re focused on,” Gaal told TechCrunch. “We’re not focused on engineering, or anything like that. We are building a way to make your own role playing video game, just by writing a story. We use that story to then generate fully 3D immersive worlds, with turn-based combat and branching dialogue, and everything that makes a role playing game great.”
To do this, the writer might describe the characters and their location, including specifics such as costumes they’re wearing or what era (e.g. medieval) a scene is taking place, and Versed matches the description with visuals that were created by its own in-house artists.

Under the hood, Versed uses a combination of LLMs and its own algorithms to match assets and build worlds. The role of the LLM here is to summarize the creator’s descriptions of the game’s content, after which it uses procedural generation — a method whereby computers create data — to build all the locations and match with assets in its internal library.
While Versed is currently using OpenAI’s GPT-4, Burton says that they have engineered their platform so that they can easily switch to a different LLM should a more suitable language model arrive on the scene.
“Because it keeps evolving so quickly, every week there seems to be a new LLM or a different advancement that comes out, we’ve decoupled it so we can switch it to any different LLM as they progress,” Burton explained.
For gameplay, Versed leans on the Unity game engine, which will allow games to be played on just about any platform, though initially gameplay will be limited to Mac and PC.
Immersive
There are some similarities here to what something like Twine has been doing for the past decade or so, with a focus on helping creators generate text-based interactive fiction on the web. “We basically go that extra step and make it fully immersive in 3D,” Burton said.
Ultimately, Versed is striving to remove all the technical and design knowhow from game development, hiding the game engine in the background to allow storytellers to focus on what they know best.
“There’s always that huge barrier to entry to those [game engines] if you want to build a game — you’ve got to know code, you’ve got to know art, you’ve got to know audio, marketing, editing all of that,” Burton said. “So we basically bridge that whole gap for people. So they can write a story like they would do in something like Twine, but what they get is a fully immersive 3D game.”
Sample Versed characters Image Credits: Versed
After TechCrunch viewed an early demo of a game created through Versed, it’s clear that there is potential for something truly revolutionary in terms of democratizing game development. But “generative AI” is surely all about allowing the user (i.e. the storyteller) to “generate” their own in-game assets, rather than relying on a library of characters and scenes created in-house at Versed? For now, that isn’t possible, but it is the ultimate end-goal. Burton says that they first need to create all their own assets, from which they can train their own text-to-3D models.
“We want to start by building the assets manually, because then when we train 3D, it’ll be trained using our own assets, our own art style, and we won’t be stealing somebody else’s IP (intellectual property),” Burton explained.
This is important for a number of reasons, beyond building its own brand and ensuring that it’s not encroaching upon someone else’s work. Indeed, it’s simply not possible to build a big enough library of assets by hand that will cover every requirement, which is why we’re seeing the likes of stock photo giant Shutterstock embrace generative AI too.
So while Versed plans to continue developing its own art, it will augment this with generative AI.
“In the long run, we want to generate the assets that are missing,” Burton continued. “We’re always going to keep our art team, that’s very important to us. But if someone writes a story, and they want a three-headed dragon wearing a top hat, the likelihood is we won’t have that in our database. So we’ll hopefully try and create that for them.”

Target market
At its core, Versed is targeting creators that are already active in the worlds of interactive storytelling, those who are perhap slooking to transition from offline to digital.
“We’re choosing role playing games first, because this is a very well established format to tell a story,” Gaal said. “A lot of our creators that we’re working with right now, a large part of them are gamemasters, they live stream on Twitch where they sell their own board games or their their own adventure novels that you can use in your board game. So this made a lot of sense, because they were already used to writing for interactive storytelling — they’ve just never done it in a digital format.”
The big elephant in the room here is the issue of business model — how, exactly, does Versed plan to make money? While the specifics are still being ironed out, Gaal said that they will likely pursue a subscription-based model where gamers subscribe to individual creators or types of adventures, with Versed taking a cut.
“Our goal is to ensure that this is a platform where our creators can make a living,” Gaal said. “We’re focused on making sure that creators can keep shipping every single week, or every single month, a new adventure for you to play. So it’s episodical, and it’s highly tailored to how creators currently work with their fanbase, which could be a weekly podcast or a monthly newsletter. So we’re trying to remain in line with that.”
For now, Versed is working with 10 creators as part of an early alpha program, with plans to introduce the first roster of games by around October time when it will launch its private beta at New York’s Comic Con. A full public launch is currently slated for the second half of 2024.
In addition to lead backer Gradient Ventures, Versed’s pre-seed round included participation from Berlin-based investor Cherry Ventures, and angels hailing from companies including Unity, Twitch, Remote, and Framer.

One Future Football’s virtual worldwide soccer league launches with backing from Blackbird,Catherine Shu,2023/06/14,"
Founded in Melbourne, One Future Football (1FF) bills itself as the “world’s first global soccer league,” and it’s goal is to attract first-time soccer fans. It launches today with more than 250 CGI generated players, who have backstories created so all fans have someone they can relate to (for example, there are players with diabetes and autism), and 12 founding member teams around the world.
1FF also announced today it has raised $3 million in pre-seed funding led by Blackbird Ventures, with participation from strategic investors like soccer players Chris Smalling, Patrice Evra and Jesse Lingard and UFC fighter Kamaru Usman. Tennis stars Naomi Osaka, Nick Kyriagos and Ons Jabeur will also be involved as ambassadors for the brand.
1FF’s sports code is completely virtual and consists of 12 weekly matches across two rounds, broadcast around the world with narrative-driven content. Teams play against each other in a league format. Founding member teams are located around the world, including London, Paris, Buenos Aires, Los Angeles, India, Indonesia and Japan.
Founded by serial entrepreneurs Peter Davis and Rohit Bhargava, who got to know each other while playing in the same Fantasy Premier League mini-league. Before 1FF, Davis founded LAUNCH accelerator-backed creator discovery platform Ampjar and Australian social media agency Get Glossy. Bhargava founded fashion crowdfunding platform StageLabel, was part of the AWS Startups Team and hosts The Startup Playbook podcast.
Before starting Get Glossy, Davis worked in sports, ranging from professional teams to big firms like talent management agency. “We’re both pretty big football fans, getting up at crazy times of the early morning to watch matches on the other side of the world,” Bhargava said.
Davis called Bhargava and asked him if he’d like to see the new thing he was working on, which turned out to be 1FF. One thing that piqued the co-founders’ interest in creating a global football league was a BBC article called “Why the most interesting clubs in the USA do not really exist.” It covered “faux football clubs,” or teams that created their own backstories, press releases and merchandise, but did not actually have players on the field.
“What the article laid out felt like a pretty special cultural moment. Football has become a big part of fashion and vice versa, and whether it’s what you wear to football training, to the office, or to the pub, what you wear says a lot about you,” Bhargava said. “Football clubs felt like the perfect way to shape a narrative that people want to say about themselves, because you can associate it with a geographic reason, causes like positive action in the climate sense, or even a style of play. As we delved deeper, we felt we could tap into trends around athlete investors and help build stories around each of the teams through them as well.”
To design each of 1FF’s 250 CGI players, which players’ sporting attributes were first set by one of 1FF’s engines. Then their personalities and lived experiences were inspired by different sources.
1FF founders Rohit Bhargava and Pete Davis with footballers Ondrej Sykora (left) and Jamil Skaik (right)
“We wanted to ensure we create a home for people that may never have connected with sport before,” Bhargava said. “You never hear of an athlete who’s into cosplay or LARPing in the park on a weekend or playing Magic the Gathering, but why shouldn’t they?”
1FF spoke with panels in each of their geographies in order to create characters that appealed to them, with background stories that include similar interests and experiences.
“We have players who have grown up very comfortably but also players who were refugees, players who are gay, players who are diabetic, anaphylactic or have been diagnosed with autism. For us, it’s about showing young people that this is for them, that they can feel safe and never ashamed of who they are.”
The geographies of the 12 founding member teams were picked to give 1FF a good representation around the world. Its players represent 88 countries, which means that even though 1FF doesn’t have a team in huge footballing countries like Mexico, Germany, Spain, Italy, Egypt, Turkey, South Korea and China yet, it does have hero players that people can follow and use as their stepping stone into 1FF.
Major League Soccer (MLS) is a big business, with Davis and Bhargava pointing to stats like Angel City valuation at $100 million despite launching only three years ago (they share some investors with 1FF), and the top 10 esports companies worth an average of $353 million, up 46% compared to December 2020.
Despite the rise of esports, Davis and Bhargava expect that their main competition will be stadium football. But 1FF’s goal is to reach fans in places like the U.S., Nigeria, India or Indonesia, who might never be able to go to a Premier League game. “Our job is to build something that resonates with them better than the Premier League, MLS, La Liga or the Bundesliga can,” Bhargava said. “This means clubs that exist for greater reasons than just to win matches, and players who look like them or have the same experiences and interests as them. We know that we an do special things with our players because they’re wholly owned by us, so we can give fans a level of control of their heres that has never been possible before.
In terms of monetization, 1FF will make money like other sporting teams, through kit sales, commercial partnerships and pitch side advertising. Some players have their own social media accounts, and brands, which 1FF will announce soon, have already signed sponsorship deals with players and teams. Some monetization channels specific to a virtual sports platform include player cards (with 10,000 available for each player) and Club Credits to give fans deeper experiences with their favorite players and clubs.
Season 1 of One Future Football starts on June 23, but before then, there will be pre-season games like matchups between Naija United (Nigeria’s team) vs Manhattan Football Club (US), Inter Nusantra (Indonesia) vs Paris St-Dennis (France) and Club De Sportivo Palermo (Argentina) vs Tokyo Youth Club (Japan).
In a statement about the funding, Blackbird partner and co-founder Niki Scevak said, “At the core of each sports fan is the desire to be an owner, to influence the decisions each club makes and to endlessly debate the merits of each small decision. Technology offers a unique opportunity to enable this at scale, and 1FF is the digital version of fantasy sports with an incredibly creative twist. As serial founders and lifelong sports fans themselves, Pete and Rohit are uniquely placed to build a modern media company like 1FF, and we’re proud to back them from the very beginning.”

Kaya Founders backs Philippines startups from ‘Day 0’,Catherine Shu,2023/06/13,"
The Philippines’ startup ecosystem is poised for strong growth, thanks to the country’s rising GDP, fast adoption of online services and a new generation of founders. Launched by tech and investment veterans, Kaya Founders wants to back the most promising startups from the very beginning. The venture firm announced today that it has closed $12 million in funding across two new funds, bringing its total committed capital to $16.5 million, with a target of $25 million. The new funding was led by the Gokongwei family.
Kaya (which means “can do” in Tagalog) was founded in 2021 by former Zalora Philippines CEO Paulo Campos, Summit Media president Lisa Gokongwei-Cheng and Locad CEO Constantin Robertz. Both Gokongwei-Cheng and Robertz are prolific angel investors, and have backed startups like Good Glamm Group, Kumu, Dali and Edamama.
The firm now has 32 companies in its portfolio, including e-commerce enabler Etaily, on-demand wage startup Advance, online clinic Kindred and MSME point-of-sale app Peddlr. Kaya’s Zero to One fund focuses on pre-seed companies, sometimes before they have gone to market. Its One to Ten Fund invests in more mature companies, from seed to Series A, that have already found product-market fit and are on their way to profitability.
Zero to One will invest $150,000 to $250,000 checks into 20 to 30 pre-seed companies, while One to Ten’s checks will range from $250,000 to $500,000 and go toward 30 to 40 startups.
Kaya’s investment thesis centers around the Philippines’ young population, economic growth (the country’s GDP is expected to double to $6,500 by 2030) and high adoption of online services.
Its founders point to a report by Foxmont Capital, another venture firm focused on early-stage Philippines startups, that show funding in the country grew to $1.03 billion in 2021 and $1.1 billion in 2022, despite the global slowdown in deal activity. Based on Kaya’s calculations, $4 billion in capital has been closed by local and regional funds over the past two years, which means Kaya’s portfolio companies have plenty of opportunities for follow-on funding.
A lot of funding in the Philippines comes from corporate venture capital, but new players are emerging, says Campos. These include regional and global investors who are investing for the first time in the Philippines, like Sequoia Surge in Locad; KKR in GrowSari; A16z in Yield Guild Games; Tiger Global in PDAX; and Cecano and SoftBank in Sprout Solutions, plus local funds like Kaya, Foxmont Capital and Core Capital.
Kaya Founders’ team
Campos compared the growth of the Philippines’ startup ecosystem to India in the 2000s and Indonesia over the past decade. One of the main reasons is founders who have experience working at large tech companies like Grab, Lazada and Zalora, as well as Filipinos who were educated abroad returning to start companies in their home country. Campos told TechCrunch that Kaya has seen four founder archetypes emerge thanks to a confluence of the Philippines’ economic, business and cultural development.
The first is “second generation tech talent,” or former employees of large tech companies that “had their eyes opened to how quickly a unicorn can be born when you hit product-market fit,” said Campos. The second is corporate executives who left their jobs to start companies and bring domain expertise to their new roles. Peddlr founder Nel Laygo is one example—he worked at Unilever and Proctor and Gamble before launching the company to provide a POS system for sari-sari, or corner stores.
The third segment are founders who have experience working abroad, including Filipino expats and members of the Filipino diaspora, and the fourth are non-Filipinos who decided to start companies in the Philippines, taking advantage of the fact that English is the main language of business (Kaya’s portfolio includes founders from countries like Germany, the U.S., Singapore and India).
An example of the third segment is Kindred founder Jessica de Mesa, who was chief commercial officer at Zalora and spent half a decade working at its parent company, Global Fashion Group, in Singapore and London. De Mesa returned to the Philippines to lead Zalora Philippines’ commercial team, but wanted to return to healthcare (de Mesa is a registered nurse). Kaya had previously developed Kindred as a concept under its healthcare-focused joint venture, Pulse-63, and backed de Mesa as a “institutional co-founder” from its beginning.
“We are really seeing an acceleration of the flywheel of startups seeing customer traction and adoption, attracting investors both locally and internationally, and those success stories and fundraising round announcements inspiring a new breed of founders to throw their hat in the ring as well,” said Campos. “We see this as being very similar to what has emerged in Indonesia the past six to seven years, with the Philippines being at the cusp of the inflection point, just before the rocket takes off.”
Some challenges the Philippines’ startup ecosystem still have to deal with include a fairly nascent venture ecosystem, dominated by local CVCs, and problems sourcing tech talent and finding strategic partners with experience in go-to-market strategies, Campos said. Kaya was founded to help bridge the gap, giving founders access to people like former Lazada Philippines CEO Ray Alimurung, who was recently appointed as general partner of the Zero to One Fund, and Gokongwei-Cheng, for mentoring and strategizing.
Other support founders can get from Kaya include recruitment, legal services, educational material, office space and product development support, and a network of downstream investors, strategic partners, beta testers and pilot customers.
“We feel strongly that from now until the end of the decade, we will be living through the ‘golden age’ of startups in the Philippines,” Campos said. “That opportunity is also not just for local homegrown ventures, but also regional SEA or global startups that target the Philippines as a growth market.”

Finfra lets Indonesian businesses add embedded finance to their platforms,Catherine Shu,2023/06/13,"
Finfra, an Indonesian startup that provides the tech infrastructure for online businesses that want to offer embedded finance products, has raised $1 million in new funding. The round included participation from DSX Ventures, Seedstars International Ventures, Cento Ventures, Fintech Nation, FirstPick, BADideas Fund and Hustle Fund.
The startup’s new funding will be used on product development and to grow Finfra’s engineering, data and finance teams. Finfra grew out of consumer financial services provider Danabijak, which is profitable and will continue operating as a subsidiary of Finfra.
Finfra is industry-agnostic, but it focuses on digital supply chain platforms, agtech companies and merchant e-commerce platforms, said co-founder and CEO Markus Prommik. It provides a loan management system so businesses can offer credit to clients through their platforms. The most popular way Finfra is used is by businesses that want to add invoice financing or purchase financing solutions. Finfra primarily serves B2B, but can also be used for B2C applications.
Prommik describes Finfra as a “one-stop shop to launch and scale white-labelled credit services,” explaining that without the startup, its clients would need to spend millions of dollars to develop the necessary tech and infrastructure, spend up to five years acquiring lending licenses and building a team. Instead, by using Finfra’s APIs, they can start offering embedded finance within weeks.
Finfra’s key value proposition is control over the customer experience. It integrates risk controls and data from clients’ platforms so they can extend affordable credit without taking on too much risk. Finfra also has portfolio analytics to help customers monitor performance and key lending KPIs.
Finfra’s team (left to right): Reinis Simanovskis, Dionysius Yogadhitya, Markus Prommik, Hilda Indriana, Varun Rathi
Prommik said that Finfra’s differentiator from other embedded finance platforms in payments, data and infrastructure is that they do not offer credit, even though it is the most in-demand financial service. Instead of seeing them as competitors, Finfra views those platforms as potential allies.
One thing that Finfra believes will bolster its growth is the Indonesian Financial Services Authority (OJK) to reach financial inclusion targets of 90% by 2024, up from 75% in 2019. Despite growth in online platforms in Indonesia, many people and small businesses still lack access to credit through traditional means, like banks and other financial institutions, and instead rely on alternatives, including embedded finance.
In a statement, Patricia Sosrodjojo, general partner at Seedstars International Ventures, said, “We’ve seen similar initiatives succeed in emerging markets where MSMEs face significant hurdles to accessing capital. Finfra’s approach not only aligns with national economic development goals but is well-positioned to take on the challenges of this rapidly growing market.”

There’s a direct correlation between the size and strength of your network and your chances of success.
In fact, it’s relatively easy to connect with reputable investors — most firms’ websites have email addresses and contact forms.
There are a myriad of reasons why startups fail to get off the ground, but it generally boils down to three things:

you don’t have a billion-dollar idea.
you’re pitching the wrong investors.
they’re not sure if you can execute against the plan.

This month, all ten “How to pitch me” participants shared their investment theses, along with tactical advice for nontechnical founders and the questions they expect entrepreneurs to ask them during pitch meetings:

Spending money on Google AdWords, Meta, or with an influencer takes some getting used to.
Paid acquisition takes time to generate positive returns, but growth expert Jonathan Martinez says it’s still “the most efficient and frictionless way possible” to achieve product-market fit.
In this week’s column, he explains how to determine which channels work best with your offerings and breaks down his “battle-tested waitlist method” for capturing and leveraging user interest using tools like Canva and Leadpages.

The ‘AI arms race’ is about more than who will lead the industry
Lorenzo Thione hopes to see more support for the LGBTQ+ community within venture.
Gaingels Managing Director Lorenzo Thione talked to Dominic Madori-Davis about his work leading sustainability and AI investments for the syndicate and his journey as an openly gay investor.
In a wide-ranging conversation, Thione shared his views on today’s frothy AI market, spoke about where the sector is headed, and emphasized why it’s important to support founders who identify as LGBTQ+.
“They simply were not getting any access to the venture engine because of who they were,” he said.

I am not an early-stage investor, which is why I was so surprised to learn that video-game startups led the pack with regard to the median amount of seed money raised in Q1 2023.
“Transportation came in second, followed by food, biotech, data analytics, and then CRM and SaaS,” reports Alex Wilhelm, who reviewed numbers from Carta.
At the Series A level, renewables, logistics and hardware startups topped the list.
“Don’t worry, the answer here is not just ‘build an AI startup,’ even if that does appear to be pretty solid advice for avoiding a down round.”

Between 2009 and 2019, VCs operating in the U.K. directed 0.24% of their funding to Black founders.
“That’s worse in some ways than in the United States,” writes Dominic Madori-Davis. London-based Black Seed, an early-stage VC firm, recently raised £5 million to support Black entrepreneurs.
“We exist as a tech fund and a community,” said founder Karl Lokko. “We exist to bridge that gap and give Black founders inclusion.”

Deal Dive: Finally, a startup building a network for those who could benefit the most

A decade ago, Porter Braswell started Jopwell, an online community for people in tech “from underrepresented communities and backgrounds,” reports Rebecca Szkutak.
But expanding access doesn’t solve every problem.
“Retention is a major challenge and still remains so,” says Braswell, who’s now launching 2045, a career platform that will support workers between 30 and 45 years old with coaching, advice and events.
“It’s very taxing to be a professional of color in this country,” he said.
“If you’re a professional in the middle stage of your career and you look up and don’t see someone who looks like you, it is exhausting.”

Turo’s Q1 2023 results indicate it may be a while until we see its IPO,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/13,"
Late last week, car rental marketplace Turo dropped an updated S-1 filing featuring its first-quarter results. TechCrunch+ previously covered the company’s full-year 2022 results, noting at the time that Turo was growing quickly while staying profitable and was posting revenue totals that, when compared with its last known private valuation, were attractive indeed.
“What’s not to like?” we asked back in March.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

But this new slew of data complicates that previously rosy picture a little.
Today, instead of comparing Turo’s pace of revenue growth in Q1 2023 to the same period a year earlier, we’re going to compare that with Turo’s revenue growth rate throughout 2022. We’re doing this primarily because the company was enduring COVID-related headwinds in early 2021, which means it would be a bit unfair to compare Q1 2023 growth rates to those set in Q1 2022. The post-COVID tailwinds it enjoyed last year have somewhat tapered off now, so the growth that the company is seeing today could be argued to be more “organic” than what it saw a year ago.
In the first quarter, Turo’s revenue rose at a slower rate than it had in full-year 2022, and the company was unprofitable to boot. Seasonality is a factor in this business, so we’ll need to figure out just how much these new results matter, and if they should change our opinion that the company should go public post-haste.
The backdrop has changed since we last talked about this company: Cava’s IPO is rapidly approaching, and the venture-backed company seems to be enjoying strong interest for its shares despite not strictly being a tech company, indicating that there could be more appetite than expected for IPOs. Turo would prove a better test for tech companies wondering if the time is right to go public.
It’d be lovely if Turo’s Q1 2023 results give us reason to hope that it would go public this year. Fresh and pertinent data on the demand for tech shares in the public market would be incredibly useful to our reporting on the late-stage startup market. After all, what is Turo if not a late-stage unicorn full of private capital?
Turo’s first quarter
In 2022, Turo’s revenue rose 59% to $746.6 million compared to $469 million in 2021. But that increase in revenue also came with higher spending, with operations and support expenses rising 92%, product development costs climbing by 66%, and sales and marketing costs increasing by 111% to $111.3 million in the year.
Still, the company enjoyed a 5% operating margin and an even better bottom line. It was a good year for Turo, which saw revenues stuck between $140 million and $150 million in 2019 and 2020. But there was an explosion in consumer demand for mobility options after COVID waned, and Turo’s revenues soared as a result. "
Zero-Error Systems raises $7.5M for its radiation-hardened semiconductor integrated circuits,Kate Park,2023/06/13,"
Space is a tough place for electronic circuits since radiation causes short circuits that result in mission failure, said Hwai Lin Khor, vice president of Zero-Error Systems.
Many companies currently build satellite electronics systems with commercial-off-the-shelves (COTS) semiconductor devices to meet the lower cost requirement. But according to Khor, the COTS chip devices can’t meet the radiation performance, causing system failure and data corruption in space. To address the issues using COTS semiconductor devices, Singapore-based startup Zero-Error Systems (ZES) built a patented radiation-hardened semiconductor integrated circuits technology for space and energy management applications.
The startup said today it has secured a $7.5 million Series A funding round, which brings its total raised to approximately $10 million, from investors, including Airbus Ventures and the Dart family office. The latest capital will support ZES’s research and development in Singapore and help increase global customers and grow its team, which has 10 people to date.
Three Japanese satellites and one European satellite operator use ZES’ technology, Khor said. Its target customers include satellite subsystems, rovers, space electronics manufacturers, and earth applications exposed to radiation, such as nuclear reactors, aviation, un-crewed drones and more. ZES’s power management solutions, initially designed for space applications for battery or solar power, could also be used for consumer electronics and industrial applications like smartphones, wearable devices and IoT companies.
In 2019, ZES was spun off from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, which has over 15 years of research on radiation-hardened integrated circuits and efficient power management designs.
“We [the founding team] observed growing demands for constellations and low earth orbit satellites to provide communication, data access, Earth observation, surveillance and reconnaissance,” Khor said. “Most of these satellites are using components that will not thrive in space; Hence, we saw the opportunity to launch the business.”
The radiation-hardened electronics market is estimated to reach approximately $4.5 billion by 2030, with a CAGR of more than 7.5% from 2021.
“Satellites, lunar landers and rovers increase demand for ICs and computing power such as artificial intelligence and power management,” Mat Costes, Partner of Airbus Ventures. “The space industry is growing and expanding beyond where we could imagine not that long ago. ZES could be [an] enabler for OEMs and new players to achieve their mission via cost and performance.”

"To boost greenhouse productivity, Skytree is using space station CO2 scrubbers",Tim De Chant,2023/06/13,"
Sucking carbon dioxide out of the air isn’t rocket science — the technology is decades old — but one startup thinks that maybe a little rocket science could help make direct air capture better.
Carbon dioxide scrubbers have been around since the 1800s, when commercial divers used them to extend their oxygen supply underwater. The technology got another boost when humans launched themselves into space. But it wasn’t until the specter of unchecked climate change that people began to consider its terrestrial applications.
A number of startups are racing to commercialize direct air capture of CO2, and most of them are chasing what you might call an open air market: drawing carbon straight from the atmosphere. Many use technology that draws on the same principles used in diving rebreathers and spacecraft life support, but Skytree is among the few that can claim a direct inheritance. The company was spun out of the European Space Agency in 2014 after its core technology saw service on the International Space Station.
On Tuesday, the company is announcing a $6 million seed round led by Horticoop and Yield Lab Europe, TechCrunch+ has exclusively learned.
Working in confined quarters seems to have shaped the company from its very founding. Its initial product was aimed at electric vehicles, of all things. Though the cars don’t produce any emissions, their occupants do, and carbon dioxide levels can build quickly in an unventilated cabin. But as anyone who has driven an EV can tell you, heating or cooling outside air can quickly sap battery’s range. Skytree figured that its scrubbers could remove carbon dioxide from the cabin, reducing the need to condition outside air.
Work on that product trundled along for a few years, but the automotive sector is a challenging market where volumes are high and margins are thin. Aware of this, the company began exploring other options. A new incoming CEO, Rob Van Straten, cemented the decision.
“Volkswagen will not sign with you with an eight-person or 20-person company — it will just not happen,” Van Straten told TechCrunch+. “And if that miracle does happen, they will squeeze you to the bone and you can’t build a profitable company. It’s a dead-end street.”
Van Straten instead directed the company to develop its other product, which was also tailored to confined spaces: greenhouses. "
Pollen’s approach to setting freelancers up for success is nothing to sneeze at,Christine Hall,2023/06/13,"
When Hillary Bush decided to leave the comforts of a full-time job at MasterClass to be self-employed, she said she “was met with scams, snake oil and SEO.” Not a pleasant thought given that 60 million Americans called themselves freelancers in 2022 and that two-thirds of Gen Z and Millennials want to work for themselves, Bush told TechCrunch.
That’s why she created Pollen, a new professional membership for those who have, or want, independent careers. Members get exclusive access to business advice and a network of peers and mentors to help grow their business.
“If you’re a freelancer and you’re leaving the safety and security of your full-time job, or school or whatever, you’re on your own,” Bush said. “People are leaving around 30% of potential income on the table because they don’t have business training. You don’t have a mentor, manager, blueprint and you don’t give yourself a promotion. You’re truly an entrepreneur.”
In putting together Pollen last year, Bush wanted to offer “the business coach that you wish you had” with a connection to peers, mentors and collaborators. Features include dozens of playbooks and templates and access to weekly drops of job opportunities.
Pollen’s private network has two membership types: annual and monthly, with the annual membership coming in at just over $1,000. Members also receive benefits, for example, over $100,000 worth of discounts on business and freelancer tools and coaching sessions. There are already over 15 active mentors.
Today, the company launches its platform with thousands of people on the waitlist and announces $4 million in funding from Animo VC, Founder Collective, XYZ, Precursor Ventures and a group of angel investors.
Bush intends to use the funding to power the next phase of Pollen, including growing the platform and its employee base. The company is hiring for its community and engineering team and for the content side of the business.
“Launching is a huge milestone for the business,” Bush said. “We really believe that anybody should have access to super-premium resources and to build their network. For anyone pursuing self employment, come to Pollen. There have been a lot of layoffs, and with that, massive reconsideration of the way work fits into people’s lives. People are really desperate for a support system whether they entered this lifestyle on their own accord or being laid off. We’re going to help you move your business forward throughout all phases — diversify your income streams, create new products and really power the future of work.”

How to pitch me: 10 investors discuss what they’re looking for in June 2023,Walter Thompson,2023/06/13,"
Let’s explode a few myths.
For starters: The tech industry is not a meritocracy. There’s a direct correlation between the size and strength of your network and your chances of success.
Second: It’s relatively easy to connect with reputable investors. Most firms’ websites have email addresses and contact forms.
There are many reasons why startups fail to get off the ground, but it generally boils down to three things:

You don’t have a billion-dollar idea.
You’re pitching the wrong investor.
They’re not sure if you can execute against the plan.

This month, all 10 “How to pitch me” participants shared their investment thesis, along with tactical advice for nontechnical founders and the questions they expect entrepreneurs to ask them during pitch meetings.
Consider yourself on notice: With deal flow down across the board, “applying fake time pressure to get a VC to make a quick decision” no longer works, said Blair Garrou of Mercury Fund.
“Artificially engineered FOMO is out,” said Monique Woodard, managing director of Cake Ventures. “Showing momentum is great, but I guard against being overly influenced by short timelines and the participation of other investors.”
Respondents also ballparked salaries for pre-revenue startups, discussed the pros and cons of using pitch memos vs. full decks, and all shared what they’re reading, watching and listening to. (This group loved “Succession” so much, they would probably take a pitch meeting with Kendall Roy.)

Vivek Ramaswami, partner, Madrona
What kinds of investment opportunities are you looking for in June 2023?
At Madrona, we invest from pre-seed to growth. Personally, I am excited about investing in Series A, B and C startups across B2B software, cloud infrastructure and AI/ML. Of course there is plenty of excitement in generative AI today, and we’ve made several investments in this space, but I believe there will continue to be great opportunities across the software stack that are either natively built on, or finding ways to leverage foundation models.
How do you prefer to be approached: a cold email, a warm intro or another method?
I’m always open to a cold email in the sector and geographic domains I focus in. A warm intro always helps, but I understand that not all founders will have an opportunity to get a warm intro. My email is vivek@madrona.com.
Many laid-off engineers are launching their own startups: What are some of the skills/experience you look for in nontechnical founders?
There is no reason why nontechnical founders can’t be successful in starting their own companies.
For nontechnical founders, I get excited about how they can lean into their strengths: (1) deep domain expertise in the sectors they are starting a company (something we often see in vertical SaaS companies where founders have “lived the problem; (2) an ability to recruit and hire amazing talent around them; and (3) a keen sense of customer focus, understanding of market dynamics and business model planning that is important and often the strength of nontechnical founders.
Generally speaking, how much salary should the founder of a pre-revenue startup pay themselves?
The range can be wide, as each case can be quite different (e.g., a second-time founder who raises again may be more comfortable with very little cash comp and more equity than a first-time founder, etc.). On average, when we look at the data we have, I would consider $130,000-$150,000 as a reasonable salary range for founders who have raised <$25 million and live in a “Tier 1” city.
In June 2023, what are some of the top questions founders should be asking investors?
Founders should be asking investors what specific sectors and stages they are investing in, because while funding was flowing freely in past years, it is less so today, and many investors are retrenching into the areas they know best. Additionally, founders should be looking at the track record of the firm, have they been able to successfully raise funds and do they reserve funds for follow-on rounds after the initial funding round.
This is very important in the current environment. And of course, take a look at the talent, marketing and biz dev help that an investor’s firm and personal network can bring to bear for your company.
Founders should also ask for references — what companies has that fund worked with, especially the partner leading the deal, so they can get a fuller sense of what the journey will be like with that fund and partner. This is a long-term relationship, so doing as much work upfront matters!
Are you open to reviewing pitch memos, or do you prefer a completed deck?
A pitch tactic I see that almost never works is having a banker cold email about a company that is completely irrelevant to the stage and sector that I look at. If anything, I would prefer the founder to reach out themselves and that way I can at least learn a bit more about the founder and it comes from a more authentic and genuine place.
It surprises me how many cold banker pitches me and my colleagues receive! A memo is fine as long as it is coherent, provides the necessary info and is concise.
Tell us about the best pitch you’ve received recently: At what point in their presentation did you realize you were going to invest?
I can’t name the company, but it was a growth-stage startup that started the presentation with the cold hard facts on the business: what scale they were at, how fast they were growing, their win rates against competitors and forward forecasts. They followed that up with what has both been going right and wrong in the business, but ultimately why they believe they are creating a generational business in a massive market, and why THEY were the right people to found the company.
Within the first 10 minutes they had laid out: (1) how well the company was doing; (2) how big the market opportunity was; and (3) why they had an unfair advantage as founders over everyone else. It was incredibly concise, straightforward and compelling to hear.
What are you reading/watching/listening to?
I’m currently reading “Chip War” by Chris Miller, a fantastic account of the development and subsequent battle over the most critical resource today — microchips. It’s an especially helpful lens to view the need for compute infrastructure in building AI companies today. I just finished watching “Succession,” so I need a new show!
Monique Woodard, managing director, Cake Ventures
What kinds of investment opportunities are you looking for in June 2023? 
We are aggressively investing out of Fund I and focus on U.S.-based pre-seed and seed stage companies that fit into one or more layers of the investment thesis at Cake. Cake Ventures has a clear investment thesis: invest in companies with global ambitions who are creating technology products that meet the needs of tomorrow’s internet users. We call this investing in demographic change.
The three key/markets we explore are:

The aging population whose size and spending power has created unique needs across categories like care and social isolation, preventative health, late-life financial services and longevity.
The increased spending power of women which are companies in technology categories like women’s health, commerce and the many ways women save, spend and invest money.
The shift to majority-minority and the changing technology consumption habits and needs that impact social, financial access, health equity and the future of work.

Right now, I’m very interested in companies that touch the future of non-white collar work. A lot of innovation has been focused on the office worker, but I want to see more innovation around healthcare jobs, service workers and other non-office careers.
How do you prefer to be approached: a cold email, a warm intro or another method
I want to hear from any founder building a company that will be accelerated by demographic change. How you reach me is up to you – just be prepared when you reach out to me to tell a concise, compelling story about the business you are building and why it matters. I can be reached on Twitter @moniquewoodard and you can can also reach out on our website.
Many laid-off engineers are launching their own startups: What are some of the skills/experience you look for in nontechnical founders?
I invest in the right person for the job and sometimes that is someone technical and sometimes it is not. The macroeconomic environment is leading many people to start companies who maybe would not have otherwise, and I think this is going to be a great thing. In lieu of technical skills, a great founder might have impressive sales skills — they will just have to know how to partner with a co-founder in order to get the product built.
The main thing I look for in founders is a big idea that can scale into a massive business, the ability to consistently execute and the resilience to get the business there.
In June 2023, what are some of the top questions founders should be asking investors?
I think asking questions around expectations on company growth trajectory, communication cadence and how the investor can best support the company as it scales are really important.
What’s a traditional pitch tactic that no longer works but is still a common practice? Are you open to reviewing pitch memos, or do you prefer a completed deck?
Artificially engineered FOMO is out. Founders who withhold information to be mysterious and put an aggressive time clock on investor decision-making (e.g., “we’re closing in three days”) are usually deals I’m going to pass on and I have never regretted that decision. Showing momentum is great, but I guard against being overly influenced by short timelines and the participation of other investors.
I will absolutely review a memo as long as it provides a full story and gives me an understanding of the business. Sometimes, memos do that better than decks.
Tell us about the best pitch you’ve received recently: At what point in their presentation did you realize you were going to invest?
The pitch I got from Jessica McGlory at Guaranteed was one of the most compelling conversations that I have had about the intersection of care and end of life. She was both mission-driven and dedicated to building a massive business in hospice care and the vision and thoughtfulness she showed in every conversation made me want to be on her team.
What are you reading/watching/listening to?
I’m reading “Palo Alto: A History of California, Capitalism and the World” by Malcom Harris and listening to the new Jelly Roll album, “Whitsitt Chapel.”
Adam Struck, founder and managing partner, Struck Capital
What kinds of investment opportunities are you looking for in June 2023?
We are especially excited about the technical innovation happening across fintech, e-commerce enablement, climate tech, and AI. Additionally, given the different macro environment than during the COVID boom, we have seen that more and more seed-stage companies are approaching funding in a more deliberate fashion.
To us, this means raising more appropriate rounds of funding that enable their companies to find robust product-market fit without exorbitant cash burn. I think this environment is more healthy and ultimately fosters more disciplined and efficient startups.
How do you prefer to be approached: a cold email, a warm intro or another method?
We want to speak to the best and brightest founders, regardless of if the introduction came from someone within our network or from cold outreach. With that being said, a warm introduction can help us cut through some of the noise, as we receive dozens of pitches each day.
If you’re comfortable doing so, please share your contact info. 
info@struckcapital.com.
Many laid-off engineers are launching their own startups: What are some of the skills/experience you look for in nontechnical founders?
We are excited about investing in nontechnical founders with robust information asymmetries that give their business an unfair advantage over the competition. For example, we get excited about a nontechnical founder that might have experienced this pain point in their previous role or sold into a similar buyer persona within their ideal customer profile.
Generally speaking, how much salary should the founder of a pre-revenue startup pay themselves?
Companies like Pave have become a great resource for founders and investors to benchmark salaries based on their role, location and amount of funding raised. It’s difficult to pinpoint an exact salary, as each individual’s financial situation is unique based on the stage of their career they are in, money saved and personal situation. We are in favor of more people pursuing entrepreneurship and becoming founders, so as long as a founder is most concerned with growing their equity value and not their cash composition, generally they can align with their early investors on a reasonable salary.
In June 2023, what are some of the top questions founders should be asking investors?
Founders should definitely look to speak with [other] founders within that VC’s portfolio and ask how the fund supported [them] during times of difficulty and uncertainty for their startup.
What’s a traditional pitch tactic that no longer works but is still a common practice?
We still encounter pitches that revolve around founders preferring to present their entire pitch deck and take questions at the end. We much prefer an engaging back-and-forth discussion around specific questions we are interested in learning more about. A discussion results in much deeper insights from a founder, which can be extremely helpful in deciding if we want to dig into further diligence.
Are you open to reviewing pitch memos, or do you prefer a completed deck? "
Nordic VC Voima Ventures launches €90M fund for deep tech startups,Paul Sawers,2023/06/13,"
Nordic VC firm Voima Ventures today announced its third fund with an initial closing of €90 million and a final target of €120 million, focusing on early-stage “deep tech” startups from across the science sphere.
Founded out of Helsinki, Finland, in 2019, Voima Ventures targets companies at the pre- and seed-stage, mostly involving startups emerging from university labs and related research institutions. Voima also occasionally delves into later stage investments where it involves existing portfolio companies, and its typical areas include companies working on sustainability, life science and health, and other “groundbreaking” technologies such as quantum computing.
Voima’s first two funds were launched back in 2019. Its €20 million Fund I was essentially the spin-off portfolio of state-owned technical research center VTT which remains one of the fund’s limited partners (LPs) today, while the second €60 million fund was announced simultaneously alongside the new Voima Ventures brand and a swathe of additional LPs. The first two funds have backed some 30 companies, including the likes of Solar Foods, Dispelix, Betolar and MVision, and it has a handful of exits to its name including Minima, which was snapped up by Bosch last year.
Voima’s latest fund includes capital from the European Investment Fund (EIF), Finland’s Tesi, VTT, Sweden’s Saminvest, and a handful of pension funds, foundations and family offices.
Bright and early
Europe has been ripe for fresh early-stage VC funds lately. In the past few months alone, we’ve seen the U.K.’s Amadeus Capital partner with Austria’s Apex Ventures for a €80 million ($86 million) deep tech fund, similar to IQ Capital which launched a new $200 million fund for early-stage deep tech startups. Moonfire VC, meanwhile, closed its second fund at $115 million; Playfair Capital closed a $70 million pre-seed fund; Ireland’s Elkstone closed its first formal VC fund at $108 million; Finland’s Lifeline Ventures closed a $163 million fund; and in France Emblem and Ovni Capital both announced new €50 million ($54 million) funds.
As with its previous funds, Voima’s third pot is focused firmly on Nordic and Baltic countries, though it occasionally dips into other countries across Northern Europe, and it’s aiming for ticket sizes ranging from €200,000 to €3 million spread across roughly 25 companies.
A core defining characteristic of Voima’s fund is that in addition to its collaboration with VTT, which is among Europe’s largest research institutes, it actively collaborates with universities from across Northern Europe. Voima founding partner Inka Mero says that nearly three-quarters of its portfolio hail from the academic world, including quantum chip startup Semiqon, which VTT recently spun out as an independent entity, and Cellfion, a clean energy materials company that emerged from the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) and Linköping University (LIU) in Sweden.
“We actively collaborate with all the Nordic and Baltic universities — we do this by visiting science teams and teams in incubation on a regular basis, hosting workshops, and coaching the most potential teams on a regular basis,” Mero told TechCrunch.
And while much has changed in the world since Voima first arrived on the scene some four years ago, from the global pandemic to major economic headwinds among other macroeconomic factors, Mero says it’s mostly business as usual in terms of what they’re looking for in startups and they’re approach to investing.
“Our investment strategy has remained the same — we continue investing in science-based and deep tech in the Nordics and Baltics,” Mero said. “With Fund III we are even more thesis-driven, and invest in companies tackling pressing global challenges.”

Indifi raises $35M to expand digital lending to more small businesses,Jagmeet Singh,2023/06/12,"
Indifi Technologies, an Indian startup offering digital lending to small and medium businesses, has raised $35 million in a new funding round led by ICICI Venture, the investment arm of ICICI Bank.
Existing investors, including British International Investment, OP Finnfund Global Impact Fund I, Omidyar Network India, Flourish Ventures and CX Partners also participated in the all-equity Series E round for the eight-year-old startup.
India is home to 63 million micro, small and medium-sized businesses. These enterprises form the economic backbone of the nation, contributing over 30% to the country’s gross domestic product and providing employment to over 113 million individuals. Despite their crucial role in the economy, these businesses continue to grapple with a significant obstacle — access to credit. The Reserve Bank of India’s Expert Committee shed light on this issue in its December 2018 report, estimating an alarming credit gap ranging from $243 billion to $303 billion (20–25 lakh crore Indian rupees) for the MSME sector.
Founded by Alok Mittal and Siddharth Mahanot in 2015, Indifi is attempting to plug this gap through different types of loans to businesses with turnaround of between $36,400–$1.21 million a year. The startup’s online marketplace enables businesses in various sectors – from travel to e-commerce, hotels, and retail – to conveniently secure unsecured loans tailored to their unique needs.
“That is a demonstration of the fact that other banks and NBFCs trust us to be able to run a tight lending ship not just from a technology and analytics standpoint, but from a core operations standpoint,” Mittal, Indifi’s managing director and CEO, told TechCrunch in an interview.
The Gurugram-based startup has disbursed over 73,000 loans across 400 cities, with a total disbursement value of over $497 million. In March, its assets under management reached $182 million, marking a growth of over 100% from the previous year.
Indifi’s client base includes about 30% of customers who have been in business for less than two years, typically below the cutoff for banks to provide loans. Additionally, more than 20% of Indifi’s customers are women entrepreneurs who often experience challenges obtaining credit from traditional channels.
“The idea is really to go to segments of the market that are not served well,” said Mittal.
In the last 12 months, Indifi grew 100% in value and 150% in volumes of loans disbursed, Mittal said, without disclosing specific figures. The startup had been profitable for six quarters in a row since February 2022, and its profitability numbers are improving, he said.
Over the last six months, Indifi has started making inroads in offering instant loans and enabling working capital finance for direct-to-consumer brands and software businesses. Mittal said the startup plans to utilize the fresh funds to continue to look for new segments in the markets it exists.
The startup also looks to improve its technology infrastructure and introduce new products to help more businesses get credit, the co-founder said.
In 2019, Indifi was processing a typical loan of $7,000 size. However, it has made technology investments to lower its average loan amount by 30% over a period of 18 months, bringing it down to about $6,000. It even processes loans of $600–1,200 to cater to the needs of micro and small entrepreneurs — alongside offering credit to medium-sized businesses.
“What we have been able to do in the last 18 months is to devise operating cost stacks that can serve a one-lakh rupee customer,” Mittal said.
Indifi has developed segment-specific models to accurately assess the risk of any particular model instead of relying on broad criteria, such as three years of vintage. It also incorporates a fully automated loan generation process, eliminating the need for manual data collection or underwriter oversight.
“Indifi has created a best-in-class digital technology platform for lending to the large MSME sector, enabling access to credit for this highly underserved segment of the Indian economy,” said Nikhil Mohta, senior director for private equity at ICICI Venture. “Indifi’s strong relationships with ecosystem partners and liability partners stand in good stead as it targets a rapid scale up. The robust governance and risk frameworks of the company inspire confidence, and we are excited to partner with Indifi in its onward journey.”
Although ICICI Venture’s investment comes as a financial one, ICICI Bank is already an Indifi partner. Mittal believes the funding from the bank’s VC arm would open up business conversations with the bank over time.
Indifi has raised over $81 million to date, including the latest funding and the Series D round of $45 million announced in November 2021. The startup has a headcount of about 700 people across product analytics, technology and business development as well as operational roles such as customer assistance and customer service.
When asked about plans to go public, Mittal said it would become a viable and attractive option at some point to raise further capital growth. Nonetheless, he emphasized that their current priority is to remain valuable to their customers by providing a diverse range of products and expanding their customer base. The startup also aims to increase the number of loans disbursed by up to three times “over the next couple of years.”
Indifi competes against the likes of Mayfield-backed LendingKart, Inclusive Fintech 50-invested FlexiLoans and Progcap, which counts Google and Tiger Global among its key investors.

Venture firm Black Seed raises £5M inaugural fund to invest in Black founders,Dominic-Madori Davis,2023/06/12,"
British early-stage venture firm Black Seed has raised £5 million ($6.2 million) as part of its inaugural fund to solely support Black founders in the country. The round was led by asset manager M&G Investments, with additional support from Atomico and Molten Ventures. The firm is hoping to raise an additional £5 million to close the round.
Black Seed was launched to address the lack of funding Black founders receive in the U.K., according to its founders: Karl Lokko, Cyril Lutterodt and founding member Yvonne Nagawa. Black founders in the country received only 0.24% of all VC funds between 2009 and 2019, and only 10 Black British women were able even to raise at all, according to a report by Extend Ventures. That’s worse in some ways than in the United States.
The dismal lack of funding has historically led to Black British talent leaving the country for the U.S. seeking funding opportunities. Lokko and Lutterodt said the firm also wants to address the fact that 88% of Black businesses in the U.K. are self-funded, and they want to decrease that number to at least 50%.
“We exist as a tech fund and a community,” Lokko said. “We exist to bridge that gap and give Black founders inclusion.”
Lutterodt said that the firm wants to cut to the chase by writing checks to help bring about change, as many Black founders in the U.K. are overmentored yet underfunded. “We have built a pipeline of Black entrepreneurs, primed and ready,” he said, adding that the firm expects to make at least 10 investments over the next three years and has a reserve fund for follow-on investments.
The firm will focus on early-stage investing, serving as a kind of “family and friends” round for those who lack access to angel investors — or, as they say in the U.K., the “Bank of Mum and Dad.” It is one of a handful of funds that exist in the U.K. that focus solely on Black founders. Black Seed is industry agnostic, though Lutterodt says it’s particularly interested in deep tech, health care and AI.
Black Seed also hosts events at its office in Brixton, the south London neighborhood known for its Afro-Caribbean population. The firm organizes the Brixton Startup Weekend as well as the pitch competition Lyan’s Den.
Humble origins
Launched in 2021, the firm was initially supposed to announce the £5 million raise late last year, but it ran into delays concerning regulatory compliance.
“We actually overestimated how long it would take to get £5 million worth of commitments,” Nagawa, who also serves as Black Seed’s chief of staff, told TechCrunch+. “It only took us six months to hit that figure. What we underestimated was the length of time it would then take to complete the legal side of things and the paperwork. It was a reminder of the complicated factors you face when raising a fund.” "

How to identify, interview and hire a head of growth for an early-stage startup
Don’t wait to identify your startup’s ideal customer personas



Launching a startup usually means obsessing about whether product-market fit (PMF) has been achieved in its early days. More broadly, PMF is a term we use to describe a product or service that has generated enough organic demand from consumers. This demand is both sustainable and economically worthwhile for a startup to continue offering said product.
How can you find PMF in the most efficient and frictionless way possible? I argue that the answer to this question is paid acquisition. This article will help you select the best paid channel depending on your startup idea, deploy a battle-tested waitlist strategy, optimize messaging tests and more.
Which paid channel to select?
Typically, I recommend Meta as the first paid channel to explore for a multitude of reasons: targeting capability, relatively cheap traffic and a visual format for testing both graphics and copy.


			How can you find PMF in the most efficient and frictionless way possible? I argue that the answer is paid acquisition.					


By contrast, Google and paid search traffic is preferable if your offering is of high search-intent volume or in a complex B2B segment. For example, advertising a supply-chain AI startup targeting freight companies on Meta would be too complex and unlikely to find the right audience.
The easiest method for determining which paid acquisition channel is right for your startup is with the following three questions:

Is my offering highly visual (clothing, product-based, etc.)?
Does my product/service require an immediate solution to an event (moving homes, doctor’s visit for cold, etc.)?
How complex is my offering?

If you answered that your product/service is highly visual, you’d be leaning toward a paid social channel such as Facebook or TikTok. However, if you answered that your offering is either immediate-solution oriented, location-based or complex, you should pivot toward a paid search channel, effectively Google.

The Venn diagram above illustrates which channels these established startups should have tested if they were looking to validate PMF. Certain startups, such as Forward Health or Canva, can get away with advertising on both channels because they’re visual, not complex, and have a large target market.
Most consumers can leverage a new healthcare plan or graphic creation, which is inherently very visual. Conversely, a startup such as Lugg, which helps people move homes, should leverage Google as their company offers a solution that consumers often need immediately and at very specific times.
As an additional note, if you’re looking to advertise on Meta, BusinessofApps is reporting that the latest cost per thousand impressions (CPMs) is hovering around $15 in 2023. This means that to have an estimated 1,000 people view your offering, you’ll be paying around $15. Not bad at all!
Battle-tested waitlist method
In college, I tested countless startup ideas with friends who were as excited about starting a business as I was. Unfortunately, none of them ultimately succeeded. However, an important, long-term success came from developing a strategy that I then employed many times to assess PMF. I’ve broken it down into five easy steps:

Identify paid channel.
Create a landing page.

"Cava boosts its IPO price range, highlighting appetite for growth stories",Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/12,"
How about we kick off the week with some good news?
This morning, American fast-casual restaurant chain Cava raised its IPO price range from $17-$19 per share to $19-$20 per share.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

As we reported during Cava’s IPO run, the company shares a number of similarities with other venture-backed, tech-enabled businesses that went public in and around 2021. That means this IPO is not a precise comparable for many startups that are waiting for the IPO market to return. Instead, it will serve to help us track a bit of private capital through its recycling period and catch the current vibe for growth-y companies.
This morning, we’re asking: What is Cava’s new midpoint and maximum valuation given the new price range? When we compare those figures to its recent revenue growth and profit metrics, can we spy any good news for unicorns looking to go public as soon as they can gin up the courage?
So what’s Cava worth at its new IPO price range?
Increasing your IPO pricing range from $17-$19 per share to $19-$20 per share is not that big of a shift. We’ve seen larger changes in the past, especially when the IPO market has been hot. Still, Cava has brought up the floor price for its IPO to its previous ceiling.
That’s great for the company, as it will be able to raise more capital without diluting its shareholders any more than planned.

At $19 per share, Cava is worth $2.12 billion ($2.16 billion if underwriters purchase their full option).
At the midpoint of its new range, Cava is worth $2.17 billion ($2.21 billion if underwriters purchase their full option).
At $20 per share, Cava is worth $2.23 billion ($2.27 billion if underwriters purchase their full option). "
VCs remain confident alternative protein has a real future despite public-market woes,Christine Hall,2023/06/12,"
How well have alternative-protein companies done in the past year? It depends on who you ask.
The industry has had an interesting go of it between the U.S. getting comfortable with cultivated meat production, layoffs and countries banning production. Yet, startups and investors are hanging in there.
To get the pulse of what’s germinating in this fast-rising industry, TechCrunch+ surveyed five investors, all active in various areas of investment in alternative protein, and they had a lot to say on the subject.
Nate Cooper, managing partner at Barrel Ventures, bluntly pointed out the valuation mismatch that startups in the sector enjoy, saying too many “food tech” companies are today valued as if they were pure technology plays. “At the end of the day, they are selling a CPG product and should be valued as such,” he said. “Until this stops, there are unfortunately going to be a lot of investors and companies left holding the bag, and a lot of companies that, realistically, will never grow into the private valuations they were given.”
Many of the startups tackling food are doing so to help improve the Earth’s climate and change the dependency on animal-based foods. Rosie Wardle, co-founder and partner at Synthesis Capital, said it is also driven by consumer demand for the same.

4 investors discuss the next big wave for alternative seafood startups

“Shifting away from animal proteins and toward alternative proteins will be necessary for governments to address climate impacts and to reach their net-zero targets,” Wardle said. “To this end, we are already seeing alternative proteins highlighted by governments across the world as a key solution to the climate crisis, and we expect this focus to grow in the coming years.”
However, more infrastructure is needed to ensure alternative proteins can be produced at levels that will make an impact. While venture capital is helping here, companies are getting creative when it comes to additional funding sources to build manufacturing plants, said Alice Brooks, principal at Khosla Ventures.
“It’s likely that startups will need to fund their first plants largely with venture capital,” Brooks said. “However, we are seeing companies using creative ways to fund their buildouts with partnerships. We encourage startups to prove their unit economics and scalability with the minimum size plant possible so they can get out there and test with customers.”
Read on to learn how companies can get more consumers on board with eating plant-based alternatives, where the gaps are in the mainstream manufacturing of alternative proteins, and who they think are some of the “bright spots” in the industry so far.
We spoke with:

Alice Brooks, principal, Khosla Ventures
Nate Cooper, managing partner, Barrel Ventures
Peter Herz, general partner, 1cc VC
Johnny Ream, partner, Stray Dog Capital
Rosie Wardle, co-founder and partner, Synthesis Capital

(Editor’s note: The following responses have been edited for length and clarity.)

Alice Brooks, principal, Khosla Ventures
Beyond Foods and Impossible are clear incumbents, but both cited declining sales last year as the reason for their layoffs. How can alt-protein companies reach more people and earn greater customer acceptance?
The market is still early for plant proteins and we are seeing them being adopted across a range of products. Any big change, like this one, takes years for customers to adopt. For new entrants, the key to a good product is taste and cost. Can it be as tasty as the conventional option? Can it be comparable in cost?
Have valuations in the alternative-protein space compressed in line with what we’ve seen with Beyond on the public markets? How has the changed investing landscape impacted your strategy in the sector?
In the past year, given recent economic conditions, the bar is higher for fundraising. In the food tech space, we have not seen valuations soar as much as they did in other areas, but we’re still advising our companies to focus on de-risking the most critical technical and commercial milestones with each financing.
The days of growth at all costs are abating, and there is now a greater focus on demonstrating valuable commercial proof points earlier in a company’s life.

"Oova grabs another $10.3M, unveils membership model for at-home fertility testing",Christine Hall,2023/06/12,"
One in six people are expected to be affected by infertility at some point in their lives, and with the cost of procedures, like in vitro fertilization, costing tens of thousands of dollars for each procedure, more people seek better ways to understand their reproductive health.
There are a number of startups tackling this issue, for example, Generation Prime, Flo, Future Family, Maven and Mate Fertility, which all received funding within the past few years.
Oova, a women’s health and fertility startup working in the fertility-tracking segment of the market, is the latest to get additional venture-backed funding, raising $10.3 million in Series A funding for its at-home approach to translating a woman’s fertility.
It is also launching the Oova Membership. Priced at $99 per month, the membership includes The Oova Kit and offers features, such as personalized support via the Oova Provider network of healthcare professionals and hormone experts and access to a community of people going through similar fertility journeys.

Oova raises $1.2M to develop a better at-home kit for detecting a woman’s best time to conceive

Oova was previously profiled in 2021 when founder and CEO Amy Divaraniya, Ph.D. officially launched its at-home urine test, called Oova Kit, with $1.2 million in seed funding. The test comes with 15 days of testing strips and measures the luteinizing hormone and progesterone to provide advanced personalized analytics and real-time action plans so a woman can know her most fertile days and confirm ovulation.

It is FDA registered, and the company touts it is the “only product that allows its users to sync and share results with their doctor in real time.” Divaraniya told TechCrunch that talk within the fertility industry, especially following the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, shifted to data security, and unlike other period and fertility tracking companies, Oova was always HIPAA compliant and invested in secure connections with its clinic partners.
Divaraniya was mum about the company’s growth over the past year, but did say Oova is now working with over 100 clinics, up from 75 at the launch in 2021. In addition, the company has trained its model on over 10,000 cycles monitored through the platform.
“We’ve also seen a massive increase in the adoption across both consumer and clinical channels,” Divaraniya said. “Because of the adoption, it led to one of the most powerful datasets in the industry. This is a dream of information to work with. Not only do we have daily hormone measurements across tens of thousands of cycles, but we also have treatment data. We’ve been able to train our algorithms on actual hormone information across thousands of women, and then even look at intrapersonal data to understand the nuances between cycles for a single woman, leading to a very personalized experience for our users.”
Meanwhile, Spero Ventures led the new round and was joined by US Fertility, Virgin Group, Jefferson Health, Connecticut Innovations, Hannah Bronfman and Spanx founder Sara Blakely. In total, the company raised $11.5 million.
“Oova has revolutionized the way we understand our hormonal health,” said Sara Eshelman, partner at Spero Ventures, in a written statement. “By making clinical-grade hormone monitoring convenient and cost-effective for daily use, Oova is empowering its users to understand their cycles, improve fertility outcomes and manage their symptoms.”
Divaraniya said Oova went after a new funding round when its technology reached some heavy adoption and the company received feedback from physicians asking for Oova to test additional hormones.
Patients are also using Oova’s technology for use cases that it wasn’t initially designed for, like the early part of pregnancy and postpartum, but are finding value in the data. In addition, the company is eyeing all other phases of a women’s health.
“We started off with fertility because it’s a place that I’m very passionate about, but what is also very clear is that all the different phases of a woman’s life are dictated by hormones,” she said. “If you can understand the different patterns that happen in classic urban spaces, you can actually start adjusting those.”

Salesforce pledges to invest $500M in generative AI startups,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/12,"
Showing it’s playing for keeps in the generative AI race, Salesforce today announced that it’s growing its Generative AI Fund, the part of the company’s Salesforce Ventures VC off-shoot backing startups developing “responsible generative AI,” from $250 million in size to $500 million.
In a canned statement, Salesforce Ventures managing partner Paul Drews said that the expansion would enable Salesforce to “work with even more entrepreneurs … accelerating the development of transformative AI solutions for the enterprise.
“We’re already seeing AI change the way the world works, and we’re excited to build on the momentum of our Generative AI fund,” Drews continued. “We’re excited to support the next generation of innovative founders.”
Launched in March, the Generative AI Fund has already invested in several firms on the frontier of generative AI tech, including Cohere, Anthropic, You.com, Hearth.AI and newer additions Humane and Tribble. While far from the only fund investing primarily in generative AI, Salesforce aims to differentiate its tranche by prioritizing what it describes as “ethical” AI technologies.
For example, go-to-market function automation platform Tribble recently partnered with Private AI, a privacy-focused AI company, to use Private GPT, a product that redacts personally identifiable information before sending it through OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot.
The Generative AI Fund is also distinguished by the diverse range of technologies it’s financing. Humane, for instance, is creating a wearable, screen-less AI assistant, while You.com hosts an AI-powered search engine with generative art and text tools.
Salesforce Ventures has a number of vertical-specific investment funds, including funds aimed at particular geographies such as Japan or Canada and a dedicated AI fund. But the Generative AI Fund is among the VC arm’s largest tranches to date; previous funds ranged from $50 million to $125 million.
The expansion of the Generative AI Fund coincides with the debut of Salesforce’s AI for Impact Accelerator, the company’s second-ever accelerator program. AI for Impact will grant $2 million to a cohort of education, workforce and climate organizations to “advance the equitable and ethical use of trusted AI.”
“AI for Impact aims to close the AI access gap by providing flexible funding, pro-bono expertise and technology to purpose-driven organizations, empowering them to accelerate generative AI-based solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges,” Salesforce said in a press release. “AI for Impact [is a] philanthropic initiative to help purpose-driven organizations gain equitable access to trusted generative AI technologies.”
Bloomberg notes that investments from Salesforce’s accelerators and funds may become more important to the company’s bottom line as activist investors, like Elliott Management, discourage large acquisitions. To date, Salesforce Ventures, one of the most active corporate VCs in recent years, has participated in over 140 deals for AI and machine learning startups, particularly in the areas of AI insights for sales, natural language chatbots for service requests, targeted marketing content and personalized e-commerce experiences.
Generative AI — assuming it lives up to the hype — could be a massive market opportunity. Grand View Research predicts that the sector could be worth roughly $109 billion by 2030.
The C-suite in particular expects generative AI to have an enormous impact on business. According to a recent KPMG survey, almost two-thirds (65%) of execs believe that generative AI will have a “high” or “extremely high”” impact on their organization in the next three to five years — far above every other emerging technology.
Beyond the Generative AI Fund and AI for Impact, Salesforce is investing in generative AI technologies internally, piloting tools like EinsteinGPT (which lets Salesforce customers ask questions about Salesforce’s content and services) and SlackGPT (which answers natural language questions about Slack content).
In addition, Salesforce has previewed the ability to create landing pages on the fly, compose sales emails and write code in Apex, Salesforce’s programming language, to programmatically trigger certain actions in a workflow, among other tasks.

Navan takes a swipe at expense management startups with new Mastercard and Visa partnerships,Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/06/12,"
Want more fintech news in your inbox? Sign up here.
In recent years, a number of startups have made a business out of providing corporate credit cards to companies. These players compete not only with each other but with legacy providers such as Concur and Expensify by offering automated expense management.
Many of these startups generate revenue from interchange fees, meaning that they receive a certain percentage of each transaction made on the corporate card they have provided. Ramp, for example, is one such company. Some of those startups also make money by charging subscriptions for their expense management software. Brex, which started out as primarily a corporate card provider, made a big push last year into software. 
Navan (formerly known as TripActions) offers both a corporate card as well as a subscription to its software. In a twist, the company today is announcing the launch of a new product called Navan Connect, which it describes as a patented card-link technology that gives businesses a way to offer automated expense management and reconciliation without having to change their corporate card provider. For the initial launch, Navan has partnered with Mastercard and Visa, with plans to announce additional network tie-ups in the near future.
The move is significant in that Navan is essentially addressing a presumably large market of companies that would prefer to continue working with an existing bank partner for a variety of reasons but want the option to offer more modern ways to manage expenses. Filing expense reports is by far one of employees’ least favorite tasks, but the rationale behind automating the process goes beyond simply eliminating expense reports – it also is aimed at giving companies more insight into how and where employees are spending so that it can identify ways to trim costs in the future and ensure company policy is applied onto the card.
Now, by integrating Navan’s technology, any corporate Visa or Mastercard user would have the option to do things like set policies and budgets they’re trying to administer and then have all expenses automatically reconciled and filed, according to Michael Sindicich, executive vice president and general manager of Navan Expense.
“When we talk with customers, some of them want our cards and they want our credit, but we also see – especially larger companies – some who have existing banking relationships and corporate cards who want better tools to manage their employees,” Sindicich told TechCrunch. “In the past when you are going with one of the new players, including Navan, you are beholden to taking the cards they issue. But what we’ve done allows us to connect with the Visas and Mastercards of the world and still get that real-time reconciliation.”
Image Credits: Navan
Navan appears to not be concerned about its new Connect product competing with its own corporate card offering.
Historically, Sindicich said, Navan has charged licensing fees and software fees for its expense and travel products. It charges trip fees, and sometimes implementation fees. And it makes “some commissions” from suppliers and some interchange commissions from card swipes. 
“But for us, it was never about being a bank,” he told TechCrunch. “So, Connect would cannibalize the money we can make from our Navan cards on the interchange. but we were giving that interchange most of it back as rebates to the customers anyway. And I don’t think that we or Silicon Valley has any right to say we are going to innovate by building a better bank against some of these larger banks that are out there. They’re better at underwriting. They’re better at managing capital and raising capital. What Navan can provide is this technology and partner with banks in order to offer this holistic solution. And so that’s where that’s where we’re focusing.”

"HSBC rebrands, expands its SVB UK buy as HSBC Innovation Banking",Ingrid Lunden,2023/06/11,"
Acquired by HSBC in an emergency sale for just £1 in March as SVB was melting down, SVB UK is now getting a rebrand and expansion under its new owner. Today the banking giant launched HSBC Innovation Banking, a new unit focusing on banking services to the startup, investor and wider tech community.
Rumored for weeks leading up to today, and now officially announced at the kick-off to London Tech Week, the new division — technically a subsidiary of HSBC UK — will be bigger than just the SVB UK assets: HSBC has added teams in the U.S., Israel and Hong Kong to the operation, with more than 700 people employed in the operation. For now, it sounds like the clientele is mostly U.K. — some 3,000 customers in all out of its home country, HSBC said.
The firm sets up arch competition between former bedfellows: First Citizens acquired the majority of SVB’s banking operations, which were in the U.S. and included some $72 billion in deposits and loans and had been operating under the name SVB Bridge Bank after holding company SVB Financial collapsed.
The two are going out of the gate in true competitive style: First Citizens is currently suing HSBC for poaching SVB staff — specifically people like David Sabow. who had been the head of SVB in the U.S. Sabow will now lead HSBC Innovation Banking out of the U.S. It also recruited what appears to have been the whole team of SVB Israel: Led by David Cohen, it also includes his whole team of Gadi Moshe, Alon Oz, Tamir Efrati, and Meir Slobodov, plus some 20 others. Indeed, that lawsuit was likely filed in anticipation of the announcement and push made official today.
Erin Platts, who had been the head of SVB UK, appears to be leading the new Innovation Banking business with the title “CEO of HSBC Innovation Banking UK”.
The large incumbent bank’s effort to tap into the fast-growing technology sector strategy is coming at an inflection point — or at least HSBC hopes that to be the case. Funding for technology companies had been gushing like a geyser for years leading up to and through the Covid-19 pandemic — one reason why SVB, originally a community bank for the nascent startup industry, had scaled into an outsized operation that regulators were struggling to keep up with. But in the last 18 months, all that has been reduced to a trickle — one big contributor to SVB’s failure.
Now, HSBC is making a bet that launching this new and redoubled effort, when the market is more quiet and at a low point, will set it up for big gains as it returns, with the added buffer that it will have a massive behemoth behind it to handle knocks more gracefully than SVB did.
It’s not clear what size the business is out of the gate with assets under management. When HSBC acquired SVB UK, the deal included assuming loans of around £5.5 billion and deposits of around £6.7 billion. In its last reported figures, covering the financial year ending 31 December 2022, SVB UK had recorded a profit before tax of £88 million, and HSBC said at the time of the acquisition that SVB UK’s tangible equity was expected to be around £1.4 billion.
“The UK’s world-leading technology and life sciences sectors are central to growing the UK economy and boosting global exports,” said Noel Quinn, Group Chief Executive of HSBC, in a statement. “HSBC now has a world-class team focused on innovation companies, their founders and their investors. We will protect this specialism and take it to the next level by combining these capabilities with our financial strength and global reach. Our new innovation teams will be there to support our clients’ international growth at every step.”
The operation will cover technology as well as adjacent areas, such as startup businesses and financiers in areas like life sciences.
“The UK is home to world-leading tech and life sciences sectors, and I am proud of the role the British government has played in securing their future and enabling them to thrive,” said UK Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, in a statement. ““HSBC Innovation Banking will help innovative businesses to unlock their potential, create more jobs and access new global opportunities – supporting my priority to grow the UK economy and cement our position as a science and tech superpower.”

Djust is a new commerce platform focused exclusively on B2B transactions,Romain Dillet,2023/06/11,"
Meet Djust, a French startup that essentially wants to build an e-commerce platform like Mirakl, but focused exclusively on business-to-business (B2B) activities. The company recently raised a $13 million funding round (€12 million).
NEA is leading the most recent funding round, with Elaia Partners also investing in the company. Elaia previously led Djust’s $4 million seed round in 2020.
The reason why I’m comparing Djust with Mirakl is that Djust’s co-founder and CEO Arnaud Rihiant was part of Mirakl’s founding team, working for the company for more than a decade. Mirakl is now one the highest valued French startup and competes with Adobe Commerce, Salesforce Commerce and Shopify.
Mirakl first started as a way to launch a marketplace of third-party sellers on an e-commerce website — a B2C strategy. Over time, Mirakl realized that marketplaces could also work well for B2B clients.
“Every time we would do a B2B project with Mirakl, I was shocked by the complexity of the project,” Rihiant told me. “When I looked into the matter, I realized that it’s not [Mirakl’s] fault. But the marketplace industry was designed for B2C.”
And yet, Rihiant believes that B2B commerce platforms represent an interesting opportunity as it has been an underserved market for too long. Many companies already have an ERP system, but they still deal with orders over the phone, via email and using Excel spreadsheets. In other words, it doesn’t scale well.
When it comes to the basics, Djust bridges the gap between legacy systems and its modern platform. It can connect with ERP systems and make data actionable.
From Djust, you can manage your catalog, your clients and your orders. And the startup offers advanced features in all those categories.
For instance, when it comes to catalog management, Djust lets you segment the catalog so that each client sees relevant products. Sometimes, clients also get different prices depending on what they agreed on when they signed the original contract.
When it’s time to order, Djust offers several options depending on the industry. For instance, you can enable a bidding process or facilitate re-orders for clients that mostly want to resupply their stores. You can also configure different payment options.
Djust is already working with clients in the construction industry, such as Bouygues and Eiffage, and with retailers looking for a platform to handle orders with their franchise stores, such as Monoprix, Franprix and Naturalia.
The startup is building a generic B2B commerce platform so it would work for different industries. For instance, restaurant chains could benefit from a product like Djust as their procurement system. Fashion brands that mostly sell their items in partner stores could connect with their retail partners on a Djust-powered platform.
The product can be used as a headless platform with your own frontend framework, or it can be used with Djust’s frontend customized to your needs. It works with different sales channels — clients can still offer phone or email orders without asking all their existing clients to go through a new website.
There are currently 45 people working for the startup. With today’s funding round, Djust plans to grow its team, iterate on its product and find new clients all across Europe.

Here are the most richly valued startup types in today’s early-stage venture market,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/11,"
If you want to score the largest possible early-stage valuation, what should your startup focus on? New data makes it clear that the seed and Series A markets are hardly equal when it comes to what venture capitalists are willing to pay for one category of startup over another.
Don’t worry, the answer here is not just “build an AI startup,” even if that does appear to be pretty solid advice for avoiding a down round.
Data shared by Carta when we interviewed the company’s CEO on the Equity podcast earlier this week provides a simple and clear stratification of early-stage valuations and fundraising sizing. Let’s start with seed data:

Consolidation continues in the world of fintech
Last week ended with a couple of significant news events in the fintech world. First up, Ingrid and I wrote about FIS acquiring banking-as-a-service startup Bond for an undisclosed amount. (Fintech Business Weekly’s Jason Mikula initially broke the news). The deal is both an example of the resilience of infrastructure in the fintech space and a year that is proving to be filled with consolidation – as expected in a no-IPO, less capital rich environment. 
Earlier this year, Marqeta acquired financial infrastructure startup Power Finance in a $275 million deal. JPMorgan closed its acquisition of Aumni. And Brazilian fintech infra company Pismo is said to be in the midst of being courted by the likes of Visa and Mastercard in a reported $1 billion transaction.
As Ingrid pointed out, not every M&A deal works out well, of course, with the biggest often being the hardest to digest. FIS made one of the largest-ever acquisitions in the world of payments when it acquired WorldPay for about $43 billion in 2019. That deal never really came up trumps, though. In February of this year, FIS confirmed that it would be spinning WorldPay off.
I also wrote about Better.com’s laying off its real estate team and the related shedding of its real estate business unit – a move that we knew was coming, but just didn’t know when. The company reportedly bet big on real estate in 2022, presumably before the housing market turned and mortgage interest rates soared. But as the refinancing market dried up and fewer people wanted to lose their lower interest rates by buying another home in a tight market, the unit was negatively impacted. The company declined to comment on the move but one person (who wished to remain anonymous) who was affected by the layoffs told TechCrunch via email on June 8: “At 8AM yesterday, after being praised in Tuesday’s meeting, our computers where disconnected and logged out of work emails. No warning.” Guess Better.com hasn’t learned from its past experiences of botching layoffs. – Mary Ann
FedNow set to launch
As you may recall, the imploding of banks, like Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank, shed a lot of light on payment rails, and the Federal Reserve’s new FedNow Service, set to launch in July, is being referenced as something that will ease some of the pain being felt by legacy payment rails. 
The Fed suggests that FedNow, an instant payment infrastructure, will be a faster payment rail for financial institutions, offering real-time, 24/7, every day of the year with immediate access to funds. Even investors are keen on it.
This week, we saw some movements related to FedNow. First, TX Zhuo, managing partner of Fika Ventures, noted that “FedNow presents both compelling opportunities and potentially complex challenges,” and many of the effects will be something we can see as early as next year. Zhuo points to one of the immediate opportunities being risk management, especially with the incidences of fraud and scams we read about each day. Read more.
The other has to do with companies working to integrate FedNow. Global digital transformation company GFT is drawing on its experience with Pix in Brazil and the Universal Digital Payments Network to provide a three-part approach for banks. GFT developed architecture and compliance measures so that banks can scale transaction volume and no longer be dependent on closed, third-party services for instant payments.
To illustrate the potential for FedNow, Brazilian instant payments Matera released a report in May highlighting how well Pix is doing in Brazil. Notably, in 12 months, Pix reached 100 million users and 24 billion transactions were made in 2022, with nearly 3 billion transactions made just in December 2022. – Christine
Weekly News
Affirm has become the first buy now, pay later player to be added to Amazon Pay, the two companies announced on June 7. As part of the new partnership, any Amazon Pay merchants in the U.S. can now choose to offer their customers the option to “buy now, pay later” using Affirm’s technology. Affirm first announced an initial partnership with Amazon in August of 2021, which was exclusive through January of 2023. The news gave Affirm’s stock a much-needed boost. Shares had closed at $15.82 on June 6, the day before the announcement came out. By Friday late morning, they were trading at $18.32 after having shot up as high as $19.58 – up 15.8%. More on the news here.
As reported by Sarah Perez, Apple on June 7 “two significant changes to Apple Wallet among a handful of other updates that didn’t make the keynote address last Monday, which kicked off the start of its Worldwide Developers Conference. With the launch of iOS 17 this fall, Apple says users will be able to set up recurring payments with Apple Cash — handy for regular expenses, like rent, or for parents paying kids’ allowances, for example. In addition, Apple is announcing a new system that will allow businesses to accept IDs stored in Apple Wallet.” More here.
Anthemis Group announced last week that it has named Harry Harrison CEO of Anthemis Asset Management. Besides being the husband to Anthemis Group founder and CEO Amy Nauiokas, Harrison is the former head of Barclays Non-Core in London. The fintech-focused venture capital firm has been in the news several times in recent months. In May, TechCrunch reported that Anthemis Group is trying to raise $200 million for a third fund, according to an SEC filing. That new fundraising filing came just months after Anthemis laid off 16 people, or 28% of its staff, as reported by TechCrunch in April. At that time, a spokesperson for London-based Anthemis told TechCrunch that the move was an effort “to better reflect current market conditions and to set up the business for future growth” against its “strategic priorities.”
In a TechCrunch+ guest post, Healy Jones, who runs financial planning and analysis for Kruze Consulting, analyzed revenue, spending and runway data from 2021 and 2022 for over 700 startup clients to find out just how well certain industries were doing, including fintech. We won’t spoil the whole thing, however, we will note that the data confirms some things we’ve seen in the fintech industry in the past year, including growth among startups was doing well until the third quarter of 2022, “suggesting that the collapse of the cryptocurrency market severely impacted fintech sector revenues.” Read more.

According to Capterra’s 2023 Accounting and AI Survey of 317 business leaders, “51% of SMBs say AI and ML will fundamentally change business finance operations for the foreseeable future, and 76% of businesses have adopted at least one form of AI or ML technology to handle accounting and finance needs.” More here.

In the era of quick judgments, it’s tempting to think we are more clever than anyone else. But from AI to Apple to senior tech, underestimating others comes at a risk: being seriously wrong. — Anna
Don’t underestimate your granny
When the U.S. surgeon general’s advisory called out “our epidemic of loneliness and isolation,” heads immediately turned to social media and its risks for children and teens.
I can only agree with Dr. Vivek Murthy that social connection and community have healing effects, but I am on the fence on where technology stands. Sure, it can make us more isolated, but it can also connect us.
Dor Skuler, a founder I met recently, thinks that age makes a difference. “While the surgeon general warns technology is a contributing factor for teen loneliness, the report and our data shows the opposite holds true for older adults,” he said.
Skuler is referring to the insights gathered by his company, Intuition Robotics. He has a horse in the race: Its flagship product is ElliQ, an AI companion aiming to achieve “healthier, happier aging.” But he also has data: After years in beta testing, ElliQ is being distributed to American seniors through several state aging agencies.

Secure your startup’s future by watching the big corporations,Haje Jan Kamps,2023/06/10,"
Welcome to Startups Weekly. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Saturday morning. Starting next week, it moves to Fridays at 12 pm PT.
As a startup founder, wouldn’t it be awesome if you could predict the future a little bit more than you currently do? It turns out you can: By paying close attention to what the behemoths in your space are doing. Last year’s AWS Re:Invent set the direction for a lot of what Amazon is doing this year — including where it invests. Re:Invent 2023 is coming up soon.
Google I/O revealed that Google is investing heavily in computational photography, large language models and all things AI. As a startup, you can use these data points and draw a line into the future: Can you align yourself with the big-picture trends? Are you missing anything?
This week, at Apple’s worldwide developer conference WWDC, the company took the wraps off its AR/VR headset. Priced at $3,500 it won’t be a commercial success, but as a startup, you’d be very silly not to pay attention: It is a complete game-changer for startups.
Startup valuations are taking a pounding
After a frothy few years of don’t-call-it-a-bubble, it seems like the inevitable market correction is here. We’ve seen wave after wave of tech layoffs, and it seems like investors are starting to take a more realistic view of their investments, starting to mark them down.
Marking down an investment doesn’t necessarily mean drama; it refers to the common process of adjusting the value of an investment asset to reflect its current market value. In the case of VC, that often happens if the valuation turned out to be a bit on the optimistic side. Investors will typically mark down investments to avoid overstating their portfolio’s worth. In a nutshell, it’s best practice to acknowledge potential losses before they are realized. That’s what is happening now — and perhaps should have been happening for a while, as Rebecca argued late last year, when she noticed that a bunch of startups had quietly marked down their own valuations.
Jeremy Abelson and Jacob Sonnenberg, both at Irving Investors, argue that if you haven’t yet, you probably won’t grow into your 2023 investment valuation.

Just in the past few weeks week, we had another handful of examples of this:

Reddit gets a reread: Manish reports that Fidelity cuts Reddit valuation by 41%.
Canva gets redrawn: Connie reports that Rowe Price has marked down its stake in Canva by 67.6%.
NestAway moves to a smaller apartment: NestAway, once valued at over $225 million, sells for $11 million, Manish reports.

Life is a highway
The EV space is exploding (sometimes literally) at the moment, and there seems to be a huge amount of stuff in motion in the world of transportation.
Mercedes just got permission from the state of California to start selling a car that can self-drive without having to hold the wheel or look at the road. No doubt this’ll set Elon Musk’s little temperature gauge to “furious” as the company’s cars do attract a federal tax break but come up short on the self-driving front in its native California.
Price is often brought up as a major hurdle for EVs, but Volvo snuck out a small SUV that can cruise along for 275 miles and has a sub-$35,000 price tag. That still isn’t pocket change, but it’s a lot cheaper than a lot of the EVs on the road. Meanwhile, Fiat showed off a city vehicle it’s working on that made both Harri and myself squee with delight.
Safety is another theme across TechCrunch’s transportation coverage: Smarter cars should, in theory, mean safer roads. In practice, Waymo had to explain why one of its autonomous Jaguars ran down a dog in San Francisco last month, and Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recently proposed a rule that means all new cars and trucks would need to have emergency systems that “would have to be capable of stopping and avoiding contact with a vehicle at speeds of up to 62 miles per hour.”
Remember what we said about legislation driving innovation and opportunities for startup? That proposed NHTSA rule falls into that category. Thought experiment: Could your company tap into that shift somehow?

Wheelbarrow-sized EV: Harri reports that Arcimoto’s latest teeny-tiny EV is all work and no play.
Well they trucked that one up: Rebecca reports that Nikola’s bid to increase shares stalls after failing to get enough shareholders to vote.

Apple sets the pace
While Apple isn’t really a startup, it is the world’s first $3 trillion market cap company, so in a week where our servers have been melting from all of the exciting news that came out of the WWDC keynote, I wanted to highlight some of the things that are most interesting to startups and startup founders.
One thing worth paying attention to is the Apple Design Awards, which often foreshadow large trends in design and user experience best practices — along with what the Cupertino-based software giant celebrates at the moment.
Another trend worth paying attention to from Apple is its focus on health and safety: It released a check-In feature to ensure people get home safe, a nudity filter to shield you from unsolicited real-life aubergine emoji and mental health mood tracking. All of that is specific to this WWDC, but it continues a trend: Fall detection, car crash detection, ECG to detect heart events, and lots of other health and safety indicators. It has made it easier to find and disable AirTags that might be used for stalking, and a Safety Check and lockdown mode, which takes your iPhone off the radar to get away from an abusive partner (more from our security team here).
As a startup, all of the above should give you pause for thought: There are big trends at play here that Apple clearly wants to continue to invest in. Apple has gone heavy into the privacy of your data, and leaning into security, safety, mental and physical health and more. Build something truly innovative in these spaces, and you have the world’s most valuable company validating that these are problems worth solving.

"Deal Dive: Finally, a startup building a network for those who could benefit the most",Rebecca Szkutak,2023/06/10,"
The tech industry has tried hard to address its diversity problem, but hiring talent from different backgrounds is only the first “challenge.” A bigger one is retaining them.
Porter Braswell is no stranger to the statistics or to companies’ various excuses for why the numbers are so bad. Early in his career, he struggled to break into tech despite holding internships at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, and was repeatedly told it was a pipeline problem.
So, Braswell launched Jopwell, a career platform for people from underrepresented communities and backgrounds.
Nearly a decade later, the company says it has supported tens of thousands of professionals, and Braswell has moved into an executive chairman role, looking for his next problem to solve. It wasn’t far off: He found that while many companies had started hiring more people of color, they had a new issue in getting the employees to stay.
“Retention is a major challenge and still remains so,” Braswell told TechCrunch+. “My heart was pulling me toward the retention part of the equation, especially [the feeling of] belonging. What are the variables that lead people to feel like they belong or that ultimately lead individuals of color to leave organizations? It’s because they don’t feel seen, heard or valued.”
Braswell decided the best solution was to create a community that could help people feel valued and also involve the corporations they work for.
That came in the form of 2045, named for the year when communities of color are expected to become the majority in the U.S. The company recently raised a $4.2 million pre-seed round led by Ken Chenault Jr., the son of the former CEO of Amex.
“It was astonishing to me that no one was building a community for what will be the largest population in America,” he said.
An attempt to actually be inclusive
2045 is launching at an interesting time for community startups. "
This week in foodtech: Cultivated meat is still a sizzling topic,Christine Hall,2023/06/10,"
If you’re adventurous with your food, or just like to keep up with the fast-moving foodtech industry, here’s a roundup of this week’s stories and some notable news we weren’t able to cover.
Bring home the bacon
Some big news came from across the pond where the U.K.-based cultivated meat startup Higher Steaks raised $30 million and changed its name to Uncommon. Balderton Capital and Lowercarbon Capital co-led the round.
The cultivated meat segment of the alternative protein industry is one of those that often has highlights and lowlights. Perhaps it’s because they hold out hope that the United States government will catch up to the forward-thinking Singapore where these products are being served. The U.K. has already made some financial commitments even as Italy’s government puts forth a bill that would ban cultivated meat.
As mentioned in the story, “being able to produce large enough quantities of cultured meat at a low enough price is problematic.” Some companies, like Dutch foodtech company Meatable, said in May that its technology reached a milestone: creating cultivated pork products in eight days.
Whatever happens, it’s clear from this round that some venture capitalists remain bullish about investing into this space. On Monday, look for a special TechCrunch+ investor survey on alternative proteins.

Cultured meat startup Higher Steaks nabs $30M and rebrands as Uncommon

Steaming cup ‘o Joe
Speaking of a food segment where funding continues to brew, this week the Green Coffee Company closed on $25 million in Series C equity funding. The company touts itself as “Colombia’s largest coffee producer,” and is the latest to get some funding amid coffee companies, including Chamberlain Coffee Fellow and Blank Street.
Green Coffee Company’s operations span 9,000 acres across 39 farms. It also has over 11.5 million coffee trees under ownership.
Its funding was a bit unique: raising capital from a network of over 450 individual, high-net-worth investors that invest directly into portfolio companies that investment firm Legacy Group advises rather than into a pooled fund, company founder Cole Shephard told TechCrunch. In total, investors have injected over $60 million into the business.
Shephard noted that the company raises in this manner because “the team at Legacy has always felt strongly about offering unique and exciting deals that provide individual investors the ability to directly invest in companies that they like rather than into a blind or diversified fund model over which they have little control or in which they hand over decision-making to large funds and institutions who provide little personalized attention.”

Nutrition is fashionable
Meanwhile, we’re always trying to eat healthier, and as reported this week, Ahara is a new personalized nutrition company that “provides recommendations to its customers after they first fill out a health questionnaire that asks them about their diet and health history, and their age and location, after which they can take a variety of at-home tests for genetic, epigenetic and biomarkers.”
At the helm are Julie Wainwright, founder and former CEO of luxury online consignment company The RealReal, and celebrity physician-nutritionist Melina Jampolis. It’s currently in beta and reportedly will have both a freemium model and premium membership that will include special benefits.
Ahara joins a crowded nutrition startup arena. As noted in the story, most offer different things, but are increasingly pushing personalization. Venture capitalists like them, too. Within the past few years, we’ve seen daily health program Mighty Health raise $7.6 million, telehealth nutrition  platform Nourish raise $8 million and British nutrition and health tracking app Zoe, bring in £25 million.

Julie Wainwright is back with a new, venture-backed startup

Not so Impossible
I’ve not previously covered the lawsuit between Impossible Foods and Motif Foodworks that began in 2022, but in the past few weeks, the case got a bit interesting.
At the end of May, some disclosures came to light that Motif suspected Impossible hired some private investigators who allegedly used fake identities to get information on Motif products.
This week, a court ruled that this strategy by Impossible did not break any rules, according to a report.
Here’s a brief background: Impossible sued Motif related to Motif’s use of heme proteins in making its plant-based meat alternative. Learn more about Motif’s process. Impossible alleges that Motif is infringing on its patent that covers the use of heme in making such food items.
Motif says that its heme use is not the same as Impossible’s and has previously stated that, “If Impossible wins​ ​[its lawsuit in Delaware], it means no one else can experiment with heme in the plant-based industry.”​​

FIS acquires banking-as-a-service startup Bond,Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/06/09,"
Consolidation continues apace in the world of fintech. FIS, the fintech giant that runs a wide range of payment, banking and investment services, has acquired Bond, a startup that specializes in embedded finance, multiple sources confirmed today. 
Fintech Business Weekly’s Jason Mikula broke the news last week that the deal was in the works. Our sources confirm that the deal has now closed, as of today.
FIS is not sharing how much it paid for Bond, a San Francisco-based BaaS (banking-as-a-service) startup. But as a point of reference, PitchBook notes that Bond was valued at $182 million the last time it raised money, in 2020. Since 2019, Bond has raised a total of $42 million in funding, according to Crunchbase. 
It has an impressive list of backers. Coatue Management led the company’s last round, a $32 million Series A in 2020, which also included participation from Mastercard, Goldman Sachs, Canaan Partners, B Capital Group and former Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack. 
BaaS, sometimes called embedded finance, helps brands (sometimes those well outside the world of finance) integrate financial services like credit cards and bank accounts to in turn sell on those services to their customers.
Touting “an AI-powered infrastructure,” Bond works to help digital brands – including other fintechs such as Pocketbook and Everest – offer “personalized and compliant banking products.” 
With roughly 30 employees, Bond’s focus has been on building APIs and software that enables commercial and consumer credit card solutions, as well as debit cards and accounts.
According to an internal memo by FIS viewed by TechCrunch, the FIS and Bond leadership teams “will determine how the two companies will work together,” including how FIS will bring Bond’s capabilities into FIS’s existing relationships.
FIS SVP of Platforms Himal Makwana, in partnership with the company’s integration management office, will be leading post-purchase planning activities, the memo added.
It’s not clear why Bond has opted to get acquired, but the deal comes amid a very unsettled period in the worlds of technology, venture funding and financial services. Funding activity has largely ground to a halt in the world of startups compared to previous years, which partly contributed to the collapse of two major banks focusing on the tech sector.
It’s not clear what the financial state of play was at Bond, but it’s notable that it hadn’t raised money since 2020, and amid a decline in fintech venture funding in particular, M&A may have become an interesting option for the startup. 
On the other side of the equation, bigger incumbents like FIS, as well as larger fintechs, have been making a number of moves to buy companies like fintechs to bolt on talent and technology in a race to update their own products and services amid the competitive landscape. 
Earlier this year, Marqeta acquired financial infrastructure startup Power Finance in a $275 million deal. JP Morgan closed its acquisition of Aumni. And Brazilian fintech infra company Pismo is said to be in the midst of being courted by the likes of Visa and Mastercard in a reported $1 billion transaction.
Not every M&A deal works out well, of course, with the biggest often being the hardest to digest. FIS made one of the largest-ever acquisitions in the world of payments when it acquired WorldPay for about $43 billion in 2019. That deal never really came up trumps, though. In February of this year, FIS confirmed that it would be spinning WorldPay off.

Airport runways are built to international standards, but civil engineers and architects must consider wind, terrain and a host of other factors before sketching out blueprints.
Startup runways are similar: Healthcare and fintech face different headwinds, which means companies in these sectors manage their cash differently.
According to Healy Jones, who oversees financial analysis and planning for Kruze Consulting, average startup runway length was 23.4 months in January 2023, up from 19.6 months in 2019.

Creating demand for a new product is hard. Unless you’re Apple.
There is a built-in customer base for every SKU on Cupertino’s virtual shelves, and the upcoming Apple Vision Pro is no different, despite its initial $3,500 price tag, writes Haje Jan Kamps.
“Still, the preposterously over-engineered headset is a vital flag in the ground for startups,” he writes.
Spatial computing may not have a broad user base today, but “with a few notable exceptions, the company has a formidable track record of willing entire ecosystems into existence.”

An onboarding flow that’s entirely smooth is a great way to lose potential customers, according to growth marketing expert Jonathan Martinez.
“One of the biggest misconceptions when it comes to user experience is that we must eliminate as many questions and barriers as possible to be the gold standard,” he writes in TC+.
In this week’s column, he explored three different types of friction and explains how to run lifetime value (LTV) experiments that drive conversions.

Five fundamentals for creating an effective OKR process
Image Credits: Caspar Benson (opens in a new window) / Getty Images
Now that easy money is off the menu, startup teams must demonstrate that they’re capable of setting (and reaching!) strategic goals.
Inexperienced founders often chase vanity metrics like social media followers or total user count that validate short-term efforts.
Successful companies, on the other hand, use objectives and key results (OKRs) to align their day-to-day efforts with long-term goals.
Whether you already have an OKR process in place or are setting one up, this comprehensive guide by Julia Daniel and Karl Alomar at early-stage VC firm M13 covers the essentials:

The OKR framework.
Setting annual objectives.
Creating an annualized roadmap.
Quarterly planning.
How to establish a rinse-and-repeat cadence.

There are many ways to approach customer discovery, but two methods dominate:

Sales and product teams gather data, ask questions and run experiments.
People substitute their own judgment for user input and hope for the best.

Chasing the wrong audience wastes time and money, which is why Yousuf Khan, partner at Ridge Ventures, wrote a TC+ post with tactics for identifying qualified customers.
“Whether you’re pursuing customer number five, 50 or 500, the process of determining if there’s a fit remains largely the same.”

Unless the overall environment changes, a new report from European VC firm Atomico forecasts that startup funding in the region “will be 52% lower than in 2021,” writes Anna Heim.
“The adjusted market reality is here to stay,” Atomico predicted, including more down rounds and layoffs.
“2021 was a clear outlier, with investment volumes and valuations now returning to long-term averages,” according to Atomico partner Tom Wehmeier.
“That’s no bad thing, but it won’t be an easy time for everyone.”

Rebecca Szkutak interviewed three seed-stage investors to learn more about what it takes to close a Series A in June 2023:

Loren Straub, general partner, Bowery Capital
Eric Bahn, co-founder and general partner, Hustle Fund
Yoni Rechtman, venture principal, Slow Ventures

Now that ARR isn’t the north star metric it once was, their answers varied. “The goal posts seem to be moving a lot,” said Bahn.
“It really sucks for a lot of people,” said Rechtman. “I really feel for people who I think have been sold a false bill of goods.”

What’s being built in generative AI today?,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/09,"
If you look past the financial headlines, what are today’s AI startups building?
News coverage of the AI boom has been hectic and mainly covered a few categories: Financial, Big Tech, concern and hype, and startup activity. The financial side is simple: Investors are working to put capital into companies that are either building new AI-powered products or embedding it into existing products.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

The Big Tech collection is also easy to understand: Google and Microsoft are racing to own the cloud layer underneath major AI technology and building generative AI services into their existing productivity and search products. Meta, Amazon and Baidu are also busy. The list goes on.
Hype is not hard to find nor is the doomer perspective. Reality will likely be somewhere in between. I suspect that we’ll grow accustomed to having AI-powered tools and services around us at all times and some of the use cases will be positive while others will prove negative.
But these conversations often don’t actually discuss what is being built. So, this morning, I’ll go back through our recent generative AI coverage to provide a few notes on what folks are working to create. I am approaching the topic as a generalist who has a pro-tech, pro-progress and pro-capitalism perspective tempered by a dash of anxiety. Call me an optimist with an asterisk.
Fair enough? Let’s get to work.
Looking past the money
We’re going to look at Together, Contextual AI, Instabase, Adept and Cohere.

Hear how Chronosphere is reinventing cloud observability on TechCrunch Live,Matt Burns,2023/06/09,"
Chronosphere aims to provide engineers with actionable insights derived from the company’s data. According to the company, this leads to lower spend and provides a better return on investment. Join this TechCrunch Live event on June 21 at 12 pm PDT to hear how Chronosphere is competing as companies look to reduce expenditures.
Martin Mao co-founded the company in 2019 and quickly raised $370 million, including from Jerry Chen at Greylock. The company had a valuation of $1.6 billion at the time of its $115 million Series C fundraise in November 2022. In April 2023, Chronosphere announced a partnership with Google Cloud to help customers address incidents while controlling costs. This allows customers to bundle Chronosphere through the Google Cloud Marketplace.
As the market fluctuates and capital becomes more expensive, companies like Chronosphere are looking for ways to help customers reduce spend — but this requires that companies spend with Chronosphere. It’s a delicate balance, and I hope you can join this TechCrunch Live event to hear Martin’s outlook. He’s in a unique position, and together with Jerry Chen, this should be an interesting conversation with actionable advice.
TechCrunch Live records each Wednesday at 12:00 p.m. PDT with the goal of helping founders build better venture-backed businesses. Register for this event right HERE. Watch past events on TechCrunch Live’s YouTube channel.

Pitch Deck Teardown: CulturePulse’s $1M seed deck,Haje Jan Kamps,2023/06/09,"
Sentiment analysis, which means generalizing a feeling expressed by people in, say, online reviews, has been around for a hot minute. It’s a powerful feedback and quantitative analysis tool with wide-ranging political, commercial and social applications.
Slovakian company CulturePulse recently raised just short of a million dollars to move the needle further in this area. The company’s pitch deck is bad enough that I’m surprised it raised money, so let’s take a look at why that is and what could be improved.

We’re looking for more unique pitch decks to tear down, so if you want to submit your own, here’s how you can do that.


Slides in this deck
The company submitted its deck to us a couple of months ago, claiming that this terse, nine-slide presentation is what it used to pitch to VCs. It comprises of the following slides:

Cover slide
Solution slide
Product slide
Business model slide
Customers and media slide
Roadmap slide
Team slide
The ask slide
Closing slide

Three things to love
I’m not going to lie: I really struggled to find three things I truly love about this deck. That said, here are a few things that stood out:
The solution space
The deck doesn’t have a problem slide per se, but this one passes as a combined problem/solution slide:
[Slide 2] CulturePulse’s combo problem/solution slide. Image Credits: CulturePulseAs much as I would have preferred a separate problem slide, this sort of works. On the left, it outlines the problem (presumably, that without CulturePulse’s product, it’s hard to capture the beliefs and motivations of customers) by stating what the solution does.
The part I really do like about this slide, though, is the illustration on the right: It shows some of the potential motivations that customers might have. For even better results, the company could have connected the dots with something like: “We enable you to spend more time focusing on your lifetime buyers than your one-time customers.” But the slide works as-is.
Cracking opening
[Slide 1] Powerful opening slide. Image Credits: CulturePulse“Show, don’t tell,” is one of the cornerstones of effective storytelling. “Make your message resonate,” combined with the product screenshot on the right is a great way to set the stage for an investment conversation. I particularly like the “resonance score” on the right — if it works, being able to test a bunch of copy to see what the AI believes will work best for the target platforms and audiences would make for a very smart approach.
I don’t like how this slide doesn’t take the audience into consideration: “Your” speaks to investors, and while there are investors on social media who might wish to use this product, they are probably not CulturePulse’s core audience. It’s needlessly confusing to have a “you” on a slide that’s talking to investors when it means your customers.
Great final thought
The deck closes with a poignant quote:
[Slide 9] Leave ’em on a high. Image Credits: CulturePulseIt’s a fantastic idea to give your would-be investors something to ponder at the end of a presentation. A quote from an economics Nobel Prize winner that essentially describes your business is as good a way to close as any. Very well done.
In the rest of this teardown, we’ll try to limit the things CulturePulse could have improved or done differently to just three things. Its full pitch deck is also included!

Nocnoc opens door to quicker setup of cross-border e-commerce in Latin America,Christine Hall,2023/06/09,"
Nocnoc, which facilitates cross-border e-commerce between Latin American merchants and global sellers, raised $14 million in Series A funding.
PayPal Ventures led the round and was joined by Mouro Capital, Quona Capital, Caravela Capital, Broadhaven and Ignia. This gives the company $22 million in total venture-backed funding to date.
Ilan Bajarlia, Joaquin Colella and Diego Szilagyi started nocnoc in 2018 to enable businesses to sell in Latin America through 16 marketplaces with a potential reach of nearly 500 million consumers, CEO Bajarlia told TechCrunch. The company is headquartered in Uruguay with offices in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, China and Spain.
Latin America’s cross-border sales grew 44% in 2022. The market is valued at $382 billion and expected to grow annually at a rate of 25% through 2025, according to Americas Market Intelligence.
“Cross border e-commerce is growing faster than local commerce in the last five years,” Bajarlia said. “People are keen to buy products that they can’t buy in their local market, so very large marketplaces from the world have been growing their share in Latin America, specifically, Chinese and U.S.-based marketplaces.”
Online merchants upload their product catalog to nocnoc’s platform and then can start selling on marketplaces, including Amazon, Mercado Libre, Americanas, Carrefour, Walmart, Magazine Luiza and Coppel. Nocnoc manages the product listings across all of those marketplaces and creates marketing campaigns for the products. The company also handles communication with consumers, delivery logistics, cancellations and returns.
When it comes to payments, nocnoc typically pays sellers every 15 days, in their local currency, even if the product has not yet made it to the buyer. This is compared to the 40 to 50 days that sellers typically wait to collect payment for a sale, Bajarlia said.
Nocnoc’s concept has caught on. The company introduced over 180,000 exclusive products to the region from more than 1,200 international sellers. In the past 12 months, gross merchandise volume grew 3x amid the company adding seven new marketplaces, expanding in Mexico, Colombia and Chile. All of that has made nocnoc “[become] the largest cross-border store in Latin America,” Bajarlia said.
The new funding will go toward helping its business and its customers grow and expand into Latin America. New features will include additional fulfillment centers and an “Advanced Payments” product that will pay sellers even faster, an average of three to five days, with cancellations and returns covered.
“We have been growing a lot in diversifying our consumer offer so everything related to which products we are selling have improved,” Bajarlia said. “We’ve improved our technology to understand what’s the best-selling product in Latin America, understanding supply and demand, understanding the elasticity of each product and what new categories we can introduce. As such, we are connected to the leading marketplaces in Latin America, and are usually the only or largest cross-border enabler for any consumer, for example in Brazil, willing to buy from an international seller.”

For LatAm payment orchestration startups, market fragmentation is a blessing in disguise

Runway’s Gen-2 shows the limitations of today’s text-to-video tech,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/09,"
In a recent panel interview with Collider, Joe Russo, the director of tentpole Marvel films like “Avengers: Endgame,” predicted that within two years, AI will be able to create a fully fledged movie. I’d say that’s a rather optimistic timeline. But we’re getting closer.
This week, Runway, a Google-backed AI startup that helped develop the AI image generator Stable Diffusion, released Gen-2, a model that generates videos from text prompts or an existing image. (Gen-2 was previously in limited, waitlisted access.) The follow-up to Runway’s Gen-1 model launched in February, Gen-2 is one of the first commercially available text-to-video models.
“Commercially available” is an important distinction. Text-to-video, being the logical next frontier in generative AI after images and text, is becoming a bigger area of focus particularly among tech giants, several of which have demoed text-to-video models over the past year. But those models remain firmly in the research stages, inaccessible to all but a select few data scientists and engineers.
Of course, first isn’t necessarily better.
Out of personal curiosity and service to you, dear readers, I ran a few prompts through Gen-2 to get a sense of what the model can — and can’t — accomplish. (Runway’s currently providing around 100 seconds of free video generation.) There wasn’t much of a method to my madness, but I tried to capture a range of angles, genres and styles that a director, professional or armchair, might like to see on the silver screen — or a laptop as the case might be.
One limitation of Gen-2 that became immediately apparent is the framerate of the four-second-long videos the model generates. It’s quite low and noticeably so, to the point where it’s nearly slideshow-like in places.
Image Credits: Runway
What’s unclear is whether that’s a problem with the tech or an attempt by Runway to save on compute costs. In any case, it makes Gen-2 a rather unattractive proposition off the bat for editors hoping to avoid post-production work.
Beyond the framerate issue, I’ve found that Gen-2-generated clips tend to share a certain graininess or fuzziness in common, as if they’ve had some sort of old-timey Instagram filter applied. Other artifacting occurs as well in places, like pixelation around objects when the “camera” (for lack of a better word) circles them or quickly zooms toward them.
As with many generative models, Gen-2 isn’t particularly consistent with respect to physics or anatomy, either. Like something conjured up by a surrealist, people’s arms and legs in Gen-2-produced videos meld together and come apart again while objects melt into the floor and disappear, their reflections warped and distorted. And — depending on the prompt — faces can appear doll-like, with glossy, emotionless eyes and pasty skin that evokes a cheap plastic.
Image Credits: Runway
To pile on higher, there’s the content issue. Gen-2 seems to have a tough time understanding nuance, clinging to particular descriptors in prompts while ignoring others, seemingly at random.
Image Credits: Runway
One of the prompts I tried — “A video of an underwater utopia, shot on an old camera, in the style of a ‘found footage’ film” — brought about no such utopia, only what looked like a first-person scuba dive through an anonymous coral reef. Gen-2 struggled with my other prompts, too, failing to generate a zoom-in shot for a prompt specifically calling for a “slow zoom” and not quite nailing the look of your average astronaut.
Could the issues lie with Gen-2’s training data set? Perhaps.
Gen-2, like Stable Diffusion, is a diffusion model, meaning it learns how to gradually subtract noise from a starting image made entirely of noise to move it closer, step by step, to the prompt. Diffusion models learn through training on millions to billions of examples; in an academic paper detailing Gen-2’s architecture, Runway says the model was trained on an internal data set of 240 million images and 6.4 million video clips.
Diversity in the examples is key. If the data set doesn’t contain much footage of, say, animation, the model — lacking points of reference — won’t be able to generate reasonable-quality animations. (Of course, animation being a broad field, even if the data set did have clips of anime or hand-drawn animation, the model wouldn’t necessarily generalize well to all types of animation.)
Image Credits: Runway
On the plus side, Gen-2 passes a surface-level bias test. While generative AI models like DALL-E 2 have been found to reinforce societal biases, generating images of positions of authority — like “CEO or “director” — that depict mostly white men, Gen-2 was the tiniest bit more diverse in the content it generated — at least in my testing.
Image Credits: Runway
Fed the prompt “A video of a CEO walking into a conference room,” Gen-2 generated a video of men and women (albeit more men than women) seated around something like a conference table. The output for the prompt “A video of a doctor working in an office,” meanwhile, depicts a woman doctor vaguely Asian in appearance behind a desk.
Results for any prompt containing the word “nurse” were less promising, though, consistently showing young white women. Ditto for the phrase “a person waiting tables.” Evidently, there’s work to be done.
The takeaway from all this, for me, is that Gen-2 is more a novelty or toy than a genuinely useful tool in any video workflow. Could the outputs be edited into something more coherent? Perhaps. But depending on the video, it’d require potentially more work than shooting footage in the first place.
That’s not to be too dismissive of the tech. It’s impressive what Runway’s done, here, effectively beating tech giants to the text-to-video punch. And I’m sure some users will find uses for Gen-2 that don’t require photorealism — or a lot of customizability. (Runway CEO Cristóbal Valenzuela recently told Bloomberg that he sees Gen-2 as a way to offer artists and designers a tool that can help them with their creative processes.)
Image Credits: Runway
I did myself. Gen-2 can indeed understand a range of styles, like anime and claymation, which lend themselves to the lower framerate. With a little fiddling and editing work, it wouldn’t be impossible to string together a few clips to create a narrative piece.
Lest the potential for deepfakes concern you, Runway says it’s using a combination of AI and human moderation to prevent users from generating videos that include pornography or violent content or that violate copyrights. I can confirm there’s a content filter — an overzealous one in point of fact. But of course, those aren’t foolproof methods, so we’ll have to see how well they work in practice.
Image Credits: Runway
But at least for now, filmmakers, animators and CGI artists and ethicists can rest easy. It’ll be at least a couple of iterations down the line before Runway’s tech comes close to generating film-quality footage — assuming it ever gets there.

Cultured meat startup Higher Steaks nabs $30M and rebrands as Uncommon,Paul Sawers,2023/06/08,"
U.K.-based cultivated meat startup Higher Steaks has raised $30 million in a Series A round of funding and revealed that it’s changing its name to Uncommon.
Founded out of Cambridge in 2017, Uncommon is one of countless companies pushing to make cultured “lab-grown” meat a reality in kitchens and restaurants around the globe, covering everything from synthetic sausages and bogus burgers to pseudo-seafood. Uncommon, for its part, is mostly focused on the $250 billion global pork market, developing bacon and pork belly products.
Hurdles
Uncommon founders: Chief science officer Dr. Ruth Faram with CEO Benjamina Bollag Image Credits: Uncommon
Regulatory hurdles has meant that meat made from animal cells in a test tube have been slow to gain a foothold, with Singapore currently the only market in the world where cultured meat is available for sale. The Food and Drug Association (FDA) in the U.S. also recently started rubberstamping such edibles as being safe for human consumption.
Some countries, though, are pushing back against the burgeoning fake-meat revolution, including Italy which is mulling an outright ban on lab-developed food to safeguard its culinary heritage.
But another longstanding challenge of bringing cultivated meat to market has been scalability. Being able to produce large enough quantities of cultured meat at a low enough price is problematic, with some companies pursuing a hybrid lab-grown meat / plant-based protein approach to get their products to market faster.
Uncommon, though, says it’s using a technique involving a polymeric molecule called RNA (ribonucleic acid), or more specifically mRNA, which essentially contains “instructions” that enable cells to make proteins from its own internal functions.
“This also means that Uncommon can create real meat without using genetic engineering,” Uncommon co-founder and CEO Benjamina Bollag told TechCrunch. “With countries becoming increasingly against genetically engineered food, Uncommon hopes that this means it can scale its cultivated meat across the world with regulatory challenges.”
Moreover, Bollag says that it’s using this patent-pending technique to help bring cultivated meat closer to price parity with traditional meat.
“With this method, it’s also possible to more directly target muscle and fat regulators in the cells when compared to growth factors and small molecules, in a similar fashion as gene editing,” Bollag said. “This in turn reduces the quantity of raw materials needed, which makes it possible to scale the process at a reduced cost compared to using genetic engineering.”
Uncommon’s $30 million Series A round was led by London-based Balderton Capital and New York’s Lowercarbon Capital, with participation from a number institutional and angel investors including OpenAI’s Sam Altman and his brother Max, as well as Redalpine, East Alpha, Miray Zaki and Sebastiano Castiglioni. The company said that it plans to use its fresh cash injection to scale up production and kickstart its regulatory approval process in Europe and Singapore, while keeping a “close eye” on the U.S. market.
“Singapore is likely to receive the approval first as it is the most developed ecosystem for cultivated meat, with other markets to follow,” Bollag said, though with little indication as to when commercialization might being. “We will be starting with high-end restaurants first before moving to supermarkets.”

Zero-based budgeting: A proven framework for extending runway



The startup ecosystem has gone through some substantial changes over the last few months, and founders need to understand current conditions to properly plan for the future.
I serve the accounting and financial planning needs of more than 750 startups, which provides me with a unique position to help founders stay informed about the different factors that affect funding, valuations, spending, startup management and other trends in the startup economy.
The data in this report is not from a survey — it’s created directly from anonymized accounting data from more than 700 of our clients. As such, it’s not subject to any optimistic thinking bias that so many startup founder surveys have.
Capital is tightening, forcing startups to react
Low interest rates over the last decade have fueled growth and boosted startup valuations across every industry. But in June 2022, the rate of inflation peaked at 9.1%. In response, the Federal Reserve dramatically increased interest rates, bringing easy access to cheap money to an end.
Startups included in this dataset raised more than $4 billion in 2021 but only in the high $2 billion range in 2022 — a dramatic drop.
The end of easy money is forcing founders to react. Startups that might have easily gotten venture funding in the past are going to have to get creative to extend their cash runway. The charts below contrast startup revenue, spending and runway in 2021 and 2022 in four sectors: software/SaaS, e-commerce, healthcare and fintech.
Startups are extending their runways
In general, the cash position of most startups remains solid, with some important nuances.
We watch the cash position and runway of our startup clients very closely, as their investors (and savvy founders) deeply care about this metric.
 

			The data in this report is not from a survey — it’s created directly from anonymized accounting data from 700+ of our clients.					


 
At the beginning of 2019, the average startup had 19.6 months of runway. As of Jan. 1, 2023, the average has increased to 23.4 months of runway. This directly reflects the expense reductions seen in 2022, plus the record amounts of funding raised by startups over the past two years.
However, the average can hide some important nuances.
There are other implications to this careful cash management as well — startups may not be in a position to hire, for example. Another expense that startups are aggressively reducing is rent, choosing to embrace remote work — our clients spent about 7% of their expenses on rent pre-COVID, but we’ve seen that expense drop to just over 3% at the beginning of 2023.

Early-stage companies are cutting back
While almost all early-stage companies have reduced their burn rates in 2022, fintech shows the greatest cuts to spending, reflecting the downturn in revenues at the end of 2022. Facing an uncertain economic environment and potential fundraising challenges, startups are clearly looking to extend their runways by reducing expenses.
Founders will need to shift from a “growth at all costs” mentality to focus on sustainable growth. That’s going to require careful cash management and cautious spending.

"AI startup Cohere, now valued at over $2.1B, raises $270M",Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/08,"
In a sign that there’s plenty of cash to go around for generative AI startups, Cohere, which is developing an AI model ecosystem for the enterprise, today announced that it raised $270 million as part of its Series C round.
Reuters reported earlier in the year that Cohere was in talks to raise “hundreds of millions” of dollars at a valuation of upward of just over $6 billion. If there’s credence to that reporting, Cohere appears to have missed the valuation mark substantially; a source familiar with the matter tells TechCrunch that this tranche values the company at between $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion.
“The new capital will fuel continued development of Cohere’s AI platform, which is focused on enterprise customers, allowing companies to use their preferred cloud provider to increase data privacy and make implementation simpler,” president and COO Martin Kon told TechCrunch via email. “The latest round allows us to invest in compute, grow our team, engage with more of the world’s leading enterprises and further advance our world-leading AI, ultimately empowering companies to build incredible products while keeping their data private and secure.”
Aidan Gomez, Ivan Zhang and Nick Frosst (who was one of the first employees at Google’s Toronto AI lab) co-founded Cohere in 2019. Before starting Cohere, Gomez co-authored the seminal paper “Attention Is All You Need,” which introduced the Transformer, the architecture behind popular large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT-4.
Kon joined in early 2023, jumping from his previous role as CFO at YouTube.
Cohere, which has developed multilingual language models trained on data from native speakers, among other AI, aims to stand out in the ocean of generative AI startups by focusing on enterprise use cases.
Cohere’s AI platform is cloud agnostic, able to be deployed inside public clouds (e.g., Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services), a customer’s existing cloud, virtual private clouds or on-site. The startup takes a hands-on approach, working with customers to create custom LLMs based on their proprietary data.
“Cohere was founded to create a platform that empowers all enterprises to transform their company and products with world-leading AI that’s cloud-agnostic, accessible, customizable and data-secure,” Kon said. “Our mission is to allow enterprises worldwide to leverage this transformational technology.”
Cohere holds its customer numbers close to its chest. But the startup claims that it works with companies like Jasper and HyperWrite for copywriting generation tasks like creating marketing content, drafting emails and developing product descriptions. Elsewhere, Cohere recently announced a collaboration with LivePerson, the conversational marketing company, to build fine-tuned LLMs to improve explainability. And the startup’s partnering with a handful of organizations, including news outlets and Salesforce Ventures, to help break down, analyze and summarize lengthy text using machine learning algorithms.
“Generally, we can share that we’re experiencing high demand from major enterprises, as both customers and partners,” Kon said.
Cohere, which has around 180 employees, has raised a lot of capital — $445 million — even by generative AI startup standards. Only OpenAI ($11.3 billion) and Anthropic ($450 million) have raised more, ahead of rivals Inflection AI ($225 million) and Adept ($415 million).

But lest it seem excessive, training AI models tends to be capital-intensive. Anthropic, for one, expects to need to raise billions more to train the next generation of its task-accomplishing AI.

“When it comes to AI, building and training language models requires a lot of capital, but we’re mindful and intentional about what we actually need and committed to securing funds that will ensure we can continue providing the best possible solution for our customers,” Kon said. “We’ve been intentional about maintaining a diversity of global investors and not taking one bigger check from one company — especially a cloud provider — because that may limit our ability to remain independent, service enterprises directly, remain cloud-agnostic and deploy data-secure solutions on any cloud according to our customers’ preference.”
That comment about cloud provider investments was a likely dig at startups like OpenAI and Anthropic, which have taken on significant backing from Microsoft and Google, respectively. But it’s curious coming from Cohere, which not long ago was reportedly in advanced talks with Google about an investment in the range of $200 million.
Regardless of where its future capital comes from, Kon says he sees “search and retrieval” as the next core area of growth for Cohere. Using techniques that give models or chatbots the ability to expand on their knowledge base and search the web for information that’s relevant to a query, like OpenAI’s experimenting with, Kon believes that Cohere can build significantly more powerful AI systems than it offers today.
“Today, chatbots don’t have access to the world. They don’t know about what happened 10 minutes ago. They have to memorize everything within themselves, and they only have memory of what they saw during training,” Kon said. “With search and retrieval, you can require a model to cite sources, so users don’t need to blindly trust a model; everything links out to a site that you can verify and fact check.”
Looking further ahead, Cohere plans to build models that can take action and “do work” for customers, like book a flight, schedule a meeting or file an expense report on a person’s behalf. In that way, it’s chasing after competitors like Adept, Inflection and OpenAI, all of which are building — albeit using different approaches — systems to connect AI with third-party apps, services and products.
Despite the competition, Kon asserts that Cohere’s in a position of strength.
“We’re differentiated as the independent, cloud-agnostic AI platform for enterprises,” he said. “We are solely focused on enabling our customers to create proprietary LLM capabilities leveraging their data and creating strategic differentiation and business value.”
Inovia Capital led the oversubscribed Series C round with participation from Nvidia, Oracle, Salesforce Ventures, DTCP, Mirae Asset, Schroders Capital, SentinelOne, Thomvest Ventures and Index Ventures.

Investors take note: Wildfire smoke will spark a surge in East Coast climate tech startups,Tim De Chant,2023/06/08,"
As smoke from Canadian wildfires has enveloped large swathes of the East Coast, millions of people have found themselves trapped inside, gazing out on orange skies and hazy cityscapes. The air quality index — which is usually ignored — has suddenly become an object of fascination and source of small talk.
It’s all remarkably similar to what happened on the West Coast three years ago, when skies there turned a sinister hue and people rushed to seal their windows and buy air purifiers. If the past is prologue, then investors should prepare themselves for a tidal wave of climate tech startups next year.
There’s no doubt that the 2020 fire season on the West Coast had a profound impact on a number of founders. Several have told TechCrunch+ that the apocalyptically orange skies of that summer played a large role in their decision to quit their previous jobs and start companies focused on addressing the climate crisis. "
How one software company is beating the SaaS growth blues,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/08,"
The go-go days of software companies growing like crazy are now firmly behind us.
Data indicates that public software companies have added fewer sources of annual recurring revenue (ARR) in the first quarter of 2023 than they did a year earlier. In fact, that metric declined even more compared to the average quarterly number in 2022.

It’s tough out there, but not every company is reporting lackluster results. Samsara, which went public in late 2021, recently proved that it is still possible to expand fast, and perhaps even more impressively, that it’s possible to hold on to value even if you listed at the end of a venture capital bubble.
TechCrunch+ caught up with Samsara’s CEO and co-founder, Sanjit Biswas, to talk about his company’s performance and the pricing and sales choices that have helped it at least partially buck the slowdown.
Let’s start with a quick refresher on Samsara and its IPO pricing. Then, we’ll explore its first-quarter performance and dig into how its sales model is providing it with a more durable revenue base than most other modern software companies.
The Samsara growth story
It’s fun to go back and read 2021-era coverage, because it was such a wild time. We even noted during Samsara’s IPO pricing run that it felt like no one was paying attention:
One more note before we can sign off on this topic for the day: Doesn’t it feel like a somewhat muted day for a decacorn IPO? Samsara raised venture rounds through a Series F! And yet this IPO feels like it’s skating right under the radar.
At the time, we hypothesized that NFT hype was consuming all the oxygen in the room, or that there were so many IPOs that year that it was just not as exciting as before. Ah, what a good problem to have!
Samsara’s late-2021 IPO set it up to raise capital and go public at a valuation that made little to no sense. We saw that happen to a number of other companies that went public in 2021. "
"Cloudflare co-founders will talk growth, changing markets and more on Disrupt’s SaaS Stage",Lauren Simonds,2023/06/08,"
Co-founders Matthew Prince and Michelle Zatlyn launched Cloudflare to the world during the Startup Battlefield competition at TechCrunch Disrupt back in 2010. Fast-forward 13 years, and the startup has grown to become a leading internet infrastructure and security company.

"European startups on track to raise $51B this year, down 39% from 2022",Anna Heim,2023/06/08,"
The venture slowdown has long been established to be a global phenomenon, and per a new report from VC firm Atomico, this “adjusted market reality is here to stay.”
Based on Dealroom and Crunchbase data, Atomico predicts that if things stay the same, the amount of capital invested in European startups this year will be 52% lower than in 2021.
That’s a clear decline, but it isn’t much worse than what we are tracking in other major regions.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

We should note that the report comes with a caveat: It doesn’t include Israel, which is often part of many European data venture data summaries, and also excludes biotech, secondaries, debt or lending capital. Some of those sectors and funding avenues have been on the rise lately, which makes their exclusion notable. However, the geographic, sector and funding-type restrictions are consistent with prior Atomico reporting, meaning we have a solid basis for historical comparison.
Many of the same problems present in the United States are also showing up in Europe, such as infrequent exits and a dead IPO market. But we already knew that.
So, instead let’s look at recent European venture capital totals and see if there is cause for optimism despite yet another decline in anticipated funding levels.
The bad news isn’t actually that bad
Atomico reports that European tech investment volumes are tracking at around half of 2021, set to reach $51 billion in 2023, compared to $106 billion two years ago.
But that comparison isn’t that useful, given that 2021 was such a big outlier. We’re more interested in how 2023 will compare to years when the funding climate wasn’t so inflated. "
EvenUp wants to automate personal injury settlements — to a point,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/08,"
Millions of personal injury cases are settled in the U.S. every year, as few go to trial — but the vast majority are kept under wraps. This leaves lawyers guessing what they should propose as a settlement price, oftentimes resulting in victims being undercompensated.
It’s what led Rami Karabibar to launch EvenUp, a startup that taps AI to generate legal documents to assess injury cases. The platform, aimed at customers in the legal field, attempts to use raw case files, including medical records, police reports and bills, to create letters arguing for proposed compensation.
“We’re on a mission to level the playing field in personal injury cases,” Karabibar, who previously worked across private equity, venture capital and venture-backed startups, said.
Karabibar co-founded EvenUp with Ray Mieszaniec, a two-time entrepreneur, whose father was permanently disabled after being hit by a car involved in a police chase. Mieszaniec’s family got just 10% of the average payout for that type of accident — partly because their lawyer didn’t know what the appropriate compensation should be.
EvenUp aims to tackle all categories of personal injury cases, including motor vehicle accidents, police brutality, child abuse and even natural disasters. To do this, Karabibar, Mieszaniec and EvenUp’s third co-founder, Saam Mashhad (a former litigator), built a database of private settlements — including hundreds of thousands of medical records — and trained an AI to estimate fair compensation based on the details of each case.
EvenUp’s platform extracts the relevant info from documents and organizes them into templated “demand packages,” which state the legal and factual basis for a personal injury claim and include a demand for compensation. Designed to be a self-service solution for lawyers, paralegal staff and law firms, EvenUp summarizes notes and copies of raw records into medical digests “optimized for injury law.”
“The more documents and cases we see, the better we are at preparing demand packages, and the better we are at increasing case outcomes and reducing costs,” Karabibar said. “EvenUp reaches deeper in the legal workflow with a higher bar for accuracy than other AI assistants, from extracting data out of raw documents, to valuing what cases are worth, to generating final demand packages that bring that all together.”
As Karabibar alluded to, EvenUp isn’t the only startup applying AI to the tedious — and monotonous — task of drafting legal documents. Lawyaw, which emerged from stealth several years ago, is building software to automate the process of customizing standard documents like NDAs and wills. Elsewhere, Atrium’s software digitizes legal paperwork and builds apps on top to speed up fundraising, commercial contracts, equity distribution and employment issues.
But EvenUp claims that it’s one of the first to tackle personal injury — a law practice area not necessarily held in high regard. So-called “settlement mills,” which charge between 33% to 40% of total awarded compensation, settle a high volume of cases without necessarily focusing on maximizing the value of each claim.
Mieszaniec implies that EvenUp could change this by normalizing the practice of AI-aided personal injury litigation.
“By harnessing the potential of technology, we can create a future where the pursuit of justice is not marred by financial pressure or the representation you have,” Mieszaniec said via email. “It’s time to embrace innovative solutions that streamline the claims process, empower individuals, humanize the process and ensure that no one walks away with a fraction of what they deserve. That’s why we built EvenUp: to level the playing field for personal injury victims.”
EvenUp appears to have won over investors, who recently pledge $50.5 million in the company at a $325 million valuation (according to a source familiar with the matter). Bessemer Venture Partners led the latest round, a Series B, with participation from Bain Capital Ventures, Behance founder Scott Belsky and legal tech firm Clio, bringing EvenUp’s total raised to $65 million.
But can the tech live up to its promises — and address the outstanding legal and ethical implications?
With any AI tech, bias is a major concern. Algorithms trained on biased data can amplify those biases, perpetuating existing inequalities and injustices. For instance, a 2016 ProPublica analysis found that a widely used algorithm was twice as likely to misclassify Black defendants as presenting a high risk of recidivism than white defendants. One can imagine EvenUp’s AI recommending artificially high or low amounts of personal injury compensation as a result of dataset imbalances.
And what about privacy? EvenUp hasn’t disclosed where it sourced the medical and personal injury documents that it used to train its AI — nor whether it took steps to notify the original owners of those records.
That’s assuming once again that the tech works as advertised, even. If there’s any overarching takeaways from the generative AI boom, it’s that even the best AI algorithms today are far from perfect. (See: Microsoft’s Bing chatbot spouting vaccine misinformation and writing a hateful screed from the perspective of Adolf Hitler.)
If EvenUp’s customers share these concerns, it’s not obvious from their rush to adopt the platform. Karabibar claims that EvenUp counts “top trial attorneys” and “America’s largest personal injury law firms” among its customers and that it’s “close to profitable.”
Some, no doubt, are chasing after the chance to reduce filing expenses while maximizing returns. Karabibar doesn’t deny this.
“Injury attorneys are contingency-based, where they make a fixed percentage of the value of the case. Any increase in case outcomes directly impacts their revenue, while also increasing the amount clients receive,” he said.
But Karabibar also makes the case — rather optimistic, in my view — that automating aspects of the filing process could encourage litigators to “concentrate more on the human side of their work.” He’s also careful to suggest that EvenUp won’t replace lawyers outright. But, reading between the lines a little, it’s hard not to see how some paralegals, most of whom work on a contract basis, might find themselves out of a job if the tech were ever to be adopted on a mass scale.
“They’ll be able to support injury victims through the legal process, and advocating for the equitable outcomes their clients deserve,” he said.
We’ll see if that’s the case. In any event, EvenUp has broad ambitions, with plans to cover document generation in both the pre-litigation and litigation stages customized to each firm, jurisdiction and case type. Karabibar believes that EvenUp will eventually be able to handle 70% of the key documents in the personal injury law workflow.
“We are well-positioned to continue growing despite the turbulent economy, and we believe our products will only become more essential as time goes on,” Karabibar said. “Legal drafting has seen a fundamental step-change given the advent of generative AI. Legal professionals will need to be quick to adapt to this change or be competed out of the profession by more tech-savvy competitors.”

Charting the future of the early-stage venture market with Carta’s CEO,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/08,"

Hello and welcome back to Equity, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines. This is our Wednesday (Thursday, this week) show where we niche down to a single topic and dig deep.

All the cool kids are filling out the Equity listener survey. We want to hear from you! 

This week Alex brought on Carta CEO Henry Ward to chat through the early-stage market with us. We had a grip of data and a sheaf of questions, which were augmented at the last minute with a data dump from Carta itself.
Here’s what we got into:

The current state of the early-stage venture capital market: From Ward’s perspective, the early-stage market is in better shape than many folks think; it’s the later stages of venture capital that are torpid. We also riffed on the quality of startups that are raising today, and how much pain is coming for young tech companies that can’t quite attract more capital.
Carta’s new seed and Series A product: Carta recently announced a mostly automated method for closing early-stage rounds, so we wanted to better understand the economics of the effort — and why it’s more expensive to raise today than it was a few years back — and what the unicorn hopes to achieve from the work.
We ended with a look ahead, and a series of fun closing questions with Ward.

That’s just the high-level summary. We also discussed entrepreneurship more broadly, the importance of LLCs and even how to construct a podcast interview. It was good fun!
We are back Friday with our news roundup. Talk soon!

Deal Dive: Startups can still raise capital — even if it’s for a good cause,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/07/08,"
When venture funding started to slow in 2022, many feared that investors would retreat to where they were comfortable: SaaS companies founded by folks in their network. And any company that wasn’t posting top growth metrics would struggle to secure funding. While this has largely been true, there have been bright spots. Everytable’s recent round is one of them.
The mission-driven food tech startup looks to make healthy prepared food, including wraps and salads, as accessible and affordable as fast-food chains. The startup prices its menu based on where each individual store is located in addition to distributing through a variety of other channels, including branded vending machines and delivery.
On June 27, the startup announced a $25 million Series C-2 round led by Dohmen Impact Investment Fund, which backs for-profit companies building food solutions to enhance human health, in addition to existing investors. This round will help the company expand its retail footprint; Everytable hopes to open up 25 stores in the latter half of 2023.
This deal is notable for a few reasons — none of which being that it got announced amid the mass VC summer exodus at the end of June. Someone is still working!

"So, how are Europe’s startups doing?",Haje Jan Kamps,2023/07/07,"
Welcome to Startups Weekly. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday afternoon.
I’ve been keeping an eye on the European startup ecosystem since well before I moved to the U.S., and today’s report from Creandum about the state of venture investing in Europe gave me pause. This, along with PitchBook’s report of what happened across the pond last year, adds up to a complex picture.
As far as I can see — and as I discussed in my column this week — the ecosystem in Europe continues to be pretty fragmented and immature, and investment across the pond took a 16% dip in 2022 compared to 2021. That isn’t unique to Europe, of course; 2022 was hard across the board, and compared to the years before, there were very few liquidity events across the startup world:
Data from PitchBook shows that exit values in 2022 were dismal. Image Credits: PitchBook
All around, 2022 was a dismal year: We haven’t seen this little M&A and IPO activity since 2016. The total value of exits in 2022 was $71 billion. The year before, it was more than ten times that.
Bad years happen, but I’m going to keep a very close eye on how quickly the VC markets bounce back. My suspicion is that the U.S. venture industry is more resilient in the face of a slow year or two and that LPs are less easily spooked. In other words, it’s going to be telling to see who raises new funds, where, and with what investment theses over the next three to five years.
Health tech is sticking its tongue out, saying aaaaaaaaaah

Spotify co-creator Daniel Ek’s new company raised a $65 million round of funding for his preventative healthcare startup Neko Health — all the more impressive given that this is reportedly the first external round of financing for the Stockholm-based company.
Lightspeed Ventures made its first investment in Africa, backing Berry Health, which aims to bring judgment-free healthcare to a continent where stigma cuts deep and is affecting many.
News of the fresh rounds comes on the heels of a healthy amount of activity in health tech — Public Ventures launched a $100 million impact fund focusing on nascent life science and clean tech startups, particularly in Canada.

It’s handbags at dawn for social media

If you’ve stumbled across the TechCrunch homepage in the past week, then you’ve seen our wall of coverage on the utter drama-fest that is the social media landscape at the moment. Investment giant Fidelity already adjusted down its Reddit valuation a month ago, but Manish reports that it further deepened its valuation cuts for Reddit this week, after the Reddit protest plunges user engagement.
If you look beyond the Reddit dumpster fire for a fraction of a second, the rest of social media is aflame as well. Twitter competitors soar after Musk makes another boneheaded move, and Paul argues that its competitors need to get their act together in order to become a true competitor.
Apropos competitors, Meta’s Twitter competitor Threads went live and quickly passed 2 million downloads in just two hours, and more than 30 million in a day. I know, I didn’t really see it coming either, but TechCrunch compiled an all-your-questions-answered article about Threads. My first impression? The app isn’t great, but Instagram’s network effect is formidable, and Twitter has been screwing up so monumentally since Musk’s acquisition that it may just be all it takes to put the bird app in its grave.
That’s a pass from us, mon frère: Natasha L points out that Meta’s Threads app is a privacy nightmare and that it won’t launch in the EU yet. This follows a report that a bunch of tech giants are having to figure out how to respond to the EU’s rebooted antitrust regime.
Money didn’t bring API-ness: Ivan ponders what’s happening over at Reddit as the social media site braces for life after API changes.
Lawsuits from a parallel universe: Devin reports that a Louisiana judge silenced White House social media talks in a lawsuit that seems pretty wild. He writes, “It’s almost pitiable how desperately the lawsuit peddles its conspiracy theories, making out routine emails to be collusion and [the] removal of rule-violating content as censorship.” So . . . that’s fun.
Take down those tweets: While we’re on the topic of wild court cases, Twitter was trying to wriggle out of a case in India, but the judge didn’t mince words: “Punishment for non-compliance is 7 years imprisonment and unlimited fine.” Needless to say, Twitter’s plea against India’s government was dismissed, although the core of the case is still curious: Twitter has been asked to take down hundreds of accounts and tweets, often for denouncing the Indian government.
Skynet awakens

AI is everywhere, but never has it been so confusingly head scratching as in the case of Humane’s first product: The Ai Pin. The secretive startup has been around since 2018 and has reportedly raised more than $230 million since then — and I can’t for the life of me figure out why this is better than just saying, “Hey, [voice assistant],” into your nearest smart device. Someone, please, explain it to me.
Did I mention that AI is hot? In the past couple of weeks, I had two founders reach out to me for fundraising advice, only to get back to me a couple weeks later with an “lol, I guess we don’t need help; we just got several term sheets.” The right teams are raising formidable amounts of funds as the FOMO sets in among investors. One example is Typeface, which is building generative AI for brands and just announced a $100 million raise at a $1 billion valuation.
On top of that, one of the wilder stories we’ve seen so far was a founder selling its four-month-old “OpenAI for China” play for $234 million. That means the startup gained about $2 million of valuation per day from starting to acquisition. Yowzers.
Incidentally, if someone wants to share some AI-related decks for my Pitch Deck Teardown series, I wouldn’t be mad.
Yes, this is definitely Bobby’s mother. He cannot come to school today: Ingrid reports that Voice.ai raises $6 million as its real-time voice changer approaches 500,000 users.
Hey, robot, you grab the crayons, I’ll make the coffee: Kyle reports that Runway raised $141 million as it builds generative AI tools for content creators.
We can’t measure this, but it’s definitely 10x better: Over on TC+, Software.com co-founders Geoff Stevens and Brett Stevens argue that the productivity boosts developers see by using AI are a bit of smoke and mirrors — not least because nobody seems to agree on how to measure productivity among software developers in the first place.

Bad horndog, no porn for you: Amanda reports that Pornhub blocks access in Mississippi, Virginia and Utah amid changing laws related to mandatory age verification for adult sites.

Go to the site from one of the blocked states, and you’re met with a video where adult performer Cherie DeVille explains why age verification systems are a bad idea.
Working remotely, or not remotely working: On TC+, Becca argues that remote work startups that will last aren’t actually, technically, remote work startups.

"How to identify, interview and hire a head of growth for an early-stage startup",Jonathan Martinez,2023/07/07,"
The waters are never calm when scaling a startup. In fact, they are typically quite choppy. However, by making the correct hire in the head of growth position, you can navigate to shore much more smoothly.
The individual you’re looking for will create and execute growth strategies, manage marketing initiatives and, ultimately, drive revenue. My more informal take on this role is that it’s someone who deeply understands growth fundamentals, has significant expertise in one to two growth pillars and knows how to build an effective team.
I’ll walk you through when and how to hire your head of growth, their archetypes, how this role stands apart from other marketing executive positions, and what to expect from this hire during their first few quarters.
Head of growth archetypes
In my decade of growth marketing, I’ve seen quite a few growth leaders who began at various startups, all possessing varying levels of experience. To make it easier, I’ve grouped these candidates into three major categories, or archetypes:

Generalists: Experience across numerous growth pillars.
Specialists: Deep expertise in one pillar.
Tertiaries: Data, finance/VC, VC or product background.

While I’ve seen members of each category become successful as heads of growth, I strongly advise hiring from either category one or category two for seed to Series B startups.
When building a growth function from zero, it’s vital to have someone who can drive the execution for your early channels and campaigns. When it comes to category three, I’ve only witnessed success after a growth team was already in place, with their efforts centered around optimizing efforts across data analytics and product.
Outside of these three major archetypes, there are two important flavors that are consistent across the groups:

B2B or B2C
Mobile or web

These two flavors can make or break the success of your growth efforts, as their type of marketing is so distinct. Someone coming from an extensive background of web acquisition at a B2B company like Rippling would not be well-suited to run growth at a B2C consumer startup such as Spotify.
Most growth marketers will heavily index in B2B or B2C, as their careers typically stay on that path. However, it’s quite common to see growth marketers who have experience in both mobile and web acquisition, and it’s absolutely acceptable to hire them.
You’ll occasionally find a unicorn who’s a generalist and has experience in B2B, B2C, mobile and web. If you do, recruit them immediately.
Heads of growth come in many flavors. Image Credits: Jonathan Martinez
How to interview
I’m fortunate to have been on both sides of the interview table for head of growth positions, largely at tech B2C startups, so I have a good sense of what makes for amazing interviewees.
Below are example questions to ask and a few case studies I’ve seen work well:
Interview questions:

What are the most important growth metrics for our startup to track?
How would you measure success in our growth efforts?
We’re having issues in our funnel — how would you analyze and optimize?
What do you think our largest growth levers are and why? "
Pitch Deck Teardown: Nokod Security’s $8M seed deck,Haje Jan Kamps,2023/07/07,"
Gone are the days when you needed a developer to build an app for a relatively easy task. No-code and low-code development let you dramatically increase the speed of building and bringing simple (and, sometimes, not-so-simple) apps to market. I swear, half my life is being run by Zapier at the moment: Book a meeting with me, and all sorts of things happen automatically in the background to ensure that our meeting is on the right calendars, is transcribed and the video of the call is stored away and tagged with your company’s name.
The ease of creating apps that low-code and no-code offer has trade-offs, though: In order to work, they need access to some pretty sensitive data. If someone wants access to my data, they could try to hack my email, or they could hack one of the many automations tied to my email accounts. When more and more apps are essentially running on the same underlying architecture and code, they become a very tempting target for hackers and others with nefarious intentions.
Enter Nokod Security, which offers to monitor no-code and low-code apps for security vulnerabilities and mitigate breaches.
The company recently raised $8 million from Acrew Capital, Meron Capital and Flint Capital, and the team was gracious enough to share the (lightly edited) deck they used so we could take a sneaky peek under the hood.

We’re looking for more unique pitch decks to tear down, so if you want to submit your own, here’s how you can do that.

Three things to love
Nokod’s deck has a lot of cool things going on, as well as some stuff that had me pretty confused. As always, I’ll get to my misgivings and OldManYellsAtCloud.gif feedback in just a moment. For now, let’s look at the slides that got me excited.
Give me a T! Give me an E!
Okay, I’m not gonna spell out T-E-A-M in the subhead, but this is an example of a company that knows its strengths. In an early-stage company, a founding team that has an unfair advantage is a straight-up superpower. Nokod has all bases covered on that front:
[Slide 2] Extraordinary founding team. Image Credits: NokodThe two co-founders have both started and exited companies in the cybersecurity space before. That’s a hell of a way to catch an investor’s attention. Relevant experience and successful exits screams “unfair advantage.” Even after just reading this one slide, I was pretty unsurprised that this company successfully raised money.
Apart from the obvious, this slide shows that the founding team understands what’s important in a pitch deck: If you’ve got incredible traction, lead with that. If you don’t, highlight your experienced team.
Well-articulated problem
[Slide 9] An elegant outline of the problem at hand. Image Credits: Nokod.A good fundraising story will have a good explanation of what the problem is and why it might be worth solving. Not everything on this list is well explained. To wit: Do you, without googling, know what PII is, or, indeed, why collection and storage of PII might be a bad thing?
The company could have taken the effort to explain the impact of some of these issues and why low- and no-code apps are particularly vulnerable in these situations, but I get the message in broad strokes: The cost of embracing no-code and low-code is that people might not always know exactly what’s going on, and if something does happen, it can be hard to figure out exactly where the ne’er-do-wells gained entry to a system.
A better go-to-market slide than most
[Slide 16] Let’s sell this thing. Image Credits: Nokod 

			This go-to-market slide has a clear profile of the customer: how they can be reached, what the business model is and where they are geographically. 					


Building a coherent go-to-market strategy can be surprisingly hard. It’s what I end up arguing about with my pitch coaching clients most often. Having some vague, hand-wavy “build it and they will come” theory works when you are focusing on the product, but if you are raising money to acquire customers, you don’t get to shrug and say, “We will figure it out when we get there.” You aren’t getting there. You are raising money to execute, so you are there.
This go-to-market slide has a clear profile of the customer: how they can be reached, what the business model is, where they are geographically and even who the decision-maker is within the business. I’m not sure how many medium-sized companies have a CISO or director of application security. I suspect a lot of the time, these decisions fall to a CTO rather than a dedicated, clearly defined security role.
Still, as an investor, I can look at this and see the outline of a plan. My next question would be: “Okay, talk me through your process. How do you actually land a sale?” The story should be consistent and outline a good sales funnel — something like, “The leads come from X, we reach the decision maker through A, B and C, and then we close the deal 25% of the time. But we suspect we can increase that percentage if we do Y and Z.” An answer like that will pass muster for me, and doubly so if the company already has paying customers and can point to the sales process it used.
In the rest of this teardown, we’ll take a look at three things Nokod could have improved or done differently, along with its full pitch deck!

"TechCrunch+ roundup: J-1 visa details, how to close a Series B in 2023, moving for tax savings",Walter Thompson,2023/07/07,"
Remote-work startups were a hot commodity when the pandemic began, but in the post-vaccine era, many investors and founders are reconsidering their enthusiasm, Rebecca Szkutak reports.
“If I looked at all the companies that are actually categorized as remote work, you’d see this little tip of the iceberg,” said Kevin Spain, a general partner at Emergence Capital. “Below that there are a lot of other companies effectively following and benefiting from that trend.”

Some companies working on hybrid workplace solutions “have pivoted out of the category,” others have reduced staff, and “one virtual office startup recently sold off its IP and transitioned to AI,” wrote Rebecca.
“It’s hard to pin the exact numbers on it,” writes Rebecca, “but there are signs that things aren’t going well for many remote work startups.”

Dear Sophie,
I just found out that I’ve been selected as a trainee in the J-1 exchange program.
I’m currently in the U.S. on a B-1/B-2 visitor visa. The sponsoring company would like me to start in August. I heard it can take several months to change my status to a J-1. Is there a way to get a J-1 faster?
Is there anything I should know about the J-1, particularly if I later decide to stay in the U.S. once the J-1 program ends?

Should you move to a new state for tax savings before selling your startup?

Once an acquisition is in the works, it’s natural for founders to start safeguarding their newfound wealth.
“On a $30 million exit, a founder could save approximately $4.3 million by moving from California to Florida or approximately $4.4 million by moving from New York City to Florida,” writes Peyton Carr, managing director of Keystone Global Partners.
“That’s a lot of incentive to pull up the stakes and head to Miami,” but unless you follow state-level guidelines about where you spend time and generate income, “your move is likely to trigger an audit.”

Prices for Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs have crashed to a two-year low, and Binance, the planet’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, is losing market share as it takes heat from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
In Q2 2023, 382 blockchain and crypto startups received $2.34B in funding, reports Jacquelyn Melinek, who talked to several investors about how they’ve adjusted their expectations.
“The Tiger Globals and Softbanks of the world aren’t going to invest in everything anymore,” said Lasse Clausen, founding partner at 1kx.

If I were a tech investor, there’s no way I’d sign a non-disclosure agreement.
Presumably, I’d be meeting with hundreds of founders each year. Signing an NDA might preclude me from doing another deal with someone else working in a similar space: why would I ever agree to that?
According to Haje Jan Kamps, entrepreneurs should only ask for an NDA when disclosing “the details of your tech with anyone outside your company.”

“We are not taken seriously.”
“It’s impossible that you can be their equal.”
Dominic-Madori Davis interviewed several Black founders in France to learn more about how they’re working around racism and cultural stereotypes to obtain the same opportunities as their white counterparts.
“We’re missing the success stories that can inspire a new generation of entrepreneurs,” said Rodolphe-Emmanuel Hospice, founder of healthcare company Clikodoc.
“There are no real stories about Black founders in France.”

VC Office Hours: Fabrice do Rego on building one of the few Black-led funds in the EU,Dominic-Madori Davis,2023/07/07,"
Before he became one of the few Black fund managers in the EU, Fabrice do Rego had quite a long career in finance. He started off with Lehman Brothers, before moving to stints at Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, and eventually founding M&A advisory firm Valmeon Corporate Finance.
But during all his years analyzing M&A deals and corporations, do Rego rarely saw people who looked like him in that industry. That realization, he tells me, inspired him to start The Blueprint VC with Ibrahim Ouassari to back founders from under-represented backgrounds in France and Belgium.
For do Rego, the logic behind launching The Blueprint is simple: Mixed teams with diverse backgrounds are known to perform well, yet capital allocation to such teams is still low. “There’s a lot of money being left on the table,” he said. So, he decided, literally, to go get that money.
Launched in December 2021, The Blueprint started raising a €25 million fund last January, which the founders hope to invest in 30 companies within the next four years. They’ve already backed two.
The firm likes to invest in mixed teams of diverse origins, mostly focused on gender and ethnicity. The Blueprint focuses on seed and pre-seed rounds, writes checks ranging from €100,000 to €400,000, and has a reserve for follow-on investments. It’s sector-agnostic but does not invest in deep tech or biotech at the moment.
I recently caught up with do Rego to talk about his work with The Blueprint, surviving the venture downturn and the best way to cultivate the next generation of talent in the EU.
(Note: The following interview has been edited lightly for length and clarity.)
TechCrunch: You’ve been raising this €25 million fund for about a year, with a diversity-focused investment thesis on a continent with noted issues regarding equity and inclusion for marginalized groups. What has the process of approaching limited partners been like?
Fabrice do Rego: It has been much more difficult than what I expected.
We have a great team, and I thought with such a team, it would be easy. But we faced some odd times raising the fund, especially with institutions. Their first question was the “pipeline problem” [asking if there was enough diverse talent to fund in France and Belgium].
Another thing that was difficult is the difference between continental Europe and the U.S. or maybe even the U.K. — we don’t yet have a super strong and wealthy community of Black people who are connected to each other. That is something we lack, and when you want to raise the first fund [for something like The Blueprint], that’s the type of LP you need to have for your first millions.
The minimum target size of our fund is €25 million. Anything below that threshold, it’s super hard to have a professional fund. We wanted our first close to be €12 million, and we will probably reduce it to €10 million because we want to deploy as much as possible, fast. "
Web3 games don’t need to highlight blockchain elements to succeed,Jacquelyn Melinek,2023/07/07,"

Blockchain-based games want to go mainstream, but the million-dollar question is: What’s the best way to do it?
According to some web3 game developers, there might not be just one right answer.
To win Web 2.0 audiences over, it appears the industry will have to meet them where they are. To do that, web3 game devs should move web3 components to the back end and avoid promoting games as being based on web3, according to Sumeet Patel, founder of NFT-based algorithmic prediction game Exiled Racers.
That makes sense to me. When using applications, people don’t really care about what’s going on behind the scenes. They just want something that’s easy to use and does what they want it to. While some people may want to understand the technology and dive deep, the majority don’t really care.
“It doesn’t sound good, but gaming doesn’t need blockchain today, but blockchain does need gaming,” said Nicholas Douzinas, business development and growth lead at decentralized gaming platform Ajuna Network.
The global gaming industry is expected to grow from $282 billion in 2023 to $666 billion by 2030, as more people increasingly choose video games as their primary form of entertainment, and 4G-enabled smartphones enable people everywhere to indulge in mobile games, according to a report by Fortune Business Insights.
But blockchain gaming wasn’t even mentioned as a trend or driving factor for gaming growth. I think that’s fair because it’s such a small fraction of the market and has a long way to go before it can even make a dent in the industry.
“NFTs mean nothing to gaming; some people don’t care about ownership,” said Douzinas. But on the other side of the spectrum, some people want to engage deeply with web3 technology, he noted.
Ajuna Network aims to attract people who are interested in web3 technology and blockchains but are comfortable with owning a token and the possibilities that come with it, Douzinas said.
Not all gaming companies are taking that route. "

SVB’s collapse drove 26K customers to Mercury in 4 months,Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/07/07,"
When Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March, a flurry of startups rushed to step in to help fill a gap in the startup and venture capital community.
One of those startups, Mercury, in particular found itself in the position of trying to meet a sudden surge of demand amidst the panic.
“The craziest time was the first five days,” recalls CEO and co-founder Immad Akhund. “It started Wednesday night — where it was very stressful and not just from Mercury’s perspective, but all of Silicon Valley was holding their breath. People were worried about what was going to happen next.”
Akhund says he spent most of his time those first few days on calls and responding to direct messages from existing and potentially new customers.
“People were very stressed and saying ‘I need a bank account now,’” he says. “Every question had this urgency.”
In response, Mercury — working with partner banks Choice Financial Group and Evolve Bank & Trust — upped its FDIC insurance, first from $1 million to $3 million and then to $5 million. It also released a new product called Vault, so people could park their cash beyond those amounts into U.S. government treasury bills.
Still, one of the questions that kept coming up, according to Akhund, was, “If SVB is failing, why is Mercury safe?” The question was fair, in his view, considering that Mercury itself is a startup.
In the first few days after the collapse, the company saw more than $2 billion in deposits. And in all of March, Mercury saw nearly 8,700 new customers depositing funds into its accounts.
“It was by far our biggest month we’ve had at Mercury, a huge inflow,” Akhund recalls. “We tried to prioritize people coming from SVB and even built some tools so they could connect to SVB accounts.”
But it wasn’t a short-term boom, something that Akhund was worried about.
The company claims that 95% of its net new customers have stayed with Mercury nearly 90 days out from the SVB crisis and that those deposits have held steady. Also, that new customer growth has continued even after the SVB crisis has settled, with the company having doubled new signups per month since April — leading to 17,000 total new customers depositing funds from April to June, a figure that Akhund shared with TechCrunch exclusively. Its total customer base includes businesses such as including Deel, On Deck, Linear, Sprig and Forage. The company says it crossed the 100,000 customer mark in 2022.
That recent surge of customers has contributed to the company’s annualized revenue run rate growing 4x year-over-year from May 2022 to May 2023, Akhund told TechCrunch. Overall, in 2022, Mercury processed $50 billion in transactions. In the first half of 2023 alone, the company has processed more than $42 billion in transactions. Mercury also, he said, has been profitable for the last 12 months. He declined to say how many customers the company specifically has today, saying only that it is “over 100,000.”
Further, according to data obtained from Kruze Consulting, more than 30% of Kruze’s clients now have a Mercury account, up from 17% at the end of February — the highest share of any neobank or bank, according to Mercury.
While Mercury is open to any U.S. business, its focus is on startups and e-commerce companies, which make up 70% of its customer base. Startups in particular, Mercury touts, have unique needs that many claim big banks are unable to adequately meet.
“We were already growing and we saw an approximately 20% jump because of what happened with SVB,” Akhund said. “It’s obviously kind of been an inflection point, and we’ve kind of sped up after this.”
Since its 2017 inception, Mercury has raised over $163 million in funding from investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, Coatue and CRV as well as angel investors, athletes, entertainers and customers. Its last round was a $120 million Series B that was announced in July of 2021.
I dug into all these details and much more with Akhund on Equity Podcast, which you can listen to here.

Reporter’s note: The story was updated post-publication to correct the number of customers that Mercury has.

Google’s Gradient Ventures backs Weflow to bring greater hygiene to Salesforce data,Paul Sawers,2023/07/07,"
Google’s venture capital arm Gradient Ventures has made another foray into Europe, investing as part of a $3.2 million seed round in two-year-old German startup Weflow.
Weflow is the latest in a line of ecosystem startups to emerge from frustrations with using the omnipresent CRM (customer relationship management) software that is Salesforce. These venture-backed upstarts focus on things like providing data backups or improving lead generation, while just last week a new company called Unaric emerged out of stealth with $35 million for the express purpose of buying and consolidating Salesforce-ecosystem startups.
Yes, Salesforce-focused tools are big business, with some estimates pegging the market value at four times that of Salesforce itself.
Weflow, for its part, is setting out to improve sales teams’ efficiency, pipeline visibility and general “Salesforce data hygiene,” according to Weflow co-founder and CEO Janis Zech, who likens his platform to something akin to “Notion for revenue teams.”
“[The main problem we solve is] helping companies to forecast their pipeline accurately — this typically requires capturing sales data, both structured and unstructured, surfacing deal insights and pipeline analytics to run forecast predictions,” Zech explained to TechCrunch.
Show me the data
The ultimate problem that Weflow seeks to fix is that of the sheer spread of data across the B2B sales sphere, spanning the countless meetings, emails and calls leading to a deal’s conclusion. Weflow promises to bring this data together within a coherent structure to deliver insights.
To do this, Weflow has developed what it calls a “revenue workspace,” pitched as an all-encompassing platform that allows companies to capture CRM data while serving up deal insights and tools for managing their sales pipeline. More recently, the company introduced collaborative forecasting and pipeline analytics, too.
Under the hood, Weflow uses AI to allocate what it calls a “deal score,” which is effectively a prediction that considers things like buying signals, sales activities and historical data to forecast the likelihood of a deal closing. In the future, Zech says the platform will also lean on AI to forecast future revenues, as well as leverage unstructured email data and even video/call transcripts to uncover hidden deal insights.

‘Salesforce fatigue’
Although Zech and his two co-founders, Henrik Basten and Philipp Stelzer, launched Weflow in 2021, the Berlin-based startup has been years in the making, built on frustrations Zech experienced at an adtech startup he founded in 2009 called Fyber (then known as SponsorPay).
“Experiencing severe ‘Salesforce fatigue’ at Fyber, we realized CRMs have become clunky infrastructure, not places to effectively work on deals and drive sales performance,” Zech said. “It’s a problem that affects most companies’ top lines.”
Zech eventually sold Fyber for €150 million in 2014, and in the intervening years he invested both as an angel and partner at Point Nine Capital. More recently, he co-founded a startup studio that birthed a company called Back, which Gradient Ventures also invested in before it was acquired by Personio last May.
As for Weflow, there are clear similarities to other tools on the market already, including venture-backed Salesforce ecosystem company Scratchpad, and revenue forecasting unicorn Clari. According to Zech, Weflow’s main selling point over incumbents in the space include per-user pricing transparency (e.g. Clari seemingly only offers a “get quote” button, while Scratchpad invites would-be customers to “schedule a demo”). Additionally, Weflow offers workflow tools such as a task manager, notepad and a Chrome extension to easily integrate with Gmail and Google Calendar.
The Google factor
Securing Google’s VC off-shoot as a lead backer is a major coup for any young startup, opening doors to potential new partners and customers, among other commercial benefits.
While the lion’s share of Gradient’s investments hail from the U.S., it’s no stranger to the European startup scene. Last month, we learned it had invested in Versed, a Dutch startup developing tools to help anyone create video games using generative AI. And last year it backed U.K. insurance tech startup Penny, as well as Germany’s Gigs, which wants to make it easier to launch a mobile network.
Prior to all this, Gradient has also invested in Denmark’s Contractbook, Kaizo from the Netherlands, Finland’s Oura and, as noted, Germany’s Back Technologies.
Prior to now, Weflow had raised $2.7 million in pre-seed funding back in 2021; with its fresh cash injection it said that it’s looking to further invest in its AI efforts, bringing it to other areas of its platform.
Aside from lead investor Gradient Ventures, Weflow’s seed round included contributions from existing investor Cherry Ventures, Hello World and several angel investors.

SpeedyBrand uses generative AI to create SEO-optimized content,Kyle Wiggers,2023/07/07,"
While working at Vetan, a startup helping small- and medium-sized (SMBs) businesses manage employee payroll, Ranti Dev Sharma realized that SMBs often lack the tools to thrive online with organic sales. The cost to hire an agency is beyond their budget, and generating content is costly — both in terms of time and money.
“Having a great online presence is critical for e-commerce stores like Shopify and Woo, as online traffic is the bread and butter of their business,” Sharma told TechCrunch in an email interview. “But existing content marketing solutions are not complete and require search engine optimization (SEO) expertise. Businesses need multiple SEO tools and to hire content strategists, writers and agencies to outsource their content marketing work.”
So along with Jatin Mehta and Ayush Jasuja, Sharma co-founded SpeedyBrand, which aims to bring “high-quality,” affordable SEO content to SMBs using generative AI. SpeedyBrand today announced that it raised $2.5 million in a funding round led by GV (Google’s venture arm) and Y Combinator that values the company at $15 million post-money.
SpeedyBrand’s platform, powered by generative AI, can create custom SEO-optimized content — including websites and social media posts — for brands. Brands first choose a topic. Then they have the platform generate text and suggest images that might be appropriate for the type of content they’re generating.
From SpeedyBrand’s dashboard, generated content can be edited and further customized before being published to various channels. An analytics component allows brands to track the performance of the content once it’s live.
“The economic slowdown requires cost-effective marketing solutions,” Sharma said. “Speedy is well-positioned to help businesses with an affordable solution.”
But there’s reason to be wary of the tech.
For one, generative AI, no matter how good, can — and does — run amok. Thanks to a phenomenon known as “hallucination,” AI models sometimes confidently make up facts. And, as a result of biases and other imbalances in their training data, text-generating AI can spew toxic, wildly offensive remarks.
In another potential problem for brands, generative AI has been shown to plagiarize copyrighted work. One study found that an indirect predecessor to ChatGPT, GPT-2, can be prompted to “copy and paste” entire paragraphs from its training data.
Then there’s the matter of generative AI spamming up the internet. As The Verge’s James Vincent wrote in a recent piece, generative AI models are changing the economy of the web — making it cheaper and easier to generate lower-quality content. Newsguard, a company that provides tools for vetting news sources, has exposed hundreds of ad-supported sites with generic-sounding names featuring misinformation created with generative AI.
Sharma asserts that SpeedyBrand isn’t a content mill — and that it takes steps to mitigate any toxic content that the platform’s AI might generate. SpeedyBrand’s AI can be personalized to brand tone and generates provably “plagiarism-free” content, he claims, incorporating feedback from content edits to improve future output.
To what extent is all this true? It’s tough to say without a third-party audit. But brands, no doubt eager to jump on the generative AI train, appear to be embracing SpeedyBrand.
The company, which has a six-person team, has around 50 paying customers and over 1,000 users. Annual recurring revenue stands at $100,000, and Sharma anticipates that it’ll reach $1 million in the next year.
That’s impressive considering the competition. SpeedyBrand faces off against Typeface, which recently emerged from stealth with $65 million in venture capital. Startups like Movio, Copysmith, Copy.ai, Sellscale, Jasper, Omneky and Regie.ai, too, are using generative AI to create (ostensibly) better marketing copy, imagery and even video for ads, websites and emails.
It’s a large and growing market. Statista reports that 87% of current AI adopters are already using, or considering using, AI for improving their email marketing. Another report projects that the market for generative AI will be worth more than $110 billion by 2030.
Given that almost half of SMB owners handle content marketing themselves, there’s even stronger incentive within that cohort to adopt tools that could — at least on the surface — save time, money and massive headache.
“Speedy saves a company’s marketing workforce hours of marketing hustle — from strategy to content generation and then posting,” Sharma said. “Speedy gives them and their team hours back every day so they can focus on the core of their business.”
With the proceeds from the funding round, SpeedyBrand plans to roll out additional tools for text and image generation.

Indonesian aquaculture startup eFishery nets $200M at unicorn valuation,Catherine Shu,2023/07/07,"
After reports that it is raising new funding, Indonesian aquaculture startup eFishery announced today that it has netted $200 million in a Series D. The company, which makes a smart feeding system for fisheries, says this makes it the first startup in the global aquaculture industry to pass a $1 billion valuation. Its goal is to reach one million aquaculture ponds in Indonesia by 2025 and expand overseas.
The funding was led by Abu Dhabi-based 42XFund and included participation from Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (Diperbadankan), Malaysia’s largest public sector pension fund, Swiss asset manager responsibility and 500 Global. Existing investors Northstar, Temasek and SoftBank also returned for the round, with Goldman Sachs acting as an exclusive financial advisor to eFishery. TechCrunch last covered the startup when it announced its $90 million Series C in January 2022.
eFishery cites a study by the Demographic Institute of the University of Indonesia (LDUI) that showed in 2022, eFishery contributed 1.55% to Indonesia’s gross domestic product in the aquaculture sector. This is significant because Indonesia has the second largest fishing and aquaculture industry in the world, ranking only behind China. According to the World Atlas, the country produces 5.8 million tons of fish each year.
Founded in Bandung, West Java in 2013 by CEO Gibran Huzaifah (pictured above), the fishery currently serves 70,000 fish and shrimp farmers in 280 cities across Indonesia. In addition to its IoT auto feeding system, eFishery’s platform includes marketplaces for selling fish and shrimp feed to farmers, fresh fish and shrimp products to B2B consumers and financial products for fish farmers.
Huzaifah started a catfish farming business when he was still in college. He told TechCrunch that during that time, he learned that feed management is crucial because 80% of total cost production is allocated to feeding. But many farmers still do hand feeding, resulting in uneven sizes of fish because not all get the same amount of food.
This is a problem because buyers have specific sizes of fish they want to purchase. Underfeeding isn’t the only problem, however — overfeeding results in nutrient runoff that pollutes water.
Huzaifah saw how tech was disrupting sectors like commerce, financial services and media, but “fish farming practice never changed in the last 30 years. I found it quite ironic that many innovations are developed to solve issues for urban citizens, like online shopping and food deliveries, but the essential sectors, such as agriculture and aquaculture, see almost zero digital innovation.”
After developing eFishery’s smart feeding system, however, Huzaifah faced resistance from fish farmers. After months of convincing them, “they finally wanted to try, not because they believed in the technology but because they pitied me.” One reason was that many farmers were not regular internet users. “I remember we had this Internet 101 with the farmers,” Huzaifah said. “We showed them how to create an email, use Facebook, get information from YouTube and other stuff.”
Even though Indonesia’s aquaculture is already very large, Huzaifah said it has only reached 7% to 9% of its total potential. Some challenges it faces includes fragmentation. Huzaifah explains that Indonesia has 34 provinces with different business practices, so it has to localize for each one.
“I learned the hard way that we have to respect the local players, including using local dialect and building relationships with the middlemen,” he said. “In one case, some middlemen poisoned our ponds. After having a discussion with them, we understood that they just want to do business, that they’re also entrepreneurs. So we found a way to turn them into our local partners because they have the local wisdom, connections assets and so on.”
At farms, feeding accounts for 70% to 90% of total production cost and much of it is still done manually, just as when Huzaifah was running his catfish farm. eFisheryFeeder automatically distributes feed to fish and shrimp and helps farmers control feed by sensing fish appetite through vibrations, which increase as they get hungry. The system allows farmers to manage ponds from their smartphones and collects data like daily fish usage, the type and brand of feed, how many fish have been produced, fish behavior and appetite, stock density and mortality rate.
With aquaculture so important to Indonesia’s economy, other tech startups are addressing different aspects of the industry. In addition to eFishery, startups that have recently raised funding include Aruna, Delos and FishLog.
In order to improve Indonesia’s aquaculture industry and increase the amount of fish it exports, Hazaifah said communities, the government and institutions have to work together to improve fishery operation infrastructure so they can handle larger volumes of fish and improve product quality.
The country should encourage sustainable aquaculture practices, like training, promoting advanced techniques and ensuring access to quality fish seed, to increase fish production, and also engage in trade negotiations to get more buyers. efishery plans to expand overseas by exporting fully traceable, antibiotic-free shrimp.
In a statement about the funding, 42XFund principal Iman Adiwibowo said, “The technology and comprehensive aquaculture solutions provided by eFishery have made a significant impact on the aquatech industry and have benefited small farmers in Indonesia. We are confident that eFishery will continue to promote a sustainable and inclusive economy, as well as contribute to environmental preservation goals not only in Indonesia but beyond.”

"Deel under fire for alleged questionable hiring practices, advice to other companies",Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/07/06,"
A California Senator is urging the state’s Labor and Workforce Development Agency to conduct an investigation into the business practices of fintech turned HR startup Deel.
Last week, Senator Steve Padilla (D-San Diego) sent a letter to Stewart Knox, California Secretary of Labor, alleging that Deel has hired hundreds of employees but classified them as independent contractors. By doing so, Senator Padilla charged, Deel is “effectively denying them the full suite of employment and social safety net benefits and labor protections they are entitled to, including healthcare, retirement, unemployment insurance, worker’s compensation, collective bargaining, and overtime pay.”
Further, Senator Padilla claimed that Deel “appears” to be advising its own customers (which include the likes of Nike, Subway, Reebok, Forever 21 and Klarna) “to misclassify their own employees and evade taxes in California,” as well as avoid paying employee benefits. Earlier this month, according to Padilla, Deel CEO Alex Bouaziz encouraged companies to leverage “the different ways of employing someone or assigning them as an independent contractor…..and therefore don’t put as much tax liability into your company.” He also encouraged companies to “spend some time on this topic” and offered to provide this as a service, stating “we can do that for you.” 
TechCrunch reached out to Deel for comment and Elisabeth Diana, a company spokesperson, provided the following statement:
“These allegations are completely made up and regurgitated from old news, most likely based on competitor hearsay. Compliance is literally what we do, in over 120 countries. We have to understand it for our customers, and we certainly practice it ourselves. Today we have over 50 compliance experts in house and an external network of country advisors. To advise clients on how to misclassify their workers would be at complete odds with our business model. We’ve also created a consortium with external academics called the Deel Lab for Global Employment to study and help prevent misclassification practices. In California we engage a handful of contractors for services, and in the US, contractors represent less than 1% of our workforce. Claims of misclassification there are ridiculous. Unfortunately Senator Padilla did not reach out to us for comment or facts prior to publishing his letter. We welcome speaking with him directly to provide factual information.”
The spotlight on Deel’s hiring practices came to light earlier this year when Insider published an article revealing, among other things, that even CEO and co-founder Alex Bouaziz was classified as an independent contractor. According to Senator Padilla, several employees “have reported being shocked to learn they had been hired as long–term contractors despite originally applying as full-time employees, and without the ability to choose.” Senator Padilla’s office told TechCrunch that the politician has asked for an investigation to determine if the practices mentioned in the article are accurate.
Many of the company’s employees, he said, have access to a range of benefits, including unlimited paid-time off, wellness stipends and reimbursements for gym memberships and doctor’s appointments. But, Senator Padilla alleged, they “continue to be denied the full suite of employment and social safety net benefits and labor protections they are entitled to, including healthcare, retirement, unemployment insurance, worker’s compensation, collective bargaining, and overtime pay, among others.”
“No company is above the law. Deel has been openly flaunting their violation of California labor laws, intentionally misclassifying their employees as independent contractors and denying them critical benefits,” said Senator Padilla in a press release. “California is clear on this issue; employees are entitled to benefits and protections. Corporations engaging in malicious employment schemes like this need to be held accountable and these employees need to see their rights restored.”
In January, TechCrunch reported that Deel had reached $295 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) by the end of 2022 and that it was profitable, according to Bouaziz. The startup, which offers global payroll and other services to companies around the world, was valued at $12 billion at the time of its last raise, although its current valuation is not known. It operates with a SaaS business model, meaning that it charges a subscription fee for its software.
Bouaziz and Shuo Wang started remote-first, San Francisco-based Deel in 2019 as an employer of record (EOR) — with the mission of allowing businesses to hire employees and contractors in other countries “in less than five minutes.” Deel also says that it gives companies the ability to pay teams in more than 150 currencies with “just a click.” It has since evolved its strictly fintech model to what it describes as a “full-stack,” “truly global HR platform” designed “to compliantly manage your entire workforce in just one system—from direct employees to international workers and everything in between.” It has more than 2,000 employees in 90 countries. 
Senator Dave Cortese (D-San Jose), chair of the Senate Labor, Public Employment and Retirement Committee, stated that an independent contractor is “a specific designation for self-employed people or businesses engaged in contract work.”
He added: “It’s not a gimmick for organizations to avoid paying for employee healthcare and other benefits or reducing their tax liability…Any company found breaking the law will be brought to justice, and they would certainly have no business advising other companies on labor law.”
Reporter’s note: TechCrunch was informed after this article was published that  Stewart Knox, California Secretary of Labor, had responded to Senator Pedilla’s letter with his own letter saying: “I take seriously the responsibility to ensure that workers receive their earned pay and benefits and that law-abiding employers compete on a level playing field. We are looking into the information that you provided and will follow up with our findings.”

So, how are Europe’s startups doing?
Pitch Deck Teardown: Nokod Security’s $8M seed deck



Whenever I spend time in the European startup world, a lot of the conversation is focused on how it can differentiate itself. One of the recurring questions is: How do we build a startup ecosystem? That’s an excellent question.
The beginnings of an ecosystem are there, but unlike in the U.S., where there are a handful of major hubs attracting the bulk of the talent and investment, in Europe, there is an appetite for experimentation that fails to fully settle into a coherent whole.
Looking to Silicon Valley might be a trope, but the San Francisco Bay Area is by far the most mature ecosystem around. California attracted more than $100 billion of venture investment in 2022. New York is in a distant second place with around $30 billion, followed by Massachusetts (or more specifically, Boston), with around $20 billion. Europe, in comparison, saw around $100 billion of investment in 2022. That sounds like a big number, but compare the size of the economy of Europe versus that of California.
Europe may be in a state of rapid growth, but as an asset class, VC is lagging behind. For every person living in Europe, $134 dollars are invested in the local ecosystem. For California, the same number is $2,650. Image Credit: Haje Kamps / TechCrunch
You can find office buildings and fast internet in most places, so how did a sprawling area around San Francisco become a working ecosystem? The history is long and complex, and hard to replicate: Stanford University engineering professor Frederick Terman was focusing on radio engineering in the 1940s. Fueled by the Cold War and a lot of defense money, he built a department and taught a bunch of the people who would found the first wave of tech startups in the area.
Stanford created a business park to go along with its research activities, and it kept evolving with the times. The region found itself in an upward spiral: More money invested meant that more engineering talent flocked to Silicon Valley, which sparked more innovation, which led to more tech companies, which in turn meant more defense money and the first few private investors looking to Silicon Valley for opportunities. Lockheed opened a plant in Sunnyvale, mostly because that’s where it could find engineers. Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard founded HP in 1939, and Shockley Semiconductors was founded in 1956 — the same year its namesake, William Shockley, was awarded the Nobel Prize for co-inventing the transistor. Early employees at Shockley left to found AMD and Intel, and from there, the rest is history: Silicon Valley had such a concentration of funds, talent and tech, that it was almost unstoppable.
Fast-forward some 70 years and Silicon Valley has only continued to grow. For startups, the way this shows up is that a lot of people got very wealthy from tech, and they further accelerated the ecosystem by founding new companies. But — crucially — they also became angel investors and advisers to others in the ecosystem. And because those acquiring other businesses are also often based in Silicon Valley, integrating the tech and the staff becomes a lot easier.
So how does this relate to Europe? Well, according to top European VC Creandum’s recent report, there are 65 cities hosting 514 “tech hubs” on the continent. Of course, it’s positive that the European startup scene is evolving and growing, but even after a couple decades of trying to make ecosystems thrive, Europe appears to be spinning its wheels. According to the report, “Europe finally has the pieces in place to challenge the US as the world’s leading tech ecosystem.” It sounds good, but there’s still a lot of work to be done before there’s a fully functioning, self-sustaining startup ecosystem in place. The truth is, every locale is trying to do it differently. That means there can’t be a single, force-of-nature strength ecosystem; instead, the result is a smattering of promising ecosystems that don’t truly get the job done.

15 investors lift the lid on the biggest surprises of H1 2023,Karan Bhasin,2023/07/06,"
The first half of 2023 hasn’t been kind to startups, but venture capital investors weren’t spared migraines either. Some VCs had a tough time of it, with their portfolio companies finding it hard to fundraise, while others dialed back their investment cadence to match the current investment climate. But what would they have done differently if they had a crystal ball? To find out, we asked 15 investors what they found to be the most unexpected trends of the year so far.
Rather unsurprisingly, the biggest surprises all seem to be related to AI in one way or another. Several investors said while they were caught unawares by how quickly generative AI took off, the real eyebrow-raiser was VC funds going from a conservative stance to jumping headfirst into AI-related companies’ cap tables seemingly overnight.
“The No. 1 surprise has been the speed of financings and valuations in the generative AI space. Probably no surprise there. But it really is a tale of ‘haves and have-nots’ in fundraising right now,” said Matt Murphy, partner at Menlo Ventures.

We’re looking for founders to participate in a TechCrunch+ survey about the usefulness of various founder-focused events.
If you’re a founder and have something to share about your experiences at such events, fill out this form.

Jenny He, founder and general partner at Position Ventures, had a similar take: “I was surprised at how quickly the AI boom happened in 2023 and how many top tier firms went from a wait and see approach at the end of 2022 to becoming very active in 2023. Some of our portfolio companies went from quiet insider rounds to very hot competitive rounds at a rapid markup at the beginning of 2023, spurred by the AI boom.”
Not all AI-related surprises were positive, though. John Tough, managing partner at Energize Ventures, was baffled by how readily some firms cannibalized their climate funds to buy into AI. “We knew generalist investor interest in climate was fleeting, but it has still been surprising to see how many household names planned to launch a climate focus area and then moved along to LLMs and AI instead,” he said.
For Rajeev Dham, partner at Sapphire Ventures, this rapid increase in AI investment also brought some worries. “There’s no question that advancements in AI will spawn an incredible set of companies, disrupt industries and be the transformative technology that drives far more productivity within existing companies, but my concern is that we’re still in the very first inning, which will lead to a lot of lost capital,” he said.
It wasn’t all about AI, though. Mark Grace, an investor at M13, was surprised by the range of early-stage valuations: “Valuation ranges are all over the place, especially at the Series A stage. We all know how quiet the later stages have been, and the seed market has seemed strangely resilient. However it has been interesting to see the wide variance in Series A pricing.”
As for what investors wish they’d done differently, several felt they should have been faster on the uptake and more active than they were. “In macro environments like this one you always regret not being more active while everyone else was fearful,” said Logan Allin, managing partner and founder at Fin Capital. “These cycles only come around so often and are a boon for net-new investments in portfolios.”
Jason Lemkin, CEO and founder of SaaStr, wishes he had taken the time to meet with more founders. “I slowed down in 2022 as did many, and should have picked it up more. Multiples are still relatively low in SaaS but great companies are being formed as often as ever.”
But our favorite answer to this question by far came from Howie Diamond, managing director and general partner at Pure Ventures: “Not have personally invested in First Republic Bank stock!”

We’re curious if you’ve run into any surprises in the startup investing world thus far in 2023.

The No. 1 surprise has been the speed of financings and valuations in the generative AI space. Probably no surprise there. But, it really is a tale of “haves” and “have-nots” in fundraising right now.
The No. 2 surprise is the scarcity of later-stage companies raising. It’s not that surprising, but behind the scenes, companies are still getting their houses in order, and it’s really difficult to sell right now, so companies are grinding through things until they find more predictability.
No. 3 would be the amount of M&A and companies trying to be acquired. We’re only going to see that accelerate.
In hindsight, what do you wish you had done differently in the first six months of 2023?
We mobilized the entire firm around GenAI and it paid off. We’ve got a strong portfolio and continue to invest. We’ve even got a handful of investors who are attending hackathons and coding in their free time. I only wish we’d started building that pipeline more purposefully in 2022. So many of these businesses are being started by founders leaving companies with pockets of AI talent, so you really need to be focused upstream on founders before there is even a full twinkle in the eye. We have been doing a great job of this so far, and really doubled down on Menlo’s Future Founders program this year.

We’re curious if you’ve run into any surprises in the startup investing world thus far in 2023.
Startup investing in 2023 has been defined by difficult macroeconomic headwinds on one hand and accelerating AI tailwinds on the other. The dichotomy has created a startup investing environment of haves and have-nots that has been quite interesting and, to some extent, surprising.
I’m surprised that the AI conversation is not centered more on the potential of AI for good. There are intractable problems that society has yet to solve where AI could offer a breakthrough. Technology has a history of presenting these types of breakthroughs and thus has been a harbinger of optimism.
AI is no different, and I see education as a prime example of where AI could offer every child individualized instruction that addresses their style of learning, pacing needs, and adaptive modalities. This could advance education practices for all learners and provide the inalienable right to education for all offered by a good society.
I’m obsessed with thinking through these types of scenarios and working on them, as AI will offer many breakthroughs for the world.
In hindsight, what do you wish you had done differently in the first six months of 2023?
While we spent time on it, we wish we had spent even more time with academics and researchers at top-tier institutions focused on AI. We believe a good subset of the AI generation’s decacorns will originate from deep technical research, much of which is in academic research labs today.

Should you move to a new state for tax savings before selling your startup?,Peyton Carr,2023/07/06,"

How much tax will you owe when you sell your company?
With a Section 1045 rollover, founders can salvage QSBS before 5 years



For company founders and shareholders with an exit on the horizon, this isn’t a myth — a move for tax reasons can make a lot of financial sense.
In tech hubs like the Bay Area and New York City, the highest tax brackets are at 14.4% (as of January 1, 2024) and 14.8%, respectively. In contrast, states like Florida and Texas have no state income tax, meaning there’s no capital gains tax at the state level.
Let’s consider the numbers: On a $30 million exit, a founder could save approximately $4.3 million by moving from California to Florida or approximately $4.4 million by moving from New York City to Florida. That’s a lot of incentive to pull up the stakes and head to Miami.
However, many times it’s not that simple. We all know that moving can be a tough decision, especially for those with strong roots in their community. Leaving behind your favorite golf course, local ski mountain, and your friend group can have a serious impact on your quality of life. And it can be heart-wrenching to pull your kids away from the home, friends, and school they know and love.
This is where some people can get into trouble.
What you need to know about moving to save on taxes
Paying less in taxes isn’t as simple as packing up, skipping town, and resurfacing with a new address in a tax-friendlier state.
As tempting as it may be, you can’t keep a foothold in Silicon Valley while dipping your toe in the Gulf Coast — and still save on taxes. The kids may be unable to stay in their Manhattan private school while you relocate to Miami.
 

			As tempting as it may be, you can’t keep a foothold in Silicon Valley while dipping your toe in the Gulf Coast — and still save on taxes.					


Living in both states won’t save you here; when it comes to taxes, you must be all-in at your new address, or you’ll likely owe taxes at your old address.  Unfortunately, some may not realize this until after they have spent a lot of time, money, and emotional investment.
Every state has its own rules for determining your residency for tax purposes, and you will not be able to fly under the radar if you’re a high-net-worth individual or top earner. High-tax states like New York or California pay especially close attention to those in the highest tax bracket. If you stop paying taxes at the state level, chances are the state will notice and challenge your new residency claim.
In other words, your move is likely to trigger an audit.
In particular, California’s Franchise Tax Board is known to be vigilant in monitoring individuals who attempt to terminate their California residence, making it all the more crucial to thoroughly plan and document your move.
Additionally, it’s important to consider the complexities of community property laws, which may impact your tax exposure if you have a spouse residing in California, even if you move to a lower-tax state. Proper legal and tax advice is essential to navigate these complexities and ensure a smooth transition.
Many people mistakenly think that splitting time between states and claiming the more favorable tax jurisdiction is easy. But when you have the means to travel and maintain more than one home, this doesn’t mean you get to choose the domicile that works most favorably for you when tax time comes. Simply spending 183 days of the year outside your high-tax state isn’t likely going to shrink your tax obligation.
Even after leaving high-tax states like New York or California, it’s important to be aware of potential tax obligations tied to passive income sources within those states. For example, if you continue to have passive income from partnerships, investment properties, or other sources within New York or California, you’ll need to file a nonresident return and pay taxes on that income in those states.
Additionally, having passive income sources in your former state can increase the likelihood of a residency audit. As a result, it’s important to carefully consider whether retaining those investments producing state-specific income aligns with your overall financial and tax planning goals.
Preparing to move
If you’re considering a move to a lower-tax state, it’s crucial to plan ahead and be prepared. The more time you give yourself before your company’s exit, the better off you’ll be. We recommend making a clean break from your high-tax state several years in advance to ensure a smooth transition. It’s also wise to assume that you may be subject to a state tax audit, so keep meticulous records and be prepared. "
Is political unrest taking a toll on Israeli startups?,Anna Heim,2023/07/06,"
Now that the first half of 2023 is officially behind us, we are going to get a flurry of data on VC investment around the world. This will allow us to paint a global picture and zoom in on countries where specific factors might be at play.
Today, we are looking at Israel by way of a new report from Israeli VC firm Viola. It offers data on how much capital Israeli startups raised in H1 and how that compares to previous years. But its authors also venture a few hypotheses on the reasons behind this decline.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

Both on my mind and on Viola’s, of course, is the political crisis Israel finds itself in since the beginning of 2023.
After the Netanyahu government announced its intent to overhaul the country’s judicial system and balance of powers, a series of anti-government protests have continued across the country.
Israel’s tech ecosystem didn’t stay out of the political unrest; entrepreneurs and investors have become key players behind anti-government protests. And more generally, concerns have emerged on the damage that could be done to the country’s economy, of which the tech sector accounts for a significant part.
With this in mind, let’s look at the data compiled by Viola to see how VC investment into Israel fared this year so far — unfavorably — and what might explain its decline.
It’s not looking good
With a provisional tally of $3.2 billion for the first half of the year, funding activity in Israel dropped by 73% compared to the same period in 2022, IVC data shows.
PitchBook data interpreted by Viola reveals a 50% year-on-year decline globally, meaning that Israel fared worse than the rest of the world. And $3.2 billion is also less than Israeli tallies in years prior to 2022.
Unsurprisingly, Israeli startups raised less in the first six months of this year than in the same period of 2021 ($13 billion). In the country, like elsewhere, 2021 was an outlier. But H1 2023 also falls short of H1 2020’s $5.7 billion total. It also fails to meet pre-pandemic levels; in H1 2018 and H1 2019, Israeli startups collectively raised $3.7 billion and $4.7 billion, respectively.
Breaking down the data by stage reveals that the latest and largest rounds are the most affected. The amount of capital that Israeli startups raised through mega-rounds fell by 80% compared to the first half of 2022; growth rounds amounted to 71% less year-on-year; and early-stage rounds saw a 56% decline.

DigitalOcean acquires cloud computing startup Paperspace for $111M in cash,Kyle Wiggers,2023/07/06,"
DigitalOcean, the cloud hosting business, today announced that it’s agreed to acquire Paperspace, a New York-based cloud computing and AI development startup, for $111 million in cash.
DigitalOcean CEO Yancey Spruill says that Paperspace’s infrastructure and tooling, once integrated with DigitalOcean’s products, will enable customers to more easily test, develop and deploy AI applications. As for Paperspace customers, they’ll benefit from DigitalOcean’s cloud services, he says — including databases, storage, app hosting, documentation, tutorials and a robust support system.
For now, Paperspace will remain a standalone business unit within DigitalOcean, and Paperspace customers won’t see immediate changes to their service.
“We’re excited to expand our portfolio tailored to the world’s small- and medium-sized (SMBs) businesses and startups with simplified AI and machine learning offerings,” Spruill said in a press release. “The combined offerings allow customers to focus more on building applications and growing their businesses and less on the infrastructure powering them.”
Paperspace was co-founded in 2014 by Daniel Kobran and Dillon Erb, graduates of the University of Michigan. Backed by Y Combinator and Jeff Carr, one of the co-founders of DigitalOcean, the company runs its own datacenters with custom-configured GPUs.
Paperspace initially focused on low-cost virtual machines, providing high-performance workstations for design, visualization and gaming in the cloud. But as AI entered the mainstream, Paperspace leaned hard into its AI offerings, launching a suite of tools designed for developing, training, deploying and hosting AI models in the cloud.
Prior to the acquisition, Paperspace raised $35 million from investors including Battery Ventures, Intel Capital, SineWave Ventures and Sorenson Capital.
Erb sees the acquisition as a step toward a comprehensive offering of cloud CPU and GPU compute to rival other vendors in the public cloud market. The combined power of DigitalOcean and Paperspace, he asserts, will let a new class of customer — particularly those on a tight budget — delve into AI- and machine learning-driven apps like generative media (e.g. OpenAI’s DALL-E 2), large language models (e.g. ChatGPT), recommendation engines and image classifiers.
“DigitalOcean is renowned for simplifying complex cloud technologies and making them more accessible to developers and business alike,” Erb said in a canned statement. “We’re thrilled to join forces with DigitalOcean, as we believe there’s no better company to unlock the endless possibilities of AI and machine learning for developers and businesses alike.”
The Paperspace acquisition is DigitalOcean’s first since 2022, when it bought Pakistani cloud hosting service provider Cloudways for $350 million, and its fourth since its public stock listing in 2021.
From the outside looking in, it’s a wise move for DigitalOcean, which risks being left behind in the surge for cloud AI and machine learning solutions. While the company’s revenue increased in Q1 2023, growing 29.7% to $165.13 million, earnings per share, return on equity and net margin fell short of expectations.
Increasingly, Big Tech cloud providers like Microsoft, Amazon and Google are turning to generative AI to boost revenues — with some success. A recent CNBC poll found that AI is now the biggest spend for nearly 50% of top executives across the economy, indicating it’s a wise place to invest resources.
Driven by the enthusiasm for AI, Gartner predicts that cloud spending will grow 21.7% in 2023, coming in just under $600 billion this year versus $491 billion last year.

SoftBank backs Japanese robotics startup Telexistence in $170M funding round,Kate Park,2023/07/06,"
SoftBank is backing Japanese robotics startup Telexistence, making good on the tech giant’s recent pledge to go back on the investment offensive in light of the current AI hype.
Tokyo-based Telexistence said Thursday that it has raised $170 million (23 billion yen) in a Series B round of funding from SoftBank, Airbus Ventures, Monoful Partners, KDDI Open Innovation Fund, a fund set up by Foxconn and CTBC Financial Holdings, and Globis Capital Partners. With the latest round, Telexistence has raised a total of approximately $193.5 million (27.5 billion yen) since its inception.
Founded in 2017, Telexistence develops AI-powered robotic arms for the retail and logistics industry. Last year, the company said it would deploy its robots in 300 FamilyMart convenience stores across Japan.
The company will use its fresh capital to bolster its workforce globally, CEO Jin Tomioka said in a statement. But aside from the funding, Telexistence is also announcing a strategic partnership with SoftBank Robotics Group, a unit of SoftBank Group, to ramp up its commercialization in North America. Telexistence is currently in talks with major convenience store chains in North America to conduct proof of concept in the near future, according to the company. Moreover, the startup said it will work with Foxconn to produce its next-generation robot, called “Ghost.”
SoftBank Robotics Group’s Kenichi Kent Yoshida, and Globis Capital Partners’ Ryohei Nomoto will join Telexistence’s board of directors as a result of their investment.
SoftBank has been more than a little bullish about investments in the robotics realm, having backed California-based Bear Robotics back in 2020. Via the SoftBank Vision Fund 2, it has also made investments in Shanghai-based Keenon Robotics, which specializes in developing service robots, and Opentrons, a medical testing robot developer.

A comprehensive list of 2023 tech layoffs,Alyssa Stringer,2023/07/06,"
Last year’s techwide reckoning continues. In 2023, layoffs have yet again cost tens of thousands of tech workers their jobs; this time, the workforce reductions have been driven by the biggest names in tech like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Yahoo, Meta and Zoom. Startups, too, have announced cuts across all sectors, from crypto to enterprise SaaS. 
The reasoning behind these workforce reductions follows a common script, citing the macroeconomic environment and a need to find discipline on a tumultuous path to profitability. Still, tracking the layoffs helps us to understand the impact on innovation, which companies are facing tough pressures and who is available to hire for the businesses lucky to be growing right now. It also, unfortunately, serves as a reminder of the human impact of layoffs and how risk profiles may be changing from here. 
Below you’ll find a comprehensive list of all the known layoffs in tech that have occurred in 2023, to be updated monthly. If you have a tip on a layoff, contact us here. If you prefer to remain anonymous, you can contact us here.
The running total of layoffs for 2023 based on full months to date is 201,860, according to Layoffs.fyi. Tech layoffs conducted to date this year currently exceed the total number of tech layoffs in 2022, according to the data in the tracker.

Big Tech corporate venture capital 🤝 generative AI startups,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/29,"
As the race to build generative AI tools for the enterprise devolves into a battle royale, Big Tech companies are busy wielding their most powerful weapons: checkbooks.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

Earlier today, Typeface raised $100 million at a $1 billion valuation, mere months after a $65 million round in February. It’s something to think about considering the company was founded in 2022. But even though we are once again seeing rapid-fire venture rounds at unicorn valuations, the investor list in Typeface’s round is worth noting.
Salesforce Ventures led the round. The CRM and cloud giant recently launched a $500 million fund to invest in generative AI startups, so its presence in this deal is not a complete shock, but the SaaS pioneer had company: Both Alphabet (through its GV investing arm) and Microsoft (through its M12 investing effort) invested in Typeface.
That’s a strange set of bedfellows: Salesforce and Microsoft have competing CRM products, and Microsoft and Alphabet compete in, to pick a few areas, search, productivity software, and public cloud infrastructure.
The Typeface cap table engenders a simple question: Where else are major corporate venture capital (CVC) investors putting their money to work?
To get a feel for the situation, I listed deals from a number of historically active CVC arms of major tech companies. Turns out, the Typeface round is funny for its internally competitive investor list, but it isn’t an outlier at all when it comes to Big Tech dollars flowing into startup accounts. The majors are busy these days. "
Speakeasy is using AI to automate API creation and distribution,Ron Miller,2023/06/29,"
Just about every developer wants to create APIs to help other companies connect to their services more easily, but creating and documenting an API is a time-consuming process. Speakeasy, an early-stage startup, wants to make that an easier and more automated set of activities.
Today, the company emerged from stealth with a $7.6 million seed investment.
Speakeasy co-founder and CEO Sagar Batchu describes his startup as an API infrastructure company, and that means it’s building tools to make it easier to create and distribute APIs, something that is near and dear to him as a developer himself. “We’ve started by working on an important problem to me, one that I’ve faced a lot myself as a developer, which is really dramatically simplifying how developers are able to ship APIs to end users,” Batchu told TechCrunch.
He sees APIs giving developers a kind of superpower. “As developers, APIs allow us to take advantage of another company’s capabilities. And so making it really easy to ship those APIs to developers means that we can really help companies accelerate how their products are adopted, as well as we reduce the burden on developers when they integrate with those APIs,” he said.
While the goal is to build a platform of features eventually to help with that mission, the company is starting with two tools, one to help developers create the APIs, and one to help their users implement them more easily.
The first piece is called Managed SDKs. Developers provide an Open API spec, and Speakeasy uses AI to help build a complete API for you along with the necessary documentation, reducing the amount of time it takes to complete a task like this to minutes.
“Speakeasy uses AI to validate and enhance the spec, creates SDKs in the most popular languages, and publishes automatically to package managers. It takes minutes to set up, and SDKs are updated every time the spec changes – saving developers significant time,” the company explained.
The second piece is designed to help the developer end user implement that API without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure, creating a package using HashiCorp’s popular Terraform tool.
“With Speakeasy, API producers can, for the first time, easily create and maintain Terraform providers from an OpenAPI specification – dramatically reducing engineering burden, while unlocking an entirely new developer community,” the company said.
The startup currently has nine employees, but is hiring engineers to help build out the platform further. As he builds the company, Batchu believes being remote will help him find a more diverse workforce. “So first of all, I think about how adopting a remote-friendly hiring philosophy means that we’ll be able to access more places, more diverse communities. It’s definitely something really important to us. And as we move forward, we will be looking to hire great talent from everywhere,” he said.
Today’s round was led by GV with participation from Quiet Capital, Flex Capital, StoryHouse Ventures and Firestreak Ventures. Last year the company raised an additional $3.3 million in a pre-seed round led by Quiet Capital with participation from a host of prominent industry angel investors.
The Managed SDK piece is generally available starting today. The Terraform piece is available in beta.

Level wants to back your fund — and your portfolio companies too,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/06/29,"
In 2023, funds of funds (FoFs) are on track to raise the smallest amount of money in more than a decade. At the same time, muted venture deal activity has many firms ditching their follow-on funds. Despite these twin trends, a new emerging manager is looking to find success with a fund that targets both.
Level Ventures has raised $104 million for its debut fund, a data-driven, three-pronged investing strategy that uses in-house algorithms to back other emerging managers, invest in promising companies from those managers’ portfolios and source deals of its own.
Albert Azout, the co-founder and managing partner at Level, told TechCrunch that the fund is based on an opportunity in the market he noticed when working as a partner at Cota Capital.
He said that many family offices — his own included — were seeing strong returns by backing small and emerging VC funds and enjoying further success by co-investing alongside those firms in their portfolio companies. He decided to launch Level to see if that strategy could prove successful as an institutional investing approach when driven by data.
“We wanted to disrupt the LP side of the equation,” Azout said. “Most LPs, even fund of funds and institutions, tend to underutilize technology. We wanted to build something that was tech-enabled that allowed us to better understand the ecosystem.”
The first key to getting the strategy to work, Azout said, was finding the right fund managers. Level is targeting emerging managers focused on sectors including enterprise automation, deep tech and life sciences. Within those categories, the firm taps its in-house data model that scores firms based on areas like how many board seats a firms’ investors are on, who they are connected with online and where they are investing.
“We spent a lot of time really making sure that our fund manager selection is optimal,” Azout said. “A lot of the early iterations of the technology was building a model and approach that would yield the top quartile of managers. But the dispersion of performance across early-stage managers is very large. Trying to find the best funds is a moving target.”
The firm looks to back funds that are less than $150 million in size that are either pretty institutional — maybe on fund two or three — or are a solo GP who brings more than just capital to the table. So far, Level has backed firms including Air Street Capital, Emergent Ventures and Work-Bench.
From there, the firm looks to use its data capabilities to keep tabs on underlying portfolio companies to unearth which startups make sense for Level to invest in when they raise their next round. Level also gives its portfolio of funds access to the data it uses.
Level’s approach to build data solutions to source and find companies puts it squarely in line with trends that have begun to gain steam in venture. An increasing number of firms are looking to build algorithms to uncover deals they would have missed otherwise or that wouldn’t have crossed their radar.
“We are seeing more and more firms adding automation and data to their sourcing process. It gives you alpha,” he said. “If you don’t have data capabilities, you will be disadvantaged from a sourcing perspective.”
But the firm doesn’t 100% leave it up to the data. Azout said that while the data is great to narrow down the field, there is always a human in the loop, proving how much people drive this industry.
What makes Level distinct from the other firms looking to add data is that for the majority of its direct strategy, the data isn’t helping it cast a wider net to find a better set of companies. Rather it mainly helps it find the most successful startups from the investors they are already backing. While this does set the firm up to potentially get a double homerun if a company ends up as a notable success, it also means failures will be two-fold, at least for the companies it backs with its own funds.
The firm currently has an even mix of investments in both funds and companies, but for its second fund will skew that ratio 75% toward funds and 25% toward companies. For now, it hopes this strategy helps unlock the best of both fund and direct investing.

"After aperitif ambitions sour, Haus is back on virtual shelves via The Naked Market",Christine Hall,2023/06/29,"
Haus, an aperitif company that tried to find a buyer last year after investor funding dried up, now has one.
The Naked Market, founded by Harrison Fugman and Alex Kost, has acquired certain assets of the low-ABV (alcohol by volume) beverage company from CPG Holding Co. and is now relaunching a few of Haus’ customer favorites, including Citrus Flower, Pomegranate Rosemary and Grapefruit Jalapeño.
Helena Price Hambrecht and then-husband Woody Hambrecht, launched Haus in 2019, and it quickly grew a following with millennials looking for beverages with all-natural ingredients, fun flavors and direct-to-consumer delivery.
When asked about the sale, Price Hambrecht told TechCrunch via email, “I am very glad to see the brand live on. I will always be incredibly proud of what we built, and look forward to seeing what the new owners will do with it in this next chapter.”
Fugman and Kost told TechCrunch that they did not know the Hambrechts prior to the purchase. The opportunity to grab select consumer-facing assets of Haus, including the brand and the intellectual property, stemmed from their experience in the space owning brands like Rob’s Backstage Popcorn and Flock Foods, and their own history as Haus customers.
“Given our background as foodies and operators in the food and beverage world, we were admirers of the brand and business that Helena and Woody created,” Fugman said. “We viewed Haus as one of the most iconic brands that’s been built in the industry over the past decade. Very few brands had an impact on the industry and consumers.”
Though the global beverage market is huge, it’s also kind of a small world. Both Haus and The Naked Market share a mutual investor, Great Oaks Venture Capital, though Fugman noted the VC firm was not involved in the acquisition.

Haus, a VC-backed aperitif startup, is up for sale after Series A falls through

How Haus lost its buzz
By 2022, the company was seeing $10 million in revenue and had a national distribution deal. It also attracted venture investors, raising $17 million on rolling SAFE notes from a group that included Homebrew, Haystack Ventures, Coatue, Shrug Capital and Worklife Ventures.
However, Haus was not immune to pandemic-related challenges, including supply chain woes and word-of-mouth not growing as intended.
“It was difficult to build the business that I wanted to build during the pandemic considering we were building a social product,” Price Hambrecht told TechCrunch at the time. “We didn’t have people gathering, we didn’t have natural word of mouth. We were a purely digital growth brand during that time, great for acquisition but not good for monitoring long-term behavior.”
Price Hambrecht chronicled the company’s journey on Twitter, and in August, after additional investor capital didn’t come through, told followers that Haus would go through a process called Assignment for Benefit of Creditors, an alternative to bankruptcy, which is where assets are put into a trust for the purpose of liquidation or distribution to pay off debts. Any assets left over go back to the debtor.
In November, Price Hambrecht updated that the sale did not lead to a buyer, tweeting, “Today the banker running Haus’ sale process informed me that the auction has concluded, and the company did not sell. Candidly, I did not expect this. He said this was a surprise to him as much as it was to me.”

“Haus 2.0”
Meanwhile, financial terms of the Haus asset acquisition were not disclosed, however, an interesting part of the deal includes plans by The Naked Market to give 5% of the company back to previous Haus employees, founders and investors through a structured program. Usually it is investors that are prioritized, and Fugman and Kost said this move is meant to show appreciation to those who worked hard to build Haus.
“The Haus community was really one of the main pillars of the brand, and this is our homage to continuing that community,” Kost said in an interview. “We thought this was a gesture to help continue that spirit as we look into Haus 2.0.”
As part of that new chapter, Fugman and Kost brought in Sonoma winemaker Micah Wirth, whose LinkedIn profile said he had been Haus’ general manager since January, to continue leading winemaking and R&D efforts. The aperitifs will continue to be sold online, and future plans include taking Haus into new categories within the food and beverage space by the end of the year.
Fugman and Kost say they ultimately want to continue the community, product quality and transparency aspects that Haus began four years ago.
“We plan to take these core principles and build on them while continuing to scale Haus’ key hero SKUs and expanding them into a new category,” Fugman said. “We have unbelievable respect and admiration for the product that Helena created and have decided to bring that back to the market.”

Halo.Car launches remotely piloted rental car deliveries in Las Vegas,Rebecca Bellan,2023/06/29,"
Halo.Car, a startup that uses remote operators to deliver rental cars to a customer’s door, has launched driverless operations in Las Vegas.
Driverless operations mean something different for Halo than they do for autonomous vehicle companies like Cruise or Waymo because Halo’s vehicles aren’t capable of self-driving.
The startup’s fleet is kitted out with a suite of six cameras, modems, antennas and other components to send data back to remote pilots at a Halo operations center. Those pilots then use the video and sensor data that’s streamed in to remotely drive the vehicles. Once a remote driver completes a car delivery, they hand over control of the vehicle to the customer and move on to the next vehicle awaiting remote delivery or collection.
Halo has been delivering vehicles to customers in Las Vegas using teleoperations for around a year, but a human driver has always been present in the front seat for safety reasons. Now Halo cars will be delivered to customers with no drivers in the vehicle.
This is an important step toward achieving Halo’s vision of on-demand vehicles being economically viable, according to Anand Nandakumar, founder and CEO of Halo.
That said, Halo isn’t at the stage where it’s hitting positive unit economics just yet. The company will still use a remote chase car that tails behind the remotely piloted vehicles initially. The driver of the tail car can stop the remotely piloted vehicle and take over if needed.
The tail car also acts as a buffer vehicle in case the Halo car needs to stop, thus preventing a potential rear-end accident with other road users. Halo’s cars will come to a stop if the system detects an anomaly, which means they meet Nevada’s minimal risk condition for AVs that says vehicles must be able to stop if there is a malfunction in the system.
Halo says it will ditch the tail car over the next year based on how the current operations perform. That’ll happen in phases across operation zones and depending on the times of day, according to Nandakumar.
While Halo might be the first company to successfully deliver remote-piloted EVs to customers in Las Vegas, it’s not the only one attempting such a feat. In December 2022, Arcimoto, the maker of the three-wheeled electric Fun Utility Vehicles, teamed up with Faction to develop EVs that can be delivered to a customer’s hotel through a combination of low-level autonomy and tele-assist technology.
Halo’s announcement Thursday comes after six months of intensive testing and training internally, says Nandakumar. The startup had originally targeted the end of 2022 for its driverless launch, but delayed in order to ensure the system’s safety.
“As we’ve seen in the rollout of AVs, there are a lot of scenarios to solve for when the vehicles don’t have a driver inside,” said Nandakumar, perhaps nodding to the many incidents of Cruise and Waymo robotaxis stopping in the middle of traffic and impeding traffic. “We want to make sure that our deployment causes minimal public disruption, and of course, is absolutely safe for all road users.”
That’s why connectivity is so important to Halo.Car’s business model. The vehicles are remotely piloted over T-Mobile’s 5G network, with AT&T and Verizon used for backup. Halo developed an algorithm that allows the data streams to use whichever network connection is strongest at any given time in order to ensure reliable, high-quality streaming and low latency.
Starting Thursday, Halo’s driverless vehicle deliveries are available in downtown Las Vegas between the hours of 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., and will expand to more areas of the city in the coming months. The startup’s fleet of 20 vehicles is made up of Chevy Bolt EVs and Kia Niro EVs, according to the company.
Halo says it plans to grow its fleet in Vegas to hundreds of vehicles before expanding to new cities in 2024.
“Our transition to driverless deliveries marks a significant milestone for us as a company. It proves that our remote-piloting technology is not just innovative, but commercially viable and ready to be scaled up,” said Nandakumar in a statement. “As we prepare to expand and launch new markets, our mission remains unchanged: to provide affordable, accessible, efficient EV transportation.”

"
Why does it seem like every startup is a SaaS company?,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/29,"
If you read enough startup coverage, you’ve noticed that no matter the part of the economy that an upstart tech company is attacking, there’s a pretty darn good chance that it is doing so through software. Software that the startup hosts and charges a recurring fee for customers to access or lever. Software as a service, in other words, or SaaS.
The reasons for this are manifold, but important to grok. First, software empowers. Workers can do more and more quickly with software than they could with pre-digital tools. Second, software is nearly impossibly flexible. It can fit everywhere all at once, solving myriad issues and improving output more generally wherever it lands. And third, software tends to have very attractive economics. This is doubly true for SaaS companies, which not only feature software-styled gross margins, but have recurring revenue to boot.

Enterprise SaaS companies continue to navigate a complex economic environment

That makes SaaS startups valuable in the abstract, as their core output — recurring revenue — is very valuable. Naturally, then, investors that want the most bang for their buck, and founders that want to dent the world with as much gusto as possible, tend to gravitate towards funding and building SaaS startups.
It’s not boring, we promise! To prove that to you, here is a smattering of recent coverage of the wide world of SaaS from TechCrunch+ from the last few weeks. (You can snag TechCrunch+ access here if you still need it!)

Snowflake and Databricks are massive SaaS business, one private and one public. Sure, they do not fit precisely into the Salesforce-style SaaS model of yore, but they offer software as a service and are also battling it out today to build the most fit-for-market enterprise LLM stack. And they are growing at a nearly bonkers clip as well. A great pairing to watch if you care about super-late startups in general.
SaaS startups are not all multi-billion dollar behemoths. Some are quite small. One such startup is Rubber Ducky Labs, which is building tech to help other companies improve their recommender systems. This isn’t tech that you would purchase as a consumer, but Rubber Ducky really does want to affect consumer purchases.
Broadening our lens a bit, let’s talk about vertical SaaS. The idea is simple: Find a particular business category, and build a tailored software solution for those companies. By picking a particular market segment, startups can go deep and build something that resonates. Some folks think that vertical AI is the “next logical iteration of vertical SaaS,” which is both an interesting hypothesis, and one that we agree with.

There’s so much more. Gusto is now doing more than a half-billion dollars in annual revenue while the HRtech space is itself maturing into a massive market. And all the while, the value of software revenue is slowly rebounding, rebuilding confidence in the SaaS model for startups once again.
It’s not all sunshine and roses, mind. During the 2021 tech and venture boom, a number of private-market investors overpaid for startup equity leading to some tough decisions in recent weeks. If it’s tough time for some venture players, it’s a tougher time for certain founders.
But one thing is clear: Even if SaaS evolves into a more on-demand model of selling, managed software services are going nowhere but into more places of our economy. And onto more venture capital betting books.

Social trading app Shares receives EU stock trading license,Romain Dillet,2023/06/29,"
Fintech startup Shares has raised $90 million for its stock trading app. And yet, the service is only available to people who live in the U.K. But that’s about to change as the company has received a couple of authorizations from French regulators. With EU passporting rules, Shares could also expand to other European countries.
As a reminder, Shares lets you trade stocks with no minimum trade size. The company offers fractional shares, which means that you can start investing with as little as £2. It competes with other neobrokers that try to make stock investment more accessible, such as Freetrade in the U.K., Bitpanda and Trade Republic in Europe.
But what makes Shares different from other mobile trading apps is that there’s a social twist. Shares lets you follow your friends and comment on their trades. Users can also create private chats and subscribe to communities of more experienced investors. So far, Shares has managed to attract 150,000 users in the U.K.
Shares just received the accreditation to operate an investment service in France from the ACPR (Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution), France’s financial regulator. And the company plans to take advantage of this license sooner rather than later as it plans to launch Shares in France starting next month. At first, you’ll need an invitation to create an account though.
France’s financial markets regulator (Autorité des marchés financiers) also recently granted the PSAN status to Shares — the startup is now officially a digital assets service provider in France, meaning that it will be able to handle crypto trades as well.
“We are very pleased to receive these authorizations: PSAN registration for cryptocurrencies, and PSI license for trading in stocks and ETFs. This is the reward of an extremely rigorous team effort, of which we are extremely proud. Shares is now regulated by the French regulator and this marks a decisive step in our journey, and allows us to announce our EU launch in July by invitation to our first members,” co-founder and CEO Benjamin Chemla said in a statement.
As you can see, today’s news is going to pave the way for future market expansions in the European Union.

Cyware lands $30M to modernize cybersecurity operations,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/29,"
Cyware, a startup developing products to help enterprises modernize their security operations, today announced that it raised $30 million in a Series C funding round led by Ten Eleven Ventures. Advent International, Zscaler, Emerald Development Managers, Prelude and Great Road Holdings also participated, bringing Cyware’s total raised to $73 million.
Cyware was founded in 2016 by Anuj Goel and Akshat Jain. Goel previously led efforts to research and implement ways to overcome silos within large security teams at companies including Citi. Jain came from Big Tech companies like Oracle and Adobe, where he specialized in building distributed systems.
With Cyware, Goel and Jain say they saw an opportunity to integrate threat intelligence with threat hunting, vulnerability and incident data through prebuilt workflows.
“An effective and proactive security posture relies on a multidimensional approach,” Goel told TechCrunch in an email interview. “When it comes to proactive threat response, it’s critical to connect the dots and quickly respond to a suspicious attack. The more accurate and faster the response to a threat, the less of an impact it has on an organization.”
So where does Cyware come in?
As Goel describes it, Cyware’s platform offers both no-code and low-code capabilities designed to help security teams automate their various threat-combating applications. Via collaboration components, teams can share threat intelligence in real time — with any luck, heading off attacks before they wreak havoc.
Extending the collaborative element, Cyware hosts a network that connects enterprise security teams with each other and with third-party threat data providers. This, Goel says, allows teams to receive threat intel, such as information about vulnerabilities, directly from security vendors, software providers and vetted tech companies.
On trend, Cyware uses AI to extract information from threat intelligence data, score the severity of threats and cluster similar threats together — ultimately combining all the data to generate a report with key insights. Cyware’s AI also provides code suggestions for security orchestration and generates detection rules and signatures that can be dropped into existing threat detection systems.
“Our solutions are built to handle volume and scale, enabling large security teams to effectively operationalize actionable threat intelligence while automating response actions without compromising on performance and speed,” Goel said.
Cyware, which has over 200 employees, doesn’t plan to grow its headcount anytime soon. Goel stressed that this isn’t cause for alarm, pointing to a growing customer base that spans Fortune 1000 companies, government agencies and regulatory bodies.
The fundraising is a testament to Cyware’s strength in a relatively weak market. According to Crunchbase, in the first quarter of 2023, cybersecurity venture capital funding dropped 58% year-over-year while deal flow dropped to 149 deals — the lowest total in years and a 45% drop from Q1 2022.
“Cyware’s platform is designed to reduce repetitive tasks for threat intel and security operations analysts, automate taking intelligent actions to proactively prevent attacks and deliver the right information to the right people at the right time,” he said. “CISOs and other C-suite managers benefit from consolidated dashboards and reports of threats, incidents and response actions, as well as the ability to action information quickly.”
Goel says that the proceeds from the Series C will be put toward expanding Cyware’s go-to-market efforts, market presence, channel business and strategic partnerships.

B Garage raises $20M for its warehouse inventory drones ,Kate Park,2023/06/29,"
B Garage, a San Jose-based startup building autonomous drones along with software to track warehouse inventory, said today that it has picked up $20 million in a Series A round of funding. 
New investor LB Investment led the Series A funding with participation from Ignite Innovation Fund, Krossroad Partners and existing backer SoftBank Ventures Asia. The proceeds, which bring the total amount raised by B Garage to $30 million, will enable the outfit to further develop and commercialize its drones and grow its engineering and business teams. 
The startup was founded in 2017 by Aiden Kim, a former software engineer at Oracle. Kim, who holds a PhD in aeronautics and astronautics from Stanford University, also previously participated in dog robot research at Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL), collaborating with Boston Dynamics for hardware development. (His team focused on creating artificial intelligence software for the dog robot research, Kim said.)
While studying for the doctoral program, Kim realized the lack of startups in the autonomous flight field, and he first came up with an idea in 2017 to build a company offering autonomous flight technology for drone manufacturers. After meeting industry experts in the U.S. in 2019, Kim shaped his plan to develop drones and management software for automated warehouse inventories. What he learned from the industry experts at the time was that industries like agriculture and logistics faced labor shortages, Kim told TechCrunch. 
“[Most] B2B logistics warehouses in the U.S. are far from urban areas and face a severe labor shortage,” Kim said. “The autonomous drone technology could be highly suitable for B2B logistics warehouse inventory management.”
B Garage’s mission is to address the labor shortage issue in those sectors by utilizing artificial intelligence and autonomous technology. 
The company has worked on a proof-of-concept pilot test with Kenco Innovation Lab, a unit of Kenco Logistics, for the last few months. Now it is planning to deploy its drones to more than 10 select Kenco warehouses across the U.S. by the end of 2023. It is also working with Incheon Port Authority in South Korea, aiming to commence the project by the year-end.
Companies like Verity, Gather AI and Corvus Robotics have also raised funding for their inventory drones. B Garage has tried to set itself apart from its rivals with four features: full autonomy that covers multiple aisles, no additional infrastructure required, mapping-free operation and automatic battery swapping.
B Garage’s drone can “navigate through multiple aisles, providing comprehensive coverage of warehouse spaces,” Kim said, adding that many other drone solutions are limited to specific paths or single aisles.

On top of that, users don’t need to integrate additional technology to operate drones with their warehouse infrastructure, so there are no extra charges. Competitors typically require an initial fee and ongoing operating costs for installing markers or beacons (indoor GPS) throughout the logistics warehouse and regularly updating the mapping, the CEO explained. 
Another differentiator, the startup claims, is the automatic battery swapping facility. 
“Our drones are equipped with advanced battery technology that enables efficient battery replacement,” Kim continued. If the drone’s battery runs out, the drone automatically returns to its dedicated battery swapping station, which replaces the depleted battery with a fully charged one from its inventory of pre-charged batteries in a matter of minutes. 
B Garage plans to continue enhancing its software solutions with the goal of integrating with its hardware to apply its technology to industries beyond logistics, such as defense and security, according to the company.
It also aims to introduce ground robots for inventory management, Kim said when asked about its plans. The ground robots will allow the startup to cater to a broader range of customers, providing comprehensive solutions for inventory management across various sectors, Kim explained.

Material Evolution raises $19M to decarbonize the cement industry,Paul Sawers,2023/06/29,"
In the industrial world, cement is about as omnipresent as materials get. But despite its clear and obvious utility, cement is responsible for some 8% of global CO2 emissions — if it was a country, it would be third biggest emitter globally, by some estimations.
While cement’s ubiquity comes largely down to how easy it is to produce and the relative cost, creating cement is hugely carbon-intensive due to the amount of energy required to make it. And this is something that U.K. startup Material Evolution is seeking to address with a new low-energy manufacturing process that it says requires zero heat.
Founded in 2017, Material Evolution today announced it has raised £15 million ($19 million) in a Series A round of funding to scale production of its low-carbon cement, which it says has an 85% lower carbon-footprint than normal Portland cement.
While Material Evolution is officially incorporated in the U.S., where it initially intended as its first target market, the company operates substantively out of the U.K., where its founders and team of 20 are based, and also where its entire product development takes place.
There are numerous companies out there trying to address cement’s carbon problem, including young upstarts such as Carbon Re and Carbonaide, both of which have recently raised venture capital (VC) cash. But Material Evolution points to its own proprietary technology as a key differentiator. Rather than using the energy-hungry kilns that are typical of cement making, the company says it uses an “alkali-fusion” process to produce cement at ambient temperatures, from various “industrial wastes and feedstocks,” circumventing the need for fossil fuels.
When Material Evolution talks about “alkali-fusion,” it’s essentially referring to a process based on similar principles to that of nuclear fusion.
“Fusion technology has been hailed as the way to meet humanity’s energy needs for [the next] millions of years, whilst emitting no carbon dioxide or greenhouse gases,” Material Evolution co-founder and CEO Dr. Elizabeth Gilligan said in statement.
The company says that its material is already used within industry, enabled in large part by a strategic partnership with materials company SigmaRoc, which is also a strategic investor in Material Evolution’s Series A round.
The company’s Series A was led by Kompas VC, with participation from Norrsken VC, Circle Rock, and SigmaRoc.

"Typeface, which is building generative AI for brands, raises $100M at a $1B valuation",Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/29,"
In 2022, Abhay Parasnis, the former CTO of Adobe, founded Typeface, a generative AI startup focused on enterprise use cases. With it, he hoped to leverage generative AI — which at the time was just beginning to come into vogue — to deliver personalized content for brands at scale.
Typeface, thanks in part to the hype around generative AI, caught on quickly, attracting Fortune 500 customers within its first year as well as partnerships with Salesforce and Google Cloud. And — perhaps more importantly — it won over investors, who this week injected hundreds of millions of dollars into the startup.
Today, Typeface closed a $100 million Series B round led by Salesforce Ventures with participation from Lightspeed Venture Partners, Madrona, GV (Google Ventures), Menlo Ventures, and M12 (Microsoft’s Venture Fund). Valuing the startup at $1 billion, the tranche brings Typeface’s total raised to $165 million.
Parasnis says that the new capital will be put toward expanding Typeface’s platform and growing the company’s team.
“Enterprise leaders are telling us across the board that they want to embrace generative AI, but they need a solution that meets their unique requirements and is ready for the enterprise,” Parasnis said via email. “They require an AI platform that keeps up with the lightning-fast pace of innovation and feels like a natural extension of their brand. They also need the assurance that their valuable proprietary content remains secure and confidential while seamlessly integrating into their existing workflows.”
The Typeface platform consists of three key components, Parasnis explained — the first being a content hub where users can upload assets and guidelines for “on-brand” text and image generation. The second, called Blend, uses AI to train and personalize content to a brand’s voice and style. As for the third, Flow, it provides templates and workflows designed to integrate into existing apps and systems.
Image Credits: Typeface
Using Typeface, a content marketing manager could generate an Instagram post — or at least a product shot and caption — to promote the launch of a new product using brand-approved wording and assets. Or a demand generation manager at a business-to-business software-as-a-service company could repurpose an event video into a blog post, draft a follow-up email to attendees and more.
“We provide enterprises with a suite of secure, self-serve solutions that empower any employee to produce on-brand content from their content workflows,” Parasnis said.
There’s no shortage now of companies in the generative AI space. (See Jasper AI, for example, which also recently raised $125 million at a $1.5 billion valuation.) So what makes Typeface different?
For one, Parasnis makes the case that Typeface places a greater emphasis on brand governance, content safety and privacy than most of its competitors. The platform provides dedicated AI models for each customer, ostensibly ensuring that their assets and activity remain private.
What’s not entirely clear is whether Typeface’s models — and the content they produce — could be subject to legal challenges down the line. Pending cases against popular AI art tools Midjourney and Stability AI allege that they infringed on the rights of millions of artists by training their tools on web-scraped images. Meanwhile, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has yet to issue clear guidance on copyright protections for AI-generated works.
Parasnis isn’t anticipating headwinds, asserting that Typeface customers own all the assets they generate on the platform.
“Every part of the enterprise needs compelling, personalized content to drive results, and that too, more at a rapid pace,” he said. “Typeface revolutionizes the way enterprises deliver content, empowering every facet of the organization to drive exceptional results with unprecedented speed.”
It might not matter — for now. The risks don’t seem to be dampening the enthusiasm around generative AI. According to a survey by FreshBooks, 25% of business owners say that they’re currently using or testing generative AI tools while two out of three say they’ll try generative AI for work within the next 12 months.
VCs aren’t shying away either, clearly. According to a PitchBook report released in March, venture firms have steadily increased their positions in generative AI, from $408 million in 2018 to $4.8 billion in 2021 to $4.5 billion in 2022. Angel and seed deals have grown as well, with 107 deals and $358.3 million invested in 2022 compared with just 41 and $102.8 million in 2018.
“With a significant demand among enterprises for personalized generative AI, we must rapidly expand our platform and continuously innovate to meet enterprises’ distinct needs,” Parasnis said. “Moreover, we will expand our exceptional team with deep AI, software-as-a-service and enterprise marketing expertise to enrich the value we offer to our growing community. This funding serves as the catalyst for a robust product roadmap and go-to-market expansion, empowering enterprises to effortlessly generate personalized content at every customer touchpoint, safely and from within their existing enterprise workflows.”

India’s startup funding slides 68% after Tiger and SoftBank make virtually no deals,Manish Singh,2023/06/29,"
Indian startups experienced a significant contraction in funding in the first half of 2023 as some kingmaker late-stage backers quelled new investments in the South Asian nation amid a slowdown in the broader public market.
The first six months of 2023 saw Indian startups raise a mere $5.46 billion, a substantial 68% decline from the $17.1 billion during the same timeframe in 2022 and a drop from $13.4 billion in H1 2021, as per data from market intelligence agency Tracxn shared with TechCrunch.
This year has thus far failed to yield any fresh unicorns in the Indian startup ecosystem, a stark contrast to the 18 new entrants to the billion-dollar club in H1 2022 and 16 minted during the corresponding period the previous year.
The funding drought is permeating startups across different stages. A total of 325 seed funding deals were struck in H1 2023, a dramatic fall from the 936 in the same period in 2022 and 921 in H1 2021, according to Tracxn’s data.
Other early-stage funding rounds, chiefly Series A and Series B, dwindled to 108, compared to 296 and 211 in the equivalent periods in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Late-stage funding also suffered, slumping to 36 deals from 137 and 114 during similar periods the prior years.
The slowdown comes as many late-stage investors, previously prolific backers of Indian startups, have taken a step back. Tiger Global has done just one deal in India this year, according to Tracxn and Crunchbase, whereas SoftBank (which deployed over $3 billion in India in 2021) and Insight Partners (which backed several late-stage startups last year and in 2021) wrote virtually no checks.
Instead, SoftBank has been bulking up liquidity. For the last several weeks, SoftBank has been selling a portion of its Paytm stake each day, according to a market source familiar with the matter. Chief executive Masayoshi Son said at the company’s annual general meeting last week that SoftBank, which has invested just $650 million through its Vision Funds across the globe in the past two reported quarters, plans to go on the “counteroffensive” soon by resuming AI investments.
Tiger Global, which has deployed over $6.5 billion into Indian startups altogether, is highly unlikely to forge investments in new startups in India for a few more months, a partner at the firm told a founder recently. Scott Shleifer, who oversees startup investments at the New York–headquartered hedge fund, which recently disclosed securing $2 billion for its new fund, said on an investor call earlier this year that returns on capital in India have “historically sucked.”
He said, “If you look at the market-leading internet companies, whether it is Google, Facebook, Alibaba or Tencent, revenue for them got bigger than cost more than a decade ago. You had a great legacy of last 17–18 years of materially profitable internet companies. So returns on equity in the internet got really high and the returns for investors have been really high. But that did not happen in India.”
SoftBank and Tiger Global are investors in 33 of the 65 Indian startups that attained the unicorn status in 2021 and 2022. All put together, India has 102 unicorns.
As some of the prominent late-stage names sit on the sidelines, sovereign funds, especially from the Middle East region, have financed the vast majority of those deals in India in recent quarters.
Rahul Chandra, a seasoned investor and co-founder of Arkam Ventures, said he doesn’t anticipate the return of some prolific late-stage investors to their customary investment activity for at least another two years in India.
The lack of participation from late-stage backers and virtually no IPOs have also hurt the appetite of many midstage investors, who are struggling to devise new underwriting models that reflect the current public market view. Several high-flying Indian startups, including Byju’s, Swiggy and PharmEasy, have experienced a dramatic downward adjustment in their valuations — by a staggering 50% or even more.
Despite this setback, there remains a ray of hope for Indian startups in the form of considerable “dry powder” – untapped capital reserves held by venture capitalists. Almost every active VC firm in India, including the likes of Peak XV Partners, Lightspeed, Accel, Elevation Capital, Matrix Partners India, 3one4 Capital and Blume Ventures, have secured new and larger funds in the past 18 months.
Arkam co-founder Chandra said that it’s likely the pace of investments will pick up in the coming months.
“What we are contained by is mostly locally available capital, which I expect will be behaving in a rational manner because there’s no irrational exuberance coming in to drive valuation up. It’ll still mean that people are chasing each other for termsheets for the good founders because the next two years there will be more capital that will get deployed,” he told TechCrunch in an interview.
Indeed, Peak XV, Lightspeed, and Accel have escalated their deal deliberations and are on track to closing nearly 50 early-stage deals since mid-March, according to people familiar with the matter.

Lightspeed says India not for the faint-hearted amid Sequoia split

Visa acquires Brazilian fintech startup Pismo in $1B blockbuster deal,Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/06/28,"
Credit card giant Visa is acquiring Brazilian payments infrastructure startup Pismo for $1 billion in cash in what is likely one of the largest fintech M&A deals taking place this year so far.
Founded in 2016 by Juliana Motta (CPO), Ricardo Josua (CEO), Daniela Binatti (CTO), and Marcelo Parise (VP of engineering), São Paulo–based Pismo has quietly racked up a list of big-name customers, including Citi, Itaú (one of Brazil’s largest banks), Revolut, N26, Nubank and Cora. The startup processes almost 50 billion API calls and $40 billion in transaction volumes annually, and powers almost 80 million accounts and over 40 million issued cards.
For some context of the explosive growth Pismo has seen, at the beginning of 2021, it was doing less than $1 billion per month in transaction volume, according to Josua. It ended 2020 with fewer than 10 million accounts total.
Over time, Pismo has expanded out of its home country and now also operates in several countries across Latin America, including Mexico and Chile, as well as in the U.S. and Europe. The startup also has some customers in India, Southeast Asia and Australia.
Pismo’s cloud-native issuer processing and core banking platform is aimed at giving banks, fintechs and other financial institutions “flexibility and agility,” the company shared when it raised $108 million in Series B funding in October of 2021. It does things like allow customers to launch products for cards and payments, digital banking, digital wallets and marketplaces. Pismo also claims to allow financial institutions to “take charge of their core data and use it intelligently.”
In a written statement, Visa said that by acquiring Pismo, it “will be positioned to provide core banking and issuer processing capabilities across debit, prepaid, credit and commercial cards for clients via cloud native APIs.” The startup’s platform will also enable Visa to provide support and connectivity for emerging payment rails, like Pix in Brazil, for financial institution clients, the company added.
“Through the acquisition of Pismo, Visa can better serve our financial institution and fintech clients with more differentiated issuer solutions they can offer their customers,” said Jack Forestell, Visa’s chief product and strategy officer, in a written statement. The deal, which is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, is slated to close by year’s end. Pismo will retain its current management team, who will remain based in São Paulo.
SoftBank, e-commerce giant Amazon and Silicon Valley–based venture firm Accel co-led the startup’s Series B raise. Falabella Ventures, PruVen and existing backers Redpoint Ventures and Headline also participated in the financing, which brought Pismo’s total funding raised to $118 million. The company did not share its valuation, but Accel partner Ethan Choi told TechCrunch that the sales price was “a very strategic multiple.”
As a SaaS business, Pismo mostly made money by charging transaction fees. It has charged per active account, so prices decrease based on volume. In other words, the more clients a customer has, the less they pay per account.
In a written statement, Josua said: “At Pismo, we aim to enable our clients to launch cutting-edge payments and banking products within a single cloud-native platform — regardless of rails, geography or currency. Visa provides us unrivaled support to expand our footprint globally and help shape a new era for banking and payments.”
Visa was reportedly just one of several companies bidding for the startup, which was not seeking to be acquired, or even fundraising, according to Choi.
“Pismo wasn’t on the block,” he told TechCrunch. Besides the transaction representing “one of the largest LatAm cross-border fintech deals that has happened,” Choi believes it is also “an example of a global card network deciding that they would like to get closer to the banks and the financial institutions they work with by providing core banking and card issuing services to them, in addition to their credit card and debit card rails.”
He added: “There are a lot of synergies to be able to sell these really critical APIs to their existing financial institution customers.”
It’s not the first infrastructure play on Visa’s part. In March 2022, it closed on its $2.15 billion acquisition of Tink, a leading fintech startup in Europe focused on open banking application programming interfaces.
The credit card behemoth also famously abandoned its planned $5.3 billion acquisition of Plaid, a U.S.-based popular open banking startup, before having to call off the acquisition after running into a regulatory wall.
No doubt that Pismo getting scooped up by Visa is a coup of sorts for the entire Latin America region, which saw a surge in global investors pouring capital into the region in 2021 and a bit of a retreat since. It’s also a comeback story, considering that in 2019, Pismo was running out of the cash it had raised in a $900,000 seed round in 2016. In fact, things were so dire that Binatti and Parise even sold their only car in order to fund Pismo’s operations. Now the company’s just over 400 workers will become Visa employees.
The deal also marks the second time that Accel has purchased a financial infrastructure company that ended up getting acquired soon after. In 2020, consumer financial services platform SoFi announced that it was acquiring payments and bank account infrastructure company Galileo for $1.2 billion in total cash and stock. That company was founded in 2000 and bootstrapped to profitability before Accel wrote it a $77 million Series A check in 2019.

"Brex refocuses on startups with hire of SVB veteran, ex-a16z operating partner",Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/06/28,"
Just over one year ago, spend management decacorn Brex declared that it was “less suited to meet the needs of smaller customers” in an announcement that caused shock waves in the startup community.
While Brex soon clarified that by smaller customers it meant small to medium-sized businesses and non-funded startups, the move still felt like a stunning reversal, considering the company had started its life as a credit card company for startups. The announcement came about two months after Brex announced a “big push into software” and that it was placing greater emphasis on moving upmarket to serve larger, enterprise customers.
But then in March, Silicon Valley Bank imploded. 
Brex was one of the bidders for the early-stage and growth portfolios of the bank, which was known for providing a swath of financial services to the startup community. Ultimately, First Citizens Bank took over, but some of those former clients shunned the idea of working with such a large bank and opted to move their accounts to fintechs such as Brex, Mercury and Arc. While Brex declined to share specifics on just how many former SVB customers in total have migrated their accounts, it did say that it opened 4,000 new accounts and received $2 billion in deposits in the first week after the SVB shutdown alone.
That influx of new customers led Brex to rethink its priorities, and strategy.
Today, the company told TechCrunch exclusively that it has tapped Jason Mok, a former Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) operating partner and more than 16-year veteran of Silicon Valley Bank as its new head of startups. In his new role, which he assumed in April, Mok will be helping founders navigate both today’s macroeconomic environment and the recent banking crises, as well as the promise of exciting technologies like generative AI. 
Via email, Brex co-founder and co-CEO Henrique Dubugras told TechCrunch that “founders and startups have always been at the core of Brex.”
He added: “The community needs our support more than ever given the broader macro and collapse of SVB. When it came to hiring someone to lead our startups organization, it was crucial to find someone who shared Brex’s pride and passion for startups; Jason fits the bill.”
At a16z, Mok managed the firm’s seed fund. And at SVB, he served as the managing director and sector head of consumer internet. Interestingly, Mok’s father also worked at SVB in the early 1990s, in a similar capacity as Mok did.
“So I grew up around SVB,” Mok recalls. “I just grew up around Silicon Valley Bank, founders and entrepreneurs, scaling with companies and venture capital.”
While at the organization, Mok said he worked on everything from early stage to growth to venture to warehouse facilities to lending.
“I learned a ton. SVB was like the best place to get your ‘MBA’ for everything about technology, finance, startups and venture capital,” he said.
In 2020, Mok was recruited by a16z to serve as an operating partner to oversee corporate development before overseeing the firm’s seed fund strategy. He left the firm in September 2022, he said, to focus on family before getting recruited by Brex this spring to help lead its renewed focus on startups.
Admitting that he was “heartbroken” by what transpired at SVB, Mok said he was drawn to the opportunity of helping the startup community in a new capacity.
“SVB was a stalwart that enabled so much of what currently is the tech and innovation ecosystem. It was amazing to see so many different people and companies come out of the woodwork to really do their part in helping prop up the innovation system,” Mok said. “Specifically, it was amazing to see Brex step up the way that it did.”

In his new role, Mok said he will be helping guide the post-SVB opportunity for Brex and how the company is “thinking about delivering for startups in the future.”
“Brex is the only non-bank alternative offering a full financial stack, including banking, bill pay and credit cards,” he told TechCrunch. “I’ve joined to add some additional leadership strategy and reaffirm Brex’s commitment to delivering to startups. Over time we have expanded to serving enterprises but startups and founders are at the core of what we do and we want to make sure we continue to iterate, evolve and grow with founders as they scale beyond startup.”
Part of that, Mok said, will include discussing with founders what they need in terms of products so that they can “scale faster and iterate better.”
The company also wants to be more present physically, by hosting events in various cities such as San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles, for the startup community and offering more “Brex ambassadors” that can serve as the face of the brand that founders, operators and VCs can go to for advice, perspective and connections to other founders.
“I’ll be overseeing all of that and really our go-to-market function,” Mok said.
He’ll also help with the further building out of Brex’s business accounts as well as “further optimizing and improving” the company’s onboarding process.
Brex said it has also named Nadav Lidor as the company’s lead for banking products catered to startups. Lidor, who leads Brex’s Israel office, will be focused on Brex business accounts — cash management accounts with FDIC insurance through partner banks and a suite of money movement tools across ACH, wires and checks. 
In late May, Brex shared that two of its products — Empower, its spend management platform, and Brex business accounts — had “each achieved $100 million in ARR,” or annual recurring revenue.
The company added that since launching Empower last year, Brex has signed on companies such as Coinbase, Indeed, SeatGeek, Lemonade and DoorDash, among others. It also said that its business accounts, which it describes as cash management accounts with a suite of money movement tools across ACH, wires and checks, had seen “rapid growth due to the ease of use and up to $6M in FDIC insurance coverage.”
Brex also recently announced it was going global.

Celestial AI raises $100M to transfer data using light-based interconnects,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/28,"
David Lazovsky and Preet Virk, technologists with backgrounds in semiconductor engineering and photonics, came to the joint realization several years ago that AI and machine learning workloads would quickly encounter a “data movement” problem. Increasingly, they predicted, it would become challenging to move data to and from compute hardware as AI models scaled past what could be kept on the die of any one memory chip.
Their solution — architected by Phil Winterbottom, previously a researcher at the distinguished Bell Labs — was an optical interconnect technology for compute-to-compute, compute-to-memory and on-chip data transmission. Along with Winterbottom, Lazovsky and Virk founded a startup, Celestial AI, to commercialize the tech. And now that startup is attracting big backers.
Celestial AI today announced that it raised $100 million in a Series B round led by IAG Capital Partners, Koch Disruptive Technologies and Temasek’s Xora Innovation fund. The tranche, which brings Celestial AI’s total raised to more than $165 million, will be used to support the production of Celestial’s photonics platform by expanding the company’s engineering, sales and technical marketing departments, according to CEO Lazovsky.
Celestial has around 100 employees at present — a number that Lazovsky expects will grow to 130 by the end of the year.
“Today, compute and memory are closely coupled. The only way to add more high bandwidth memory is to add more compute, whether the additional compute is required or not,” Lazovsky told TechCrunch via email. “Celestial’s tech enables memory disaggregation.”
In a data center, memory is often one of the most expensive resources — in part because it’s not always used efficiently. Because memory is tied to compute, it’s challenging — and sometimes impossible, due to bandwidth constraints and sky-high latency — for operators to “disaggregate” and pool the memory across hardware within the data center.
According to an internal Microsoft study, up to 25% of memory in Azure is “stranded,” or left over, after the servers’ cores have been rented to virtual machines. Reducing this stranded memory could cut data center costs by 4% to 5%, the company estimated — potentially significant savings in the context of a multibillion-dollar operation.
Celestial — which began as a portfolio company of The Engine, the VC firm spun out of MIT in 2016 — developed an ostensible solution in its photonics-based architecture, which scales across multiple-chip systems. Using light to transfer data, Celestial’s tech can beam information within chips and chip-to-chip, making both memory and compute available for AI — and other — workloads.

Celestial also claims that its tech can reduce the amount of electricity necessary for data movement, indirectly boosting a chip’s performance. Typically, chips devote a portion of the electricity they draw to data movement between their circuits, which takes away from the electricity that the chip can direct to computing tasks. Celestial’s photonics reduce the power required for data movement, allowing a chip to — at least in theory — increase its compute power.
Celestial’s photonics tech, which is compatible with most industry interconnect standards (e.g., CXL, PCIe), delivers 25x higher bandwidth and 10x lower latency and power consumption than optical alternatives, the company asserts.
“With the growth in AI , especially large language models (LLMs) and recommendation engine workloads, there is a shift towards accelerated compute,” Lazovsky said. “The key problem going forward is memory capacity, memory bandwidth and data movement — i.e., chip-to-chip interconnectivity — which is what we are addressing with Celestial’s photonic fabric.”
Celestial is offering its interconnect product through a licensing program and says that it’s engaged with several “tier-one” customers, including hyperscalers and processor and memory companies.
The interconnect product appears to be priority number one for Celestial. The company sells its own AI accelerator chip, dubbed Orion, built on Celestial’s photonics architecture. But as investors told TechCrunch in a recent piece for TC+, AI photonics chips have yet to overcome engineering challenges that would make them practical at scale. Unless Celestial stumbled upon breakthroughs in the areas of data-to-analog conversion and signal regeneration — top stumbling blocks for today’s photonics chips — it’s unlikely that Orion is much further along than the competition.
Chip aside, Celestial has a number of competitors in a photonic integrated circuit market that could be worth $26.42 billion by 2027.
Ayar Labs, which makes chip solutions based on optical networking principles, has raised over $200 million in venture capital since its founding in 2015. Renovus, another rival, recently landed a $73.9 million investment.
There could be consolidation ahead in the broader optical interconnection space, though. Around three years ago, Marvell bought Inphi, an optical networking specialist, for $10 billion. After a period of quiet, Microsoft last year acquired Lumenisity, a startup developing high-speed optical cables for data center and carrier networks.
Both Inphi and Lumenisity were targeting different use cases with their tech. But the enthusiasm from Big Tech around optics and photonics is worth noting.
“Our photonics technology is truly differentiated and is unique with superior characteristics,” Lazovsky said. “Given the growth in generative AI workloads due to LLMs and the pressures it puts on current data center architectures, demand is increasing rapidly for optical connectivity to support the transition from general computing data center infrastructure to accelerating computing.”
Samsung Catalyst, Smart Global Holdings, Porsche Automobil Holding SE, The Engine Fund, imec.xpand, M Ventures and Tyche Partners also participated in Celestial’s Series B.

"As $100M+ venture rounds evaporate, IPOs might have to carry the weight",Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/28,"
Earlier this year we wrote that the “the $100 million venture round is going extinct.” Often our predictions wind up sideways. This time we were on the right track.
According to new data from PitchBook, the U.S. venture market is continuing to endure lackluster velocity for nine-figure investments into private companies, colloquially referred to as “mega-rounds.”

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

In the first half of 2023, PitchBook counted just 108 mega-rounds in the United States. If we presumed that this rate will hold throughout the year, we’re looking at just over 200 nine-figure deals in the U.S. in 2023. That’s a dramatic decline from prior levels. Starting in Q4 2020 through Q3 2022, there were more than 100 mega-rounds recorded per quarter. In 2021, the average was more than 200 per quarter. To see perhaps 200 this year implies that the number of late-stage startups that will be able to raise an IPO-sized round is in free fall.
The rounds are also getting smaller, with data indicating that the average nine-figure round size has fallen under the $200 million mark, exclusive of a few rounds that are hardly traditional venture deals, like OpenAI’s massive round earlier this year. Smaller mega-rounds, and fewer of them, is a tough mix for unicorns of all stripes and sizes.
Of course, we could see nine-figure rounds rebound in other markets. Europe and Asia have seen their fair share of the transactions historically. But as the United States’ venture market is the largest in the world and was once the leading player in mega-round financings, where the U.S. goes, so, too, goes the world.

Cava’s explosive IPO hints that public markets are more ready for growth-stories than founders thought

If unicorns here are struggling to find fodder in the quantity that they became accustomed to, other startups around the world are likely enduring a similar dearth of capital.
Notably PitchBook thinks that “the need for capital likely leading to an uptick in mega-rounds as the year progresses” thanks to “the notion that depleting cash runways will force more of these startups to raise in the harsher dealmaking environment,” it still expects full-year mega-round tallies to come in at dramatically reduced levels compared to prior years.

Techstars raising $150 million for new accelerator fund,Annie Njanja,2023/06/28,"
Startup accelerator Techstars is raising $150 million for its new fund, SEC filings show. The accelerator is seeking new capital ahead of the end of the deployment period of its third institutionally-backed fund, Techstars Accelerator 2021, later this year.
Techstars declined to offer details on how it intends to use or deploy the funding, citing regulatory restrictions. However, like its predecessors, the new fund, Techstars Accelerator 2024, is expected to be used for accelerator-stage and/or post-accelerator investments.
Notably, the Boulder-based early-stage investor has used its current fund only for accelerator-stage investments. Its previous funds backed startups both during the accelerator stage and with follow-on investments after the program.
Fund 3 aimed to back more than 800 pre-seed and seed startups that are part of its global accelerator programs by the end of 2023. Through its accelerator groups, Techstars has so far backed over 3,500 early-stage startups in various sectors, including health tech, fintech, web3 and clean tech.
Startups going through Techstars’ three-month program receive $20,000 and a $100,000 convertible note in exchange for 6% to 9% of common stock, in addition to access to its network and mentorship, amongst other resources.

Techstars debuts new fund for companies too early for its own accelerator

Founded in 2006, Techstars runs more than 50 accelerator groups in major cities across the globe, including New York, Los Angeles, London, Boston, Tel Aviv and Lagos. The accelerator launched the Lagos arm last year in partnership with ARM Labs as part of its plan to expand its specialist and generalist programs globally.
To double down on its growth and expansion plans, Techstars recently launched new funds to bolster its investment efforts.
Last year, for instance, it launched Rising Stars, a fund to back startups that are too early for its accelerator programs. Under this fund, Techstars will issue $100,000 checks in exchange for 7% to 10% equity.
The accelerator also launched the $80 million Advancing Cities Fund in partnership with JPMorgan to back over 400 startups by diverse founders in nine cities across the U.S.

Techstars names Maëlle Gavet CEO as the accelerator group looks to expand

OpenAI brings the competition to DeepMind’s doorstep with new London office,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/28,"
OpenAI is expanding overseas. To London, specifically.
Today, the Microsoft-backed AI startup announced that it plans to open an office in London, its first international outpost. When OpenAI’s London location opens its doors, it’ll focus on advancing “research and engineering capabilities” while balancing collaborating with “local communities and policymakers,” according to CEO Sam Altman.
“We see this expansion as an opportunity to attract world-class talent and drive innovation in AGI development and policy,” Altman, who reportedly had floated Poland and France as alternatives for the office, said in a canned statement. “We’re excited about what the future holds and to see the contributions our London office will make towards building and deploying safe AI.”
London is a conspicuous choice for OpenAI, which hasn’t expanded beyond its San Francisco headquarters since its founding in 2015. The city is the longtime home base of DeepMind, Google’s largest AI research division, and a wellspring of data science talent, owing to its rich academic history and renowned universities.
Broadly speaking, London is also becoming a booming center for AI startup ventures. According to a recent report, as of 2021, over 1,300 AI companies were based in London and the city was the top-funded in the U.K. in terms of venture dollars invested.
The city is also important politically to tech companies heavily invested in AI, like OpenAI, which seek to convince the U.K.’s governing bodies to regulate AI with a light touch. On a recent lobbying tour, Altman made an appearance at the University College London, where he called for “balanced” regulation and warned of the risks of deepfake disinformation.
At that same appearance, Altman said that OpenAI would “cease operating” in the European Union if it’s unable to comply with the provisions of the bloc’s AI Act, one of the first comprehensive set of regulations for the AI industry. He later backed down from the comments — but the play was made.

Quandri raises $8.5M Series A to bring process automation to insurance brokers and agencies,Frederic Lardinois,2023/06/28,"
Robotic process automation (RPA) has been a buzzword for a while now, but most of the tools that try to help businesses automate their workflows tend to be generalists. Quandri, a Vancouver, Canada-based startup, is taking a very different approach with its digital workers for the insurance industry. The company today announced that it has raised an $8.5 million Series A round led by FUSE, with participation from Defined Capital and existing investors Aviso Ventures, Rebellion Ventures, N49P and Good News Ventures. In total, the company has now raised $10 million.
The company was co-founded by brothers Jackson (CEO) and Jamieson Fregeau (president). Jackson was previously the COO of Revenue Accelerator while Jamieson worked at a number of hardware-centric companies, including Open Ocean Robotics. Jackson noted that while he was at Revenue Accelerator, he ended up building a number of bots to automate repetitive data entry tasks. So when the brothers were thinking about what product to build, they decided on putting a different spin on RPA.
“Nobody was really talking about a bot for a customer specifically. It was like: you’d give this capability to a customer. And then they would need to go and configure and build all this stuff themselves in a really rigid way. And that prevented a huge slew of companies from accessing this kind of technology because they don’t have the technical resources — or if they have the technical resources, they’re applied to their very specific core products but not on operational automation.”
What Quandri is building is more akin to “robot-as-a-service” than traditional RPA. Instead of having to build automation themselves, Quandri essentially pre-builds these bots for their customers, which also means that the team has to focus on a very specific niche. After working with a couple of potential customers in the insurance space, Jackson told me, the team realized that this was a vertical where brokers and agencies were still doing a lot of repetitive manual work and where a lot of data was sitting in silos (even as the consumer-side of the industry has quickly modernized).
“There hasn’t been a lot of net new tooling built for brokerages over the last 10 years,” he said. “It’s been somewhat overlooked by a large wave of innovation that has happened in a lot of other industries.”
Right now, Quandri offers three of these pre-built robots: Renewal Reviewer to help agents compare policies upon renewal, a tool that helps users ensure that files are named correctly and contextually (and not “1847AHDKS812 BROKER”), and Download Director, a service that matches unmatched policies and eDocs to the correct accounts and then matches claims and verifies producer commission amounts as needed.
Jackson tells me that the company is currently 100% focused on the insurance industry and specifically on North American brokerages. In the long run, the team may branch out and apply its technology to other verticals.
“Bots are a total game changer for our agency,” said Angela Trimble, president, Trustpoint Services. “I told my Agency Manager we are now at a place where we don’t have to be worried about hiring additional employees when it comes to the tasks involving tedious paperwork because we have bots in place.”

"Tiny acquires HappyFunCorp, the prolific firm that’s built apps for Twitter, Amazon and more, for $30M",Ingrid Lunden,2023/07/03,"
M&A and consolidation continue to be major themes in the tech world as companies look for their next steps in a tight market. That’s a trend impacting not just startups and larger tech companies, but the firms that work closely with them.
In the latest development, HappyFunCorp — a product engineering house that designs and builds apps and more for the likes of Apple, Disney, Amazon and Twitter — is getting acquired by Canadian firm Tiny for $30 million.
Tiny is based out of Canada and is publicly traded there with a current market cap of around $500 million. HappyFunCorp is being acquired with a mix of shares and cash and will continue to operate independently out of Brooklyn, New York, where it was founded, said Ben Schippers, co-founder and co-CEO, in an interview.
It will also work closer with Tiny, which has built a tidy business out of quietly scooping up companies that — if you could put a description around it — largely focus on providing an array of front and back-end design and product services for tech companies and internet-based businesses.
Other acquisitions in the Tiny stable include e-commerce technology player WeCommerce; Dribbble, an online community for designers to share work and pick up new work; and it also has a stake in Flow, for task and project management. The co-founder of Tiny is Andrew Wilkinson, who is also the co-founder of MetaLab, an interface design company that is also part of Tiny.
Together with HappyFunCorp the companies work behind the scenes with some of the most well-known names in tech — companies that do a lot of major work in house, but also — maybe with a little less fanfare — also turn to third parties to build out products that are typically outside of the normal course of an organization’s workflow and thus a distraction and strain were they to be developed, maintained and updated internally, at least while they’re getting off the ground (or while the company’s watching to see if they can get off the ground).
Customers for the combined Tiny organization range from a long tail covering tens of thousands of smaller online businesses, through to building some significant apps and other work for some of the biggest names in tech, such as Amazon, Facebook/Meta, Twitter, Disney, Samsung and Apple.
Some of the most successful of those projects actually cover both of those ends of the spectrum. One anecdote that has stuck in my memory for years is that MetaLab turned a struggling startup’s rough concept into an app that blew up beyond, seemingly, anyone’s wildest predictions: that app was Slack.
HappyFunCorp was founded in 2009, and in the last 14 years it’s racked up its own very long list of big-name customers. Similar to the other companies in the Tiny stable, it has up to now been bootstrapped and profitable. Revenues in 2022 were $12 million and it’s on track for more growth this year, Schippers said. He, along with current co-CEO Holly Zappa and COO Robb Chen-Ware, will stay on to run the company post-acquisition.
(Note: TezLab, a popular third-party Tesla application that was incubated at HappyFunCorp, is being spun out as an independent company with this acquisition.)
Tiny’s acquisition of HappyFunCorp is significant not just because it’s another example of the consolidation that continues to change the shape of today’s technology landscape; but because it shines a light on a group of companies in the tech ecosystem that are likely to be taking an even more prominent role in the coming years.
Companies continue to trim their workforces — with hundreds of thousands of layoffs in the last year — and they’re also trimming their budgets to meet the current state of the market. And new developments in areas like AI create a lot of variables and unknowns around the corner in both of those departments.
Yet those companies still have their eye on future growth and, to that end, want to continue developing new products and concepts to meet demand and to create new demand. Tiny’s bet is that this pull and push will drive more business into its arms over time.
The profile of companies like this has definitely changed over the last decade, Schippers said.
“Eight, nine years ago we did all this work and we didn’t talk about it,” he said in reference to some of its higher-profile projects, including some ambitious projects of Twitter’s. “Now the pendulum is swinging.”
Cost consolidation, he added, will additionally drive a lot of companies to a “near shore” model focusing on R&D not in New York or Vancouver (where MetaLab and Tiny have operations), but economies like Costa Rica and elsewhere in Latin America “where work can be done at a fraction of the cost,” he said. “Full stop that is where the market is going.”

Trying to close a Series B in 2023? Read this first,Mark Chaffey,2023/07/03,"

Mark Chaffey is CEO of hackajob, a career marketplace for technology job seekers and employers.	

Despite ongoing economic uncertainty, there will always be a path forward for determined founders with strong ideas and smart investors with an eye for opportunity. But make no mistake, the challenges are real and sizable. Global funding in Q1 2023 was down 53% compared to Q1 2022, a precipitous drop hastened by broader market turbulence and fears of a prolonged downturn.
And the stagnation wasn’t limited to just late-stage funding either. Crunchbase analysis revealed that Series B investment in the second half of 2022 was down over 60% from the same period the year before — putting Series B investments on track to come in at the lowest quarterly level in more than three years.
With this backdrop, our company began our Series B round of fundraising in early 2023. We went into the process aware that our sector has historically suffered in a down economy, but we chose to focus on the positives — namely that our ability to close in this environment would showcase the quality of our business and that any investors willing to make an investment despite the challenges would result in a stronger long-term partnership.
How we closed our $25 million Series B in April 2023: 5 key factors
For us, we knew we were ready for a Series B when:

We were cash efficient with a burn multiple under 1.
We had proven product-market-fit and go-to-market fit with excellent unit economics.
We had strong retention, in our case a net revenue retention rate (NRR) of 149%.

From there, it was all about execution. Here are five other strategies that helped us close our Series B.
Set the foundations to scale: Team, process and expertise
Series B rounds are all about scaling the business. The scrambling and existential doubt you had as an entrepreneur won’t go away, but by this point, you should have built a strong executive team around you that is, frankly, more skilled at scaling their individual functions than you are. As soon as you land the Series A, start to lay a real business foundation — pivoting from a survival mindset to a sustainable one.
We embraced this, and after closing our Series A, we built the groundwork throughout 2019 that enabled us to take advantage of the unique opportunity that the COVID-19 pandemic created. Ultimately, this strong foundation led us to close our Series B round in an extremely challenging market.
 

			There will always be a path forward for determined founders with strong ideas and smart investors with an eye for opportunity.					


Your org chart doesn’t have to be fully built at this stage, but you should have a plan to scale. When building out our exec team, we balanced homegrown talent that had progressed internally with individuals who had achieved success at the next level of scale than we operated currently.
When raising a Series B, it is important to hire execs with experience for this stage of the company. A CRO who is used to scaling from $50 million ARR to $100 million ARR has a very different skill set than what you need to scale from $10 million to $30 million ARR. For example, when looking for a VP of finance, we wanted someone with a track record of closing Series B and C investment rounds, as that was the next step for us.
Understand potential investor reservations, then create a plan to counter them
When fundraising, a common piece of advice for founders is to start with your tier 3 funds first and work your way up to pitching tier 1. This gives you the opportunity to learn what questions investors will ask and what objections you might receive before you sit down with the big guns.
This didn’t work for us. The challenge with starting with “tier 3” funds is that the “tier 1” funds often have more context about your space (at least they should if you’ve tiered correctly) and therefore the quality of the questions they ask are far superior to the ones you’ve been prepping on from “tier 3” fund conversations.
Instead, we sought to understand the common objections investors would have about investing in our business through informal catch-up calls when we weren’t in fundraising mode. This enabled us to understand potential investors’ objections upfront without going through the “tier 3” to “tier 1” process while still addressing those objections directly. In these introductory conversations, we were frequently asked the following: "
15 investors talk about their investment cadence in H1 2023,Karan Bhasin,2023/07/02,"
As part of our ongoing coverage of VC performance in the first half of 2023, TechCrunch+ surveyed 15 investors about their investment cadence and their plans for the second half of the year.
As expected, it appears a good mix of investors wrote checks at the rate they’d aimed for, while others fell a bit short. However, there is a sense that a slower investment cadence is going to become the new norm. Rajeev Dham, partner at Sapphire Ventures, and Mark Grace, investor at M13, both noted that the rapid investment cadence of the pandemic years has passed, and the adjustment period has been a bumpy ride for some.
However, those who operated at a slower cadence seem to be favoring a more cautious approach. Gen Tsuchikawa, CEO of Sony Ventures, said, “We have always been selective in our investments, and we are keeping the cadence of those investments flexible for now.”
Dham also advocates prudence for the coming period. “Once we understand what the new operating cadence is of businesses and then apply the appropriate price, which we now all know what it is (what it has always been!), then we can act accordingly. The other massive shoe to drop is further retreat from the most active investors in the 2018–2021 era. The more they retreat, the more likely there is to be less capital in the system chasing startups, which also level sets on price.”
Grace has his eyes firmly set on the full-half of the glass: “I think dealmaking cadence will continue to rebound. You need to be an optimist in this industry!”
Logan Allin, managing partner and founder of Fin Capital, stated that his firm was the most active fintech investor across the globe in Q1 thanks to its focus on early-stage startups founded by repeat founders.
He gave us some insight into his firm’s confidence: “This accelerated rate of new company formation is a function of (a) Management teams turning over the reins to professional management to take the company public or exit via M&A or buyout, and (b) seasoned entrepreneurs with underwater options that are not worth sticking around for to vest further.”

Did your investing cadence meet your expectations? Did you exceed your targets or undershoot them?
The back half of 2022 was dead. Things suddenly picked up in late February, and we felt it across the board. We made investments in Anthropic and Typeface and have continued at a fairly rapid pace since then. In Q2, we made several commitments, including two life sciences companies, one digital health, one hard tech company and a few SaaS companies. So, the end of Q1 picked up and Q2 really accelerated. We even had a term sheet in on a company and we won the deal, but it got acquired.
Is your firm planning on accelerating its dealmaking cadence in the back half of 2023? Why or why not?
Q2 was already busy and active for us, but mainly at the early stage. We have three funds: an incubation fund (Menlo Labs), which has been steady state; our Venture Fund, which picked up significantly in Q2; and our Inflection Fund (defined as early growth in companies with $3 million to $10 million ARR), which was still slow in Q2.
We expect Labs and the Venture Fund to remain just as busy as they have been from a pacing standpoint, but [we] expect the Inflection Fund will accelerate significantly in the back half of the year. About 80% of the companies in our sweet spot haven’t raised in two-plus years, and many will need to come back to market in 2H 2023. We’re excited about that segment of the market, where there is early but predictable scale and where valuations have settled substantially.
There will be many flat and down rounds, and there should be no stigma around that. The multiples VCs will use to value companies will be different, but that doesn’t change whether a business is good or not. So we’ll all get past valuation and focus on building great companies.
Sheila Gulati, managing director, Tola Capital
Did your investing cadence meet your expectations? Did you exceed your targets or undershoot them?
Our current focus is AI, primarily in the areas of domain-specific foundation models, AI/ML tooling, AI SaaS applications, AI compliance and governance, and AI security tools.
We have closed deals in these spaces in 2023, but the frenzy around AI has definitely meant a lot of capital has rushed into this market. The result has been that we have backed off certain deals based on valuation, and we expect this to continue in the AI world. It has meant fewer deals overall.
Is your firm planning on accelerating its dealmaking cadence in the back half of 2023? Why or why not?
We’re focused on doing the right deals. Generational companies will emerge from this transformative period defined by AI, but there will be many losers, too. "
Fintech M&A gets a big boost with Visa-Pismo deal,Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/07/02,"
It was a very busy week in the world of fintech, which certainly kept us on our toes. We covered a couple of notable M&A deals (including one of the biggest of the year so far), a different kind of financial services startup aimed at undocumented immigrants, Brex’s official recommitment to the startup community and more.
End-of-quarter frenzy
As the generative AI craze rages on, Ramp acquires customer support startup Cohere.io
We started the week with some M&A news out of corporate spend management company Ramp. The team shared with us exclusively that it had scooped up an AI-powered customer support called Cohere.io, which had raised $3.5 million in seed funding over its lifetime from backers such as Initialized Capital, Y Combinator and…Ramp co-founders Eric Glyman and Karim Atiyeh. Notably, Ramp (and companies like Deel and Rippling) were also customers. Glyman told us that it was evident from early on that once his company started using Cohere.io, “suddenly the majority of tickets were being answered properly in an automated fashion. […] It actually really worked,” he said. “The technical sophistication of the team was far beyond anything we had ever seen.”
Visa acquires Brazilian fintech startup Pismo in $1B blockbuster deal
Then later in the week came confirmation of one of the biggest, if not the biggest, fintech M&A deals of the year. It was rumored for months that Visa, Mastercard and potentially a bank and private equity firm were all courting Brazilian payments infrastructure startup Pismo. The acquisition was definitely a coup for the Latin American startup community, considering that Visa could have likely considered companies from all over the world. Pismo has apparently seen some explosive growth in recent years — jumping from 10 million accounts at the end of 2020 to 80 million today. Also, at the beginning of 2021, Pismo was doing less than $1 billion per month in transaction volume compared to processing $40 billion in transaction volumes annually today.
However, as noted by KBW managing director Sanjay Sakhrani, the $1 billion purchase price is roughly 30% below the $1.4 billion that Visa was rumored to have offered for Pismo earlier this year. We don’t know what Pismo was valued at when it raised $108 million in a round co-led by SoftBank, Amazon and Accel in 2021. But Accel partner Ethan Choi told us the sales price was “a very strategic multiple.”
Sakhrani also said in a report that in addition to beefing up Visa’s issuer processing capabilities across card products, Pismo also brings “differentiated core banking capabilities and will allow Visa to provide connectivity and support to emerging payment rails like Pix in Brazil.”
The last week in recent memory where we remember seeing such a flurry of fintech M&A activity was in mid-January, when Jonah Crane, partner at Klaros Group, predicted we would continue to see more acquisitions in 2023 thanks to the continued venture slowdown and practically dead IPO and SPAC markets. And according to CB Insights, fintech M&A exits rebounded in the first quarter, but not as much as one might have expected. They were up 15% QoQ to 172 deals. Most of Q1’23’s top M&A deals involved fintechs based outside of the U.S. For the first time in the previous year, the top M&A valuation fell below $500 million.
Side note: The acquisition represented a rare win for SoftBank, which has had a number of high-profile disappointments in recent years with investments in the likes of WeWork, the now defunct Katerra and FTX. Alex and I talk more about that on Friday’s episode of Equity Podcast here.
Brex refocuses on startups with hire of SVB veteran, ex-a16z operating partner
Last summer, Brex made headlines for announcing it would stop serving SMBs and non-funded startups. This summer, it’s making headlines for pledging its recommitment to the startup community. After Silicon Valley Bank imploded in March, Brex (along with the likes of Arc and Mercury) saw an influx of new customers. Specifically, the company says it opened 4,000 new accounts and received $2 billion in deposits in the first week after the SVB shutdown alone. That obviously led the company to rethink its strategy. Last week, Brex told us exclusively that it had hired Jason Mok, a former operating partner at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and 16-plus-year veteran of Silicon Valley Bank to serve as its head of startups. I talked with Mok about his previous experience and how he thinks that will help him in his new role, which includes providing more “Brex ambassadors” who can serve as the face of the brand that founders, operators and VCs can go to for advice, perspective and connections to other founders.
No SSN, no problem, says Maza, a fintech startup aimed at undocumented immigrants
I also wrote about Maza, a fintech startup that raised $8 million in a seed-funding round led by a16z to help undocumented immigrants get an ITIN (individual tax identification number) and access the U.S. financial system. TechCrunch has previously reported on a number of startups focused on the immigrant community — including Welcome Technologies, Fair, Majority and TomoCredit. (It’s unclear whether Fair is still around considering its website appears to no longer exist or is down.) But what makes Maza different is its focus on undocumented immigrants specifically. “We’re doing much more than just providing a bank account — we’re really giving immigrants a stable and legal financial foundation from which to build credit and wealth indefinitely,” said co-founder and COO Robbie Figueroa.
Fun fact: The name Maza came from a song about perseverance called “La Maza” that co-founder and CEO Luciano Arango used to listen to with his mom growing up.
Nubank’s CEO explains what the US could learn from LatAm fintech
In one of the Equity podcasts this week, I spoke with David Vélez, the co-founder and CEO of digital bank giant Nubank. (Did you know it has a market cap of  $37 billion?!) Digital banking is always top-of-mind over here at TechCrunch, so we quickly got into discussing Nubank’s strategy for achieving profitability and how the company has been able to maintain that in a challenging macroeconomic environment. Vélez also compared and contrasted the Latin American and U.S. fintech markets and dished on how he sees banking evolving in the next few years. One particularly interesting part of the conversation, as one Equity listener pointed out: Vélez’s reasoning for only expanding Nubank in three markets over 10 years: “‘I am extremely wary of any deck where people tell me ‘18 markets in 2 years.’”

Deal Dive: Betting on the sports betting market,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/07/01,"
If you live in a state where online sports betting is legal, companies like FanDuel, Caesars Sportsbook and DraftKings don’t let you forget it. They dominate TV ad slots during sports games and seemingly everywhere else, too. They give the mirage that the market is saturated with no room for startups. Betr, well, wouldn’t bet on that.
Betr co-founder and CEO Joey Levy thinks there is still space for companies that bring a new approach and business model to online sports betting. What makes Betr stand out, though, is that it’s built its user interface to be more accessible for the casual sports bettor as opposed to someone who spends all day poring over stats. It also focuses on microbets, so instead of predicting who wins the whole game, users can bet on things like how many free throws Nikola Jokić will get the next time he’s up at the line.
The startup just announced a $35 million Series A2 round with a $300 million pre-money valuation. The round was led by IA Sports Ventures and Eberg Capital and also included existing investors. Betr was founded in 2022 and is live in two states so far, Ohio and Massachusetts.
This is Levy’s third sports betting startup. His first, Draftpot, was a daily fantasy platform that was acquired in 2017. His second, Simplebet, is still running to provide the back-end infrastructure needed to power microbets. But through those he noticed a problem he thinks Betr can solve: Most online sports-betting apps were designed for sports bettors not sports fans.

This week in food tech: Upside Foods wastes no time debuting its cultivated chicken,Christine Hall,2023/07/01,"
If you’re adventurous with your food, or just like to keep up with the fast-moving food tech industry, here’s a roundup of this week’s stories and some notable news we weren’t able to cover.
Upside Foods gets on the plate
In what is perhaps the first ever sale of cultivated meat in the United States, Upside Foods said it is unveiling its whole-textured product at Chef Dominique Crenn’s restaurant Bar Crenn in San Francisco today. This comes just a week after gaining approval to sell its cell-cultivated chicken product in the U.S.
Upside’s cultivated chicken will be fried in a tempura batter, drizzled with a burnt chili aioli and garnished with edible flowers and greens. Incidentally, this is the first time Bar Crenn is putting meat on its menu since it was removed in 2018, according to the company. The cultivated chicken will be incorporated into additional dishes at the restaurant through a series of ongoing monthly services that will commence later this year.

We’ve officially entered a new era of ‘cultivated’ meat production

As seen on TechCrunch
Bluu Seafood reels in $17.5M to bring cultivated fish products to market
Paul reported on Bluu Seafood’s new €16 million ($17.5 million) Series A round of funding. The German company is creating cultivated fish products and unveiled its first products last August, which included a line of fish sticks and fish balls.
Joyful Ventures debuts with $23M focused on investment in sustainable protein startups
Thriving startups in the alternative protein sector now have a new place to pitch. Venture capital firm Joyful Ventures unveiled its new fund. Joyful was co-founded by Jennifer Stojkovic, Milo Runkle and Blaine Vess. The company has already made two investments from the fund, including New School Foods and Orbillion Bio.
Omeat emerges from stealth with beefy tech approach to cultivated meat growth media
Omeat, a cultivated meat startup out of Los Angeles, believes it has cracked the code on how to reduce the traditionally high costs to scale production of cultivated meat via a process that uses regenerative factors extracted humanely from cow plasma to make growth media.
BetterBrand’s new dough raises company’s valuation to over $170M
BetterBrand, a food tech company known for creating “The Better Bagel,” closed on $6 million of Series A capital at a pre-money valuation of $170 million. BetterBrand’s proprietary “grain-changing” technology combines non-GMO and clean label ingredients to create a line of better-for-you baked goods.
Make way for a new vegan protein on the menu
Natasha writes about Finnish startup Solar Foods’ alternative protein, Solein, which has been blended into a custom (vegan) chocolate gelato at a restaurant in Singapore. It’s not your average scoop, she says.

Bluu Seafood reels in $17.5M to bring cultivated fish products to market

Time to make the meat
In April, we ran a commentary focused on whether additional capacity for precision fermentation, which is a method that uses bioreactors to make cultivated meat, is what was really needed to advance the industry and bring costs down.
For those in the camp of more biomanufacturing facilities, Liberation Labs is contributing to that. This week, the company broke ground on its first facility in Indiana that, when fully up and running, will have a capacity to make up to 600,000 liters of bio-based proteins.
Impossible vs. Motif, take 20
During the last roundup, I mentioned the year-old lawsuit between Impossible Foods and Motif FoodWorks became interesting when it was uncovered that Motif suspected Impossible hired some private investigators who allegedly used fake identities to get information on Motif products.
Ultimately a court ruled that this strategy by Impossible did not break any rules, according to the story.
While that was a mark for Impossible, the newest thing to come out is a mark for Motif: The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board agreed to review Impossible’s intellectual property related to using heme to create plant-based meat substitutes. More here.

Are corporations too influential?,Haje Jan Kamps,2023/06/30,"
Welcome to Startups Weekly. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.
This week, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about how some of the biggest companies in the world have as much — if not more — power than entire countries. Most countries, at least, have some level of democratic oversight, but that isn’t true in the same way for companies. My question, then: In a world where the policies of, say, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter become de facto standards all around the world, should we have a greater degree of say (TC+) in what those policies are?
The other thing that’s kept me busy this week is fundraising. Alex talked with 11 VCs (TC+) about how hard it was for their companies to raise so far this year. Meanwhile, I talked with a number of founders who were really struggling to raise money. The truth is, the founders struggling the most have three things in common (TC+).
Now let’s take a look at what happened in the world of startups this week.
Notes from the security frontlines
Image Credits: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch
The most popular story on TechCrunch in the past week was one of my own, which came with a curious backstory: Flipper Devices was founded in Moscow, Russia, in 2020, by a Ukrainian founder and a largely Russian team. I ran the headline that a “Russian hacking device” had made $80 million worth of sales, only for a bunch of PR people to get very upset with me for calling the company, which was founded in Russia and whose team is still 90% Russian, Russian. Don’t get me wrong, I get why a company making a hacking device might not want to be associated with Russia — and the company has gone to great lengths to scrub any traces of that connection from the internet. The whole story was pretty weird, and concluded with me getting an unsolicited scan of the founder’s (Ukrainian) password in my email inbox. Very curious indeed.
That sounds secure…: In a beacon of “here’s what not to do,” Lorenzo reports that an Illinois high school accidentally changed every student’s password to ‘Ch@ngeme!’. The problem? For a moment there, every student knew every other student’s password. D’oh.
Stupid and pointless: Prosecutors called for the British hacker who was responsible for the 2020 Twitter breach to serve at least seven years. Zack reports that the hacker was sentenced to 5 years behind bars. The convicted hacker described his crimes as “stupid and pointless.” Who am I to disagree?
Watching the watchers: Zack reports that Polish-developed stalkerware LetMeSpy, a phone-tracking app, says it was hacked. The leaked data included years of victims’ call logs and text messages dating back to 2013.
News you can touch. Yep, it’s hardware.

A ton of interesting things happened in startup hardware land this week. Uplift Labs signed an interesting deal with Major League Baseball to use the startup’s 3D motion tracking tech to help scout for promising players.
Fast on the heels of its previous $14 million fundraise, Realtime Robotics raised another $10 million or so, representing the third close on what now seems like a never-ending Series A financing for the manufacturing automation startup.
Apropos robotics, Brian also had a fascinating story today on how robots are learning from watching YouTube videos. If my YouTube recommendations are anything to go by, every robot in the world will very soon be expert woodworkers and do very stupid things with explosives.
Who’s a good bot? That’s right, you’re a good bot: In a, “Geez, I feel safer already” type moment, Brian reports that the House GOP discussed the use of robot dogs to patrol U.S. borders.
It flies and it counts. That’s just what it does: Kate reports that B Garage raised $20 million for its warehouse inventory drones. And as we’re talking about flying inventory drones, Brian reported that Gather AI bought drone inventory competitor Ware.
Walking? Feh, check the webcam: The lazy among us may have pointed a webcam at the oven to keep an eye on a pizza, but Devin reports that Lilz takes the same concept to a whole ‘nother level, bringing its gauge-watching smart cameras to the U.S. and raising $4 million.
Startups that are going places
Image Credits: Joby Aviation
Raise your hand if you saw this one coming (while I sit on my hands, because I really did not) — but it seems like the Tesla charging standard is gaining a foothold very quickly. First, Texas said that state-funded EV chargers had to include Tesla plugs (now known as the North American Charging Standards, or NACS), and it seems like Washington state may be following suit.
Wheeee: You couldn’t force me on board one of these things with a gun, but Joby Aviation has reasons to celebrate, as Rebecca reports that the company received a permit to fly its first eVTOL built on a production line.
Pulling the e-brake: Kate reports that Singapore’s ride-hailing firm Grab lays off over 1,100 employees, representing around 11% of its staff — its first big round of layoffs since 2020.
End of the road for Lordstown: It’s been an uphill battle for Lordstown Motors. Rebecca reports that the company is suing Foxconn, claiming fraudulent conduct that “destroyed” the American company’s business. Over on TC+, Alex ponders that there’s not a lot of SPAC deals left that didn’t come crashing down painfully and spectacularly. Canoo, anyone?
Despite all its rage, it is still just a car in a cage: Even as Lordstown implodes and a lot of the other EV companies are struggling, Faraday Future raises $90 million to keep itself alive.

Secretive hardware startup Humane’s first product is the Ai Pin,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/30,"
Humane, the startup launched by ex-Apple design and engineering duo Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, today revealed details about its first product: The Humane Ai Pin.
It’s been a long time coming. Humane has kept its work more or less under wraps since 2018, its founding year, unveiling no products but bringing on dozens of ex-Apple employees responsible for the iPhone’s touchscreen keyboard, elements of Apple’s industrial design and infrastructure for Apple services like iCloud, Apple Pay and Home.
Humane’s product, as it turns out, is a wearable gadget with a projected display and AI-powered features. Chaudhri gave a live demo of the device onstage during a TED Talk in April, but a press release issued today provides a few additional details.
“The [AI Pin is a] connected and intelligent clothing-based wearable device uses a range of sensors that enable contextual and ambient compute interactions,” the release reads. “The Ai Pin is a type of standalone device with a software platform that harnesses the power of Ai to enable innovative personal computing experiences.”
Stripping away the marketing jargon, the Ai Pin will be able to — assuming Humane’s claims hold water — perform many of the tasks a smartphone can, but with fewer gestures and voice commands required. Activated with a tap, the Ai Pin, designed to clip to a breast pocket, can offer a summary of emails and calendar invites, translate between languages and answer and place phone calls.
Thanks to a camera and computer vision-powered software, the Ai Pin can also recognize objects around it, such as food nutrition labels. And using a built-in projector and depth sensor, it can project an interactive interface onto nearby surfaces, like the palm of a hand or the surface of a table.

“Our Ai Pin presents an opportunity for people to take AI with them everywhere and to unlock a new era of personal mobile computing which is seamless, screenless, and sensing,” Chaudhri and Bongiorno said in a canned statement.
Humane also revealed today that it’s collaborating with Qualcomm to develop the Ai Pin’s internal hardware. An unnamed chip from Qualcomm’s Snapdragon series will power the wearable; Human’s promising more info to come later in the year ahead of the device’s launch.
“Humane’s Ai Pin will deliver a superior AI experience,” Qualcomm SVP of product management Ziad Asghar was quoted as saying in the release: “With the advent of generative AI, Humane’s Ai Pin and user experience takes excellent advantage of some of the key strengths of on-device AI and uses real-time contextual information to provide the user with exciting, personalized AI use cases.”
Humane previously announced that it’s partnering with SK Networks and Microsoft to bring its platform and services to market, with Microsoft supplying the cloud processing power and SK Networks handling distribution. Meanwhile, Humane’s collaborating with OpenAI to integrate its tech into the startup’s device — whatever form it ends up taking, exactly. LG, for its part, is working with Humane on R&D projects for the next phase of its product life cycle as well as adapting Humane’s tech for smart home devices. And Volvo’s teaming up with Humane on a potential automotive industry offering.

"TechCrunch+ roundup: Vertical AI, crypto losses decline, machine learning investor survey",Walter Thompson,2023/06/30,"
According to Paris Heymann, a partner at Index Ventures, the current wave of AI-powered products and services can be sorted into three layers:

Foundational models
AI infrastructure
AI applications

“Some of these applications will be broadly horizontal,” he writes in TC+, “but many AI applications will also be vertical, or industry-focused.”

The generative AI land rush has created a new challenge: How can enterprises use proprietary data to build powerful models while maintaining security and privacy?
“Protecting training data and models must be the top priority,” says Anjuna CEO and co-founder Ayal Yogev.
“It’s no longer sufficient to encrypt fields in databases or rows on a form.”

Generative AI startup Typeface emerged from stealth this year, but the $100 million Series B round that just boosted it to a billion-dollar valuation signals that “big tech companies are busy wielding their most powerful weapons: checkbooks,” writes Alex Wilhelm.
In The Exchange, he examines how companies like Microsoft, Salesforce and other corporate venture entities are buying their way into AI-adjacent products and services.
“So long as your founding team has an AI pedigree and a plan to sell lots of AI tech to big companies, you can expect a flood of cash from big tech funds and traditional venture investors alike.”

Are the rug pulls, exploits and pump-and-dump schemes that have scammed so many crypto consumers becoming a thing of the past?
According to a report by De.Fi that used information from REKT, “losses in the second quarter were 55% narrower than in Q1 2023, when the industry lost a whopping $462.3 million to hacks and scams,” writes Jacquelyn Melinek.

Dear Sophie,
Our startup employs about 30 people globally through a combination of direct and co-employment based on their country.
Over the last year and a half or so, we helped several team members relocate from Ukraine and Russia to various non-Schengen countries such as Georgia, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and Uzbekistan.
We realize it’s more expensive if we bring these employees to the U.S., but our startup will be more successful. How do we bring them here?

Fund of funds are starting to play a different role for venture LPs

After reviewing the last few years of declining fund of funds activity, Rebecca Szkutak found that several factors are leading limited partners to look elsewhere.
“There has been way more opportunity to invest in a VC than there has ever been in the past,” said Kyle Stanford, a senior venture analyst at PitchBook.
“For new LPs coming into the market, they didn’t need to go to a fund of funds to get access.”

Voice.ai raises $6M as its real-time voice changer approaches 500K users,Ingrid Lunden,2023/06/30,"
Services like Midjourney and ChatGPT have pushed the boundaries of how AI can create images and text out of basic text prompts. Now, audio appears to be the inevitable next frontier. Music generation based on word prompts, AI tutors for language learning and voice simulators have all seen developments in recent months. Voice.ai hopes to be a part of that conversation (heh) with technology that lets users change (and disguise) their voices in real time, and now it has raised its first outside funding on the heels of early growth.
With more than 480,000 users and a library of more than 50,000 voice filters, Voice.ai has picked up $6 million, funding that it plans to use to take its voice changing tech into new places.
Mucker Capital and M13 are leading the round. Before now, Voice.ai has grown by word of mouth — the startup has a Discord channel with more than 120,000 people — on the back of $3 million in self-funding.
Currently the company’s tools — available as apps for Mac, PC, Android and iOS — are getting adopted by gamers, content creators, Vtubers and others on TikTok, Zoom, Discord, Minecraft, GTA5, Fortnite, Valorant, League of Legends, Among Us, Skype, WhatsApp and other platforms. The Voice.ai interface lets them create a new voice, or select from some 50,000 different pre-created voices (created and shared by users like themselves), which can be used as-is or modified, to use live in supported platforms, or for recordings.
The plan is to use the funding to hire more technical talent and to build new SDKs and APIs to work with further platforms like Meta, Unreal and Unity; bring on multi-language support; and add in new applications like singing where voice is center stage.
The startup doesn’t single it out, but it will be interesting to see if it uses some of the funding also to increase server capacity.
That is no small burden. Anecdotally, we’ve heard that GPU pain is one of the biggest gating factors in how a lot of AI apps are able to scale at the moment. (It’s partly why you’re seeing big deals being made that include strategics providing processing and server capacity.)
For Voice.ai specifically, your voice is processed locally and channeled into wherever it will be used through what founder and CEO Heath Ahrens described to me as a “virtual audio cable.” But when you look at reviews of its apps, a common lament is that when you sign up you are put on a waitlist because “overwhelming demand has our servers at max capacity” with a promise that you’ll be informed when the service increases that capacity.
There are dozens of speech-to-voice and voice-to-speech services in the market today, and already a lot of activity among them: Last year Spotify acquired Sonantic and Snap bought an AI voice assistant even earlier than that; another startup, Sanas, is working on changing your accent and there are the voice simulators Murf and Acapela, among many others. Voice.ai counts itself in the same general category as Respeecher and ElevenLabs, two voice-to-voice AI startups, letting users apply masks to tweak or completely transform their voices — in some cases creating completely synthetic voices in place of the real thing.
Respeecher, founded and based in Ukraine, made a name for itself by helping build a new Darth Vader voice for new Star Wars installments, based on how James Earl Jones sounded 45 years ago when he originated the role. (In keeping with a character hell-bent on destroying worlds, Darth’s voice was delivered to the Hollywood client from its offices in Ukraine as Russia marched into the country.)
ElevenLabs — famously (or infamously as the case may be) — has built a platform that is frighteningly good at cloning voices, and earlier this month it picked up its most recent funding round of $19 million from a group of big-name investors.
Voice.ai is trying, in that mix, to position itself as the AI voice modifying app for Everyman.
“There are plenty of companies that are trying to provide a different flavor of voice tech to businesses,” Ahrens told TechCrunch in an email (ironically, it wasn’t possible to arrange a live interview with him). Ahrens has some experience with the building of B2B AI tech: his two previous companies — iSpeech for text-to-speech and Haystack for face recognition — are built around API offerings.
“What sets Voice.ai apart is that we are focused on bringing tech that was previously reserved for enterprise companies directly into the hands of consumers in an affordable fashion.” Many users, he noted, “come to us from classical DSP voice changers and voice modulators which they had been using in the past and which are still popular among many gamers and streamers.”
“Affordable” comes in two tiers, with most users now on a free service that requires them to opt in to providing computational power to train Voice.ai’s models, with its service built on its own private data set comprised of “millions of unique users.” No pricing is provided on the site: we’re asking for those details.
“We believe in making technology accessible and plan on working together with the open source community to democratize Voice AI technology,” added Ahrens.
Voice.ai also claims it takes what is a fundamentally different approach to the challenge of changing a voice, tapping into some of the ethos that has built up around the use of avatars by Vtubers, gamers and others online.
“Most voice AI companies that are coming into the space try to build scalable enterprise focused text-to-speech solutions or expensive voice-to-voice services for production studios,” Ahrens said. “We start from the opposite spectrum and try to deliver value to individuals who are looking to expand how they sound online. The core value proposition of our speech-to-speech AI isn’t that it can perfectly replicate any given person. It’s that it retains the core elements of a user’s speech: their emotion, pacing and emphasis while replacing the sound of the voice, in order to create a completely unique new end result, in real-time.”
It might be because of how the demographics in interactive platforms like gaming skew, but for now Voice.ai’s audience is 70% male versus 30% female with new categories opening not just around who is using the tech, but why.
That includes not just those using avatars and building voices to match them, or those looking for more privacy protection, but also, he said, “transgender users who can represent themselves with voices that match their identity, as well as users exploring completely new online personas for themselves.”
There is already a base of users tapping into Voice.ai’s direct-to-consumer offerings, but one of the reasons why Mucker is investing in the startup is because it believes that there is an opportunity to build out a network of developers using and integrating its tech.
“Voice.ai is poised to revolutionize the AI developer community in a manner akin to AdMob’s impact on the mobile app developer community,” said Omar Hamoui, a partner at lead investor Mucker Capital. (Hamoui previously founded the mobile ad startup AdMob, eventually acquired by Google, so he has some direct experience building mobile developer tools.) “By offering user-friendly solutions that were once exclusive to large enterprises, Voice.ai aims to democratize access for developers worldwide.”
Karl Alomar, the former COO of Digital Ocean, who led the investment for M13, said investors will be taking an active role in the next stage of development. “At Digital Ocean too we saw the value of building a community of builders by builders,” he said. “We’re excited for creators and developers to build on the Voice.ai platform.”

"Well done, Pismo and Visa! You gave SoftBank a win",Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/30,"

Hello, and welcome back to Equity, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.

All the cool kids are filling out the Equity listener survey. We want to hear from you! 

Mary Ann and Alex are back for another busy news week chock full of deals to chew through.
Here’s the rundown:

Deals of the Week: We think that the idea behind the recently funded Honey Homes is excellent, but we’re split about the cost. We also went over Gusto’s latest financial achievements and its plans to team up with Remote.
Fintech M&A: The biggest deal of the week in fintech was Visa’s purchase of  Pismo. We haven’t had unicorn-level acquisitions lately, so this one was welcome. Elsewhere in the space, Brex has brought on board a former SVB and a16z denizen, and Ramp bought Cohere.io (not this Cohere, the other one).
Other M&A: But those weren’t the only deals. Databricks bought MosaicML, IBM bought Apptio and ThoughtSpot has acquired Mode Analytics.
Help, my unicorn is starving: We closed with Alex’s look at the declining funding to unicorn and web3 startups, as well as Rebecca Szkutak’s latest on the secondary market in the process.

Equity will be back on Wednesday as we head off into yet another holiday weekend here in the U.S. when Alex will finally put his PTO to use. In the meantime, let’s catch up on Twitter @EquityPod. Talk soon!

For episode transcripts and more, head to Equity’s Simplecast website. 
Equity drops at 7:00 a.m. PT every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, so subscribe to us on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify and all the casts. TechCrunch also has a great show on crypto, a show that interviews founders, one that details how our stories come together and more!

Pitch Deck Teardown: Super.com’s $60M Series C deck,Haje Jan Kamps,2023/06/30,"
It’s rare to find a pitch deck that forces me to dig deep to unearth something to criticize. The last time was with Orange’s seed deck, and in this week’s installment, I had to dive deep into the deck that Super.com used for its $60 million equity, plus $25 million venture debt round.

We’re looking for more unique pitch decks to tear down, so if you want to submit your own, here’s how you can do that. 

Slides in this deck
Super.com operated with a deck that tells a great story. It consists of 17 slides:

Cover slide
Mission slide
Traction slide 1
Traction slide 2
Team slide
Customers (interstitial slide)
Customer profile
Target customers / market size
A Savings Super App (interstitial slide)
  Why Now slide
  “Why a super app” slide
  Product slide
  Product road map slide
  User behavior slide
  Solution slide (“SuperCash is core to the experience”)
  Value Proposition slide (“Personalized Experiences”)
  The Ask slide

Three things to love
It’s hard to choose from all the stuff that works in this deck because the Super.com team really knocked it out of the park. But here are three highlights, which, incidentally, are the three most important slides you can have in a pitch deck. I’m utterly unsurprised that the company successfully managed to raise money.
You’ll raise if you’ve got traction…
Super.com starts its pitch with two traction slides in what can only be described as a masterful flex:
[Slide 3] Traction snapshot. Image Credits: Super.com[Slide 4] Traction over time. Image Credits: Super.comIn Slide 3, the company really flexes its stuff: 80 million customers, $1 billion in goods sold, and $150 million in terms of money saved for customers is beyond impressive. But then, in Slide 4, it shows how that growth is accelerating over time.
I’ve said it before: If you can show incredible traction, you don’t really need much else. Super.com does that, but it also has the goods for the rest of its story.
And an incredible team…
Super.com knows its strengths, and it segues from talking about its mission with its traction into a conversation about its team. Co-founders Henry Shi and Hussein Fazal have built a deep bench of incredible team members:
[Slide 5] What a team. Image Credits: Super.com 

			This is what an absolutely world-class team slide looks like.					


Each of the business verticals — travel, finance and the shop — are led by some world-class people, who are all CEO material in their own right. The company’s CFO is ex-Bank of America, and the CMO used to head marketing at Chase.
In addition, the company has attracted Joanne Bradford (president at Honey, COO at SoFi, and head of global partnerships at Pinterest) and Anan Kashyap (ex-CFO at Ethos and Poshmark) as independent board members.
In a huge market
Most of the time, I recommend doing a top-down TAM/SAM/SOM analysis to arrive at your market size, but Super.com chose a bottom-up approach:
[Slide 8] A slightly unusual market size slide in that it expresses it in customers, not dollars. Image Credits: Super.comThe company says that in the U.S. alone, 25% of the population is its target customer, and it can stretch to around 54% of the population if it expands its reach further.
If this were a pre-seed deck, I’d tell the founders to get it together and do better. But for a company that already has 80 million users, I want to know where it is going to grow. This slide does a good job of answering that question.
The company’s CEO, Fazal, gave me some important context:
We serve the customers who need it the most — typically lower household income, with no to low FICO scores, typically looking to save before they buy. There are about 183 million in that customer base. As we are seeing the wealth inequality gap in the U.S. growing, we have a unique opportunity to make a difference in the lives of more than 100 million Americans. We’re really well-positioned to do this given our active customer base: It’s customer-driven expansion.
That’s a hell of a story.
In the rest of this teardown, we’ll look at three things Super.com could have improved or done differently, along with its full pitch deck!
 "
Fidelity deepens valuation cut for Reddit and Discord,Manish Singh,2023/06/30,"
Fidelity has further slashed the estimated worth of its holding in the social platform Reddit and the chat app Discord as well as SaaS startup Gupshup, giving a preview into how one of the world’s largest asset managers sees the impact of the ongoing slowdown in the public market on privately-held startups.
Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund valued its holdings in Reddit at $15.4 million as of May 31, according to the fund’s monthly disclosure released Friday. That’s down 7.36% from the $16.6 million mark at April’s closure and altogether a slide of 45.4% since its investment in August 2021. The updated share value suggests a $5.5 billion valuation for Reddit.
Fidelity marked down the value of its Discord’s holding to $1.7 million, down 13.4% from a month ago and 47% since the $3.3 million initial investment. (Worth noting that the vast majority of markdown in the value of Reddit and Discord holdings by Fidelity predominantly occurred last year.)
Reddit, which is currently grappling a revolt from moderators of some popular subreddits over API cost changes, was valued at $10 billion when the social media giant attracted funds in August 2021. Discord raised funding in September 2021 at a valuation of $15 billion.
The financial giant also readjusted the value of its holding in Twitter to $6.86 million, up from $6.55 million from a month prior, but still down 65% since the original investment. It slashed its holding in SaaS startup Gupshup to $10.15 million, down from $11 million at April’s closure and 38% since the original investment.

Fertifa enables companies to offer fertility and reproductive health benefits,Catherine Shu,2023/06/30,"
The number of workplaces offering fertility and reproductive healthcare benefits are on the rise. Doing so can help companies become more competitive employers and bolster diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, for example by attracting more women and LGBTQ+ people. Based in London, Fertifa wants to enable more companies in Europe to offer reproductive benefits to workers. Its clients already include Lululemon, Meta, Bain Capital and Virgin. Today the startup announced it has raised a £5 million seed round (about $6.3 million USD) led by Notion Capital and Triple Point Ventures.
Other participants included Conviction, Calm/Storm, Tiny.vc, EQT Foundation and angel investors Eamon Jubbawy, Catherine and Jonathan Lenson, Dorothy Chou, Caroline and Mike Hudack and Scott Mackin. Existing investors Passion Capital, Lemonade Stand, Speedinvest, Monzo co-founder Tom Blomfield, Adam Knight and Jeremy Yap also returned for the round.
Fertifa was founded in 2019 by Tony Chen and Nick Kuan, who have since left the company but remain as shareholders. Eileen Burbidge, who led Fertifa’s pre-seed round along with her Passion Capital partner Malin Posern, joined in January 2022 as executive director to lead the startup and take charge of its business development. Fertifa currently has 22 employees.
Burbidge told TechCrunch in an email that she’s committed to Fertifa’s mission because she has been through “many reproductive health journeys,” in different places and stages of her life, while maintaining a career. These include two elective terminations in her 20s in California, two miscarriages in her 30s while living in London and three rounds of IVF in 2017. She is now perimenopausal and on HRT.
“Although I am an example that it’s possible to do (and to just grin and bear it or carry on), I’m also witness to what a difference it could make for employee wellbeing if individuals had support from their workplaces,” she said. “For example, I imagine how it might have helped me if I’d felt able to perhaps take a day off when I knew I was having a miscarriage at work or to tell someone even as GP of my own venture fund that I was going through IVF and having injections every day.” Access to reproductive healthcare was another concern. “As someone who grew up in America and now lives in the UK, I’m intensely sensitive to what appears to be a slow erosion or roll back of reproductive health rights (or even simply access to via public healthcare due to strains on the NHS and providers)—and I’m desperately keen to play a part in ensuring that as many people as possible have access to education and information so they may make the best choices for themselves,” Burbidge said.
Services Fertifa help facilitate include fertility preservation like egg, embryo and sperm freezing, fertility planning, IVF, IUI and ICSI treatment cycles, contraception, surrogacy and adoption, as well as care for menopause, endometriosis, PCOS, fibroids, STIs and men’s sexual health. Fertifa says it has increased revenues 10x over the last year, and also saved patients more than £1.5 million through employer-funded allowances. It’s also saved employers about £250,000 in compliance by identifying ineligible claims.
Other providers in the space include Peppy, which focuses on menopause, endometriosis and PCOS education in the United States, and reproductive health benefits platforms Apryl, Maven Clinic and Carrot. Fertifa says its differentiators are the scope of its offering, which includes educational resources that are available to employees through an app, clinical services from an in-house team lead by medical director Dr. Gidon Lieberman, reimbursement administration, prescription writing and fulfillment.
Burbidge added that one of Fertifa’s main “competitors” is inaction on the part of employers. Fertifa combats that by demonstrating the business case for providing reproductive health and wellbeing support. It is also often requested by employees through their networks or executive sponsors. “Another influence is when corporates see their competitors acting and investing in the space—and they realize they compete for talent with those companies, so need to meet the bar,” she added.
Fertifa works with companies of all sizes and monetizes through a per employee per month pricing model. It also offers reimbursement administration by charging a 5% fee on transaction volume, with an annual minimum.
The new funding will allow Fertifa to launch new services like treatment financing and scale up its enterprise sales. Its goal is to become the market leader in the U.K. within a year, and then the EMEA category leader by the end of 2024.
In a statement about the financing, Notion Capital partner Itxaso del Palacio said, “Although there is 8x more spent on assisted reproductive technology (ART, including IVF, IUI, ICSI, etc.) in Europe over the U.S., there are three unicorn companies in the U.S. [Maven Clinic, Progyny and Kindbody] and none in Europe. It’s clear there is a massive opportunity for a team with commitment to better outcomes to make a significant impact. We believe we have found this in Fertifa and are excited to see what can be achieved.”

Korea’s Alwayz aims to make online shopping fun again with $46M in funding,Kate Park,2023/06/29,"
Seoul-based e-commerce company Levit, an operator of the shopping app Alwayz, wants to make the shopping experience more entertaining and affordable. The two-year-old startup has recently raised $46 million in a Series B round of funding led by DST Global Partners with participation from new investor BOND and existing backers KB Investment, Mirae Asset Capital, Korea Investment Partners, GS Ventures, and Klim Ventures. With the latest round, Levit has raised a total of $67 million since its inception.
Alwayz offers a wide range of products, from daily groceries to home appliances and apparel to cosmetics. But it deviates from typical e-commerce platforms by incorporating social features like short videos and gamification into online shopping to draw customers. 
For example, users can earn rewards by playing games nurturing the pig character Don-Don-E, or receive crops in real life after successfully cultivating crops by playing a game called AI-Farm in its app. In addition, Alwayz recently introduced a “Shorts” feature that allows users to watch short videos and, in return, get discounts when shopping.  
It also attracts customers with low-price products. Users get discounts if they purchase products with other users or their friends on Alwayz. Alwayz’s C2M (consumer-to-manufacturer) model eliminates layers of distributors, including logistics, inventory and other intermediaries, allowing the app to offer high-quality products at lower prices. Most sellers on Alwayz are producers or manufacturers, according to the company.
“Our average product selling price is around 20% cheaper than the lowest prices on other e-commerce platforms,” chief executive officer and co-founder of Levit, Jaeyun Kang, said. “This has been made possible because lesser-known brands, which traditionally spent nearly 30-50% of the selling price on marketing in search-based [e-commerce] platforms, can now sell their products more efficiently on Alwayz through discovery-based shopping.” 
Levit says games and social features help users enter the Alwayz app daily and be exposed to various products, even if they do not immediately intend to buy. 
“As users enjoy the engaging experience on our platform, we leverage their high engagement to expose them to a range of items through our recommendation algorithms. This way, even if items are from lesser-known brands, customers can discover and buy them,” Kang said. Levit describes this user experience as a “discovery shopping experience.” 
When asked about how it ensures low-priced products are high-quality, the company CEO said its recommendation algorithms assess all items on Alwayz, using factors such as conversion and customer repurchase rates. “We ensure an item isn’t widely exposed until it has proven its quality, and this approach allows us to maintain the quality of items,” he said.

Since its launch in September 2021, the startup claims Alwayz has amassed 1 million users within three months and has reached 7 million users, 2.5 million monthly active users (MAUs) and 1.3 million daily active users (DAUs) in one and a half years. Alwayz aims to secure more than 12 million registered users, 5 million MAUs, and 3 million DAUs by the end of 2023, Kang said, adding that it has nearly 20,000 sellers registered on the app. 
Three founders of Levit — Kang, Sangwoo Park and Hyunjik Lee — have set their sights on two ambitious goals: establishing Levit as the leading e-commerce company in South Korea and capturing a significant share of the global discovery shopping market.
Alwayz has to compete with local peers, the likes of Coupang, Naver and Kurly, but its business model is more similar to the U.S.-listed e-commerce Pinduoduo and China-based AliExpress in terms of social features and lower-price products. 
The outfit, which has 20 people on the team, is planning to bring its platform to the U.S. market as early as this year. 
“Disruption in horizontal commerce is rare,” said Daegwon Chae, general partner of BOND. “Dislodging large incumbents requires meaningfully better, faster, cheaper experiences, which are difficult to achieve in a mature and efficient market. Alwayz has broken through with its relentless focus on user experience, engagement and value.”

11 VCs reveal how hard it was for their startups to fundraise in H1 2023,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/29,"
Everyone knows that raising venture capital has been harder for startups lately — unless you are building an AI startup, of course. But instead of only talking to founders, we’re flipping the script today.
We wanted to hear from investors how their portcos are handling a cash-light environment. To that end, TechCrunch+ recently asked 11 VCs how the first half of 2023 bore out for their investments.
From their answers, it appears a startup’s ability to fundraise in today’s climate is based on several key factors, including capital efficiency, the market and its needs.

Q2 failed to bring a funding reprieve for web3 startups and unicorns

How bad was H1 2023?
Menlo Ventures’ Matt Murphy was succinct when we asked how 2023 was shaping up for his firm’s portfolio companies: “Fundraising is challenging, full stop.” [Update: Menlo Ventures reached out to underscore that Matt’s comment here is in reference to the larger industry since less than 10% of their portfolio needed to raise in the last 12 months.]
“Challenging” is a good descriptor. So is “quiet,” which is how Jason Lemkin of SaaStr Fund put it. For Kaitlyn Doyle of TechNexus Venture Collaborative, the year has been mostly “flat rounds with companies trying to delay the valuation discussion.” She added that the second quarter felt a lot like the first, with investors and startups taking a “wait and see” stance.
Other investors had slightly brighter perspectives on H1 2023. Rex Salisbury of Cambrian Ventures felt the narrative that “this is a terrible time to raise” is simply not true, especially at the early stage. That sentiment matches what we’ve seen thus far in the data: The earlier a startup goes out to raise a round, the better its chances of landing a strong valuation. Indeed, the massive repricings of the public market are yet to trickle down to seed and pre-seed deals. "
Fund of funds are starting to play a different role for venture LPs,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/06/29,"
Fund of funds (FoF) were created to serve as a bridge for LPs to get access to managers they couldn’t back otherwise. But in an environment where funds are not seeing consistent support from their existing LPs, and there are more venture funds than ever, is their role still relevant?
Fund of funds fundraising — say that five times fast! — has declined for years. To compare, traditional U.S. venture firm fundraising set a record in 2022 with $162 billion. U.S.-based VC FoF raised just $400 million in the first quarter of 2023, according to PitchBook, and $3 billion in 2022. This compares to $24.4 billion in 2021 and $33.7 billion — the fundraising peak — in 2017.
It’s not surprising why many LPs have soured on the strategy, said Kyle Stanford, a senior venture analyst at PitchBook. For one, backers of these funds pay a mix of fees to both the FoF and the underlying commitments the FoF manager makes.
“LPs have that double layer of fees. And that extra time it takes after [an LP] invests in the fund of funds and then have it deployed is just something that LPs right now just don’t want to deal with,” Stanford told TechCrunch+.
And with there being so many new firms and funds in the market, the issues surrounding LPs not getting access to attractive VC funds is largely moot and that barrier isn’t really an issue anymore, he said. “There has been way more opportunity to invest in a VC than there has ever been in the past,” he said. “For new LPs coming into the market, they didn’t need to go to a fund of funds to get access.”
But to be clear, even if the funding numbers are down, FoF still holds a place in the future of venture — maybe just a different one than they did traditionally. Multiple firms have started innovating on the model, and FoF can still help LPs get access to the managers they can’t invest in otherwise, albeit for different reasons than before.

"Niantic lays off 230 employees, cancels NBA and Marvel games",Amanda Silberling,2023/06/29,"
Pokémon GO maker Niantic laid off 230 employees today, just one year after it laid off around 90 employees.
During last year’s layoffs, Niantic canceled four projects, including a Transformers game. Some Niantic games will meet the same fate this time around. After four months in the App Store, Niantic is shutting down NBA All-World; the company will also cancel production on a game based on the Marvel franchise.
“In the wake of the revenue surge we saw during Covid, we grew our headcount and related expenses in order to pursue growth more aggressively,” CEO John Hanke wrote in an email to employees, cross-posted to the company blog.
This has been a common refrain among the hundreds of tech companies that have conducted layoffs over the last year — companies claimed they overhired during the pandemic and now need to right-size their teams. In Niantic’s case, Hanke said that revenue has returned to pre-pandemic levels, and new projects have not delivered as much revenue as they would have hoped.
One such new project is Peridot, a Tamagotchi-like mobile game. Niantic’s first attempt at original IP since Ingress, Peridot launched in May. But according to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, Peridot has only made $1.4 million in gross in-app purchase revenue thus far.
Peridot is a technologically sophisticated game, complete with a robust breeding system that makes every players’ pets genetically unique. But players were disappointed at launch, since many of the game’s most exciting features are paywalled. The only way to hatch a new Peridot, for example, is to pay $5 for an in-game item. And once you pay to hatch a Peridot, you discover that you also have to pay if you want your new pet to have certain unique fur patterns or styles.
Pokémon GO is Niantic’s cash cow, pulling in more than $1 billion in in-app purchases each year since 2020. But players have also been feeling slighted by Niantic’s in-app purchase system.
At the end of March, Niantic nearly doubled the price of remote raid passes, an extremely popular in-app item. The company’s reasoning is that remote play options were essential during pandemic lockdowns, but they go against Niantic’s vision for the game, which is to get people outside to play together in person. Players don’t feel that way, though. Some even chose to boycott Pokémon GO in protest. While their protest may not have caught Niantic’s attention, its in-app purchase sales likely did.
Between July 2022 and March 2023, Sensor Tower data shows Niantic made an average of $70 million in gross in-app purchase revenue each month. In the three months since the remote raid pass price increase, Niantic has made an average of $53 million per month.
“The top priority is to keep Pokémon GO healthy and growing as a forever game,” Hanke wrote. Some Pokémon GO staff were impacted by these layoffs.
Though games like Peridot have not yet proved financially sustainable, Niantic has an entire business arm separate from its own games. Niantic’s Lightship AR developer kit makes it possible for any developer who knows how to use Unity to make AR games. Developers also have access to Niantic’s impressive visual positioning system (VPS), which lets users interact with local landmarks in their real-world surroundings.
Hanke even mentioned in his note to employees that the company wants to ramp up its focus on building for mixed-reality devices and AR glasses. So, if Niantic can’t seem to make a successful follow-up to Pokémon GO, maybe its developer tools can keep the company on the right track.

"Runway, a startup building generative AI for content creators, raises $141M",Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/29,"
It’s a big day for generative AI funding.
On the heels of Inflection AI landing a $1.3 billion investment, Runway, a startup building generative AI tools for multimedia content creators, today announced a $141 million extension to its Series C round from Google, Nvidia and Salesforce, among others.
Building on the Series C the company announced in December, Runway says that the new capital will be used to scale its in-house research efforts and expand Runway’s headcount.
“We’re focused on how we can continue pushing the boundaries of creativity,” Runway CEO Cris Valenzuela told TechCrunch via email. “The additional funding allows us to double down on this, innovating on new tools for artists and creators.”
Runway was founded in 2018 by Valenzuela, Alejandro Matamala and Anastasis Germanidis. Valenzuela met Matamala and Germanidis while in art school at NYU, where the trio came to realize that they shared a curiosity in AI’s creative potential. From there, Valenzuela, Matamala and Germanidis started building a suite of AI-powered tools geared toward moviemakers, cinematographers and photographers.
Runway’s focus has gradually shifted over the years to generative AI, particularly on the video side. Its current flagship product is Gen-2, an AI model that generates videos from text prompts or an existing image.

We tested Gen-2 and found it to be impressive — if somewhat wanting. But to Runway’s credit, Gen-2 — the follow-up to Runway’s Gen-1 model launched in February — is one of the first commercially available text-to-video models.
Runway has ambitions beyond building a toolset, to be clear. The startup recently founded Runway Studios, an entertainment division that serves as a production partner for enterprise clients. It also launched the AI Film Festival, an event Runway claims is one of the first dedicated to showcasing films produced in whole or in part by AI.
Valenzuela says that Runway’s customer base now spans Fortune 500 and Global 2000 companies, including New Balance and “millions” of individual creators.
The growing enterprise client base isn’t surprising, considering the massive hype around all forms of generative AI. In a recent FreshBooks survey, 25% of businesses said that they’re testing generative AI tools, while around 33% plan to try generative AI for work within the next year.
“Content creation today is very expensive and time consuming,” he added. “We want to help bring those cost and time factors as close to zero as possible, especially as companies’ content needs are only increasing . . . [Our goal is to] reimagine content creation and [build] a new type of creative suite, the generative suite.”
The Series C extension — which values Runway at $1.5 billion, a source familiar with the matter tells TechCrunch — brings the company’s total raised to $237 million. It makes Runway one of the better-funded generative AI startups out there, in league with Cohere, Character.ai ($150 million) and Stability AI (~$100 million).

"Thrive Capital doubles down on Clair, a fintech helping frontline workers get paid instantly",Christine Hall,2023/07/06,"
After developing a free earned-wage advance offering for frontline workers two years ago, fintech company Clair is back with a new tool to help workers get paid after completing a shift and receiving $25 million in new equity funding.
The round was led by Thrive Capital and includes Upfront Ventures and Kairos. Clair’s total venture-backed funds now rise to $45 million, according to Nico Simko, co-founder and CEO of Clair. As part of the investment, Michael Presser, investing partner at Kairos, was appointed as a board observer.

The company also announced $150 million as part of a new consumer lending program from partner bank Pathward, which holds the FDIC-insured accounts for Clair and provides the wage advances to frontline workers. Clair is facilitating loans that Pathward issues directly to Clair’s customers when they take a wage advance, with the lending between Pathward and the customers, according to the company.
Clair currently works with over 10,000 employers, workforce management systems and payroll and over 50,000 workers. Employees will see Clair through those existing employer systems that allow you to select your schedule separate from your payroll system. Employers can onboard employees and see payroll data. Employees can download the Clair app and conduct financial activities, including savings, check printing and the ability to withdraw funds for free through ATMs.
Simko touts the company’s new offering as “the first free on-demand pay solution” where users can withdraw funds immediately for the money they’ve earned but not yet received, instantly into their account.
“We’re the first provider that went to a bank and convinced the bank to do those advances, basically as micro loans, $50 loans,” Simko said. “Most early-stage, on-demand pay companies are the ones advancing the funds. By convincing a bank to do this, it gives regulatory certainty to our partners and consumers because there is a national bank backing it.”
He explained that having a bank make the advances “fueled our growth, which included 10x revenue growth over the past year,” and provided security measures for employers still thinking about the demise of Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank.
Simko intends to deploy the new capital into meeting demand for Clair’s backlog of customers. And while it is focused on workforce management and payroll companies, the company has received some inbound requests from larger businesses that Simko aims to address.
Clair is also launching a new offering for employers called Clair for Employers, which is a way for them to offer free, holistic financial wellness benefits to their employees. The offering integrates with a companies’ payroll providers, and employees of companies using it can also access additional features in their Clair accounts, including 3% cash back on gas and groceries purchased on their Clair Debit Mastercard.
In addition, the company is looking at other offerings, including a dynamic 401(k) and health savings account.
“With financial services tied to payroll and workforce management, the sky’s the limit,” Simko said. “Most of these need to be tied to a bank and payroll system, and since we have these deep kinds of HR integrations, the vision of Clair is to build the best bank for America’s workforce.”
Editor’s note, July 6, 2023, 8:23 a.m.: Story updated to reflect that the $150 million is not debt funding, but a consumer lending program.

Dear Sophie,
I just found out that I’ve been selected as a trainee in the J-1 exchange program. 
I’m currently in the U.S. on a B-1/B-2 visitor visa. The sponsoring company would like me to start in August. I heard it can take several months to change my status to a J-1. Is there a way to get a J-1 faster? 
Is there anything I should know about the J-1, particularly if I later decide to stay in the U.S. once the J-1 program ends?
— Techie Trainee
Dear Techie,
Congratulations on being selected as a J-1 educational and cultural exchange trainee!
The purpose of the J-1 is to exchange knowledge between countries. Check out my podcast that provides an overview of the J-1 as well as the waiver process. The J-1 visa is intended for people from around the globe to work or study in the U.S. and then take their newly acquired knowledge and skills back to their home country.
The Trainee J-1 usually lasts 18 months. Some J-1 holders are required to return to their home country for at least two years once their J-1 status ends. The waiver process can be particularly tricky. I recommend you consult an immigration attorney before you begin your program to confirm if you are subject to the two-year foreign residency requirement. They can also help you with any J-1 change of status or waiver application as necessary.
Good news: USCIS (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services) just rolled out premium processing for J-1 changes of status, shortening the process for individuals currently inside the United States!

Keep in mind: non-immigrant intent
Most U.S. visas such as the B-1/B-2 for visitors, J-1 for exchange visitors, and F-1 for students require their holders to have non-immigrant intent: it’s your job to prove to the U.S. government that you plan to depart the United States at the end of your program. Evidence of immigrant intent — your intention to live permanently in the U.S. by obtaining a green card — is cause for immigration officials to deny your visa. Other factors, like having a significant other who is a U.S. citizen or stating that you are planning to work in the U.S. long-term, could also be interpreted as evidence of your immigrant intent.
For the J-1, you will need to demonstrate to immigration officials that you intend to eventually return to your home country by maintaining a residence in your country or showing you have ties to your country of residence. The reason the State Department administers this program is to promote the flow of knowledge around the world. (Remember, before the internet, we generally had to physically travel to share knowledge, information, and network with people in other countries!)
How to get a J-1
After you enroll in a program, it will issue you a Form DS-2019, which is the Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor (J-1) Status. Recently, most people have been applying for new J-1 visas at the consulate and receive a multiple-entry visa. The duration is based on whatever reciprocity agreements the State Department has in place with the government of your country of citizenship. "
Brinc launches new program for climate tech startups,Catherine Shu,2023/07/05,"
Brinc, the Hong Kong–based accelerator backed by investors like Animoca Brands, is launching a new program for fledgling climate tech startups. The three-month program is tailored for founders who are focused on carbon dioxide removal (CDR). They will receive fundraising support, guidance on how to scale up and introductions to Brinc’s network of follow-on investors, mentors and corporates.
Janina Motter, Brinc’s Climate Tech Program manager, told TechCrunch that the accelerator has focused on climate tech for several years through its food tech vertical. “From those successes, we recognized sector specificity is key to maximize value for founders,” she said. “This is why we plan to have several different climate tech programs over time, with this new program focused on carbon removal, utilization and storage.” She added that Brinc has seen underinvestment in carbon removal relative to its climate impact.
The inaugural cohort includes four startups. Motter said “the strongest applicants understand how their approach fits into the competitive landscape and have compelling answers about ‘why them? why now?’ for the company to grow. Furthermore, for CDR in particular, it’s critical that startups have some initial understanding of how their technology fits into broader context (ecological risk, co-benefits, local communities, etc.) and are willing to develop a robust framework which will help them scale responsibly.”
From the United Kingdom, Airhive is creating geochemical direct air capture (DAC) to scale carbon removal. Its DAC system is modular and based on a fluidized nano-structured sorbent.
Based in the United States, CarbonBridge captures fermentation CO2 — CO2 generated by fermenting plant matter — to make beer, wine and other products, before it enters the atmosphere, and produces eco-friendly methanol through a microbial conversion process. The startup says this is a cost-effective alternative to mainstream methanol made from fossil fuels.
Hong Kong’s Formwork IO wants to reduce carbon emissions in architecture and other parts of the built environment. It does so by creating carbon-negative concrete through the use of waste carbon dioxide and materials as binders. Formwork IO is focused on the Asian market, where it says more than 70% of cement is produced.
Poás Bioenergy, based in Costa Rica, turns agricultural waste, including coffee and pineapple residue, into biochar and syngas, making waste management more efficient and giving farms a source of clean energy.
The Climate Tech Program is supported by organizations like Artesian, Carbon Business Council, CO2CRC, Direct Air Capture Coalition, PML Applications and others.

Crypto funding drops for fifth straight quarter as investors continue to pull back,Jacquelyn Melinek,2023/07/05,"

Funding for crypto startups continues to grow more scarce. Venture capital flowing into the industry dropped for the fifth consecutive quarter since Q1 2022 to $2.34 billion globally as investors withhold their checkbooks, fearing risks from a severe regulatory stance and an uncertain economy.
The second quarter’s $2.34 billion tally was raised across 382 deals, according to PitchBook data, but it’s a stark decline from the $12.14 billion peak the industry hit in the first quarter of 2022. The biggest raises during Q2 2023 were LayerZero’s $120 million Series B round and Worldcoin’s $115 million Series C round.
“It’s a numbers game,” said Lydia Chiu, VP of business development at Ava Labs. In general, investors are seeing lower valuations, so they’re writing “smaller checks,” she told TechCrunch+.
This decline in capital deployment could be attributed to regulatory headwinds in the U.S., which have inclined a lot of crypto-related deal flows in Q2 to be structured like traditional venture structures, like raising equity, opposed to token investments or simple agreement for future tokens (SAFTs), Chiu said.
 

			The Tiger Globals and Softbanks of the world aren’t going to invest in everything anymore.							Lasse Clausen, founding partner, 1kx



Regulations have certainly stifled optimism around the industry, but there are also a number of other factors at play. A handful of popular crypto companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year, squelching confidence in the industry, and a few traditional firms and entrepreneurs left the U.S. ecosystem altogether when the market turned. It also didn’t help when investors suddenly adopted a much more discerning approach that valued profits over growth.
According to Chiu, valuations in the industry dropped a stark 50% from the first half of 2022 to the second half of 2022. Since then, crypto startups’ valuations have dropped an additional 15% to the first half of 2023, totaling almost 70% year over year.
That’s a severe decline — startups that raised money in January 2022, for example, would be hard pressed to raise capital again today without taking a steep discount on their price tags.
But it’s not all doom and gloom, and crypto-native founders and investors are not yet giving up hope. “That trend is not necessarily going to reverse, but it may slow down in Q3 or be less severe,” Chiu said.
Indeed, there’s still “a lot of money being deployed,” said Lasse Clausen, founding partner at early-stage crypto investing firm 1kx. “[Funding] looks like it’s down, and it absolutely is, but comparing it to all time highs, those didn’t even make any sense.”

Announcing the SaaS Stage agenda at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023,Frederic Lardinois,2023/07/05,"
Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) has become something akin to the default model for software distribution. But it’s more than a business model. It’s also a way of developing and managing software throughout its life cycle — and that means its underpinnings are forever changing.
We decided to host a special SaaS Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023 to dig deeper into the current state of SaaS, especially now that AI is changing the software landscape once again. We announced the new stage a few weeks ago, and today we’re excited to provide a first look at the agenda. Stay tuned — we’ll add more in the weeks to come!
We’ll examine the current state of SaaS of course but, more importantly, the agenda explores what comes next. We’ll talk to some of the sharpest minds and professionals in the industry — executives from early- and late-stage SaaS companies, leaders from the infrastructure companies that power the industry and the venture capitalists who fund them. The agenda is about 80% complete, so make sure to check back for more updates!
We hope you’ll join us at TechCrunch Disrupt on September 19–21 in San Francisco.

Selling Your SaaS Startup: The VC View
with Whit Bouck (Insight), Megan Reynolds (Vertex) and Cathy Gao (Sapphire Ventures)
There are many reasons to sell your SaaS startup, but what is the investor perspective? This panel looks at why VCs might support your move to sell, and when they might encourage you to keep going.
What’s Next for GitHub?
with Thomas Dohmke (GitHub CEO)
GitHub has long been at the core of developer workflows, but over the course of the last few years, the company started going well beyond being a code repository and collaboration service. To a large degree, that’s thanks to its Copilot code completion service. In this session, we’ll talk about what’s next for GitHub as it expands beyond its core service under the ownership of Microsoft.
Cloudflare’s Journey from TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield to Public Company
with Michelle Zatlyn and Matthew Prince (Cloudflare co-founders)
Cloudflare launched onstage at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2010. Today it’s a public company. We will chat with the co-founders about their journey and the challenges they face in today’s investment climate.
AI for SaaS
with Ines Chami (Numbers Station AI), David DeSanto (GitLab) and Navrina Singh (Credo AI)
The use cases for generative AI are endless, so it’s no surprise that virtually every new and existing SaaS startup now wants to make it part of their core product. In this session, we’ll talk about how to best do that, no matter whether you have an established product or you’re just starting out — all while doing so responsibly.
The State of Quantum
with Itamar Sivan (Quantum Machines)
Quantum computing is quickly moving from a science-fiction concept to a technology that has the potential to change the state of computing. In this session, we’ll talk about the state of the industry, the challenges ahead and the potential risks involved.

Steering through venture’s global correction with the GPCA’s CEO,Alex Wilhelm,2023/07/05,"

Hello and welcome back to Equity, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines. This is our Wednesday show where we niche down to a single topic and dig deep.

All the cool kids are filling out the Equity listener survey. We want to hear from you! 

Long-time Equity listeners and TechCrunch readers should be familiar with LAVCA, an association of capital managers in the Latin America region. We have reported on its data a number of times. Well, it turns out that LAVCA is part of the larger Global Private Capital Association, which keeps tabs on a host of markets that we’re working to cover more carefully as startup activity becomes an increasingly global phenomenon.
So to cap off the second quarter, and to get our claws into what is going on around the world, we had Cate Ambrose, the CEO of the GPCA on the show to riff with us about Asia and Africa and Latin America and Central and Easter Europe. Here’s what we wanted to find out:

How wild was the 2021-era venture peak in less mature startup markets?
How resilient are smaller startup ecosystems in a more conservative venture and macroeconomic environment?
Are we seeing green shoots anywhere in the world? Or put another way, where is the rebound kicking off?
We closed with a short discussion on the role of government in startup markets and squeezed in an AI question because how could we not!

We have another interview coming your way Friday, so stay tuned!
For episode transcripts and more, head to Equity’s Simplecast website.

"Yes, investors will sign an NDA, but only in this specific circumstance",Haje Jan Kamps,2023/07/05,"
If you’ve tried to get an investor to sign a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) before you pitch them, you’ll often be waved off with something like, “We don’t do that.”
That is somewhat sensible: Investors talk to a lot of startups, so signing an NDA could open them up to liabilities in many ways. For example, an investor could agree to not share anything you’ve disclosed, but it’s possible they heard another startup doing exactly what you do, with exactly your approach a couple of weeks before they spoke to you. That puts them in an awkward position.
This practice is therefore so widespread it’s become something of a rule.

As a startup founder, you really need to understand how venture capital works

There are times when you should push back against such conventions, though: When you’re discussing the details of your technology.
If an investor says they don’t sign NDAs, here’s what you should do: Take the meeting anyway but move the slides that talk about your technology to another part of the presentation deck, behind an interstitial slide saying, “Beyond this point, an NDA is required.”
Your job as the founder — using the market size, your unique team and traction — is to tell enough of a compelling story that the investors choose to sign an NDA ahead of your next meeting.
Here’s why you might need an NDA

CADDi raises $89M Series C to scale its B2B supply chain marketplace for manufacturing parts ,Kate Park,2023/07/05,"
The pandemic has damaged the entire manufacturing supply chain, which is not likely to return to normal until at least 2024 due to a few challenges, including the ongoing U.S.-China tech battle. According to a recent survey by the Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM), which surveyed more than 150 equipment manufacturing firms and 179 equipment manufacturing executives, 98% of the respondents still are facing the supply chain issue and more than half are experiencing worsening supply chain conditions owing to a labor shortage and access to source intermediate components. 
Today, a startup called CADDi, which operates a business-to-business (B2B) marketplace for the manufacturing industry, said it has raised $89 million in a Series C round, bringing its total capital to $164 million, to scale its business and help those equipment manufacturing players. 
Existing investors Globis Capital Partners, DCM Ventures, Global Brain, World Innovation Lab, JAFCO and Minerva Growth Partners participated in the Series C financing along with four new investors, including SMBC Venture Capital and Mitsubishi UFJ Capital. 
CADDi did not provide its post-valuation but said the valuation had been up from its previous funding. In 2021, TechCrunch reported that its valuation was estimated at $450 million at its Series B funding, citing sources familiar with the deal. 
Since its last fundraising, the number of employees has more than doubled from 250 to 590 globally, and the startup launched a new platform called CADDi Drawer, an artificial intelligence-powered cloud service for managing drawing data, last June. 
Yushiro Kato (CEO), a former consultant at McKinsey & Company, and Aki Kobashi (CTO), who previously worked as an engineer at Lockheed Martin and Apple, co-founded CADDi in 2017. The startup now offers two major solutions: CADDi Manufacturing, a parts procurement platform, and CADDi Drawer. 
CADDi deals with mid-volume production and high-mix, low-volume production manufacturers, also known as make-to-order manufacturing, in which manufacturers produce products after confirmed orders. But the problem is consumers cannot get optimal pricing with low- to mid-volume production manufacturers due to volume constraints.
The outfit says the CAADi Manufacturing platform eliminates some procurement work and aggregates orders to help find similar materials, processes and suitable delivery schedules. It enables customers to access optimal prices with a 99.83% on-time delivery rate and a 99.96% non-defective rate yielding, Kato said in an email interview. It also allows manufacturers’ procurement costs to reduce by nearly 20%. 
CADDi Drawer offers access to “all procurement data” and details that impact quality, cost and delivery (QCD); its platform also enables users to save significant time and costs while allowing manufacturers to improve QCD with more drawings created. Since April, the CADDi Drawer team has worked with the AI team to handle the information. 
“Because of the difficulty of access [drawings], drawings are often recreated or just not found, which means keys to improving QCD, the KPI for manufacturing professionals, are never unlocked,” Kato said. “So, instead of more drawings providing more improvement, it’s almost like the data is never saved, and people are forced to start from scratch every time.” 
CADDi claims it works with 70% of Japan’s top 20 industrial equipment manufacturers (by revenue) for CADDi Manufacturing. For CADDi Drawer, its customers include Tokyo Electron and EBARA. 
It will use the proceeds to enhance CADDi manufacturing and CADDi Drawing and expand its workforce in the U.S., aiming to reach its goals of posting $10 billion in revenue from CADDi manufacturing and $1 billion in revenue from CADDi Drawer by 2030. 
Some of the pains in the procurement industry in the U.S. are similar to those in Japan, Kato said, citing not only labor shortages in the manufacturing sector but also many ongoing mergers and acquisitions. But factories are not integrated well on account of different systems and standards, Kato noted. 
“We can expand into the U.S. by leveraging [our] knowledge and technology that have developed since our inception, primarily in Japan and across a variety of manufacturing industries,” Kato said. 
The Japan-headquartered company recently opened an office in the U.S. and supplier operations in Mexico to cater to clients in the U.S. In Asia, CADDi has offices in Vietnam and Thailand.

Daniel Ek’s Neko Health raises $65M for preventative healthcare through full-body scans,Paul Sawers,2023/07/05,"
Neko Health, the health tech startup co-founded by Spotify co-creator Daniel Ek, has raised €60 million ($65 million) in its first external round of funding.
The Series A round was led by Lakestar, with participation from Atomico and General Catalyst.
Founded out of Sweden in 2018 by Ek and Hjalmar Nilsonne, Neko Health exited stealth back in February with the lofty promise of preventative healthcare via full-body scans backed by AI software that help doctors detect skin conditions including cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, among other metabolic syndromes.
Each scan apparently takes around 10 minutes and costs €250, according to the company, and is followed by an in-person consultation where the results are explained.

The Stockholm-headquartered company claims a team of 35 doctors, researchers and technicians spread across Europe, and it has a waiting list for people seeking full-body scans out of its inaugural clinic in Stockholm.
“Healthcare costs are spiraling out of control — we believe preventive health will be key to reversing this trend,” Neko Health CEO Hjalmar Nilsonne noted in a statement. “Doctors today just don’t have enough time or resources to focus on prevention. This leads to many health problems going unnoticed until they get really serious, causing a lot of pain and putting a massive strain on the healthcare system.”
Unhealthy silence
What’s perhaps most notable about Neko at this juncture is its aversion to interviews, particularly against the backdrop of high-profile health techs such as Theranos’ spectacular fall from grace after making bold claims with little foundation. Indeed, Neko Health declined to give interviews to international media when it formally launched earlier this year, and little opportunity was given to ask questions ahead of today’s funding announcement.
At any rate, Neko Health has amassed a fairly impressive roster of investors spanning the U.S. and Europe, which have collectively backed companies including Spotify, Airbnb, Snap and HubSpot. And as a result of their investments, Lakestar and Atomico’s founders, Klaus Hommels and Niklas Zennström respectively, will join Neko’s board of directors alongside Neko’s two founders.
The company said it will use its fresh cash injection to accelerate its expansion plans, including more clinics across Europe, and investing in R&D, clinical studies and recruitment.

"PharmEasy, once valued at over $5 billion, seeks new funding at a 90% valuation cut",Manish Singh,2023/07/05,"
Indian online pharmacy startup PharmEasy is planning to raise about $300 million in a new round of funding at a 90% markdown from the previous valuation, two people familiar with the matter said, effectively giving in to some investors’ push to sell itself. Should PharmEasy succeed in securing the new funding, its valuation will drop to half of the total capital it has raised over years.
PharmEasy, one of India’s largest pharmacy firms, is racing to raise the new capital to pay its lender Goldman Sachs, the people said, requesting anonymity discussing sensitive information. PharmEasy borrowed about $285 million from Goldman Sachs last year to pay off an earlier debt that it took to move ahead with a majority stake acquisition of Thyrocare for over $600 million.
The firm, which offers a range of services including tools and information on wellness, consultations, diagnostic and radiology tests and treatment deliveries, had filed for an $843 million IPO in November 2021, but later deferred the plan.
PharmEasy’s chief executive did not respond to a request for comment.
Indian newspaper Economic Times first reported the development, while Moneycontrol said separately that healthcare group Manipal was looking to lead the $300 million funding into the startup. Some of the startup’s backers have been pushing it to sell the business for several quarters, according to three people familiar with the matter.
API Holdings, the parent firm of PharmEasy, was valued at $5.6 billion in its most recent funding round in the second half of 2021.
The startup plans to raise new financing through a rights issue that would value the price of its shares at 5 Indian rupees, down from 50 earlier, Economic Times reported, citing internal documents.
At the proposed terms, if the round materializes, PharmEasy will see its valuation plummet to about $500 million to $600 million. The startup, whose stake in Thyrocare itself is worth about $241 million at Wednesday’s closure, has altogether raised over $1.1 billion against equity and in debt. It will also become the first major Indian unicorn to raise a down round.
PharmEasy has been looking to raise a new round for several quarters, but has struggled to find a taker at even $2 billion valuation, TechCrunch reported earlier. The company did not respond at the time.
The firm counts TPG, Prosus, Temasek, B Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, Eight Roads Ventures, Steadview Capital and JM Financial among its backers.

"After bootstrapping for 8 years, accounting startup Dougs raises $27 million",Romain Dillet,2023/07/04,"
Dougs, a French accounting startup, has been around since 2015. It already generates $16.4 million (€15 million) in annual recurring revenue. And it’s a bootstrapped company, meaning that it hasn’t opened its capital and raised any funding from VC firms. But now, the company has decided to raise its first funding round.
Dougs raised $27 million (€25 million) from Expedition Growth Capital, a British VC firm that is looking for investment opportunities in bootstrapped companies that have reached a certain level of maturity. And Dougs seems to fit the bill quite well as the company has 14,000 clients and is already profitable.
At its core, Dougs is an online chartered accountant service for small and medium companies. It handles your financial statements and generates certified tax filings. Behind the scenes, Dougs works with chartered accountants, legal experts, HR professionals, etc. But the company has also designed its own accounting application to improve the relationship between the Dougs team and its clients.
In particular, clients can connect Dougs with their bank accounts so that the accounting platform can automatically fetch transactions. From the customer portal, clients can upload documents, receipts and more. Dougs can also handle expense reports and invoices, which means that you can use Dougs to get an overview of your company’s revenue — past, present and future.
Additionally, Dougs can facilitate the incorporation process. It can also be used for your company’s payroll. Dougs also provides legal advice when needed. In other words, the startup handles all the usual tasks that would be handled by an accountant.
There are 250 people working for Dougs. With today’s funding round, the company expects to reach the next level by doubling the size of its team by 2025. Up next, the startup plans to expand to new countries, such as Germany and the U.K.
Dougs competes with other online chartered accountant services, such as Keobiz, Livli, Wity, etc. Some tech companies like Pennylane are taking a different approach as they work with existing accounting firms to make them switch from a legacy accounting software solution to a modern software-as-a-service platform.
But there’s room for many companies in this space, as accounting firms remain extremely fragmented in France. Existing accounting firms working with old-school accounting applications remain the default option for many small and medium companies.

Deep tech in Latin America and the Caribbean is set to skyrocket,Anna Heim,2023/07/04,"
The Tesla Gigafactory planned to be built in Mexico should be seen, Bloomberg argues, “as a graduation moment for Mexican manufacturing.” And there’s hope that the CHIPS bill, which President Joe Biden promoted to supercharge semiconductor production in the U.S., will benefit its southern neighbor as well.
While the prospect of new factories and more jobs is good news for Mexico, the country and its Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) peers can harbor higher hopes when it comes to deep tech, a new report posits.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

Titled “Deep Tech: The New Wave” and created in collaboration with the Inter-American Development Bank’s innovation laboratory (IDB Lab), the report concludes that there is room for a twentyfold increase in VC investment into LAC deep tech startups over the next decade.
While such projections are always open for debate, the reasoning and data behind this conclusion are worth looking into.
Diving deep
What “deep tech” means changes according to who’s using it. The consulting firm behind this report, Surfing Tsunamis, used this definition by Propel(x) CEO Swati Chaturvedi:
Deep technology companies are built on tangible scientific discoveries or engineering innovations. They are trying to solve big issues that really affect the world around them. For example, a new medical device or technique fighting cancer, data analytics to help farmers grow more food, or a clean energy solution trying to lessen the human impact on climate change.
Based on this definition, the report says LAC’s “most notable deep tech success story to date” is cybersecurity startup Auth0, which Okta acquired for $6.5 billion in 2021.
Despite this fairly broad definition covering everything from cybersecurity to biotech, most LAC startups don’t fit the bill. Inferring from a previous report, Surfing Tsunamis estimates that deep tech companies represent roughly 10% of the regional startup ecosystem.

Making sense of the $6.5B Okta-Auth0 deal

“The vast majority of startups from Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) [regions] focus on product and business model innovation, with limited technology risk,” it said.
Venture capital investment into LAC deep tech represents an even smaller share of overall VC dealmaking in the region. However, it is on the rise, both in absolute numbers and proportionally, growing from $96 million (0.59%) in 2020 to $172 million (2.2%) in 2022.
What do the recipients of this venture capital look like? They are fairly diverse, both in terms of sector and country of origin. "
Plaid will deposit open banking intel on the Fintech Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023,Lauren Simonds,2023/07/04,"
If a cat had a thousand lives, we would name it Plaid — in recognition of the fintech startup giant that moves forward relentlessly, regardless of obstacles along the way. Case in point: When the Department of Justice scuttled a $5 billion acquisition deal with Visa, Plaid barely blinked.
Instead, it continued its quest to make open banking a reality by releasing new features and raising more money. It’s been an impressive performance, considering the challenges presented by the macro-environment — from which Plaid was entirely not immune.
These are just a few reasons why we’re excited that Zach Perret, Plaid’s co-founder and CEO, will join us for the aptly named session “Plaid’s Zach Perret Opens Up on Open Banking.” You’ll find it on the Fintech Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023, which takes place September 19–21 in San Francisco.
We look forward to hearing Perret’s take on the current state and overall future of open banking. We’re also interested in how he, and the company, regrouped after the Visa deal fell through. What did it take to focus and forge ahead?
Plaid has been gradually expanding its offerings over the years — including adding income verification services, facilitating payments and tackling fraud. We wonder whether Perret ever worries about the company trying to do too much at once.
We’ll also ask what’s ahead for Plaid, and, without a doubt, more questions will pop up between now and September. Join us for what’s sure to be an interesting, insightful session.
Zach Perret: Plaid co-founder and CEO
When Zach Perret realized how difficult it was to build a personal finance application, he co-founded Plaid in 2013. The tech platform gives developers easy and secure access to a financial data network capable of powering any digital financial service.
Prior to founding Plaid, Perret was a consultant for Bain and graduated with degrees in physics and chemistry from Duke University.

What’s it like being a Black founder in France?,Dominic-Madori Davis,2023/07/04,"
In France, Shaila Sahai says pitching investors usually goes like this.
She is a woman, Black and a CEO, and when she walks into a meeting with investors, armed with a slide deck for her fintech startup We Take Part, she’s often greeted with bafflement. “They are surprised, and they can’t hide it,” she told me.
She’ll go on to pitch her company, and then: “They usually just leave the conversation,” she said. “I’ve had people say, ‘Oh, okay, nice, very interesting. Thank you. See you soon.’ And we were in the middle of a conversation.”
In France, Sahai isn’t alone in facing this almost systemic avoidance of people who look like her, but you wouldn’t be able to find any proof of it. The French startup ecosystem for Black founders is shrouded in mystery, especially because France’s embrace of universalism and its color-blind approach to economic and social policy has meant that there is little to no data or visibility into the startup and venture capital industry’s racial and ethnic diversity.
The country does not track its racial diversity metrics (former French president Nicolas Sarkozy tried and failed to change that about 14 years ago), meaning that while racism continues to exist in the country like everywhere else in the world, there is no hard evidence of that racism. Many Black founders are reluctant to draw attention to themselves and instead move in silence, contributing to a lack of success stories about them.
 

			We have to fight all these stereotypes to prove we can do interesting things.					


For those looking to break into the tech sector, this lack of information makes it look like there is nothing happening within venture capital for Black founders.
Naturally, that isn’t true: Laura Pallier raised a $20 million Series A for her fintech SaaS platform Regate last September; Alvyn Severien closed a $13 million Series A for his algae products company Algama in January; Nelly Chatue-Diop raised $2 million last year for her web3 investment startup Ejara; Bruno Mendes Da Silva raised $3.5 million last year for his AI-focused data startup Heex Technologies; and Sebastien Luissaint raised $2.4 million last August for Myditek, an agtech startup.
This list isn’t comprehensive, of course, but it’s representative of the fact that Black founders can and do run fast-growing businesses in tech and other fields. “We are invited to speak, we are invited onstage to testify,” Sahai said. “But we have more to bring to the table than just testaments. We should be invited to the decision-making process. We should be funded. And that’s it.”
“It’s impossible that you can be their equal”
Black people in France have faced a long history of discrimination that’s been swept under the rug. Many Black people in France hail from or are descendants of immigrants from its Outremer or “overseas departments” — mostly islands such as Réunion and Martinique — and are legally French citizens. Others have ancestors from former French colonies in Africa, including Côte d’Ivoire, Mali and Senegal.
Sahai, who was born and raised in France, believes the country is still “embarrassed” about its history of enslaving and colonizing Africans and Afro-Caribbeans. Despite that, deep-seated racial stereotypes and prejudices still fester in the country, manifesting in the form of economic discrimination against Black entrepreneurs, a few founders told TechCrunch+.
Compared to the U.K., where there have been more open and honest conversations about racism and colonialism, she said the French don’t want to acknowledge their history.

Google’s Gradient backs YC alum Infisical to solve secret sprawl,Paul Sawers,2023/07/03,"
Secret sprawl, where companies store authentication credentials and similar sensitive data across multiple locations, is a real and growing problem for any company wanting to avert a security breach.
Companies might have hundreds of secrets — such as API keys, passwords or database access tokens — spread across their infrastructure, making it difficult to keep tabs on what is stored where, who has access to it, and whether any of this data has inadvertently found its way into the public realm. By way of example, back in 2017, Uber revealed a major breach that exposed the personal data of some 57 million customers, and while there were many security failures at play, the root cause stemmed from hackers that found an AWS access key in a GitHub repository of an Uber developer.
And it’s against that backdrop that we’ve seen a slew of startups and Big Tech tools go to market designed to help companies manage their secret sprawl. The latest is a San Francisco-based company called Infisical, which today announced it has raised $2.8 million in a seed round of funding led by Google’s Gradient Ventures to help companies of all sizes centralize their secret management.
Top secret
Infisical is pitching itself as a holistic secret-management platform combining all the components a company needs — a bit like what Rippling has been doing in the workforce management space, except for secrets, according to Infisical co-founder Vlad Matsiiako.
“As companies are becoming more digital and integrated with other software, it’s harder to manage all of their application and developer secrets — they have to buy multiple tools and give all of them access to their secrets, which is a security concern on its own,” Matsiiako explained to TechCrunch. “You can think of Infisical as an all-in-one secret management stack that combines all related product verticals for a company.”
This includes a dashboard for managing secrets across different projects and environments; client SDKs; a command line interface (CLI); native integrations with the likes of GitHub, Netlify and Vercel; secret versioning and “point-in-time recovery”; audit logs; and secret scanning.

As for a business model, Infisical attracts revenue through its hosted cloud incarnation, which it sells as a SaaS, and through its self-hosted counterpart by selling enterprise-grade features.
The (sort of) open source factor
While Infisical is pushing itself as an “open source” SecretOps platform, a quick peek at its licensing on GitHub reveals that it’s perhaps more aligned with the open-core or source available realm, than it is the pure open source sphere. That is to say, while much of the platform’s core functionality is apparently available to use under the permissive MIT license, including secret-scanning and infrastructure integrations, it has retained a lot of the features — such as audit logs, single-sign on, recovery and access controls — under a proprietary license under a separate enterprise edition (EE).
“Our entire codebase is available for everyone to view on GitHub, and we keep all core secret management functionalities available under the MIT license,” Matsiiako said. “We strongly believe that solo developers and hobbyists should be able to experiment with most features for free using either Infisical Cloud or Infisical self-hosted.”
The thinking here is that when users start considering Infisical in terms of deploying for critical commercial use cases, they need more features such as advanced security and compliance. So even if a company has chosen to self-host Infisical, they still have to purchase an enterprise license to leverage core proprietary features.
“The goal is really to charge only larger enterprises,” Matsiiako added.
There are a bunch of similar tools on the market already, including the open source Vault project from billion-dollar cloud infrastructure giant HashiCorp, which has pretty much set the standard for the secret-management sector. However, Matsiiako argues that Infisical is aimed more at general developers rather than platform-engineering teams, making it easier to deploy with a flatter learning curve.
“Vault is difficult to adopt for developers without a background in security or infrastructure, and we find it to be more popular amongst security and platform-engineering teams,” he said. “Because of that, companies experience slower development cycles and some even resort to developing fully custom developer-facing solutions on top of — or instead of — Vault.
Other notable alternatives include Doppler and Akeyless, which are substantively proprietary SaaS products, and even tangential products such as secret-scanning tools from the likes of GitGuardian, a feature that Infisical is already supporting as part of its platform.
“By integrating secret scanning inside of Infisical’s bundle offering, we extract synergies between secret management and secret scanning, and a company looking for related secret management solutions now only needs to go through one vendor instead of multiple,” Matsiiako said.
The story so far
The company’s trio of founders — Matsiiako, Maidul Islam and Tuan Dang — met at Cornell University, where they studied a mix of computer and data science subjects, going on to work at various companies such as AWS, Figma and Bung. They then met up to kickstart their new venture together out of San Francisco last August.
“Throughout our past collective experiences and talking to industry peers, we recognized that managing application secrets was cumbersome and that problems in the secret management industry were far from being solved,” Matsiiako said. “It became clear to us that we needed to build an open source solution that’s simple to use for secret management; being open source gives developers the flexibility of using Infisical Cloud or self-hosting it on their own infrastructure which is what larger companies frequently do.”
Infisical went on to raise $500,000 from its participation in Y Combinator’s (YC) winter ’23 program, and it recently made its first engineering hire, who joined them from enterprise software giant Red hat.
Aside from lead backer Gradient Ventures, the company’s seed round included investments from YC, 22 Ventures and angel backers such as Elad Gil and YC’s Diana Hu.

Kenya’s MyDawa aims to be an all-in-one health platform backed by $20 million funding,Annie Njanja,2023/07/03,"
Kenyan e-health startup MyDawa has raised $20 million from private equity investor Alta Semper Capital to expand its regional reach and product offerings with the aim of becoming an all-in-one health platform for users.
MyDawa, which launched in 2016, has diversified from an e-pharmacy to include online and in-person consultations, as well as laboratory services at its expanding network of walk-in pharmacies and health centers.
It has also launched its own branded products, and plans to open up its technology infrastructure from telehealth to fulfillment, helping other businesses in the health sector to scale. It claims to have already inked deals with some of Kenya’s biggest clinic chains, which are looking to expand their reach.
Additionally, MyDawa has acquired Uganda’s Guardian Health, one of the many acquisitions and collaborations it aims to make as it expands beyond Kenya. The growth plans will be steered by new CEO Priscilla Muhiu, formerly of Glovo Kenya.

African health tech startups in the supply chain segment show rapid growth, spurring a $7M investment initiative

Commenting on the funding and newest acquisition, MyDawa co-founder Neil O’Leary said: “Alta Semper’s ambition exactly matches that of MyDawa, and it brings the drive, connections and clout to succeed. Three years ago, AAIC, a Japanese-backed African healthcare fund, joined as our first external investor and now the team has been augmented in the strongest manner possible.”
“MyDawa now has both a solid secure base and a great expansion opportunity based on a great offering which improves health outcomes. Guardian is a great first step on fulfilling our ambition,” O’Leary added.
MyDawa raised $3 million from AAIC’s Africa Healthcare Fund in 2019, and has also received $1.2 million grant funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation to fight the spread of HIV/AIDS by increasing access to PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis) medication.
Alta Semper CEO Afsane Jetha, said the investment marked the PE firm’s first entry into digital healthcare in Africa, regarded as one of the sectors with the potential for great growth in the coming years.
“MyDawa was the logical choice for us as their groundbreaking technology, underpinning a scalable business model, along with regulatory knowhow and market entry experience, mapped so well to our own strategy. The drive to increase the access to good advice and safe and affordable medication is core to our overall mission of democratizing access to health and well-being across the African continent,” said Jetha.
“With consumer spending in Africa projected to reach $2.1 trillion by 2025, this represents one of the continent’s largest business opportunities. Therefore, the investment into MyDawa is part of our strategic aim at meeting this growing demand by investing in locally produced and value-priced consumer goods and services.”

The remote work startups that will last aren’t actually remote work startups,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/07/03,"
Back in 2020 when the pandemic forced people to work from home, entrepreneurs saw an opportunity to build tools to fuel this new transition to remote work. From virtual offices to making it easy to run payroll for a distributed team, founders leaned in hard.
But now, three years later, some companies have remained remote, others have gone back to the office, and most are operating somewhere in the middle. It’s become increasingly unclear if there really is a large market for companies focused on catering exclusively to remote work. It seems that the remote work category has lost steam — but has it?
It’s hard to pin the exact numbers on it — because the category can include companies across various sectors — but there are signs that things aren’t going well for many remote work startups.

"Hello Alice, Global Entrepreneurship Network unveil $70M Equitable Access Fund",Christine Hall,2023/06/28,"
Hello Alice, a fintech helping small businesses access capital, and entrepreneurship ecosystem Global Entrepreneurship Network (GEN) created a $70 million Equitable Access Fund designed to bridge the financing gap experienced by women and BIPOC-owned founders.
“There’s an estimated $40 billion gap among the BIPOC community alone,” Elizabeth Gore, Hello Alice co-founder, told TechCrunch. “Also, the biggest gap we saw to growing businesses was lack of credit history.”
She also noted that many small business owners don’t have the generational wealth or collateral to put up for loans. Some turn to credit; however, just 25% of small business owners have applied for a business credit card, and 85% of those applications were denied due to poor credit or lack of credit.
The Equitable Access Fund will provide those credit enhancements, including guarantees, loan loss reserves and cash collateral deposits to financing partners. It will be deployed over the next five years with aims to improve equitable access to credit and unlock up to $1 billion in credit for small business owners in what Gore called the “new majority,” which includes women, veterans, BIPOC, Latinx, those with disabilities, LGBTQIA+ and other groups.
Initial capital commitments were led by Wells Fargo. Other partners in the program include First National Bank of Omaha, Mastercard and the Kauffman Foundation.
The fund is part of the Equitable Access Program, run by Hello Alice and GEN, which provides increased credit access via a Mastercard secured card and financial education. As part of the program, Hello Alice also launched a business health score tool in April that provides an overview of a business’s financial health and recommendations on how owners can improve their performance.
Meanwhile, Hello Alice serves 1.3 million small business owners, and its loan center has distributed just over $30 million in grants and continues to grow with 92 lenders, Gore said.
“With the economic uncertainty, upheaval in banking and a lot of the fear that things are tightening and interest rates are changing, we’re going to see that it’s even harder for folks to get loans, particularly in the first 24 months of their business,” Gore added. “We really rushed to get out the business health score, which was supposed to come out later, because it is absolutely critical that all business owners are managing their cash flow appropriately right now.”

Here’s why so many fintech startups are loaning to small businesses

"No SSN, no problem, says Maza, a fintech startup aimed at undocumented immigrants",Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/06/28,"
Want more fintech news in your inbox? Sign up here.
While there are a multitude of fintech companies offering digital banking services to a variety of demographics, there has been one segment of the population that historically has been underserved even more than others: the undocumented immigrant.
Because undocumented immigrants don’t have Social Security numbers, it can be difficult to impossible to access traditional banking services. A startup called Maza has set out to help solve that problem.
While several fintech startups set out to serve immigrants generally (Welcome Technologies, Majority, TomoCredit are examples), Maza says its main differentiator is that it provides immigrants with an individual tax identification number (ITIN), plugging in directly with IRS-certified acceptance agents “to make the Tax ID number process automated for customers.” The end goal, notes co-founder and COO Robbie Figueroa, is to unlock access to the rest of the U.S. financial system and avoid non-traditional (and sometimes predatory) approaches to finance, such as loan sharks and pawn brokers.
Maza customers are “immediately” equipped with a U.S. bank account and debit card. The company claims that because its members also have a tax ID number, they can start building a credit history and applying for loans. Having a bank account also allows them to receive payments from employers and file taxes. With Maza, customers without SSNs can access credit and thus, develop a credit history so they can do things like get auto or home loans. The startup also says it offers a robust peer to peer payments functionality.
On the back end, Maza says it “handles” their taxes to ensure they remain compliant, even going as far as automatically renewing their financial identity documentation for them.
Since its 2022 inception, the Los Angeles-based, 15-person startup has grown to having 50,000 users (each paying $150 a year for access) on its platform, enabling $41 million in digital payments to date.
Maza’s unique model caught the attention of Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), which recently led the company’s $8 million seed funding round. Other backers include SV Angel, Box Group, Restive Ventures, Global Founders Capital, Abstract Ventures and a group of angel investors including Anré Williams, CEO of American Express National Bank, and Plaid co-founder William Hockey.
While its total addressable market is the more than 15 million immigrants living in the U.S., Maza says its focus is on the Latino, or Spanish-speaking, population.
“Customers go from undocumented to partially documented,” Maza co-founder and CEO Luciano Arango told TechCrunch in an interview.
Arango and Figueroa teamed up with Siggy Bilstein (CTO) to start Maza after seeing their own parents struggle as immigrants in the U.S. (The trio is a combination of Colombian, Peruvian, Brazilian and Ecuadorian descent.)

Like many fintechs offering digital banking services, Maza is not itself a bank. It is able to offer its services without requiring an SSN by partnering with Visa and Blue Ridge Bank. The company’s banking product features “broad payment functionality,” it touts, as well as integrations with all major payment platforms, including PayPal, Zelle, Venmo and CashApp. Further, money deposited in Maza, the company claims, earns “one of the highest checking account interest rates,” an effort to help its members “grow their wealth over time.”
Interestingly, while Maza might be a digital bank, its marketing efforts are mostly focused offline. The company has found success targeting high-density, smaller Latino neighborhoods in markets such as South Florida, Washington Heights, New York and east Los Angeles with campaigns including posting bulletins in churches. It also does Google advertising but Arango says most of its growth thus far has been organic.
In the long run, Maza’s goal is to expand into credit building and to outside of the U.S. because as Arango said, “the whole world doesn’t have a Social Security number.”
Image Credits: Maza
“We want to be able to get folks cleared into the U.S. financial system no matter where they are,” added Arango, who also previously co-founded — and then sold — ScopeAI, which got acquired by ObserveAI in 2021.
“We’re doing much more than just providing a bank account — we’re really giving immigrants a stable and legal financial foundation from which to build credit and wealth indefinitely,” Figueroa said. 
Andreessen Horowitz Partner Seema Amble said Maza’s thesis is something that a16z has “been excited about for a long time.” 
Writing via email, she said: “There is a massive gap between mainstream financial access and the Latino population in the US (which is 19% of the U.S.). And the product needs don’t mean just translating existing products into Spanish – it’s offering them a set of products that fits their life and work.” 
Banking products are not accessible to most Latinos, Amble added, but not primarily because of a language barrier. 
She wrote: “They’re blocked from even accessing these products in the first place. Maza has identified the true pain point, lack of SSN, and they have built a product that unblocks everything from payments, to credit and mortgages without leaving the app….Compared to some of the other startups, Maza has focused on this core pain point and wants to continue to offer community-tailored products, rather than just offer another card product marketed towards Latinos.”

Workflow automation startup Parabola raises $24M,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/28,"
Parabola, a San Francisco-based startup that uses AI to help expedite back-office processes, particularly in the logistics and e-commerce sectors, today announced that it raised $24 million in a Series B funding round led by OpenView, with participation from strategic investor Flexport alongside Matrix, Thrive, Good Friends, Webflow, Otherwise Fund, Abstract Ventures and Merus Capital.
Alex Yaseen, Parabola’s founder and CEO, says the new capital will be put toward hiring and product R&D. To date, the company’s raised $34.2 million — inclusive of the latest tranche.
“Most software companies struggled in the pandemic shift, but we’ve found success,” Yaseen said. “2023 is the year of the operator, and Parabola is the go-to platform to empower them.”
So what does Parabola do, exactly? Boiled down to basics, the platform applies AI to automate various workflows. Using Parabola, customers can take documents like PDFs, text message logs, images and emails and have Parabola standardize, enrich or categorize them.
For example, given a list of product names, Parabola can categorize them according to specific departments, such as “clothing,” “home goods,” “grocery” and “electronics.” It also can standardize inconsistently formatted invoices and extract the amount, due date, sender information and line items from each into a table. And it can analyze Amazon keyword rankings within a specific time frame, enabling e-commerce teams to optimize their product listings.
Yaseen describes Parabola as a “collaborative data tool” for nontechnical users who’d otherwise be stuck with arduous manual processes and spreadsheets.
“Our core differentiator is our ability to be owned directly by an operations team to build solutions to their own problems without getting bottlenecked on data and IT.” Yaseen said. “This enables them to automate workflows that otherwise are too fast-changing for engineers to write code on their behalf.”
Business process automation is a growing trend, with 66% of organizations responding to a recent McKinsey survey saying that they’ve experimented with process automation in one or more business functions. The motivation is cost savings, often. A UiPath survey estimates that businesses can save an average of $1.5 million per year by automating at least a portion of their processes.

Lots of vendors have emerged to meet the large addressable market, unsurprisingly, including so-called integration-platform-as-a-service providers like Zapier, Workato, Tray and MuleSoft, as well as internal-tool-building platforms like Retool and Airplane.dev. Retool has done particularly well for itself lately, raising $45 million at a $3.2 billion valuation last July.
Yaseen makes the case that Parabola’s rivals, though — even the well-funded ones — focus less on building logic and more on transferring data between different systems, plus require extensive technical resources to boot.
“Many users choose to stick with their outdated and mundane processes because it’s what they’re familiar with, and they believe that their complex datasets cannot be automated,” he added. “[But] enterprise leaders can no longer exhaust valuable engineering resources on projects that can be achieved otherwise … We’ve built a suite of collaboration features that turn the ‘individual use-case’ into a ‘company use-case,’ allowing operations teams to  align on best practices and ultimately build off one another’s work.”
Parabola claims to have clients in a “wide range of industries,” including e-commerce, retail, consumer packaged goods and shipping and logistics. The 30-employee startup’s current customer base stands at just over 500 brands, and Yaseen says the plan is to expand Parabola’s headcount to 60 people by the end of the year.

Memphis.dev looks to simplify event streaming with open source and SaaS products,Ron Miller,2023/06/28,"
Startups have been looking for ways to disrupt event streaming, popularized in the last decade by Kafka, the open source event streaming platform. Just this week we looked at Redpanda getting a $100 million Series C for its event streaming platform, and today Memphis.dev, an earlier-stage startup, announced a $5.5 million seed investment to support its open source project and SaaS offering called Memphis Cloud, which they are making generally available starting today.
Memphis co-founder and CEO Yaniv Ben Hemo says that the company was founded on the idea that streaming was too complicated, and they wanted to simplify it. He said they came from organizations dealing with massive amounts of data, where they struggled to get insights from it.
“The component that was usually the most challenging one was getting Kafka to absorb the massive amount of data that we ingested, and also what we call the Day 2 operations, which are all about how to take the raw data that we ingested and make it into something that the organization can do something with to create insights from it,” Ben Hemo told TechCrunch.
The company wanted to build a solution that helped solved these kinds of problems for developers building real-time streaming applications, and they built and open sourced this new message broker they called Memphis. He said they wanted to attack two key problems that they saw with streaming large amounts of data and building applications making use of that data.
“So the first part would be the management over the scalability, the maintenance that it requires, the amount of time that it takes and complexity to really implement such a technology or a solution within the organization.” The second part involved how to build applications that really take advantage of the data the engine was processing.
The founders started by building the open source project, and eventually building Memphis Cloud, which is geared toward enterprises with typical features like authentication and permissions, but they are also making it a serverless experience, making it easier to implement without worrying about the underlying resources required to run any particular application, while paying only for what you use. The company has also designed it to work on multiple platforms, including AWS and Google Cloud Platform for starters.
“We try to create as much alignment as we can between the commercial version and Memphis. But the commercial version is definitely more for enterprises, organizations that require serverless experience, and don’t want anything to do with infrastructure and scale and monitoring and stuff like that. So it really made sense for the community, as well as some other features that we simply were not able to deploy through the open source version, technically,” Ben Hemo said.
The company currently has 14 employees with two open recs, and as currently constituted has a pretty diverse group. He says he hopes to continue that along multiple dimensions of diversity, including geographical, as he builds the organization.
Today’s seed investment was led by Angular Ventures and Boldstart Ventures along with several prominent industry angels.

Unaric exits stealth with $35M to buy and consolidate Salesforce-ecosystem startups,Paul Sawers,2023/06/28,"
A new company is emerging out of stealth today with $35 million in funding and a plan to acquire and consolidate startups within the Salesforce ecosystem.
Unaric, as the company is called, has secured $25 million in debt and $10 million in equity from various VCs, angels and growth lenders, as it looks to bring together independent Salesforce-focused SaaS companies help them capture a larger chunk of the gargantuan market that has cropped up around Salesforce these past couple of decades.
Some companies have built megabucks businesses on top of Salesforce, including Salesforce-native DevOps platform Copado; Salesforce data backup platform OwnBackup; and lead-generation platform Qualified. Thousands of smaller companies have cropped up off the back of Salesforce’s rise to the giddy heights of a $200 billion enterprise behemoth, creating an ecosystem that some estimates peg at four times that of Salesforce itself.
However, relatively few companies within that Salesforce ecosystem become massive in their own right, due in part to their narrowly-focused “point solutions” that mean end-users have to combine multiple different tools from various smaller vendors — something that larger enterprises are often reluctant to do. And this is where Unaric enters the fray.
“For enterprise customers it can be painful to purchase and manage small niche solutions,” Unaric co-founder and CEO James Gasteen explained to TechCrunch. “Unaric addresses this by building larger suites, which solve large problems for customers through a single vendor who can provide greater innovation, better service and global support.”
‘By founders, for founders’
Founded out of London in July last year, Unaric is aiming to buy up to 40 companies over the next three years, the first of which it’s announcing today with the acquisition of Salesbolt, a product that automatically keeps CRM contacts up-to-date. Over time, Unaric says that it intends to increase the opportunity for cross-selling and knowledge-sharing across all Salesforce products under its wing, as well as introduce a “shared central infrastructure” including a product and engineering hub.
The Salesbolt deal pegs Unaric’s initial focus firmly in the RevOps realm, an area Gasteen says it will double-down on.
“By acquiring multiple companies in this area we will be able to drive cross-sales,” he said. “This is an area where we already have a pipeline of deals lined up. The next stage is to use our knowledge of industries and existing customers’ needs to build out suites of companies focused on particular industry sectors.”
Unari is the handiwork of Gasteen and chief product officer Neil Crawford, each having previously founded Salesforce-ecosystem companies, and chair Peter Lindholm and CFO Moritz Birke. Gasteen, in fact, already has experience of merging two Salesforce-focused companies, when his previous startup Precursive acquired a “complementary” product called Taskfeed back in 2019.
“There is a mismatch in the Salesforce ISV (independent software vendor) ecosystem which we have experienced personally, and we know how to put it right,” Gasteen said. “We believe that by building suites of products that match more closely the needs of enterprises, we can help companies to significantly increase their sales, scale their businesses and sell to corporate buyers who would not normally buy from individual vendors.”
Such a hefty acquisition spree will, of course, require a lot of capital, which is where Unaric’s external funding comes into play. The $25 million debt segment emanates from Atempo Growth, with the remaining seed equity tranche coming from LocalGlobe, Concentric, FJ Labs and angels such as OwnBackup founder Sam Gutmann, Hotjar founder Johan Malmberg and enterprise software startup investor Dave Kellogg.
Longer term, Gasteen says Unaric is looking to emulate the growth trajectory of a number of established enterprise software companies, such as Veeva Systems, a $32 billion life sciences software company; and Ncino, a $3 billion fintech. Both companies were initially built on top of Salesforce and embraced the cloud from the get-go, but more importantly they have focused their efforts on broad techstacks spanning a single sector.
“They have created a lot of value in the ecosystem through being focused on a single industry techstack,” Gasteen said. “They have built the companies mainly through product development and some M&A. Our idea is to emulate the success of these companies by building many Ncino’s and Veeva’s within Unaric.”

"Astrix Security, which uses ML to secure app integrations, raises $25M",Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/28,"
Astrix Security, a platform that helps companies manage and secure third-party app integrations, today announced that it closed a $25 million Series A funding round led by CRV with participation from Bessemer Venture Partners and F2 Venture Capital.
Co-founder and CEO Alon Jackson says that the round, which brings Astrix’s total raised to $40 million, will be put toward expanding headcount across the company’s offices in Tel Aviv and the U.S.
“The pandemic enforced cloud and software-as-a-service (SaaS) adoption, thus increasing third-party adoption and automation — requiring a solution to fit this digital and fast-paced interconnected world,” Jackson told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Astrix was founded to close a significant and unaddressed security gap by allowing security teams to extend access management and threat detection to the non-human identity layer.”
Jackson co-launched Astrix in 2021 alongside Idan Gour, who he met while serving in the Israel Defense Forces. Both say that they saw a need to create a platform that could help companies bring app integrations, which continue to gain in popularity, under firmer control from a security standpoint.
To their points, according to one recent report, company departments use between 40 and 60 different apps, with departments using an average of 200 apps organization-wide. This can amplify the security risk. Another poll, published in 2022 by the Ponemon Institute and Mastercard’s RiskRecon, found that 54% of organizations were breached through third parties over the preceding 12 months.
“Apps are often connected by employees across departments without the security team’s knowledge, making having visibility and governance into every third-party connection virtually impossible,” Jackson said.
Astrix connects to a company’s core systems — including SaaS, integration platform-as-a-service and infrastructure-as-a-service — to attempt to protect against over-privileged and malicious third-party app connections that might expose an organization. Using machine learning-based behavioral analysis engines, Astrix tries to spot deviations from standard app-to-app connectivity behaviors and suggest remediation steps that security teams can take to address the root of the problem.

Beyond detecting threats, Astrix provides a view of all the internal and third-party integrations within a business environment, as well as all access keys in use (e.g. API keys and service accounts) and the permissions and level of access granted to each one.
James Green, a general partner at CRV, said that it was these holistic observability features that caught CRV’s eye.
“Astrix is taking an innovative approach to extending identity and access management and threat detection to all non-human identities, giving unprecedented capabilities to manage the growing API-based third-party attack surface across all environments,” he said in an emailed statement.
Astrix isn’t without rivals in the app connection security space, including Apiiro, which works to help developers and security operators find and solve app-related issues that could result in vulnerabilities. There’s also Valence Security, Wing Security and Kodem, the last of which recently came out of stealth with $25 million in venture backing to tackle app security.
But Jackson, while declining to reveal the size of Astrix’s customer base, noted that Astrix recently brought on high-profile customers, including Figma, Priceline, Bloomreach and Rapyd.
“Cybersecurity is one of the few fields that is traditionally less impacted during down times,” Jackson said. “Moreover, layoffs and down markets create more cybercrime worldwide, and we’ve especially been experiencing this in the past year.”
That first point isn’t necessarily true — Q1 marked lowest VC funding for security in a decade, according to one report. But it seems that Astrix is successfully bucking the trend.

Fairphone CEO Eva Gouwens to step down,Paul Sawers,2023/06/28,"
Fairphone CEO Eva Gouwens has announced that she’s stepping down, some five years after landing in the hotseat.
Founded out of the Netherlands back in 2010, Fairphone has set out to differentiate from other smartphone makers by focusing on sustainability and lowering its environmental footprint — this includes making its devices modular and thus easier to replace parts and minimizing its use of conflict minerals. The company has also expanded into tangential products, including headphones and accessories, and has raised around $94 million in funding, including a $53 million tranche just six months ago.
Stepping down
Gouwens joined Fairphone first as managing director in 2017, before replacing the company’s founder Bas van Abel the following year as CEO.
Quoting former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, Gouwens indicated that her reason for stepping down was simply to her running out of steam: “I know what this job takes, and I know I no longer have enough in the tank to do it justice. It’s as simple as that.”
At the time of writing, it appears that Fairphone has not yet found a successor, with today’s announcement signaling the start of a search process to find the company’s next CEO.
“Now I know it is the right time for me to find someone like-minded yet fresh to take my place,” Gouwens said. “Someone who understands Fairphone’s mission and vision. Someone who can help Fairphone scale even greater heights.”

Dear Sophie, 
Our startup employs about 30 people globally through a combination of direct and co-employment based on their country. 
Over the last year and a half or so, we helped several team members relocate from Ukraine and Russia to various non-Schengen countries such as Georgia, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and Uzbekistan. 
We realize it’s more expensive if we bring these employees to the U.S., but our startup will be more successful. How do we bring them here?
— Meaningful Moneymaking
Dear Meaningful Moneymaking,
Many companies have helped make a meaningful difference in people’s lives, supporting talented team members and their families from countries such as Ukraine and Russia to relocate to safety. Thank you for now considering how to help certain individuals relocate to the U.S. May all humans enjoy peace, prosperity, and freedom.
Many employers are continuing to work with the Ukrainian and Russian professionals who have left their homes since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.
Of the 8 million people who have left Ukraine, more than 270,000 have been admitted to the United States, most of them under the Uniting for Ukraine program, which provides a temporary stay in the United States and a work permit.
Between 500,000 and as many as 1 million people have left Russia and thousands of Russians have sought entry to the U.S. between February 2022 and April 2023. According to Russian government figures, about 100,000 IT specialists (about 10% of the tech workforce) left Russia, which is likely underestimated.
Before I dive into options for bringing Ukrainian and Russian employees to the United States, I recommend you work with an immigration attorney to devise a strategy for each employee you’re seeking to sponsor based on their education, skills, qualifications, location, and situation. Your company has several options for bringing your Ukrainian and Russian employees to live and work in the United States.
Uniting for Ukraine
The Uniting for Ukraine program, which began last year, provides a way for Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members to come to the United States to stay for two years under temporary parole status. Individuals participating in the program must have a U.S.-based supporter or multiple supporters — an individual, organization, or business — who agrees to financially support their stay.
The supporter must fill out Form I-134A (Online Request to be a Supporter and Declaration of Financial Support) and submit it to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The program includes the option for a Employment Authorization Document (EAD) — otherwise known as a work permit.
Right now, parole under the Uniting for Ukraine program cannot be extended beyond two years, but that may change. Your company could consider sponsoring employees on parole for work visas or green cards. I explain in more detail below. "
Bluu Seafood reels in $17.5M to bring cultivated fish products to market,Paul Sawers,2023/06/28,"
Bluu Seafood, a German company creating cultivated (i.e. “lab-grown”) fish products, today announced it has raised €16 million ($17.5 million) in a Series A round of funding.
Founded out of Berlin in 2020 originally as Bluu Biosciences, Bluu Seafood starts with a “one-time” fish biopsy — which, it says, doesn’t require killing any fish — and then uses stem-cell technology to grow entire cell lines (i.e. fish species) inside a lab.
The company unveiled its first products last August, including a line of fish sticks (or “fish fingers”) and fish balls. These are made from cultivated fish cells that are enriched with plant proteins, a process it says helps make their mouth-feel and cooking process more realistic.

Production problems
Bluu Seafood is one of numerous biotech startups that are setting out to address the world’s seafood production problems, which includes overfishing, contamination and cruelty. But the movement is not limited to marine animals, with countless companies raising bucketloads of VC cash to reproduce everything from bacon to burgers and chicken and beyond.
Bluu Seafood, for its part, had raised €7.1 million in funding so far, and with another €16 million in the bank it’s now gearing up to attain regulatory approval in various markets, including Singapore, which is currently the only market in the world where cultured meat (chicken) is available to buy. However, the Food and Drug Association (FDA) also started rubberstamping such edibles as being safe for human consumption, and just this week it approved two companies to begin selling their lab-grown chicken products — so we can expect some commercial activity in the U.S. in the very near future.
First up, Bluu Seafood is aiming to enter Singapore, where it says it expects to receive approval sometime in 2024, while it says it has also kickstarted the approval process with the FDA, and will then set about targeting the European market.
Bluu Seafood’s Series A round was led by Sonae-subsidiary Sparkfood and LBBW VC, with participation from Delivery Hero, SeaX Ventures, Manta Ray Ventures, Norrsken VC, Hamburgische Investitions- und Förderbank and Dr. Oetker.

Flowie wants to make invoices flow freely,Romain Dillet,2023/06/27,"
Meet Flowie, a new French startup that wants to facilitate money movements between companies. The company centralizes everything related to accounts receivable and accounts payable so that everyone in the company can see relevant information when it comes to getting paid by clients and receiving money from suppliers.
Flowie was started by Yann Ravel-Sibillot, Rémi Legorrec and Aurélie Hadida. In particular, the company’s CEO — Yann Ravel-Sibillot — already has plenty of experiences when it comes to managing invoices at scale. He was the CTO of Big Mamma and worked on Sunday, a fast restaurant checkout flow.
With this new startup, the Flowie team wants to improve how companies handle invoices. Flowie acts as a central repository for all your transactional data.
It connects with all your existing tools, such as the ERP system that holds your contracts, order numbers, receipt slips, etc. Flowie also integrates with your CRM so that you can get some context about the relationship with a client or a supplier. Finally, it also connects with your bank account so that it can see if you received a payment and initiate new payments.
For instance, when you receive an invoice from a supplier, usually the person in charge of accounting doesn’t really know if they’re supposed to pay this supplier. Maybe your company never received what you paid for.
Instead of having an internal conversation and creating friction, anybody can validate transactions on Flowie. The platform automatically tries to fetch information from the invoice, and people in the company can add files to provide context.
When a transaction is approved, you can either choose to pay it now or pay it at some point in the future. If you schedule a future payment, you can notify your supplier that the payment has been scheduled and there’s no need to get back to you about that pending invoice.
On the other side of the equation, when it comes to accounts receivables, companies can upload an invoice on Flowie. It is converted into an e-invoice with a QR code. Clients can click on a link and see different payment methods. They can pay with a bank transfer, a card payment or a direct debit. Flowie also lets you offer early payment discounts.
It’s still early days for the startup. The company has raised a bit of money from business angels and there are 11 people working on the product. But the company has already tracked hundreds of millions of euros in invoices on its platform.

Reka emerges from stealth to build custom AI models for the enterprise,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/27,"
Large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT-4 are all the rage these days, owing to their unparalleled ability to analyze and generate text. But for organizations looking to leverage LLMs for specific tasks — say, writing ad copy in a brand’s style — their generalist nature can become a liability.
When the instructions get too precise, even the best LLMs struggle with consistency. Fine-tuning, or narrowing an LLM’s scope, is one solution. But it’s often challenging from a technical standpoint, not to mention costly.
Motivated to find an easier way, a team of researchers from DeepMind, Google, Baidu and Meta founded Reka, which emerged from stealth today with $58 million. DST Global Partners and Radical Ventures led the tranche with participation from strategic partner Snowflake Ventures, alongside a cohort of angel investors that included former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman.
San Francisco–based Reka is the brainchild of Dani Yogatama, Cyprien de Masson d’Autume, Qi Liu Head and Yi Tay. While working on AI systems, including DeepMind’s AlphaCode and Bard, the four co-founders say that they realized it was impractical to expect a large LLM to be deployed for all possible use cases.
“We understand the transformative power of AI and would like to bring the benefits of this technology to the world in a responsible way,” Yogatama told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Reka is a research and product company that develops models to benefit humanity, organizations and enterprises.”
Reka’s first commercial product, Yasa, doesn’t quite meet those lofty ambitions. But it exemplifies the startup’s early approach. Going beyond text, Yasa is a multimodal AI “assistant” trained to understand images, videos and tabular data in addition to words and phrases. It can be used to generate ideas and answer basic questions, Yogatama says, as well as derive insights from a company’s internal data.
In this way, Yasa, which is in closed beta, isn’t dissimilar to models like GPT-4, which can also understand text and images. But the twist is that Yasa can be easily personalized to proprietary data and applications.
“Our technology allows enterprises to benefit from progress in LLMs in a way that satisfies their deployment constraints without requiring a team of in-house expert AI engineers,” Yogatama said.
Yasa is just the start. Next, Reka plans to turn its attention to AI that can accept and generate even more types of data and continuously self-improve, staying up to date without the need for retraining.
To that end, only available to select customers for now, Reka also provides a service to adapt LLMs it developed to custom or proprietary company datasets. Customers can run the “distilled” models on their own infrastructure or via Reka’s API, depending on the application and project constraints.
Reka, it should be noted, isn’t the only startup chasing after models better suited for enterprise use cases. Writer lets customers fine-tune LLMs on their own content and style guides. Contextual AI and LlamaIndex, which recently emerged from stealth, are developing tools to allow companies to add their own data to existing LLMs. And Cohere trains LLMs to customers’ specifications.
Not to be outdone, incumbents like OpenAI now offer tools for fine-tuning models and connecting them to the internet and other sources to ensure that they remain up to date.
But Reka’s sales pitch won over one early customer (and investor), Snowflake, which partnered with the startup to let Snowflake customers deploy Yasa from their accounts. Appen, the big data analytics company, also recently announced that it’s working with Reka to build tailored multimodal model–powered apps for the enterprise.
Rob Toews, a partner at Radical Ventures, had this to say when we asked why he invested in Reka:
What makes Reka unique is how it offers every business the power and potential of an LLM without having to put up with many tradeoffs. Reka’s distilled Yasa models keep the data within the enterprise, they’re incredibly efficient in terms of cost and energy and they don’t require costly research teams building models from scratch. If every business will become an “AI” business, Reka’s ambition is to give each of those businesses its own, production-quality foundation model.
Yogatama says Reka, which currently isn’t generating revenue, will use its funding to date to acquire computing power from Nvidia and build a business team.

"TechCrunch+ roundup: Building growth funnels, HR tech bonanza, secondary market signals",Walter Thompson,2023/06/27,"
Building a durable growth funnel doesn’t just scale your business: it also signals to investors that a team can move directionally, which is a major confidence builder.
“Acquisition, activation and retention are critical,” writes Jonathan Martinez, TC+’s in-house growth expert. “While referral and monetization are also quite important, they won’t make or break a startup.”
He says early-stage teams should push well beyond “vanity metrics” like click-throughs and conversions to develop advanced metrics that are specific to the business they’re building.

For this article, he broke down onboarding and activation processes at several startups, including Postmates, Zoom, Uber and Canva, to show how they shaped messaging that push users deeper into their funnels.
It’s complex work, but don’t be intimidated — a growth analyst or data scientist contractor can easily set up the dashboards you’ll need to run experiments, set goals and track day-to-day progress.
“This isn’t meant to be a teardown of each specific startup, but rather a holistic look into what leading companies are doing, their mindsets when it comes to growth and how to replicate these actions in your own startup,” says Martinez.

Crypto maximalists are comfortable making big bets, but ambiguous oversight by U.S. financial agencies is holding back corporate adoption, according to a study conducted by The Block and Coinbase.
“Around 91% of surveyed executives agree that lack of clear regulation on crypto, blockchain or web3 make the space hard to navigate,” reports Jacquelyn Melinek, who interviewed Kara Calvert, head of U.S. policy at Coinbase, and Faryar Shirzad, its chief policy officer.
“It doesn’t matter where lines are drawn, we’ll build to those lines,” said Shirzad. “But we can’t deal with a lack of clarity; the uncertainty is not healthy.”

Most early-stage startups don’t have a dedicated full-time CMO, and that’s OK.
However, it’s still someone’s responsibility to capture user data, which is why growth expert Jonathan Martinez shared a guide with TC+ for developing ideal customer profiles (ICPs).
“By identifying your ideal customer personas first, you will find product-market fit faster and identify the right customers to sell to,” he writes.

Buyers and sellers in the secondary market are getting closer on prices: The average bid/ask spread at private securities marketplace Forge Global has fallen to 17%, reports Rebecca Szkutak.
“We need to watch this and see that this 17% is sustainable,” said Forge Global CEO Kelly Rodriques.
“If it is, there are a group of market participants that are watching the space and wondering when to jump back in.”

"As Lordstown immolates, SPAC deals that didn’t go to zero feel like the exception",Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/27,"
In 2020 and 2021, we had several months when enthusiasm for new EV manufacturers was crossed with the resurgence of blank-check companies. Also called special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, these listed shell companies promised quick access to capital and a path to the public markets, and a wide array of tech and tech-ish companies took them up on the offer.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

In 2020 and 2021, several electric vehicle companies took the SPAC route to raise quick cash and go public, especially because investors were pretty OK with investing in such experimental transactions. Full of enthusiasm, these companies’ investor presentations showed a clear path to production and stellar profits.
It’s obvious in retrospect, but the results often proved to be messy.
U.S.-based EV company Lordstown Motors is one such example. Today, the company filed for bankruptcy protection and sued its former partner Foxconn at the same time. As TechCrunch reported earlier this morning:
Lordstown Motors has made good on its threat to sue Foxconn, the Taiwanese company best known for manufacturing Apple’s iPhones. The EV company took legal action against Foxconn Tuesday, and simultaneously filed for bankruptcy and put itself up for sale. […]
In its complaint, Lordstown says Foxconn misled the EV maker about collaborating on vehicle development plans and was “not the partner that it promised to be.” The complaint accuses Foxconn of pretending to support the Endurance pickup truck and future joint product development in order to secure ownership over Lordstown’s most valuable asset, the Ohio manufacturing plant, and to poach some of Lordstown’s skilled manufacturing and operational employees.
It would be easy to dismiss Lordstown’s failure as the result of a dispute between the two companies. But that would be wrong. In reality, the Lordstown saga is a blend of pure SPAC nasty. Let’s take into account a few pertinent facts to form our opinions.
Lordstown’s SPAC journey

Khosla Ventures just doubled down on this handyman-on-demand service for homeowners,Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/06/27,"
If you own a home, you know that there is always something that needs to be repaired, installed or generally addressed. Whether it’s a leaky faucet, a new bed that needs to be assembled or a Nest thermostat that needs to be installed, there is always something.
One startup wants to make that particular part of home ownership less painful by offering up a dedicated handyman to be there to take care of all the random tasks on your to-do list. It’s an interesting model. Honey Homes hires the handyman as part of its staff, as a salaried employee to help ensure consistency in who’s taking care of the work in your home. Homeowners pay Honey Homes a flat fee ($200 per month or $2,000 per year) for the convenience of a membership-based “end-to-end” service using its app.
The way it works is that members are matched with a dedicated handyperson who comes by at least once a month to take care of home improvements and preventative maintenance. Because the employees are salaried, they also receive benefits, including parental leave and paid time off, a rarity in an industry that has historically relied on contractors.
Honey Homes launched the company with its first 10 beta customers in August of 2021 and is currently available to single-family homeowners in all of the San Francisco Bay Area suburbs, although not San Francisco proper. It recently began operations in Dallas.
Husband and wife team Vishwas Prabhakara (Yelp’s first general manager) and Avantika Prabhakara (a former marketing head at Opendoor, Trulia and Zillow) teamed up with Katie Pham and Rory O’Connell to start Honey Homes in 2021.
In the last two years, Honey Homes has grown to more than 500 members and has completed over 20,000 tasks for homeowners, according to Vishwas. The company grew members — and thus revenue — by 8x in 2022, he added, and almost doubled already this year.
Since inception, the company has raised a total of $12.1 million in funding, including more recently $9 million in a Series A led by Khosla Ventures. Khosla and Pear VC co-led Honey Homes’ seed round in 2021. Other backers include Teambuilder Ventures and Moving Capital, along with angel investors such as DoorDash co-founders Tony Xu and Stanley Tang, Lyft co-founder Logan Green, Opendoor co-founder Eric Wu and Mercury co-founder Immad Akhund, among others. 
Vishwas told TechCrunch he began working on the company in earnest after talking to a number of homeowners and concluding that there would be enough people interested in paying for a generalist to come to their house once or twice a month for ongoing maintenance or improvement work. 
“I asked them, ‘would that be interesting to you? Would you pay for that?’ And surprisingly to me, the answer was a resounding yes,” he said. “We seemed to hit a nerve with homeowners.”
The Honey Homes app lets a homeowner create a to-do list and schedule appointments. It also helps pair homeowners with specialists if needed.
But what if, I was curious, you cross all the tasks off your to-do list? What then?
“The one thing that has been really eye-opening is that by offering this as a membership service, all of a sudden you realize you want more,” Vishwas said.”And there are some people who just like the peace of mind.”
Honey Homes employs 45 people, including 25 handy people. Vishwas said the consistency of workers has helped boost its credibility.
“From a homeowner perspective, what you want is somebody you can build a relationship with and trust,” he told TechCrunch. “And so seeing the same person over and over is highly valuable to a homeowner.”
The startup has also launched something called Honey Homes University, or a training facility for people who work in the field so they can build their skills. Looking ahead, Honey Homes eventually plans to expand into urban centers but for now is focused on serving suburban single family homeowners, which Vishwas says tend to have a wider set of upkeep and maintenance needs. 
Khosla Partner Evan Moore, who joined the Honey Homes board as part of the Series A funding round and also is a co-founder of DoorDash, said that while he was VP of product at Opendoor he saw that the company “could get dramatically better service, quality and pricing from home service providers.”
But as an individual homeowner, “it’s hard to reliably get good work done at a reasonable cost.”
Moore wrote via email: “Many startups have attempted to improve this customer experience and failed, but it seems Honey Homes got it right. Rarely does an idea work so well so quickly. I’ve been involved since day one and have been fortunate to see the incredible response from customers.”
He believes that Honey Homes differs from many other consumer startups in the home services space that simply match homeowners with potential vendors or “serve as a concierge.”
Added Moore: “Honey Homes solves the whole problem of home improvement and maintenance, from idea to completion. By doing quality work repeatedly, we build trust with our customers. They then reward us with more work over time.”

"Gusto reaches $500M in trailing revenue, teams up with Remote to support international hires",Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/27,"
Gusto, best known for its American payroll management software and services, is playing in the big leagues.
TechCrunch+ has exclusively learned that Gusto has surpassed a significant revenue milestone: In its most recent fiscal year (the 12 months ended April 30, 2023), it generated revenue of more than $500 million, the company said.
The company also has a key profitability benchmark within reach, anticipating reaching free cash flow positivity in the next few quarters, where it expects to stay thereafter.
Gusto has so far held details regarding its financial performance close to its chest, so these numbers are illuminating. In 2021, the company admitted to recording revenue in the nine figures, but these new details place Gusto among the largest private-market tech companies in terms of scale.
We could better nail down Gusto’s place in the private technology company hierarchy if we had, say, a fourth-quarter revenue figure that we could annualize. But given what we have, Gusto certainly ended its last fiscal year on a greater run rate than $500 million, meaning that it is far and away large enough to go public in its current form.
Gusto declined to share information relating to its recent growth rate, but CEO Josh Reeves told TechCrunch in 2021 that his company was growing around 50% per year.
Reaching cash flow positivity is notable for Gusto in today’s business climate, which has many tech startups and unicorns working to conserve cash. Ending cash burn is not a simple process. “At-scale companies should have a path to be able to fund themselves,” Reeves told TechCrunch+, adding that his company has “been on a path” to cash flow positivity for the past four or five years.
Understandably, Gusto has no plans to raise more outside capital. That said, we don’t expect it to pursue a direct listing when it does go public.

When the tech IPO market reopens, keep an eye on HR unicorns

Partner power
How did Gusto breach the half-billion-dollar revenue milestone? By pursuing a multipart model. Back in mid-2021, the company launched an embedded payroll feature, which allowed other companies to offer its payroll services to their customers inside their app or service.
The work has paid off: The company told TechCrunch this week that since its launch, its embedded payroll service has grown to a partner base of 27. Those partners, in turn, support more than a half-million businesses. Gusto also said that it has agreements with a few “Fortune 250” companies but declined to share their names.
Gusto’s efforts to offer its payroll services to other companies via an API was foreshadowing, to a degree. Reeves indicated at the time of the launch that more of Gusto’s platform would become available via an API over time. That was made possible by the company’s work to use internal APIs to power its own software.
And this prior API-related work stands to pay dividends, given that Gusto announced this morning that it is teaming up with Remote to support international hires.
Remote + Gusto
In the United States, Gusto is best known for its HR tech business, including payroll and benefits management. Remote, in contrast, helps companies hire and support full-time staff around the world.
Gusto powers its American customers’ domestic payroll and supports international contractors, while Remote allows companies to hire internationally, handling the necessary work to do so in a compliant manner.
According to Reeves, demand for Gusto to support full-time international workers was clear — in a more remote-friendly world, this is not a massive shock — which makes the Remote partnership feel contentedly logical. Gusto confirmed that the deal is a revenue-share arrangement.
But why not build instead of partnering with another company? Reeves framed his company’s choice by reaching back in time, explaining that Gusto launched only with support for California before going on to support all U.S. states over the next three years. It chose to leave revenue on the table by being methodical.
He said that Remote has taken a similar approach to international markets, “expanding country by country” by building the “right infrastructure” to do so.
That shared perspective regarding careful compliance and the chance at a quick time to market made the Remote partnership a “no-brainer,” Reeves said. The two companies also share a backer in General Catalyst.
For Remote, the deal took a while to close but left both parties quite happy, its CEO Job van der Voort told TechCrunch+.
Van der Voort said that a few years ago, his company decided to offer its services through APIs, mirroring what we heard from Gusto back in 2021. The result is that Gusto customers will be able to add international talent via Remote inside of the Gusto app. There will be a button, van der Voort explained, which sounds simple enough.
To begin with, Gusto customers can start hiring via Remote in Canada, and more markets will be added shortly thereafter. Van der Voort said he wants to bring his company to as many markets as possible in time, past the 75 or so it currently supports. So, Gusto customers could have the ability to hire nearly anywhere globally when that happens. For both unicorns, that shared capability could unlock a new bloc of growth.
Before we get into the competitive considerations at play in the deal, we should note that both companies were not bowled over when we recommended that they just get it over with and do a merger.
Is Gusto’s $500 million number big?
According to PitchBook data, Gusto’s most recent private valuation was around $9.6 billion, just shy of the decacorn mark. Remote is worth a flat $3 billion, according to Crunchbase. The two companies therefore represent a massive amount of private-market wealth held by dozens of investors. If this deal goes well and allows each to do more total business, it could make a lot of pockets fatter. "
4 VCs illustrate why there’s good reason to be optimistic about the machine learning startup market,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/27,"
When you talk about investments in artificial intelligence startups versus machine learning startups, it’s important to distinguish “AI” from “machine learning.” Those phrases are often used interchangeably, but they carry a slightly different meaning.
Machine learning, or ML, is a method of training AI models so that they can learn to make decisions. Put another way, ML involves training models to solve specific tasks by learning from data and making predictions. AI, on the other hand, is the broader concept for systems that mimic human cognition.
So ML is a subfield of AI but not the same thing.
Lonne Jaffe, managing director at Insight Partners, explains that Insight uses a “three-layer” framework to unpack the definition of an ML startup.

We’re widening our lens, looking for more investors to participate in TechCrunch+ surveys, where we poll top professionals about challenges in their industry.
If you’re an investor and would like to participate in future surveys, fill out this form.

At the first layer, he says, are core infrastructure companies — products with which a person builds an ML system. At the second layer are apps that seek to tackle a particular use case or workflow using ML. The third layer, meanwhile, comprises ML startups that manifest within an industry as an “actual player” in that industry — think startups that become a startup bank, even if the core of the startup is still ML talent.
According to this framework, examples of ML startups range from Weights & Biases, which provides tools to create and monitor AI models, to Iterative Health, a healthcare company that leverages an ML system designed to identify cancerous polyps from a colonoscopy.
The market for ML is quite large, with a report from Grand View Research estimating that it was worth $49.6 billion in 2022 and could grow at a CAGR of 33.5% by 2030. And it’s been building for some time: A 2021 survey by Dresner Advisory Services found that 59% of all large enterprises are deploying ML, with 50% of those organizations claiming to have 25 or more ML models in use today.
Why is this area growing so fast? 451 Research, the tech R&D group within S&P, posited in a recent report that the initial wave of ML adoption focused on making legacy systems and processes smarter — like business intelligence, customer support, sales and marketing and security. But now, as those applications mature, the attention has shifted to more niche, industry-specific and lucrative ML applications, particularly in finance, retail, manufacturing and healthcare.
Jerry Chen, a partner at Greylock, believes we’re just starting to see what the next generation of ML companies will be. “The cycle is going strong,” he told TechCrunch+. “I’m curious to see how incumbent companies and tech players enter, compete or partner with the startups. In particular, I think we will see some interesting go-to-market partnerships in the next few months.”
But what about the broader VC ecosystem? Are VCs in general optimistic about the future of ML?
To get a better sense, TechCrunch+ surveyed investors including Chen and Jaffe about the state of ML investing today. We touched on the health of the ML funding landscape, and whether the hype around ML, which several years ago was quite strong, is beginning to die down. We also asked investors what challenges stand in the way of ML tech adoption and what the next few months might look like in terms of market growth.
We spoke with:

Lonne Jaffe, managing director, Insight Partners
Jerry Chen, partner, Greylock
Ashish Kakran, principal, Thomvest
Janelle Teng, VP, Bessemer Venture Partners

How strong is the ML venture fundraising market today and how has it evolved thus far in 2023?
The release of ChatGPT five months ago sparked the fire of startup innovation around ML, along with a renewed fundraising dynamic. We’ve gone from systems of prediction — like classification or recommendation systems — to systems of creation. While funding has been flowing into generative ML systems, there has also been a lot of progress in more “traditional,” discriminative ML systems, like prediction or classification systems.
We’ve been particularly active recently in applied computer vision ML systems in healthcare, some of which may soon match or even exceed human physician performance across certain domains. For example, dental startup Overjet uses AI to analyze dental X-rays to help dentists decide if a tooth needs a filling or a crown, improving patient outcomes. "
Prosus slashes edtech giant Byju’s valuation to $5.1 billion,Manish Singh,2023/06/27,"
Prosus, the largest non-founder shareholder in Byju’s, has drastically slashed the worth of its stake in the edtech giant, implying a starkly diminished valuation of $5.1 billion to the Indian startup.
Prosus disclosed on Tuesday that it had downsized the value of its 9.6% stake in Byju’s to around $493 million in the financial year ending in March. This figure stands in stark contrast to the $6 billion at which Prosus had valued Byju’s as recently as November of the previous year. More concerningly, that’s a staggering drop from the $22 billion valuation at which Byju’s has raised multiple tranches of funding in the past 18 months.
The markdown comes at a time when the most Indian valuable startup is grappling with a number of challenges — a legal battle with lenders, resignation of board members and departure of global auditing firm Deloitte.
Prosus, Peak XV Partners and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative confirmed late last week that their representatives had resigned from the board of Byju’s. The board members’ resignations came shortly after Deloitte told the startup’s board that it was also resigning from its role.
Deloitte, which was slated to work with Byju’s until 2025, said that the edtech giant had failed to hand over financial results for the year ended March 2022.
In its Tuesday annual report, Prosus said it had lost “significant influence” in Byju’s during the current year “due to the loss of board representation.”
Prosus is not only one of the largest shareholders of Byju’s, it’s also one of the earliest. The investment giant has never sold its stake in the Indian startup, which has raised over $6 billion to date. It’s also not the only Byju’s shareholder to write down the worth of their startup stake.
Byju Raveendran, the co-founder and chief executive of Byju’s, has been working on securing a substantial large funding round to calm his existing investors.
TechCrunch reported last month that Byju’s was in talks with sovereign wealth funds and other investors, aiming to raise up to $950 million.
In a shareholder call last week, the chief financial officer of Byju’s pledged to have the auditing for the financial year ending March 2022 conclude by September this year, and for the financial year ending March 2023 by December, said a person briefed on the minutes of the call.
Raveendran also assured shareholders that he had intended a smoother transition for board members and acknowledged the abrupt departure of Deloitte.
He attempted to assuage the concerns by stating that he was all-in committed to Byju’s, having injected hundreds of millions of dollars of personal funds, taken as loans, into the company.
“Byju’s is not my work; it is my life,” he stated, according to the person briefed.

Glean operational advice from Airbnb and Instacart at TC Disrupt 2023’s Builders Stage,Lauren Simonds,2023/06/26,"
What does it take to turn an unknown startup into a household name? The ability to scale. It’s the Holy Grail that every early-stage startup founder chases. Scaling internal operations may lack the glamor of funding rounds and founder profiles, but it’s essential heavy lifting for startup success.
Founders looking for inspiration need look no further than Airbnb and Instacart. These two respected companies share important similarities. They scaled to massive size, and each added to their initial wins: Airbnb Experiences and Instacart ad network.
We’re thrilled that Naba Banerjee, director of trust product and operations at Airbnb, and Asha Sharma, COO at Instacart, will join us for a session called “How to Build Intelligent Startup Ops that Will Scale with Your Business.” You’ll find it on the Builders Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023, which takes place on September 19–21 in San Francisco.
Scaling is no simple feat — if it were, every startup would be a unicorn. Both Banerjee and Sharma are consummate leaders with visibility into two companies that have practically turned scaling into an art form.
We look forward to hearing their individual perspectives on what it takes to build out operations that support and grow along with your company. We’ll ask questions along the lines of:

How do you know when someone on staff is not up to taking their team or department to the next level, and whether you need to hire someone externally?
How do you handle cultural consistency during periods of rapid hiring, especially in a multi-office model?

And that’s just for starters. If you’re looking for operational tips and insight, you don’t want to miss this session.
Learn more about our expert speakers — and their qualifications for scaling startups into massive companies — below.
Naba Banerjee: Airbnb director of Trust Product and Operations

BentoML scores $9M funding to expedite AI app development,Rita Liao,2023/06/26,"
The success of large language models like GPT has sparked a frenzy of developers eager to make AI-powered applications. But building AI services can be tricky, especially due to the shortage of skilled developers to meet the rising demand these days.
That’s where Chaoyu Yang, an early software engineer at the data mega-unicorn Databricks, comes in. Along with his co-founders, he’s built the AI development framework BentoML, which just announced a seed financing round.
Yang, in an interview with TechCrunch, explained that today’s AI services are often built on multiple machine learning models, making their management and operation complicated. Many programmers entering the fray are coming from a full-stack or application development background, meaning they often lack the skills to build the required AI infrastructure, resulting in a prolonged development process.
A demo AI app like Microsoft’s Visual ChatGPT, an upgrade to the chatbot that allows it to produce responses from both text and image prompts, for example, can take at least three to six months to make it production-ready, Yang said.
While tech behemoths like Microsoft enjoy the financial prowess and human capital to train AI models and put them to use in the real world, smaller businesses, in Yang’s words, are collecting “valuable data that can benefit tremendously from AI” but “lack the resources to build the infrastructure for development.”
BentoML, which provides a high-level API that abstracts away the details of the infrastructure needed for running AI models on the cloud, belongs to a camp of tools like SageMaker that wants to smooth the path for developing AI services. It’s a so-called AI application framework, a set of tools that make it easier to build, ship and scale AI applications, like a construction tool kit one uses to build a house.
Specifically, BentoML is targeting data scientists who train AI models, DevOp engineers who manage their lifecycle and developers who actually build applications on top of the models.
With BentoML, developers can make Visual ChatGPT scalable and cost-efficient for production use in as short as two days, said Yang. Users have also used the framework to run the art generator Stable Diffusion and open source LLMs on the cloud.
Yang compared his company to Vercel, which focuses on serving front-end developers and was last valued at over $1 billion. BentoML aims to be the Vercel for AI, he said.
While Yang predicted that AI would eventually become more production-ready, he admitted he didn’t think the AI application wave would arrive so soon. The founder expects AI app developers to account for over 90% of the platform’s users in the future.
“If you ask me a year ago, I’d say that probably 90% of the companies would be training their own models, but the foundation models that have recently emerged are so powerful that they can perform well even given a dataset it has never seen before,” he said.
“Rather than focusing on model training, developers now only need to work on finetuning and product engineering, which in themselves present a bottleneck because of the shortage of AI-focused developers.”
BentoML was open sourced in 2019 and later introduced a self-hosted SaaS version to enterprise customers. It’s been acquiring users organically through its open source community, which quadrupled its membership to more than 3,000 over the past year, with Japanese messaging giant Line and South Korean internet conglomerate Naver being among its early adopters.
Yang declined to disclose the company’s revenue size.
Investors are taking note of BentoML’s traction in the developer community. The startup recently raised $9 million from its seed financing round led by DCM Ventures, with Bow Capital also participating. DCM’s general partner, Hurst Lin, has joined BentoML’s board following the round.
The exuberant AI market has been a boon to BentoML, but the rapidly changing industry also makes it tricky for the team to juggle short- and long-term goals, Yang admitted.
“You might have to build things that ride the current trend, but in the long term, we of course want to have our own moat. The question is how we balance our time and human resources between the two.”
Update (June 28, 2023): The article previously stated that Line was a South Korean company. Line is headquartered in Japan and is a subsidiary of Z Holdings, a joint venture between Japan’s SoftBank and South Korea’s Naver.

French VC firm Frst reaches $80 million first close for its new seed fund,Romain Dillet,2023/06/25,"
Frst, the Paris-based VC firm with no vowel in its name, is in the process of raising its second fund. The firm has already reached a first closing of €72 million (nearly $80 million at today’s exchange rate).
And if there’s one thing to say about this new fund it’s that business is as usual for Frst. As the name suggests, Frst aims to be the first VC firm to invest in a tech startup.
Frst even tells me that around half of the VC firm’s term sheets are sent before the startups are incorporated. The firm has decided to keep the same formula, with some fresh capital to invest over the next few years.
The team, led by Pierre Entremont and Bruno Raillard, originally met when they were working for Otium Venture as part of Pierre-Édouard Stérin’s family office. In 2019, the team created its own VC firm and raised the initial Frst fund (called Frst 2). At the time, Frst raised €90 million (nearly $100 million at today’s exchange rate).
With today’s new fund called Frst 3, the investment firm expects to reach the upper limit of €100 million ($110 million). Frst has secured funding from the European Investment Fund, Bpifrance’s Fonds National d’Amorçage 2, Axa Venture Partners and Isomer. Several individual investors are also investing in the fund itself, such as entrepreneurs working for PayFit, Owkin, Shippeo, Pigment, Electra, Supercell, Wolt, Aiven and Homa Games.
While Frst doesn’t focus on one vertical in particular, the firm believes that there will be plenty of interesting investment opportunities in the coming years due to the rise of artificial intelligence.
“The rapid developments observed in the field of Artificial Intelligence over the past few months and the disruptions they are creating make an extremely favorable context for startups. From work to medicine, defense, education, or natural resource management, the economy and society as a whole are preparing to undergo unprecedented changes,” Entremont said in a statement.
Overall, if you include Otium Venture’s original €44 million fund, the Frst team has more than €200 million of assets managed or advised ($219 million). With this metric, Frst says that it is now the largest seed fund focused on French startups specifically.
“France is particularly well positioned to play a leading role in this upcoming revolution, notably due to its production of top technical talent. This is why Artificial Intelligence has always been a very present theme in our investments, with, for instance, Owkin or Doctrine 7 years ago. We have also already made several investments with Frst 3 in teams with remarkable technical quality,” Raillard said in a statement.
The Frst team has invested in dozens of startups, such as Pigment, Electra, Poolside, Doctrine, PayFit, Shippeo and Owkin. With its new fund, it plans to invest between €1 million and €3 million in around 30 companies.

utu raises $33M to help travelers get more from tax-free shopping,Catherine Shu,2023/06/25,"
utu, a travel tech company that helps flyers get more out of their tax-free shopping, announced today it has raised a $33 million Series B from investors, including SC Ventures. utu also announced it has acquired CardsPal, a Singapore-based fintech that offers deals and promotions nearby to users.
During the pandemic-induced travel hiatus, utu worked to establish partnerships with travel, hotel chain and retail brands. The company notes that even though travel has rebounded, only about 1% of venture funding over the past 15 years has gone to travel, primarily short-term rental hospitality. utu’s goal is to create innovation in the tax-free shopping sector, which allows tourists to reclaim VAT on their purchases.
utu offers customers a Tax Free Card, which has two main offerings. First, tax-free shoppers can opt for frequent flyer miles or hotel points instead of VAT refunds. Or they can select an immediate store voucher that is equal to 120% of the VAT or GST they paid while shopping overseas. utu says that retailers, airlines, hotels and other organizations that partner with them can not only increase customer loyalty, but also grow their revenue from tourist shopping by up to 40%.
utu’s partners include 10 global airlines, like Air France-KLM, Emirates, Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines, as well as Accor, one of Europe’s large hospitality brands. To facilitate payments, utu works with fintech partners with Nium and also uses its own proprietary tech. It plans to announce more partnerships later this year.
Customer pay VAT upfront, and can reclaim it through operators like Planet or Global Blue. But they don’t get back the full amount of VAT, which is where utu comes in.
utu co-founder Asad Jumabhoy spent eight years working in the duty-free business, before another 25 in tax-free shopping. While operating fashion and perfume stores at Changi Airport in Singapore in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Jumabhoy started a tax refund business that evolved into Global Blue. After selling Global Blue in 2012, Jumabhoy decided to take his understanding of retail margins, value-added taxes and customer shopping habits to develop utu.
“The way we think about our work is that we are unbuilding new product layers on top of the existing tax-free shopping infrastructure that unlocks value for all stakeholders connected to tourist shopping — brands, tourists and our VAT refund partners,” he said.
Jumabhoy said even though tax-free shopping is a common practice, there are still two problems. The first is that the process of getting VAT refunds is difficult, and secondly, tourists only get part of their VAT spending back. utu focuses on the second problem and wants to give tourists more value when they shop. For example, they can receive over 90% of their refund value in airline frequent flyer miles.
The CardsPal acquisition will give utu a digital marketplace, a promotions engine and self-service merchant registration portal. It will also expedite utu’s rollout in markets like France and Italy, plus another 50 countries that offer VAT and GST refunds.
utu’s funding will be used to grow its product distribution across all countries that offer a VAT refund service, invest in technology and new products and strengthen its management to execute its growth plan.

There are signs that it will be a hot secondaries summer,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/06/25,"
One of the main reasons we have yet to see a meaningful recovery in late-stage deal activity is the lack of consensus around how startups should be valued. No one wants to pay 2021 prices, but gauging what startups are worth now isn’t easy.
However, there are signs that folks are coming to an agreement.
Last week, Forge Global, a private securities marketplace, released data that shows the average difference between what secondary sellers were looking to sell for and what buyers were looking to buy shares for — also known as the bid/ask spread — had decreased to 17%. This is the lowest percentage in a year, showing that buyers and sellers are starting to get on the same page regarding price.

Did this one feature entice Robinhood to acquire X1?,Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/06/25,"
Welcome back to The Interchange! If you want this in your inbox, sign up here. We’re back after a brief hiatus, with lots of fintech news, including Robinhood’s latest acquisition, Plaid’s newest product and a ChatGPT-powered AI tool that aims to help you save money on bills.
Robinhood’s motives
When Robinhood announced on June 22 that it was acquiring credit card startup X1 for $95 million, it caused all sorts of chatter in the fintech world.
Why would Robinhood want to buy a credit card startup? Did it get a good deal, considering that X1 has raised only $62 million over its lifetime? Did its investors get a good deal or just a return on their investment? Why X1 in particular over the many other credit card startups out there?
Let’s talk about that last point first.
When we talked to X1 in December at the time of its last fundraise, founder and CEO Deepak Rao told us the company was launching a new trading platform that would give its cardholders the ability to buy stocks by using earned reward points. He even singled out Robinhood as a company he was hoping to compete with, telling TechCrunch: “By using credit card points to buy stock instead of cash or their savings, we feel this is a safe way for many consumers to start investing. There is no real downside as their investing is technically free.”
Aha.
Could that be what drew Robinhood to X1??
On this week’s Equity podcast, we chatted about that possibility, with co-host Alex Wilhelm noting that one would have to earn a lot of rewards before being able to buy many stocks. He also pointed out that Robinhood perhaps had some money to burn, as well as the company declaring that it was looking for something new as a way of “broadening [its] product offerings” and “deepening” its relationship with existing customers.
If you’ve been following Robinhood’s performance over the past year, a desire to diversify its business is probably not a surprise. We noted that not only has Robinhood’s crypto trading slowed, but also the company has seen significant user attrition. So an X1 acquisition gets Robinhood into the credit card space and an additional revenue stream.
Still, one observer noted that while X1’s basic premise of offering credit based on income rather than credit score was innovative, since it first formed in 2020 it has not really since delivered anything — other than the new stock feature — that stands out in the market.
Fintech analyst Alex Johnson shared a similar sentiment, tweeting: “The brand alignment is strong. Both companies have a certain unearned machismo about them. Other than that though, I don’t get this for Robinhood. X1 doesn’t have a lot of customers (did it ever even fully launch?) and none of its features are revolutionary.”
It is true that X1 may not have had a lot of customers, especially in comparison to a giant like Robinhood, but the company claimed to be on a growth trajectory, with Rao telling us last December that the company saw $3 million a month in revenue last October, giving it an annual revenue rate of $36 million.
Not everyone is down on the deal, though. Better Tomorrow Ventures’ Sheel Mohnot tweeted that while X1 may not have a lot of customers, Robinhood does. He added: “[T]his seems like a good acquisition to me, cheaper to cross-sell than to sell to new customers.”

Weekly News
Fintech startup Plaid got its start as a company that connects consumer bank accounts to financial applications but has since been gradually expanding its offerings to offer more of a full-stack onboarding experience. And on June 22, Plaid announced even more new product releases that moved the company into a whole new direction while also helping to diversify its revenue streams. At the top of that lies Beacon, which it is describing as a “collaborative anti-fraud network enabling financial institutions and fintech companies to share critical fraud intelligence via API across Plaid.” More here.
Navan (formerly TripActions) offers both a corporate card and a subscription to its software. In a twist, the company announced on June 12 the launch of a new product called Navan Connect, which it describes as a patented card-link technology that gives businesses a way to offer automated expense management and reconciliation without having to change their corporate card provider. For the initial launch, Navan has partnered with Mastercard and Visa, with plans to announce additional network tie-ups in the near future. More here.
Spend management startup Brex was named to Time’s 100 Most Influential Companies list. As it made the recognition, Time wrote: “Co-CEO Henrique Dubugras says think of Brex as a ‘spend platform.’ The company launched its corporate charge card for startups five years ago, and has since grown into a fintech conqueror. Valued at $12.3 billion in 2022, it has made 10 acquisitions, and after Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse, it received $2 billion in deposits and opened 4,000 new accounts. Last year Brex launched Empower, software that links Brex cards and accounts to a custom expense-­management service. The company services startups, helping new businesses get off the ground, as well as enterprise clients, including DoorDash, Indeed, Coinbase, SeatGeek, and Lemonade.” Ramp, another spend management startup, also made the list, with Time writing: “Notching an $8.1 billion valuation just three years after being founded is striking, even for a tech startup. While many fin­tech companies struggled last year, Ramp’s meteoric rise accelerated. The business-expense-software firm saw revenues quadruple as its customers looked to stay lean through inflation. Ramp’s Visa cards are tied to employer-­set policies, so employees instantly know if charges are approved; reports and receipts aren’t always needed. Employers get alerts about duplicate expenses and items they may be overpaying for. ”
Brubank, an Argentina-based digital bank founded by former Citibank executive Juan Bruchou, shared with TechCrunch that since launching in 2019, it has brought in nearly 3 million clients, making Brubank “the largest Spanish-speaking digital bank in Latin America, with a 50% activity rate,” according to the company. It also has been sustaining bottom line profitability for the past 12 months.
At least two companies are poised for a credit card launch this summer: Snowfoll, one of three startups that pitched at TC Early Stage Boston in April, will launch a credit card in July that is tailored to users in the U.S. and India so they can more easily transmit cash cross-border. The company said users in the U.S. are eligible for limits as high as $30,000, and the card reduces the need for having separate bank accounts in the U.S. and India. In addition, the process is instant and cost-free. Meanwhile, Step, the financial platform tailored to teens, their families and young adults, opened up a waitlist for its latest card, Step Black Card. Cardholders will be eligible for perks, including earning 5% on savings balances up to $1 million and up to 8x the points on purchases. Read TechCrunch coverage on Step here and here.

The start of a new season is always a good time to revisit past predictions and look for new topics to track. Today, dry powder and university spinouts. — Anna
Record levels of dry powder in Europe?
In November of last year, PitchBook made so many predictions on venture capital and private equity in Europe that it is now reexamining them in a fresh report.
The new report, titled “European Private Capital Outlook: H1 Follow-Up,” doesn’t just look at whether PitchBook analysts were right or wrong. It also reevaluates its forecasts and what changed since then to make new assertions.
Several of PitchBook’s new predictions have to do with private equity, but the one that caught my attention relates more directly to startups: the amount of venture capital that may or may not be available to them.
Often referred to as dry powder, the money raised by VC funds that hasn’t been invested yet was expected by PitchBook to reach record levels in Europe this year. Its EMEA Private Capital analyst Nicolas Moura stands by the prediction, but the nuances between then and now are worth exploring.

Deal Dive: Caraway shows what else digital health can do,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/06/24,"
Access to healthcare has long been an issue in the U.S., but the sheer magnitude of the problem became apparent during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Numerous digital health startups stepped in to address the plethora of issues, and for a few quarters, VCs flocked to back them.
Many of those startups are still focusing on the same things, like telehealth primary care or chat-based therapy, but there’s little visibility into the adoption and customer acquisition they’ve seen. It’s clear investors aren’t so sure either: VC investment in digital health dropped to just $3.4 billion in Q1 2023 from a peak of $15.1 billion in Q2 2021, according to CB Insights.
I’m not saying the sector is dead in the water by any means, but the founders still finding success are doing far more than merely building off their peers. A recent fundraise illustrates clearly what VCs are finding attractive in the sector, and the types of startups that may find traction in today’s climate.
On Wednesday, digital health startup Caraway said it had raised an oversubscribed $16.8 million Series A round led by Maveron. The startup looks to offer 24/7 access to physical and mental health resources targeted at Gen Z customers, and its integrated healthcare service has doctors and nurses who are always available for text chats and calls. It also offers tools that help its customers maintain and respond to mental and physical health issues in between appointments or when professionals are offline. The app is licensed to operate in 10 states.
When founder Lori Evans Bernstein started the company in January 2022, she had just left her previous startup, HealthReveal, which used AI to help people manage chronic illnesses. Around the time, Evans Bernstein realized how hard it could be for people to get treatments when talking with her niece: After 15 weeks of fruitlessly waiting for appointments to treat a reaction to an unknown allergy, her niece simply gave up and hoped it wouldn’t come back.
“The more I peeled the onion, the more I couldn’t believe the lack of access to care and the experience they had to go through to get the care they needed,” Evans Bernstein said. That story inspired her to start Caraway, aiming to do away with those barriers to accessing healthcare. "
What happens if regulators nix the $20B Adobe-Figma deal?,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/23,"
When Adobe announced it was putting up $20 billion to buy Figma in September 2022, it didn’t take long before people began assuming it was a blatant attempt to take a competitor off the market. 
It was certainly curious, especially considering the offer was double what the company’s most recent valuation had been and worth around 50x Figma’s revenue. It’s hard to argue that the deal wasn’t a display of brute force on Adobe’s part, the kind of corporate rollup that regulators are trying to put a stop to after years of letting the tech giants run rampant, buying up startups that could eventually erode their market share.
The proposed Adobe-Figma deal has certainly gotten the attention of regulators — and not in a welcoming way. Already, the Justice Department, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) — Britain’s competition watchdog — and the EU are taking long, hard looks at the deal, and it wouldn’t be too much of a stretch to think that any of them could nix the deal for being anticompetitive.
“We are still in preliminary phases of the regulatory process and are having constructive discussions with the CMA, EC and DOJ about the businesses, markets and positive economic impacts this deal will bring to support [customers’ positive] reviews [of the product],” an Adobe spokesperson told TechCrunch+.
It seems pretty obvious even to a casual observer that Adobe is trying to take a potential rival off the board, a move that could stifle both competition and innovation, not a great mix for design software consumers. 
To be sure, the deal would give Adobe an entirely new look, one it has tried to build on its own with a design tool rival, Adobe XD. But XD never gained much traction, which explains why the company was willing to fork over $20 billion to get the cream of the crop.
In an interview at TechCrunch Disrupt last fall, Figma co-founder Dylan Field argued that the two companies would truly be better together. But of course he has 20 billion reasons to think that.
When asked to explain why he decided to join forces with the company that his marketing team had been painting as its biggest rival, he saw two companies marrying creativity and design, and he couldn’t see having the resources to move in that direction on his own, at least not for a long time. “If we want to go and make it so that we’re able to go into all these more productivity areas, that’s gonna take a lot of time. To be able to go and do that in the context of Adobe, I think gives us a huge leg up, and I’m really excited about that,” Field said.
But with regulators looking closely, it’s not a stretch to wonder if that’s ever going to happen. But even if it does, would the deal be a net-positive for Figma and its backers? Let’s talk about it. "
When AI bots pose as humans,Haje Jan Kamps,2023/06/23,"
Welcome to Startups Weekly. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday afternoon.
This week, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about the implications of artificial intelligence. One of the most fragile parts of the puzzle is the training data. We already know that you can see if your images were used to train the datasets and that a lot of the training datasets out there are . . . spurious at best. Some startups are trying to build datasets trained exclusively on licensed data, and human artists are pretty grumpy when big-name studios use AI to generate art.
An interesting curveball is realizing that even evaluating training data may be challenging, as researchers discover that Mechanical Turk workers — who are, in theory, human workers doing tasks that machines can’t do — are reportedly using AI tools themselves. That’s fine for some tasks, but not great if the text they are generating is meant to be used as the rubric that AI-generating text tools are measured against. The old computing adage of “garbage in, garbage out” still stands. If you can’t trust the training data, you can’t trust the output (TC+).
Seen through the lens of startups, AI is continuing to go gangbusters — and Amazon’s AWS is throwing its not inconsiderable weight behind the burgeoning trend, with a $100 million program to fund generative AI initiatives.
The highest highs and deepest lows of transportation

It’s a bad week when a submersible goes missing, followed by a series of reports showing that perhaps the company didn’t have the most solid safety track record. The sub imploded under the ocean’s crushing pressure, killing its five passengers and raising new questions about the role of whistleblowers in startup land. The OceanGate underwater vessel used a carbon fiber hull that “wasn’t rated for Titanic depths,” claimed the operations-director-turned-whistleblower. It goes to show that, while startups famously “move fast and break stuff,” perhaps that tenet doesn’t quite extend to life-or-death critical equipment.
A highlight for transportation this week is a breakthrough in battery manufacturing. It turns out that up to half the energy required to make a lithium-ion cell is used in the process of drying certain components of the battery cell. Volkswagen just came up with a new process (TC+) that does away with that requirement, drastically reducing the cost and time it takes to create the batteries that power our electric vehicles.

Hackers gonna hack
Image Credits: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch
Both in startup land and beyond, we are seeing a tremendous amount of movement in security news over the past couple of weeks. We’ve had a ton of coverage of Reddit slowly imploding over the new API charges the social media giant introduced a little while back. But one story I particularly wanted to highlight is that hackers are threatening to release confidential data stolen from Reddit unless the company pays a ransom demand — and reverses its controversial API price hikes. It seems pretty curious for hackers to demand both policy changes and cash. If they were given one or the other, I wonder which they would choose — and what that says about the power of hack-tivism.
Malicious hacking has long been in the news, but I find it particularly interesting that we are seeing more and more startups trying to help tackle the problem, whether that’s hardening API security, data security at source or Internet of Things devices. As hackers get more sophisticated, and as computer security exploit exploration becomes more prevalent (just last week, a ransomware gang listed its first victims of MOVEit mass-hacks, which included U.S. banks and universities), opportunities for startups also increase. And yet, as Alex explored recently, it seems like a miss that VCs aren’t queuing around the block (TC+) to fund the current generation of cybersecurity companies.

That seems bad. That’s bad, right? Yeah, that’s bad: A simple bug exposed access to thousands of smart security alarm systems.

You’re so money and you don’t even know it

Fintech, what are we going to do with you? Even in an industry that’s all about money, the vertical just continues exploding with investment. Paro raised $25 million to match independent financial experts with firms, open banking fintech company Volt just raised a huge round at a valuation north of $350 million, and Majority, a digital bank for U.S. migrants, closed almost $10 million as it expands operations in Texas.
Sexy it ain’t, but investors know that fintech — once the company gets a soupçon of traction and a fistful of customers — is interesting for two reasons: Money never goes out of fashion, and there are M&A-hungry multinational giants who are standing by to snap up a company that’s on the upswing. At startup scale, the most recent example was that Robinhood just acquired credit card startup X1 for $95 million. At a very different scale indeed, Nasdaq announced it is planning to acquire financial services software company Adenza for $10.5 billion.
There’s money in them money trees, it appears.

That’s it, no more fraud for you: Mary Ann reports that Plaid unveils a new collaboration network aimed at sharing fraud intelligence.

Don’t wait to identify your startup’s ideal customer personas



Don’t reinvent the growth funnel.
There’s more than a decade of growth marketing now behind us. Thousands of startups have experimented with infinite variations and tweaks to their growth funnel, so why should you try to reinvent the same foundation?
The most important aspects are acquisition, activation and retention. While referral and monetization are also quite important, they won’t make or break a startup like those first three. If you can’t acquire, activate or retain consumers to your startup, your probability of success is practically nil.
In this article I will walk you through world-class setups from several leading companies, broken down by each stage of the funnel, so that you can draw inspiration from what has already been proven over the last decade.
This isn’t meant to be a teardown of each specific startup, but rather a holistic look into what leading companies are doing, their mindsets when it comes to growth and how to replicate these actions in your own startup.
Funnel stage I: Acquisition
Without question, the most advanced acquisition I personally encountered occurred while I was a leader of rider growth at Uber. As you can imagine, at that time we had swarms of product managers, data scientists and all the complementary growth roles you can think of helping us push our growth marketing team forward.
When building the correct approach for acquisition, these are the aspects that will elevate a world-class program above an average one:

Attribution setup
Mindset on metrics
Focus on large levers

In terms of our attribution, I must begin by qualifying that I have never seen an attribution framework that was 100% accurate, as it is essentially impossible to capture all acquisition data without leakage.
At Uber we did still spend a great deal of time working with our attribution partners, such as our mobile measurement partner, and were constantly locating areas of improvement. Before unloading on your acquisition budget, you should first ensure you are capturing all possible data from your paid channels. If you’re acquiring on the web, this means adding UTM parameters to all campaigns.
 

			Acquisition, activation and retention are critical. While referral and monetization are also quite important, they won’t make or break a startup.					


Conversely, if you’re acquiring on a mobile app, this means having a mobile measurement partner fully integrated into your app. I’ve written an entire column on how to set up a proper tech stack that I implore readers to visit if they are starting their own attribution efforts from scratch.
Mindset on acquisition is what separates marketers flashing vanity metrics such as CTR and CVR, while simultaneously losing sight on down-funnel conversion metrics. At Uber, we focused on advanced metrics such as predicted LTV (pLTV) and predicted first trips (pFT) of new riders that we were acquiring in real time. Using methodologies we developed in-house that analyzed various data points, including acquisition channel and geography, we were able to accurately predict the number of trips a new user would make 90 days out.
Whatever your north star metric is, you should always be looking far into the future to understand the value of your acquisition so that you can double down on those channels that bring the highest-value consumers.
Acquisition is ever-changing and the best-in-class marketers work hard to stay in touch with the latest creative trends, new ad formats to test, and those next golden pockets to sell to. When I was on the growth team at Coinbase, we spent a minimum of 10% of our budget testing the new ad formats that TikTok was releasing.
The point here is that you should focus on the largest paid acquisition levers as they come to fruition, with one such example being creative on paid social. I recommend the following sites that keep startup founders up-to-date on the latest growth and marketing trends — SocialMediaToday for paid social or Search Engine Land for paid search.

"TechCrunch+ roundup: AI + travel, fusion investor survey, why you’ll never get funding",Walter Thompson,2023/06/23,"
Most founders won’t realize that they’re on the wrong track until it’s too late.
That’s because failure is something many entrepreneurs can only perceive in hindsight: The day-to-day work of building a startup requires a high degree of confidence — and for some, denial.
Quoting the movie “Grosse Pointe Blank,” perhaps this column by Haje Jan Kamps will be “a swift, spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.”

In his experience, there are three reasons why some startups will never get a thumbs-up from an investor:

the market is too small;
the team is not good enough;
the plan doesn’t make sense.

These are all major problems, but here’s the good news: These are only existential issues for ego-driven founders. People who can accept they don’t have all the answers are able to pivot to success.
On the other hand, those who look in the mirror and see Captain America smiling back tend to make poor CEOs.

When it comes to integrating AI with travel, “even a small lead matters right now,” according to Eric Crowley and Adam Segall of global investment bank GP Bullhound.
Today’s consumers can create their own itineraries, but it still requires guesswork:
Can I walk to the beach from my hotel with a surfboard? Which restaurants near this conference center have vegan options?
In this TC+ post, Crowley and Segall share advice for founders working on AI-powered travel products: “At this early stage, our firm and other investors in the space we work with don’t have an expectation of perfection.”

According to a report from global venture firm Accel, a “flywheel of inter-generational talent spawning from unicorns” is helping Europe and Israel maintain momentum even as deal flow and funding have slowed globally.
“Our data reveals that 221 of the region’s 353 VC-backed unicorns have fueled 1,171 new tech-enabled startups through their alumni,” writes Harry Nelis, a partner with the London-based company.

Follow-on investment may be harder to obtain, but Alex Wilhelm reports that “the combination of seller pessimism and modest buyer optimism” is driving an “uptick in secondary market activity.”
Interpreting data from Caplight, Forge, Other Information and PitchBook, he concluded that the increase may signal a potential rise in startup valuations.
“It’s becoming clearer how much pain startups will need to endure to raise more capital, but it’s anybody’s guess if they’re willing to accept that fact.”

Black founders based in the United Kingdom have an even harder time than their U.S.-based counterparts when it comes to accessing venture capital, reports Dominic-Madori Davis.
“Between 2009 and 2019 in the U.K., just 30 Black people received VC funding, equating to less than 0.4% of all funds allocated to founders.”
She interviewed multiple investors who are working to expand this community, including Karl Lokko, co-founder of venture firm Black Seed, which recently announced its £5 million inaugural fund.
“The wheels are starting to turn, but we’ve got a long road ahead,” he said.

Byju’s key investors confirm board exits,Manish Singh,2023/06/23,"
Prosus, Peak XV Partners and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative confirmed Friday that their representatives have resigned from the board of Byju’s, India’s most valuable startup that is also reeling from the departure of its auditor Deloitte this week.
The board members’ resignations — which Byju’s vehemently denied on Thursday — came shortly after global auditing giant Deloitte told the startup’s board that it was resigning from its role. Deloitte, which was slated to work with Byju’s until 2025, said that the edtech giant had failed to hand over financial results for the year ended March 2022.
A spokesperson for Peak XV Partners confirmed the departure of GV Ravishankar, a partner at the firm, from Byju’s board and said the investing giant, formerly known as Sequoia India, was “committed to supporting the company for bringing on board an independent director in order to strengthen business processes and internal control mechanisms.”
In a statement, a Prosus spokesperson said:
Prosus confirms that Russell Dreisenstock, the representing Board Director from MIH Edtech Investments, B.V. (a Prosus entity) on the board of Think & Learn Private Limited, resigned from his position. The Company is required to file the resignation letter with the MCA in India within the required time period.
In a statement, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative confirmed that Vivian Wu has quit Byju’s board. The resignations halve the board’s size to just three individuals: Byju’s co-founders — Byju Raveendran and Divya Gokulnath — and Raveendran’s brother Riju.
In a statement, a Byju’s spokesperson said the company’s management is engaging with investors to reconstitute the board and said departing members left because their shareholding had fallen.
“The need for reconstitution arose as few investors had to vacate the board seat due to their shareholding falling below a minimum required threshold as per our SHA. We want to reassure all stakeholders that we are actively working towards constituting a diverse and world-class board commensurate with the company’s size and scale.”
Trouble is mounting at Byju’s, which is also the most valuable edtech globally. India’s corporate affairs ministry ordered an investigation into Byju’s last week after the ministry took cognizance of “various corporate governance lapses” at the startup, television channel CNBC-TV18 reported earlier Friday — another reporting that Byju’s denied.
Deloitte said Thursday that it was resigning because it had not received “any communication” from Byju’s on the status of “audit readiness of the financial statements and the underlying books and records for the year ended March 31 2022.”
It was a déjà vu moment for the auditor. Byju’s attracted intense scrutiny last year from the government, investors and creditors after it repeatedly failed to publish its accounts. In September, Byju’s finally published its accounts for the year ending March 2021, revealing revenue figures that fell short of its own projections.

This week on The TechCrunch Podcast, I’m stepping in for the podcast’s usual host Darrell, and taking a closer look at what’s happening at Reddit. The popular social media company seems to be hell-bent on alienating as much of its user base as possible after introducing a policy that significantly increases the price of access to its API.

"While everyone keeps talking about AI, HR tech startups are quietly building toward a $24B market",Anna Heim,2023/06/23,"
While venture capitalists, startup founders and major tech companies compete to see who can say “AI” the most in a week, people are busy building other, more useful stuff.
And one particular group has caught our eye: companies that build software for human resource management.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

TechCrunch+ noted in March that there’s a burgeoning group of HR tech unicorns in the United States that are ripe to go public when that window opens. But our initial scope proved limited, because HR tech is hot in Europe right now as well and it’s worth paying attention to.
It makes sense that HR tech has managed to grow rapidly and still fly under the radar — it’s not going to be hyped as the economic model of the future and neither will it be criticized for having the capability to potentially end civilization.
Still, HR tech companies often find themselves moving hundreds of millions of dollars — if not billions — through their channels and have therefore become large and lucrative.
Today we’re digesting notes from a recent GP Bullhound report on European HR tech to expand our general comprehension of the sector in anticipation of an environment in which IPOs are again a reality.
Morphing into unicorns, one paycheck at a time
Strikingly, GP Bullhound reports there is just as much bullish sentiment around HR tech as around AI and climate tech. “We look for these sectors to produce the next tech giants, with maintained if not increased bull-market funding levels and exponential growth in the number of companies,” the report said. "
EvaluAgent raises $20M to build out software that evaluates call center agents,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/23,"
After spending more than a decade in the customer experience industry, three friends, Jaime Scott, Michelle Dinsmore and Alex Richards, decided to launch their own company, EvaluAgent, to develop quality assurance testing software for contact centers.
The three co-founders say they were motivated by a shared desire to find a solution to the problem of contact center manager overwork. Reviewing customer calls and texts for quality assurance calls takes time — so much time, in fact, that it’s rarely done regularly. According to one source, only between 1% and 2% of calls to a contact center actually get evaluated.
“At its heart, the contact center’s role is to serve customers,” Scott, who serves as the company’s CEO, told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Those customers are human beings and, as such, are always going to demand a level of service and experience technology alone won’t be able to offer. Our belief is that the greater the employee experience for agents, the greater the customer experience they’ll be able to offer.”
Scott, Dinsmore and Richards incorporated EvaluAgent in 2012. The team grew quickly, but was largely focused on working with a small number of corporate clients. That changed in 2018 and 2019, when Scott says the leadership recognized a gap in the market for a more flexible software-as-a-service-based quality assurance testing solution.
Today, EvaluAgent’s platform aims to help quality assurance staff analyze conversations — both text and voice — across channels to coach and train customer agents. Via mostly automated workflows, EvaluAgent tries to boost the efficiency of QA teams, showing quality assurance-related stats in a unified dashboard.
Managers can give employee feedback via EvaluAgent’s dedicated tool while employees can find answers to common questions in EvaluAgent’s built-in company knowledge base.
“EvaluAgent not only delivers quality assurance, but also provides customers with tools to ensure that evaluators’ findings convert to ongoing behavior change in the agent base,” Scott said. “Altogether, the platform represents a complete system of record for contact centers’ quality teams.”
EvaluAgent also offers an automated scoring system, driven by a combination of speech recognition technologies and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The system, SmartScore, transcribes conversations if necessary and uses ChatGPT — an AI chatbot that understands text — to summarize them for insights, rating line items and providing coaching tips. 
“Out-of-the-box key moments, such as customer frustration, repeat contact, and complaint escalation, are automatically tagged,” Scott explained. “It … empowers organizations to achieve more interaction coverage and streamline the quality assurance process while keeping quality teams in full control.”
Image Credits: EvaluAgent
One wonders about bias creeping into the algorithms used to evaluate agents’ actions, though. After all, studies have shown that AI is more likely to classify Black speech as “toxic” or “offensive.” And it’s well-understood that voice recognition tech, too, is racially and ethnically biased. So can SmartScore be trusted?
Scott didn’t elaborate on which measures, if any, EvaluAgent takes to combat bias in its algorithms. But he stressed that they aren’t intended to replace human quality assurance evaluators.
“EvaluAgent has made investments in its technical resources to incorporate the best AI models available for its use cases,” he said. “We are model-agnostic, which we believe is a significant advantage in the modern rapidly-evolving AI landscape. Additional AI-fueled innovation and automation, which incorporate the latest AI models but allow quality assurance teams to remain at the center of key workflows, will follow on the back of this financing.”
The lack of transparency hasn’t gotten in the way of the company’s success, it seems. EvaluAgent claims it’s seen revenue grow nearly fivefold over the last three years, with customers ranging from Fortune 500 enterprises to mid-market business process outsourcers and tech companies.
The momentum captured the attention of major investors, which poured cash into EvaluAgent’s Series A. Announced today, the Series A, led by PeakSpan, closed at $20 million, bringing EvaluAgent’s total raised to $21 million.
PeakSpan’s Phil Dur, the lead partner on the deal, says that he saw “tremendous opportunity” in what he described as the “quality arena.” That’s despite stiff competition in the over-$35.3-billion space, apparently — startups including Invoca offer features similar to — but not exactly the same as — EvaluAgent’s.
“Having spent years studying the category, we believe EvaluAgent is the strongest vendor of quality assurance and performance improvement software,” Dur said via email. “The platform shines for small and mid-market contact centers, while maintaining the capacity to serve enterprise-level businesses with large contact center operations.”
Scott says that the Series A funding will be put toward enriching its products, expanding its remote team and supporting customers in “new and existing geographies.”
“Roughly 25% of the contact center market still runs their QA programs on spreadsheets, while another portion makes the best of in-house legacy tools,” he said. “Contact centers are facing a new dynamic — balance leaner staff and fewer onsite agents with an increasingly demanding customer (call volumes, hold times and escalations have been steadily rising) all while optimizing cost to navigate a potentially choppy macroenvironment.”

"Dropbox hearts AI, the creator-platform wars and why we’re bullish on fake booze",Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/23,"

Hello, and welcome back to Equity, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.
Mary Ann and Alex are back, and once again they tapped the TechCrunch roster for expert input. This week, we’re lucky enough to have Kirsten Korosec back on the podcast. She’s TechCrunch’s mobility lead, hosts a podcast of her own and is one of our favorite humans.

All the cool kids are filling out the Equity listener survey. We want to hear from you! 

The summer slowdown is far from happening yet, so we had a whole raft of stuff to chew through. It was a good thing that we had six hands on deck! Here’s the rundown:

Deals of the Week: Mary Ann wanted to talk about Robinhood buying X1, a deal that seemed inexpensive but we lack enough numbers for full confidence; Alex wanted to riff on Dropbox’s new AI fund, even if it does feel a little small; and Kirsten had notes for the team on Cruise’s latest app rollout. Even if Mary Ann and Alex cannot find a way to agree on self-driving cars, we all thought that the Cruise bus is cute.
Twitch and Reddit try to balance corporate requirements with community power: Building off our recent show digging into the creator economy, the crew tackled the latest from Twitch (a new creator-corporate revenue split of sorts) and Reddit (where the battle between the company and its power-users continues to blaze). It’s feeling more hot war than cold war lately on the internet, with platforms struggling to find a way to keep revenue growth coming while not estranging the folks who make their services tick.
The power of Not Boozing: How big is the market for non-alcoholic drinks? Smaller than the market for vodka, certainly, but we’re curious. Also there’s a new app in the market that is helping folks find non-booze bevies, which we dig.

A big thanks to Kirsten for swinging by, and we’ll chat with you Monday morning!

Forcite seeks the smart helmet success that Skully squandered,Tim Stevens,2023/06/23,"
Whither, Skully? The Indiegogo darling of a smart helmet company made all sorts of promises in 2014 and even shipped a few lids to early backers before getting lost on the way to market and disappearing into a cloud of misplaced hype and undelivered promises.
Nearly a decade later, another company called Forcite is back making many of the same promises: a smart helmet that is more digital companion than safety device, which can deliver integrated navigation with visual and auditory prompts.
Forcite, though, is skipping the ugly crowdfunding bit and is instead working directly with distributors. The company has already shipped thousands of MK1S smart helmets and, yes, its technology actually works.
But that’s just the beginning of a journey for this Australian startup working to create a platform that will, it hopes, become an integral part of motorcycle safety.
Inspired by a crash
Forcite co-founders Alfred Boyadgis and Julian Chow. Image Credits: Forcite
Forcite was founded a decade ago, initially dabbling in various wearable technologies like in-helmet cameras for American football players. The move toward smart helmets started in 2019, according to CEO and co-founder Alfred Boyadgis.
“I had a motorcycle accident and wanted to create a technology that wasn’t just about passive safety or impact, something that could predict what was ahead on the road, thus changing the decision,” Boyadgis said in a recent interview.
He was also inspired by the GoPro craze. “Everyone started to use these action cameras on the front of their helmet, com-sets on the side of their helmet,” Boyadgis said. “These things increase the rotational velocity of the helmet.”
In a crash, more rotational velocity on a helmet can mean greater forces transferred to the brain within. Keep everything within the shell of the helmet, and that force is reduced.
Forcite’s in-house team started iterating on design ideas but soon turned to the wisdom of the crowd.
“We put together a group of 8,000 riders, an online test pilot club — it was on a Facebook page,” Boyadgis said. “We got those riders together and started talking about the technology which they use. So, you know, how they use the dash cameras, the things they don’t like about how they use com-sets, how they use audio. And then this new layout, which was, like, how do they receive information in an effective way?”
Motorcycling requires far more concentration than driving a car. A moment’s distraction can be fatal, and so the helmet’s UI had to be minimal.
The Forcite team ultimately nixed early ideas of including an augmented reality display of the sort found in the Skully AR-1.
Nuts and bolts
Image Credits: Forcite
At its simplest, the MK1S is a helmet with an integrated Bluetooth audio connection, including speakers positioned over the ears. This means that riders can take calls, listen to music or get navigation instructions provided to the helmet wirelessly from the phone.
Many manufacturers now sell helmets with integrated Bluetooth functionality. What’s novel in the MK1S is a row of RGB LEDs inside the helmet above the chin bar. These glow upward, providing simple visual cues to the rider, all driven by the smartphone app. A green sweep from left to right means to make a right turn, for example. An inward sweep of orange means an accident ahead. A quick blink of red means the camera is activated.
That 1080p camera is built into the chin and can be used to automatically record incidents. It can also be manually toggled for highlights, which are stored on a microSD card. A separate, wireless controller mounts to the handlebars of the bike and allows the rider to toggle the camera, phone and navigation with a thumb press. For now, that’s the only way to give the helmet commands while on the bike.
While the electronics are within the shell of the helmet, including a rechargeable, ceramic battery, they do not compromise the crucial foam that actually protects the rider’s head. This design not only ensures the maximum possible safety and performance in various international helmet certifications, but it also allows an element of reuse. Should a helmet be damaged in a crash or otherwise, the electronics can be ported over to a replacement.
This could reduce costs for some in the long-term. The upfront cost, however, is significant.
A new Forcite MK1S costs $1,099 in the United States. That compares to about $600 to $800 for a top-shelf helmet made by leading manufacturers like Shoei and Arai — manufacturers that Boyadgis and co tried to partner with.
“So, we actually went around to a lot of manufacturers asking them if they wanted to build one, and all of them were, like, ‘No, we’re very happy with the margins that we make on motorcycle helmets,'” he said.
Predictive aspirations
Most of the MK1S’s functionality is driven by the Forcite app, which for now draws its data from Here Technologies. Developers are reworking the app to use Mapbox (said to offer “a smoother, more polished experience” according to a Forcite rep). The Forcite app provides navigation and gives warnings of debris, crashes and even police, which are communicated to the rider via voice prompts and that strip of LEDs.
Interestingly, those in-helmet alerts work even if the rider isn’t actively navigating.
“It can endeavor to provide you with something that’s coming up on a realistic route ahead, not something that’s on a parallel road or on a road that’s disjunct from your current graph network,” Tom Larcher, Forcite’s senior development manager, said.
That’s just the beginning, according to Larcher. “Predicting a corner that is particularly hazardous is a great one,” he said, indicating that the app will soon look at factors like road conditions, historic incidents and even the motorcycle’s current speed, then warn riders if a given stretch of road is dangerous.
“Predictive AI will be used for that aspect of things,” Larcher said, successfully delivering the hottest buzzword of the moment during our interview.
The ultimate integration
Image Credits: Forcite
The long-term goal is to integrate not just the helmet and smartphone, but also the bike itself. Right now, most motorcycles are raw, simple machines compared to the rolling data factory of a modern car — software-defined vehicles with Ethernet backbones collecting hundreds of data points in real time.
Motorcycles, per Boyadgis, will get there soon.
“There’s definitely more sensors going on to bikes,” he said. “Advanced awareness systems will definitely become a common thing across the entire industry. We want to be that standardized interface.”
Forcite is working to define a new protocol for this kind of connectivity, something more reliable than the typical Bluetooth interfaces used for wireless accessories. Standards, though, are only as useful as those who support them.
For now, Forcite reps declined to identify which manufacturers are onboard for this idea, saying only that they’ve partnered with two brands for “deeper integration.”
Forcite has announced a partnership with Harley-Davidson Australia to “develop a next generation smart helmet and sensing system to preempt and identify hazards, such as debris and other road users and alert riders so they can take evasive action.”
In the world of motorcycling, it doesn’t get much more significant than H-D.
CEO Boyadgis says we won’t see this technology on motorcycles until 2026 at the earliest and hopes to integrate the necessary protocols into Forcite’s helmets as soon as next year.
“What we’re trying to do is work out a way where we get permission from a few manufacturers, both Japanese and Italian, to be able to pair with their bikes without something that they’re selling,” he said.
Next-gen bells and whistles
Other forthcoming advances will be more focused on lifestyle, including an in-helmet voice assistant capable of handling commands like, “Hey, Forcite: contact the first four people I know who ride a Ducati in my area, and then make a route that utilizes that style bike so we all meet up at a Mexican restaurant in time for lunch.”
Boyadgis wants to deploy this “collaborative ride experience” within the next two years, where the helmet becomes a real partner on the bike.
Forcite’s physical offerings will also evolve, including new models optimized for different types of riding, like a retro-styled helmet for cruisers, a flip-up model for the touring crowd and a visored adventure-style helmet.
Markets and money
To get there, the company will need to raise funds. Forcite closed AU$6.6 million in funding in December to drive the expansion into U.S. distribution. The company is now moving into a Series B capital round to raise capital that will fund those future helmet designs as well as the necessary research and development for all those app advancements.
Forcite is focused particularly on the U.S. market and plans to ship more than 10,000 units next year. The brand has already shipped 5,000, roughly 3,000 going to the company’s home Australian market.
But, Boyadgis says, the potential is to go much higher: “Let’s take a brand like an Arai or a Shoei across the United States; they’re selling in excess of, like, 50,000 units. So, that’s where we want to get to.”
The question, though, is whether Forcite’s more high-tech, high-price lids will speak to the same audience as the simple, comfortable, relatively affordable helmets from familiar, respected brands.
Motorcycling is, for many, a rejection of the complexity and claustrophobia of motoring.
Even Boyadgis has simplified his own daily Forcite experience, using it as a dashcam but not using it for navigation. “I do have it connected in the background, but I only have, like, police and speed camera alert — not that I speed or anything. But, they are pretty useful things if I’m going around a bend or something and I need to slow down. So, it really depends on, like, how much you want to use it, right?”
Whether Forcite can challenge the established brands or convince traditional motorcyclists to spend more money remains to be seen. However, there are early indications that Forcite is on the right track. The excitement around the failed Skully AR-1 product showed there’s an appetite for a smarter helmet. And the hunger still appears to be intact; Forcite’s shipments have already outpaced Skully’s.

"Singapore’s ride-hailing firm Grab lays off over 1,100 employees ",Kate Park,2023/06/23,"
On-demand startups in Asia raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors over the last several years to scale and compete heavily in ridesharing, alternative transport, delivery and a supersized range of related and unrelated services. Now comes the reckoning. 
This week, Southeast Asian supper app ride-hailing and food delivery app operator Grab laid off more than a thousand people, or about 11% of its staff, its first big layoffs since 2020.
Grab — which offers services in Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and Myanmar — said it will make severance payments of half a month for every six months of completed service. It also will provide medical insurance coverage through to the end of 2023, as well as career transition consultations, among other measures, for those impacted.
The cuts come about a month after Grab — which trades on the Nasdaq exchange in the U.S. — reported quarterly results that indicated slowing user growth and user spend amid an ongoing net loss, as well as the departure of its co-founder from the business. 
In a memo to staff, CEO and co-founder Anthony Tan downplayed the move as a cost-cutting measure merely aimed at profitability; instead he framed the move as right-sizing in reaction to changes in technology, the state of the capital markets and competition.
“We must adapt to the environment in which we operate,” he wrote in the letter, published online. “Change has never been this fast. Technology such as Generative AI is evolving at breakneck speed. The cost of capital has gone up, directly impacting the competitive landscape.” The group has publicly committed to being “Group Adjusted EBITDA breakeven” by the end of this financial year.
But it’s been aiming for that goal without major cuts to its expenses. Unlike its big competitors in the region Sea and GoTo (the parent company of GoJek), Grab held off from making layoffs in the last year. Last September, its chief operating officer Alex Hungate told Reuters that Grab doubled down on that commitment, despite weakening market conditions. 
Prior to this week’s news, the last time Grab laid off workers was in 2020: It cut 360 jobs during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, when business for all ride-hailing companies globally fell off a cliff. At the time, those cuts worked out to less than 5% of its staff.
By comparison, GoTo laid off 600 employees in March of this year to improve its profitability after cutting 1,300 jobs, or 12% of its workforce, seven months prior to that to preserve cash. 
Although Tan didn’t want to point to profitability as a main goal, the cuts might be seen as a response to some of the lackluster metrics in its last earnings, which have manifested elsewhere: The company has been getting hammered in the markets.
When Grab went public in December 2021 by way of a SPAC, it did so having raised more than $10 billion in outside funding as a startup — with investors including SoftBank’s Vision Fund when its spending exuberance was at its peak, as well as strategic backers like Hyundai — and a valuation of $40 billion. Today, however, the company’s market cap is between $12 and $13 billion.
Another challenge has been heavy, ongoing price competition with rivals, which plays out not just as promotions for consumers, but incentives for drivers, too.
And a third challenge might well be the size of the business. Grab has amassed a large grab-bag of services over the years in its quest to build a “super app” providing any and all services to its consumers. Most recently, the Singapore on-demand firm acquired the Philippine-based motorcycle taxi platform Move It in 2022, a Malaysian supermarket chain Jaya Grocer and Indonesian digital payment platform OVO in 2021.
Grab has not ruled out what else it might do to “adapt” to today’s market, including divestments, sunsetting services or indeed further layoffs.
“The primary goal of this exercise is to strategically reorganize ourselves so that we can move faster, work smarter and rebalance our resources across our portfolio in line with our longer-term strategies,” Tan said.

Joyful Ventures debuts with $23M focused on investment in sustainable protein startups,Christine Hall,2023/06/27,"
The alternative protein sector has seen a lot of movement in the past week, including U.S. regulators approving both Upside Foods and Good Meat to sell their cultivated chicken products for the first time in the country.
Poised to help thriving startups in this sector is a new venture capital fund called Joyful Ventures, which just closed $23 million of its $25 million fund. Advisors and investors include Björn Öste, co-founder of Oatly; Dr. Sandhya Sriram, CEO of Shiok Meats; Ryan Bethencourt, co-founder of Indie Bio and CEO of Wild Earth; and Arturo Elizondo, CEO of EVERY.
The woman and LGBTQIA+-led fund is co-founded by Jennifer Stojkovic, founder of the Vegan Women Summit; Milo Runkle, co-founder of The Good Food Institute; and Blaine Vess, co-founder of edtech startup Student Brands. All are general partners of Los Angeles–based Joyful Ventures.
To learn more about the fund and how the trio plan to drive climate solutions, we spoke with Stojkovic, who told TechCrunch that the fund will invest at the pre-seed and seed stages into startups that have strong B2B opportunities and are innovating technologies, including plant-based, precision fermentation, mycoproteins, molecular agriculture and cultivated technologies.
The company has already made two investments from the fund, including New School Foods, which raised $12 million earlier this year to make plant-based salmon, and Orbillion Bio, a company making cultivated Wagyu beef and other products.
The following conversation was lightly edited for length and clarity.
TC: What inspired the three of you to start Joyful Ventures?
JS: There is still a lack of awareness when it comes to the impact of food. We’re going to build the next big era of great startups, in my opinion, by unlocking the investment potential. There’s billions and billions of dollars of VC dry powder out there. I read about 50% is earmarked for climate, and some VCs are very interested in climate, but most of the ones I speak to don’t know the connection.
Why focus specifically on sustainable proteins?
When we say sustainable protein, we’re really talking about the broader food ecosystem and how it relates to it. We’re looking at everything from how to reduce the water footprint or improve the texturing of the plant protein crop, all the way to the end product on the grocery shelf. The protein aspects are where the driver of emissions is, but the type of widespread change that’s going to need to happen in the system to support transitioning toward, it’s myriad.
We need to be thinking holistically: What are the different mechanisms and levers that need to be pulled to actually transform the system? It’s not as simple as making a product and they’ll show up. How do we get the cost down? That’s going to be investing in the larger agriculture system.
What was the fundraising environment like? How long did it take you to raise the fund?
Terrible! It is June and we started our close in November. That gives you an idea of how long it took to get the first bit of investments in. It’s been tough. We are feeling incredibly elated to be able to even have a double-digit fund like this. That is such a rarity these days. And then of course, there has been back-and-forth about the future of the (alternative protein) space.
The Cargills of the world and the bigger entities, the ones with hundreds of years of scale on how we produce food on the planet, are coming to the table now and saying, “No, this wasn’t just a blip during the pandemic.” Those are the types of folks that we’re talking to, and that is the type of viewpoint that we have. This is a long game. If you’re looking to make a quick buck, food is not it, but if you are looking to make enduring sustainable change that could quite literally save the planet, we’re your team.

VCs remain confident alternative protein has a real future despite public-market woes

What were some of the concerns your LPs had?
Inflation has been a big part of it. There’s very real challenges at the grocery store. There’s going to be an unfortunate reality where brands are not going to be able to sell at the price point that consumers are able to pay right now. If you’re a widespread protein manufacturer, you have a massive portfolio and can play with the numbers. But if you’re a newer startup, you don’t have that kind of ability to change your exposure.
With Upside Foods and Good Meat moving kind of to the next stage, do you feel like this is continuing to move in the right direction?
Absolutely. This is huge. We’ve got the products being sold in Singapore for the last two years. Now we’ve got the United States, which is arguably the biggest, depending on which metric to use, meat market in the world, ready to serve to consumers potentially by the end of 2023. You need a market like America to shake things up. You’re going to see a lot more countries coming as soon as America does that. Things could start snowballing pretty quickly.
What are you looking for in an investment?
We’re investing in founders that are in it for the long haul. We’re not investing in founders that just heard that the alternative protein was a hot space to be in. We look for people that understand what it takes to disrupt a 100-year-old system, and for companies that are not only making food ingredients that can eliminate animals, but, for example, also can serve high-end cosmetic companies. I believe that for this industry, one of the most important things that we do is build companies that have multiple revenue streams. The margins you can make on a high-end cosmetic could be 90%, which allows for you to build in the pricing for the food commodity that you also need to serve.
Why should founders pick you as their investment partner?
We are geographically agnostic and looking at companies all over the world. We are also very conscious to avoid the hype. We have looked at hundreds of deals since we closed the round, and we are extremely thorough with our process and what types of opportunities we’re looking at.
In addition, Blaine is a two-time exited founder who built his own company from the ground up as CEO, so we have the chops to really understand who are the founders that take it to the finish line.

Unshackled Ventures secures another $35M to invest in immigrant founders,Christine Hall,2023/06/27,"
Despite a challenging fundraising environment, venture funds able to prove their thesis are continuing to see interest from limited partners.
Unshackled Ventures is the latest venture capital firm to close on a new fund, its third, with $35 million in capital commitments toward pre-seed investments in immigrant founders. It’s been a while since TechCrunch profiled the firm, founded by Manan Mehta and Nitin Pachisia, and boy has the firm been busy. In addition to deploying over $35 million into 80 companies, Unshackled Ventures has provided over 200 founders with visa sponsorship, immigration support and resources.
When talking about the fundraising environment today versus 2019 when the second fund was announced, Pachisia said it took 18 months to secure capital for the third fund compared to around six months for each of the previous funds. He noted that the environment shifted about halfway after he and Mehta began speaking with LPs “but that it brought us closer to the right kind of LPs that we aligned with.”
Indeed, Fund III more than doubles the firm’s assets under management, Mehta and Pachisia told TechCrunch, and garnered 73% of its funding from institutional investors, including Cambridge Associates, Cendana, Emerson Collective, California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank and Sorenson Impact Advisory.
“A lot of Fund III represents what Fund I was founded for, which are the problems that we faced nine years ago,” Mehta said. “If we provide immigrants with friends-and-family capital support, we believe that we can preserve the American promise and honestly as a venture capital firm, invest in a talent pool that otherwise was overlooked. Immigrants are some of the greatest job creators, and in this country, that’s why we keep on believing as a national advantage, this population is in the American best interest.”

Unshackled Ventures has $20M to invest exclusively in immigrant founders

In 2023, 781,000 foreign workers registered for 85,000 H-1B visa lottery slots, more than double the registrations for the previous year. Unshackled Ventures wants to be able to help more immigrants in this situation, and along with the fund, will begin a program called Eighteen150, a founder-in-residence program, on July 18 to support more immigrant entrepreneurs regardless of their immigration status.
Though Mehta and Pachisia didn’t want to disclose much more on the program just yet, they did say the firm is dedicating $5 million out of Fund III for the program to provide complete immigration and employment support, offering founders $150,000 or 18 months of runway, for 10% ownership.
Meanwhile, Unshackled Ventures has already made 18 investments with Fund III, including Masa Finance, a web3 identify infrastructure layer; Cache Energy, a long-duration energy storage company; and Formally, a generative AI legal tech company.
“The core of it all is backing people when they are ready to jump into their entrepreneurial journeys,” Pachisia said. “One of the trends that we might be bucking a little bit in VC is, as funds get larger, usually investors move later-stage and want to write bigger checks. We’re moving earlier to realize our true advantage lies in that earliest phase of joining the founder when they’re ready to go.”

Y Combinator-backed 0pass seeks to replace passwords in the enterprise,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/27,"
Several years ago, Noah Stanford teamed up with Michael Melone to found 0pass, a startup that aims to make it easier for companies to replace usernames and passwords with biometrics, like Touch ID and Face ID.
Relatively quickly, 0pass gained the attention of investors, including Y Combinator, recently closing a $3.5 million seed round led by Brett Gibson at Initialized Capital with participation from Y Combinator, Box Group, 645 Ventures and angel investors.
Prior to starting 0pass, Stanford joined SpaceX as a security engineer, leading the identity and authentication team. After helping to roll out authentication across SpaceX, he sought to commercialize the tooling he’d built at his previous employer.
“The primary difference between 0pass and other passwordless solutions is that 0pass is able to address passwordless login for all systems under one umbrella rather than just a subset,” Stanford explained. “This means that 0pass is able to handle passwordless login for Windows, Linux, Mac, remote access and websites — fully within the cloud or completely air-gapped.”
0pass’ products, which are available in on-premise and fully managed flavors, enable companies to enroll their employees into hardware authentication devices and biometric authentication such as Windows Hello and Touch ID. The company’s tooling, which uses private keys stored in secure hardware modules, enforces biometrics for access to workstations, apps and web apps and servers — allowing admins to manage authentication methods and tie user identity to security keys.

“0pass can integrate with private infrastructure, operating systems, identity providers and any user directories or certificate authorities,” Stanford explained. “Keys are tied to certificates to connect employee identity for authorization.”
0pass competes with a growing number of startups in the passwordless authentication market, which Statista projects will be worth $53.6 billion in 2030. Descope, a “developer-first” authentication and user management platform, recently emerged from stealth with $53 million in funding. There’s also Stytch, an API-first passwordless startup, and Magic, which offers “plug and play,” enterprise-oriented passwordless tech.
Fortunately for 0pass, demand remains strong for passwordless technologies. In a recent survey by Axiad, 82% of respondents — developers and IT and cybersecurity professionals — say that moving to passwordless authentication is in their top five priorities. One motivation? The potential cost savings. According to one source, organizations can save millions by switching to passwordless authentication — thanks to fewer data breaches and password resets, to name a few possible plusses.
As of May 2020, 150 million people were using passwordless logins each month, per a Microsoft report.
“Senior leadership is having to rethink how to secure accounts as traditional methods are repeatedly compromised,” Stanford said. “Taking a completely different approach and changing how every individual at the company logs in is a C-suite directive. Instead of adding more steps and complexity to employee logins, passwordless represents a new paradigm and addresses one of the largest security risks an organization faces.”
0pass moved out of private beta recently, and plans to onboard its first batch of enterprise customers in the coming weeks. Stanford says the company, which has four employees (possibly eight by the end of the year), has at least “several years” of runway, and will spend the proceeds from the round on product development and customer acquisition.

Data security startup Cyera lands a $100M investment,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/27,"
A trend accelerated by the mass move to digital during the pandemic, enterprises are having to handle an increasing amount of proprietary data. According to one survey, the average company deals with 63% growth in data volume per month, with 12% of respondents reporting a whopping 100% growth.
As the amount of data grows, it becomes tougher for organizations to keep track of it — and ensure that it remains secure. Seeking to protect it, Yotam Segev and Tamar Bar-Ilan, who met several years ago in the Israel Defense Forces, co-founded Cyera, a platform intended to provide companies greater visibility over their sensitive data.
Demonstrating the enthusiasm around such solutions, Cyera today closed a $100 million Series B funding round led by Accel, with participation from Sequoia, Cyberstarts and Redpoint Ventures. The round brings Cyera’s total raised to $160 million, which Segev, who serves as Cyera’s CEO, says will be put toward investing in engineering talent and R&D.
The funding is all the more impressive in the context of the broader cybersecurity landscape, which — once bright — has been dimming slightly, at least in terms of the VC investments floating around. Funding for cybersecurity startups dropped 58% in Q1 2023 compared to Q1 2022, with deal flow dipping to 149 deals — the lowest in years and down 45% year-over-year, according to CrunchBase.
“The move to distributed work and software-as-a-service (SaaS) collaboration platforms during the pandemic has accelerated the need for effective data security, and highlighted the shortcomings of legacy solutions to keep pace with data creation, sprawl and evolution in the cloud era,” Segev told TechCrunch in an email interview. “By providing that deep context and understanding of the data a company manages, and providing detailed insight and remediations for security, privacy and compliance exposures, Cyera is revolutionizing data security.”
Cyera falls into the category of platforms known as data security posture management (DSPM), which attempt to abstract away and automate common data detection and protection practices — particularly in the cloud. The past several years have seen a fair number of DSPM startups emerge from stealth, like Laminar Security, Dig Security, Sentra, BigID and Varonis.
The rise has coincided not only with the growth in data under enterprise management, but with the climbing adoption of the cloud and cloud technologies. According to a recent O’Reilly poll, 90% of organizations reported using cloud computing in 2021 — an increase from 88% in 2020. Gartner predicts, meanwhile, that by 2027, more than 50% of enterprises will adopt industry cloud platforms — platforms with features and services tailored to industries such as healthcare, logistics and retail — to accelerate their business initiatives.

So what makes Cyera stand apart from the sea of DSPM vendors out there? Segev asserts that the platform has a wider — and more holistic — focus than most.
“DSPM startups … have limited capabilities,” Segev said. “Legacy vendors attempting to ‘bolt on’ DSPM capability are architecturally flawed and can’t scale the way Cyera does. Cyera has differentiated itself from the slew of DSPM vendors in the space by focusing on an AI-powered data security platform to protect all of a company’s data, everywhere.”
To that end, Cyera leverages an OpenAI large language model (via OpenAI’s API) to deliver context around the data that a company manages. (In recent weeks, Microsoft and Google have similarly launched products that tap language models to help contextualize security issues.) The model can discover, classify and identify different types of data, providing an understanding of what a company’s data represents (e.g. the role is serves and the region where it’s from).
At a higher level, Cyera spotlights exposures, posture issues and risks associated with overly permissive access to data.
A recent addition to the suite, Cyera offers a browser extension that anonymizes sensitive data typed into OpenAI’s AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT — timely in light of company bans of ChatGPT over privacy concerns. SafeType attempts to automatically detect sensitive data in prompts, stopping it (at least in theory) from being sent to ChatGPT.
“We provide complete cloud data security coverage across software-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service and infrastructure-as-a-service environments, with on-prem support coming in 2024,” Segev added. “The result is cloud data security that enables businesses to be more agile and innovative while mitigating risk to reputation, customer loyalty and compliance stemming from data theft.”
Impressively, despite its relatively small (100-person) team, Cyera claims that it’s managed to gain “strong traction” among the S&P 500 in the two years since it launched. Cyera secured “double digit” new customers in Q4 2022 alone and an astounding 800% in revenue growth in 2022.
By the end of the year, Segev expects that the staff will grow to 150 people.
“Cyera’s agentless technology and novel technical innovations to streamline and accelerate data store inventory creation and data classification ensure that businesses will have the confidence that they always know what data they have, where it is located and what it represents,” Segev said. “Because Cyera’s process is automatic and continuous, security teams are empowered with up-to-date context and understanding of sensitive data exposure, as well as insight into how to best partner with the business to address and remediate risk.”

Socure acquires identity verification startup Berbix for $70M,Frederic Lardinois,2023/06/27,"
Socure, the identity verification service that raised a massive $450 million Series E round at a $4.5 billion valuation during the heady fundraising days of late 2021 (and $100 million earlier in 2021), today announced that it has acquired identity verification service Berbix for $70 million in cash and stock transactions. Berbix previously raised a total of $11.6 million, including a $9 million Series A round led by Mayfield in 2020.
This marks Socure’s first acquisition.
Founded in 2018, Berbix focuses on verifying users’ identities by checking scanned IDs in real time. Using its patent-pending forensics engine, Berbix can help businesses detect fake IDs to reduce fraud and ensure compliance with local regulations.
Socure’s platform, meanwhile, takes a slightly broader and multi-dimensional approach that includes both active and passive means to deter fraud in a wide range of sectors, ranging from e-commerce to healthcare.
“From a product perspective, Socure is moving with a high velocity into new markets and new geographies, covering e-commerce marketplaces, gig economy, public sector and healthcare, among others,” Socure founder and CEO Johnny Ayers said. “We are finding repeatedly that there is a need for best-in-class active and passive — documentary and non-documentary — identity verification and fraud controls to solve very complex fraud and customer acquisition challenges.”
He noted that Socure’s customers are asking for the ability to check IDs online that, combined with the company’s existing tools, can help them ensure that, for example, a driver applying to a grocery delivery service is who they say they are.
“Our combined solution is easily quantifiable in terms of speed, accuracy and fraud capture which equate to immediate revenue lift and spend reduction,” said Ayers.
He also noted that Socure is in a good position to make an acquisition like this. He noted that Socure’s revenue grew over 50% in 2022, all while other companies in the space were flat to down. “We are looking to be offensive where it makes sense,” he said. “There are a number of companies that made some very interesting investments in innovation in the past couple of years, but unfortunately don’t have the runway or access to capital to continue independently. It makes sense to continue assessing what is in the market.”
Socure already integrated Berbix in its existing Predictive Document Verification service, which is launching version 3.0 today. The updated service combines Berbix’s forensics engine for spotting fake IDs with Socure’s image capture app and user experience. The company notes that while users can use the document verification service as a stand-alone application, it’s also integrated into the overall Socure platform.
This acquisition is part of a wider trend we’ve been seeing, with well-funded startups capitalizing on their ability to acquire companies that may have a hard time raising the next funding round and/or justifying their previous valuations.
“The cost of capital in the last 18 months for most companies has gone from single digit to 20-30% or more, which we expect will mean a lot of really great assets are coming to market trying to find a home in the winner in a given space,” said Ayers. “We are seeing that every venture fund is bucketing their portfolio into categories of ‘great,’ ‘good,’ ‘ok’ or ‘not good’ — and anything that’s good or less, they’re going to be more open to trade previously overpriced private stock to a much higher quality stock with higher upside and shorter-term liquidity within the winner of a market. We expect there to be individual point solutions that are just never going to get big enough to be a long-term independent company.”

"Zenarate, an AI-powered agent coaching platform, raises $15M",Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/27,"
While running a 5,000-agent contact center, Brian Tuite often experienced the problem of having to train new agents on the basics. The way he tells it, they weren’t prepared for success — and drained the contact center’s resources.
That gave Tuite the idea of creating what he describes as “simulation training” for customer service agents. After pitching it to Rab Govil, he and Govil decided to turn the concept into a company — Zenarate.
“Zenarate is an AI simulation training platform,” Tuite explained to me in an email interview. “It’s a ‘flight simulator’ for customer and prospect-facing agents, where agents in training are immersed in life-like conversation, screen and chat simulations to master high-impact topics they’ll face with live customers and prospects.”
Using Zenarate’s AWS-hosted platform, service agents engage with an “AI coach” that gives them feedback on their tone and soft skills — making suggestions where appropriate. Agents get a scorecard showing that they’ve mastered certain areas and met baseline requirements, like transitioning from service to sales, juggling multiple chats at once and addressing a customer by name.
The AI coach can present random call scenarios, forcing agents to think on their feet. Or customer service managers can assign particular scenarios to particular agents and teams.
“There’s no IT integration for agents to roleplay with the AI coach from the home or office,” Tuite said, touting what he sees as the benefits of Zenarate’s platform. “The only IT requirements are a Chrome or Edge browser and a headset. And there’s no personal or account information for testing or implementation, as all the content is fictitious training data.”
Of course, Zenarate isn’t particularly unique in the market for sales and agent training software — a market that Polaris Research predicts will be worth $7.74 billion by 2032. Rival Vervoe similarly provides “AI-powered” software that agents can use to prep for different types of live calls. So does Second Nature, which attracted an investment from Zoom’s Apps Fund early last year.
I’m also wary of the ways in which companies like Zenarate apply AI, which could open the door to bias — intentional or no. For example, studies have shown that some AI trained to detect toxicity sees phrases in African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) — the informal grammar used by some Black Americans — as disproportionately “toxic.” It’s not tough to imagine a scenario in which a Black customer service agent repeatedly scores lower than a white agent on a certification test because of the vernacular they use. (No need to imagine; it happens.)
Zenarate claims that its AI isn’t biased. But beyond assuring me that the platform’s AI models are trained with each client’s “best and required practice” data and that clients are charged with overseeing the model training, Tuite didn’t offer much in the way of details about Zenarate’s bias mitigation measures — assuming that it takes any.
Image Credits: Zenarate
If investors share these concerns, they aren’t showing it. Zenarate today announced that it raised $15 million in a funding round led by Volition Capital with participation from a number of undisclosed angel investors.
According to Volition’s Sean Cantwell, Zenarate’s positive unit economics were the winning factor; annual recurring revenue is sitting at “double digits,” currently, driven by an over-80-company-strong customer base with “over a million” users.
“There’s a significant growth opportunity to disrupt legacy passive training methods with the power of simulation training,” Cantwell added. “AI-powered simulation is the new standard in customer service and sales training, and Zenarate is leading the trend.”
Palo Alto-based Zenarate plans to spend the bulk of the new capital — which brings its total capital raised to $18 million — on expanding its workforce from 92 employees to 110 by the end of the year.

Redpanda nabs $100M Series C as streaming service experiences significant growth,Ron Miller,2023/06/27,"
Redpanda helps companies capture data in real time in a modern context, providing a new way to stream data while maintaining backwards compatibility with Kafka, the popular open source streaming project.
Today, the company announced a $100 million Series C, just 16 months after announcing a $50 million Series B. This kind of trajectory was common a couple of years ago, but seeing a company raise $150 million in such a quick succession these days has become far more rare.
CEO Alex Gallego says the company has been performing so well that existing investors stepped up with the additional investment, seizing the opportunity to capitalize on the startup’s startling growth.
“We’re basically oversubscribed on this round, and I know you mentioned that in this climate, it’s been hard to raise money, but the reason for this is that we quintupled our revenue last year and doubled the size of the company — and we literally haven’t lost the deal in seven months against all the competitors,” Gallego told TechCrunch.
At the time of the Series B, Gallego described the appeal of the product his startup has created this way:
“What’s happened in the market is that streaming is now the foundational part of how to build new modern applications. It sits as the bottom layer on which to build new applications. And for that you need unification, and what I mean by that is you need limitless data retention. And so that feature alone actually changed how the market perceived and how developers think about real-time data.”
He says that it turned out that this idea has resonated with the market, perhaps even better than he envisioned when he launched the company in 2019. “We’re one of the few technologies where the CIO looks great, because they cut their bill in half, developers love the technology and there’s basically zero cost to migrate from Kafka into Redpanda,” he said.
He says as the company has been growing so quickly, he needs the capital infusion to begin to expand in three areas, including go-to-market, scaling to meet the needs of larger customers and customer support. What’s more, the infinite data retention that the platform allows becomes more important as companies are building large language models, which has also pushed the company’s growth.
Customers currently include Cisco, Akamai, Lacework and Vodafone, among others.
The company had around 60 employees in February 2022. Today, it has 160 and is actively hiring, according to Gallego. He says as a Latino leader, he is cognizant of the need to build a diverse workforce and is working to do so as he scales the company, starting with the leadership team and working from there.
Today’s round was led by a trio of returning investors: Lightspeed Venture Partners, GV and Haystack VC.

CalypsoAI raises $23M to add guardrails to generative AI models,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/27,"
Companies are increasingly embracing generative AI. But they’re not necessarily considering all the blockers and challenges that come along with folding the tech into their existing workflows.
In one recent survey by KPMG, 90% of businesses said that they had “moderate to highly significant” concerns about the risks of using generative AI and doubts about how to mitigate those risks. Only 6%, meanwhile, said that they felt that their company had a mature AI governance program in place.
It’s partly for these reasons that Neil Serebryany founded CalypsoAI, a startup developing software to test, validate and monitor internally developed as well as third-party AI apps prior to their deployment.
“CalypsoAI’s platform promotes the power and competitive advantage that using AI can bring but within a safe, secure and reliable way,” Serebryany told TechCrunch in an email interview.
That’s setting the bar high. But investors evidently believe in CalypsoAI’s ability to deliver. The startup today announced that it raised $23 million in a Series A-1 round led by Paladin Capital Group with participation from Lockheed Martin Ventures, Hakluyt Capital and Expeditions Fund.
Notable angels contributed to the A-1 tranche as well, including former YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki and her sister, 23andMe co-founder Anne Wojcicki. To date, CalypsoAI has raised $38.2 million.
CalypsoAI claims that its tools — deployed as a container within an organization’s infrastructure — allow businesses to monitor and shape the usage of large language models such as ChatGPT via dashboards that show stats related to the toxicity of the models, user engagement and more. Serebryany says that CalypsoAI can prevent sensitive company data from being shared on models while identifying attacks coming from generative AI tools.
“While every company wants to reap the benefits of generative AI solutions — namely the clear productivity gains — they also want to make sure they aren’t subject to cyberattacks and that employees don’t expose sensitive information to public models,” Serebryany added. “By implementing CalypsoAI, CISOs and IT leaders can start to seriously consider implementing generative AI solutions across their organizations in a safe and secure manner — allowing them to introduce efficiencies into their business without the added risk.”
Certainly, there’s demand in the corporate sector for some sort of generative AI guardrail solution. Out of fear that employees might accidentally expose proprietary info, companies including Apple, JPMorgan Chase and Verizon have banned or restricted the use of ChatGPT-like tools internally. Many of these same companies are wary of generative AI’s toxicity and misinformation issues, which continue to plague even the best models available today.
The industry, eyeing the huge potential addressable market, has risen to meet the demand. Microsoft offers the Azure OpenAI Service, which provides governance and compliance capabilities on top of generative AI models from OpenAI, including ChatGPT. Elsewhere, Salesforce recently launched the Einstein Trust Layer, which attempts to prevent text-generating models from retaining sensitive data.
How well these guardrails work in practice is an open question, however. Putting one vendor’s claims into question, researchers recently uncovered flaws in NeMo Guardrails, Nvidia’s toolkit aimed at making AI-powered apps more accurate and secure, that allows the toolkit’s protections to be bypassed.
Serebryany insisted — for what it’s worth — that CalypsoAI’s products are robust to attack. In the same breath, he stressed that CalypsoAI doesn’t hold any data from its customers, instead only facilitating the info flow from employees into the model of a company’s choice.
“Securing LLMs in the enterprise has become a critical venture, which has led to CalypsoAI’s strategic shift to address the needs of enterprises looking to use AI solutions,” Serebryany said. “With many organizations looking to securely use generative AI solutions to propel their business forward, CalypsoAI feels confident about our ability to develop the best possible product and attract the best talent to secure enterprise organizations.”
Serebryany says that CalypsoAI will use the funding from the latest tranche to drive product development, hiring and the company’s go-to-market initiatives. CalypsoAI’s current headcount stands at 35 employees, and the startup recently opened an office in Dublin — a part of CalypsoAI’s plan to double its workforce over the next two years.
“As our company continues to grow and expand, we recognize the value of bringing on new investors to support our growth,” he continued. “By partnering with investors who share our vision and goals, we can continue to innovate and drive our business forward.”

Faros AI raises $20M to bring visibility to software engineering teams,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/27,"
Three years ago, Vitaly Gordon, one of the founding members of Salesforce’s Einstein research division, started Faros AI, a platform for software engineers designed to bring key operational data into one place. Alongside Shubha Nabar and Matthew Tovbin, two fellow ex-Salesforce employees and Einstein co-founders, Gordon sought to help developers better navigate common workflow challenges by shining a light on top bottlenecks.
“Our background was in building machine learning products and engineering teams, and we were motivated by our frustration with the black-box that was engineering operations,” Gordon told TechCrunch via email. “We found that while we were helping Salesforce customers harness AI to improve business outcomes, our visibility and insight into our own engineering processes was sorely lacking. And it wasn’t just us. Most sizable software engineering organizations today are largely flying blind.”
Word spread — and investors flocked. Faros today announced it raised $20 million in a Series A funding round led by Lobby Capital with participation from SignalFire, Salesforce Ventures and Operator Collective. Gordon says that the round, which brings Faros’ total raised to $36 million, will be put toward bolstering Faros’ go-to-market strategy, R&D and customer success initiatives.

According to Gordon, Faros “hadn’t touched” most of the cash from its previous fundraise. But the company ended up hitting milestones sooner than expected, tripling its customer base and quadrupling revenue over the past 12 months.
“Given the unprecedented opportunity to tap top talent and expand our go-to-market footprint, while everyone else is cutting costs and scaling back, we decided to move forward and raise additional capital,” Gordon said.
Faros as it exists today aims to provide a “single-pane” view across a software engineering team’s work, goals and velocity. Customers can connect various data sources to the platform, starting with out-of-the-box modules and benchmarks and then customizing and building their own analytics.
The idea behind Faros is to allow engineers, engineering team managers and the C-suite to measure an organization’s health and tech debt, as well as things like the dependencies between departments and bottlenecks in processes. The platform can break down time spent on feature development versus tech debt and measure the efficacy of onboarding processes, Gordon points out — plus track seniority and tenure by team, location and other dimensions.
“Software is eating the world and engineering becomes the highest budget item for every company,” Gordon said. “With Faros AI, companies no longer have to fly blind and teams can do more with less.”
I can’t speak to Faros’ effectiveness. But there’s some evidence to suggest that today’s software engineering teams do, indeed, lack visibility, to Gordon’s larger point.
Engineering management platform Jellyfish — not the most unbiased of sources in this area, granted — found in a recent survey that engineering and technical leaders underestimate the amount of time their teams end up spending on unplanned work by 81%. According to the same survey — which, again, must be taken with a grain of salt — teams using engineering management platforms dedicate 25% more time to innovation while spending 18% less time on customer support issues and bugs.
Another look at Faros’ platform capabilities. Image Credits: Faros
“While every tech company is seriously affected by the current market conditions, we are experiencing significant tailwinds from companies exploring how they can do more with less, and shifting their engineering resources to core functionality while looking to partner with vendors that can offload this undifferentiated work,” Gordon said.
A portion of the funding from Faros’ recent tranche will support the rollout of Lighthouse AI, Faros’ newly unveiled AI engine that allows users to gather insights about engineering operations from disparate systems — tapping natural language for data analysis. Gordon sees it as the natural evolution of Faros’ platform, enabling engineers to make sense of the vast amounts of data that their organizations generate each day.
“The AI revolution has only just begun,” Gordon said. “We anticipate that every aspect of software engineering is going to be transformed by AI in the next five years, and at Faros, we are making sure that operational intelligence keeps pace, allowing engineering organizations to make that transition with confidence.”
Faros currently has 35 employees and anticipates that number doubling in the next 12 months.

ShopZetu raises pre-seed funding to fuel growth of its fashion marketplace beyond Kenya,Annie Njanja,2023/06/27,"
Kenyan fashion e-commerce startup ShopZetu is set to add beauty and home décor categories to its portfolio, in response to the growing needs of the young and style-conscious women in Africa. This is as it currently scales regionally over the next few months while working to attract international fashion brands, and more than triple the number of vendors on its platform to 1,000.
The startup plans to trial regional delivery services in Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, scaling beyond Kenya, where it launched in 2021, on the backing of a $1 million pre-seed funding it has just closed.
“The goal is for ShopZetu to become the leading lifestyle platform. We are looking to expand our beauty, skincare, hair and home décor offerings, which are all expressions of one’s identity. We want to become a one-stop shop,” said Marvin Kiragu, ShopZetu CEO, who co-founded the startup with Wandia Gichuru, also co-founder of the popular Kenyan fashion brand Vivo.
The pre-seed round was led by Chui Ventures, with participation from Launch Africa, Roselake Ventures and Logos Ventures. Angel investors that took part in the round include Kendall Tang, the CEO of RT Knits; Ben Munoz, the co-founder and CEO of Nadine West; Sumit Bhasin of Estée Lauder Inc.; Patricia Ithau, the CEO of WPP Scangroup; and Peter Njonjo, the co-founder and CEO of Twiga Foods.

Jendaya raises funding to scale its Africa-focused luxury e-commerce platform

Kiragu told TechCrunch that ShopZetu was born out of the need for a multibrand marketplace to bridge a highly fragmented industry that has “hundreds of thousands of sellers” offline and online including on Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp. This, he noted, makes the shopping process cumbersome, lacking price visibility and customer trust.
He added that the infinite number of possible stock-keeping units makes it nearly impossible for any one player to house the available assortment under one physical location.
“ShopZetu seeks to solve this problem by aggregating the available supply of fashion and lifestyle products under one roof,” he said.
ShopZetu’s over 300 vendors, mainly made up of large and small local manufacturers, and traders of imported fashion products, have currently listed more than 20,000 products on the ShopZetu marketplace. Vendor onboarding is free, however, they pay a commission for sales generated on the platform, and for other additional services, including delivery.
“We also offer vendors a variety of services such as content, digital marketing, warehousing, last-mile delivery and returns management. These services are offered at a cost but are largely subsidized to ensure vendor success online,” said Kiragu.
“Our goal is to lower the barrier for anyone to start and scale a fashion brand leveraging ShopZetu’s reach and resources. We have good case studies of brands incubated and launched on ShopZetu and then go on to scale online and establish physical stores,” he said.
The startup requires vendors selling on the marketplace to, amongst other conditions, be well stocked, have high-quality products and inclusive-sizing.
The startup says it has in the past two years served over 30,000 customers, and sold more than 100,000 products, while achieving over 400% increase in monthly orders since January 2021.
ShopZetu says it is eyeing the growing fashion industry in sub-Saharan Africa, which is currently dominated by second-hand clothing. However, startups like ShopZetu are banking their growth on affordable new clothing options, and the growing fashion-conscious, tech savvy population in Africa.
“We believe the market for fashion is huge as clothing is a basic human need. While a big percentage of this is currently serviced by secondhand clothing, we are seeing a gradual shift to new clothing as more affordable options are introduced into the market,” said Kiragu.
“We believe that online fashion retail will leapfrog formal retail and become the largest e-commerce category in Africa.”

Dust uses large language models on internal data to improve team productivity,Romain Dillet,2023/06/27,"
Dust is a new AI startup based in France that is working on improving team productivity by breaking down internal silos, surfacing important knowledge and providing tools to build custom internal apps. At its core, Dust is using large language models (LLMs) on internal company data to give new superpowers to team members.
The company was co-founded by Gabriel Hubert and Stanislas Polu, who have known each other for more than a decade. Their first startup was called Totems and was acquired by Stripe in 2015. After that, they both spent a few years working for Stripe before parting ways.
Stanislas Polu joined OpenAI, where he spent three years working on LLMs’ reasoning capabilities while Gabriel Hubert became the head of product at Alan.
They teamed up once again to create Dust. Unlike many AI startups, Dust isn’t focused on creating new large language models. Instead, the company wants to build applications on top of LLMs developed by OpenAI, Cohere, AI21, etc.
The team first worked on a platform that can be used to design and deploy large language model apps. It has then focused its efforts on one use case in particular — centralizing and indexing internal data so that it can be used by LLMs.
From an internal ChatGPT to next-gen software
There are a handful of connectors that constantly fetch internal data from Notion, Slack, GitHub and Google Drive. This data is then indexed and can be used for semantic search queries. When a user wants to do something with a Dust-powered app, Dust will find the relevant internal data, use it as the context of an LLM and return an answer.
For example, let’s say you just joined a company and you’re working on a project that was started a while back. If your company fosters communication transparency, you will want to find information in existing internal data. But the internal knowledge base might not be up to date. Or it might be hard to find the reason why something is done this way, as it’s been discussed in an archived Slack channel.
Dust isn’t just a better internal search tool, as it doesn’t just return search results. It can find information across multiple data sources and format answers in a way that is much more useful to you. It can be used as a sort of internal ChatGPT, but it could also be used as the basis of new internal tools.
“We’re convinced that natural language interface is going to disrupt software,” Gabriel Hubert told me. “In five years’ time, it would be disappointing if you still have to go and click on edit, settings, preferences, to decide that your software should behave differently. We see a lot more of our software adapting to your individual needs, because that’s the way you are, but also because that’s the way your team is — because that’s the way your company is.”
The company is working with design partners on several ways to implement and package the Dust platform. “We think there are a lot of different products that can be created in this area of enterprise data, knowledge workers and models that could be used to support them,” Polu told me.
It’s still early days for Dust, but the startup is exploring an interesting problem. There are many challenges ahead when it comes to data retention, hallucination and all of the issues that come with LLMs. Maybe hallucination will become less of an issue as LLMs evolve. Maybe Dust will end up creating its own LLM for data privacy reasons.
Dust has raised $5.5 million (€5 million) in a seed round led by Sequoia with XYZ, GG1, Seedcamp, Connect, Motier Ventures, Tiny Supercomputer, and AI Grant. Several business angels also participated, such as Olivier Pomel from Datadog, Julien Codorniou, Julien Chaumond from Hugging Face, Mathilde Collin from Front, Charles Gorintin and Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve from Alan, Eléonore Crespo and Romain Niccoli from Pigment, Nicolas Brusson from BlaBlaCar, Howie Liu from Airtable, Matthieu Rouif from PhotoRoom, Igor Babuschkin and Irwan Bello.
If you take a step back, Dust is betting that LLMs will greatly change how companies work. A product like Dust works even better in a company that fosters radical transparency instead of information retention, written communication instead of endless meetings, autonomy instead of top-down management.
If LLMs deliver on their promise and greatly improve productivity, some companies will gain an unfair advantage by adopting these values as Dust will unlock a lot of untapped potential for knowledge workers.

Dexory nabs $19M to bring visibility to warehouses through analytics and autonomous robots,Paul Sawers,2023/06/27,"
Dexory, a company that serves warehouses with real-time inventory management data using AI software and autonomous robots, has raised $19 million in a Series A round of funding led by European VC Atomico.
Founded in London in 2015, Dexory’s product can be split into two segments. On the hardware side, the company develops robots replete with sensors and cameras to capture data as they traverse a particular warehouse, taking continuous photos of racks as they move at something akin to normal walking speed (e.g., a half-meter/second). The robots capture 3D scans of the site, which can give insights into things like dimensions, shapes and sizes, and volumes of goods sitting on shelves.
Dexory then uses computer vision and machine learning to process the captured data, while tying it to the physical location of the stock but inside a digital twin — that is, a complete virtual equivalent of its real-world counterpart.
“The robots can be deployed multiple times a day or once a day around their shift patterns, including overnight,” Dexory co-founder and CEO Andrei Danescu told TechCrunch over email. “The collection of data insights over a short space of time, all the time, allows analysis for identifying issues on-the-spot and decision making in driving warehouse operational efficiencies.”
Dexory’s software Image Credits: Dexory
Dexory says that its customers use its platform for any number of use cases, such as carrying out autonomous stock checks throughout the day, reducing the need for labor-intensive manual inventory counts. This can also be helpful for solving some of the common warehouse pain points, such as identifying misplaced pallets or other goods that have gone AWOL.
Instinctively, this will never be a perfect solution in every scenario, as it surely isn’t possible to see every item on a shelf, particularly if they’re stacked in rows or located high on shelves. But Danescu reckons that it will go most of the way toward solving at least some of the stock-check problems.
“If the goods are behind one another, the solution might not be able to identify exactly what the goods are — no label to read means nothing to identify of course,” Danescu said. “But due to the 3D scans, it will let the operators know that something else is there, and show them a picture of what that is, solving more than 80% of the problem.”
Moreover, stock checks aren’t the entire purpose for Dexory’s platform. It can also be used to keep tabs on space optimization — for instance, where there may be large gaps with nothing in it. Or it could be used to forecast capacity, or even as part of a company’s safety regulation compliance workflow, where it can spot any dangerous situations arising.
While there are countless robotics companies already infiltrating the retail sphere with similar smarts, including the likes of Bossa Nova, Simbe, and Zippedi, Danescu says they’re setting out to differentiate from the pack through its focus on larger warehouse-style environments, rather than retail stores — its robots can scan up to 15 meters (50 feet) high by physically expanding.
“We have new solutions on the roadmap to go beyond that (19–20m-plus), but that’s barely 2–3% of the market,” Danescu said.

Scaling
For now, Dexory operates in the U.K. and Ireland across the logistics and supply chain sectors; air cargo; retail and e-commerce; and manufacturing, with clients such as Menzies Aviation; Denso Manufacturing U.K., Huboo, and Maersk. Indeed, today’s news comes a week after Maersk revealed it was extending its partnership with Dexory to include more warehouses in the U.K. and Ireland area, after entering into an initial proof-of-concept partnership back in January shortly after Dexory had rebranded from BotsAndUs.
With its fresh cash injection, Dexory has now raised a total of $37.9 million across its various rounds, and it’s planning to scale its platform into new markets, including the U.S., Germany, and the Netherlands.
Aside from lead investor Atomico, Dexory’s Series A round included participation from early Facebook and Spotify investor Lakestar; Maersk Growth, the investment arm of Danish shipping and logistics giant (and Dexory customer) Maersk; London-based early-stage VC Kindred Capital; and Capnamic.

DePoly keeps hard-to-recycle plastic from ending up in landfills,Catherine Shu,2023/06/26,"
About 400 million tons of plastic are produced each year, but less than 10% is recycled, with most of the rest ending up incinerated or in landfills. One reason is that it is difficult for conventional recycling processes to handle contaminated plastics, like those that are made up of several different types of plastics, combined with other materials or those that are just plain dirty. DePoly, a deep tech startup, has developed a process that is able to tackle complex plastic streams and turn plastics back into raw material without affecting quality. The Swiss-based startup announced today it has raised $13.8 million in seed funding.
The round was co-led by BASF Venture Capital and Wingman Ventures, with participation from other investors like Beiersdorf, Infinity Recycling, CIECH Ventures and Angel Invest.
DePoly’s chemical recycling tech converts all PET plastics and polyester textiles back into their main raw chemical components, which are then sold back to the industry to make new items. DePoly says items made from its raw material are virgin quality.
The company currently operates a pilot plant that can process 50 tons per year of complex PET or polyester plastic streams. It serves such industries as post-consumer packaging, textiles, fashion and post-industrial streams. DePoly is building a showcase plant with a capacity of 500 tons to demonstrate its tech at commercial scale, and it already has five customers, ranging from fast-fashion brands, to sporting good brands and packaging users to resin producers.
DePoly was founded in 2020 by CEO Samantha Anderson, CTO Bardiya Valizadeh and CSO Christopher Ireland, and now has a team of 13 people. In the years before launching DePoly, the three moved to Switzerland to work on their PhDs and post-docs. Anderson told TechCrunch that there were a lot of articles being published about issues like microplastics in people, growing plastic patches in the ocean and animals washing up on shore with microplastics in their stomachs.

“For us, all this was quite alarming, particularly that companies seemed not to care about solving the problem now, not in 10 to 15 years,” Anderson said. “So we decided that we wanted to tackle the plastic problem, using chemistry and the skills we had developed during our degrees, with the aim of if we could make it work, to spin a company out and tackle the problem faster than others were moving.”
Conventional plastic recycling means things like bottles and food packaging made of PET and other plastics are brought to a recycling facility, then sorted into colors, cleaned, melted and turned into rPET pellets. But if they are too dirty, mixed with other plastics or in fabric or fiber form, they usually get incinerated or dumped into a landfill, Anderson said. There are also limits to what can be recycled because of health and food safety standards, which means the majority of plastic produced is destroyed or thrown away, and new plastic has to be made from crude oil.
DePloy’s chemical recycling tech operates at room temperature and standard pressure and does not need plastics and materials to be washed, pre-sorted, pre-melted or separated. This means it can be used to recycle PET and polyester materials that don’t make it into conventional recycling systems, including mixed plastics, mixed colors, dirty plastic waste streams, fabrics and fibers. PET is converted back into PTA and MEG, its original two monomers.
Anderson explained that DePoly has a B2B model, connecting users of complex plastic waste, like blended polyesters, multilayered PET items or PET items that are too dirty or chemically contaminated to be introduced into the mechanical recycling process, with people who produce virgin-quality PET items from oil because of limited accessibility to sustainable chemicals like PTA and MEG. DePoly’s tech allows one side to get rid of PET and other plastic waste, and the other side (or the producers) to have access to the original, sustainable chemicals that make up those items, creating a circular economy for plastics.
DePoly can also do content recovery. For example, it can recover PP or cotton from PP/PET combos or cotton/polyester blends. Anderson said this is because of the low temperature of its system, because it doesn’t melt polymers. The startup is also scaling tech for polyurethanes (PU), polylactic acid (PLA) and similar polymers like PBT.
As an example of how DePoly’s chemical recycling process has been used, Anderson said it’s worked with customers in the sporting goods industry that have polyurethane blended polyester items. The polyurethane content means those items would usually be discarded, but DePoly is able to fully recycle them and is now scaling its tech to recover the polyurethane portion.
Anderson cites startups Carbios, Gr3n and Ioniqa as other companies that are doing similar work with plastics, and says she thinks “the tech they’ve developed is really neat.” The main way DePoly differentiates itself is the reaction that occurs during its recycling process, the product output in Ioniqa’s case, the temperature required for the reaction and the contamination threshold allowed. “In our case, we’re lower temperature, produce the same monomers that make up PET and to our understanding have a higher contamination threshold versus others.”
In a statement about the investment, Wingman Ventures principal Antonia Albert said, “We are extremely proud to support DePoly since day one on their journey to tackle this planetary crisis to clean our oceans and landfills from plastic waste and to welcome leading investors from the chemicals, recycling, climate- and deep tech space on board to build the global leader for the sustainable plastics recycling.”

Supply chain startup Baskit supports Indonesia’s middlemen,Catherine Shu,2023/06/26,"
Large brand distributors dominate the top of the supply chain, but toward the bottom, there are thousands of middlemen, including wholesalers, who are the ones creating relationships with retailers. Founded last year, Baskit wants to provide them with tools to digitize the management of their inventory and services to help them get better prices. The Indonesia-based startup announced today it has raised $3.3 million for its seed round, from investors including Betatron, Forge, 1982, Investible, DS/X, Orvel and Michael Sampoerna. This follows a $1.5 million seed round three months ago.
Founder Yann Schuermans said he is a “very big believer in the space. Supply chains are fundamental to the economies of every major economy in Southeast Asia, as anywhere from 40% to 50% of their GDP are dependent on supply chains. Eventually they have to modernize and digitize.”
Baskit currently works with more than 50 wholesalers, predominantly in West Java. Schuermans noted that supply chains in emerging markets are very fragmented, especially in Indonesia, which has a complicated geography with thousands of islands. As a result, a supply chain is not as simple as getting goods from point A to point B. Middlemen are necessary, he said, because supply chains start with a manufacturer and distributors, then the smaller distributors and wholesalers who sell to retailers.
“All of these guys in the middle are so critical with their relationships and connectivity to their communities,” he added. “Their kids go to school with the kids of shop owners who are buying their product.”
Wholesalers often don’t have exclusivity to brands, operating more like traders by buying products they can sell at higher prices. Instead of striving to cut out the role of middlemen from supply chains, Baskit provides them with several layers of tools to grow their businesses. This includes software that helps them digitize their operations and bring inventory online.

Schuermans said Baskit differentiates from other supply chain startups because those often focus on creating ERP software for the upper enterprise part of supply chains, like big brand distributors who do tens of millions of dollars a month in turnover. In contrast, Baskit’s software helps middlemen by organizing their warehouses and inventory, giving them visibility into pricing, missing goods or items that are aging. Then their inventory is connected to an ordering system, so customers who were previously buying goods through offline processes can do so online through a catalog.
Baskit also offers customer service that helps wholesalers source better products and pricing from manufacturers.
“The best way to describe our business is a hybrid between software digitization partner, but with a very commercial kind of service provider angle where we provide in that respect, we almost look like a marketplace,” Schuermans said. “We help to connect the buyers and sellers, but it’s a very tightly managed marketplace.” Ultimately, Baskit’s goal is to make the middlemen in supply chains more attractive partners to the organizations at the top, including big manufacturers and brand owners.
“Inventory is the gold standard here, because when I have the data, I have information on pricing, I know how much product there is available. I know what products are moving fast. That is the centerpiece to our entire stack. Once we have inventory visibility, we can do a lot of magic in how we help them sell, but also in helping that wholesaler optimize their margins,” he added. This is important because wholesalers often operate on thin margins of 3% to 7%, and are also dealing with inflation. By helping middlemen get a handle on their inventory, Baskit is also able to help them decide what suppliers to purchase from and price it correctly for the people they are selling goods to.
Baskit also offers financing services to middlemen, who often struggle to get working capital from traditional financial institutions. It is able to do so because its software has data on how much turnover a business has, and how much money is going and coming in. Baskit is currently working with several P2P lenders, and some traditional banks, including one of which is on its cap table.
Baskit’s plan is to expand into more cities, with the goal of reaching double-digit penetration of the wholesaler base in each one, which Schuermans says will make it an indispensable player. “That gives us a very broad distribution because these 50 wholesalers can cover the entire territory and it also gives us access to a very important supply base, a share of wallet. It’s interesting how very few suppliers, very few wholesalers, can do so much in covering the overall needs of retailers that they serve.”

The era of tech giants overstaffing and overpaying has ended, at least for now. But talent is flooding the market, and those still employed have been left to shoulder all the work — there’s a huge opportunity for savvy recruiters to scoop up top performers.
Today’s job market is a confusing paradox. While unemployment is at a record low and there’s a labor shortage in healthcare and hospitality, tech has seen nonstop layoffs that hit 166,044 workers in Q1 2023 alone. That’s more than all of 2022’s then-record 161,411 tech layoffs.
What’s most unprecedented is that these layoffs are hitting software engineers, including top talent at FAANG companies that were previously considered untouchable. This is in sharp contrast to the 2008 recession, when the U.S. high-tech industry gained about 77,000 jobs in Q4, most in software development, despite the overall U.S. labor market losing 38,000 jobs.

The reversal of fortunes for engineers is particularly brutal coming off of 2021’s startup fundraising boom and relentless optimism. Companies preempted growth with hiring sprees far ahead of their metrics in hopes of continued growth.
But by the summer of 2022, the Great Resignation and “quiet quitting” gave way to mass layoffs by four of the big five in tech — Meta (Facebook), Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet (Google), known as FAANG. All but Apple made sizable cuts, including deeper cuts for software developers.

Executive summary
SignalFire’s State of Talent Report explores macro conditions and top-talent movement trends in tech to identify practical strategies for winning in the current hiring market. Top findings include:

Hiring power is shifting to startups as post-pandemic layoffs and budget cuts cause a “Great Restart” of compensation norms at Big Tech companies that can no longer overpay to win the best talent.
An unprecedented 166,000 tech layoffs happened in Q1 2023 — more than in all of 2022 — and included formerly untouchable software engineers.
Big Tech talent has flooded the market — 69% of FAANG engineers who were laid off or left after May 15, 2022 still listed no current job as of March 15, 2023.
28% of rehired FAANG engineers played musical chairs and switched to another tech giant, while 6% went to early-stage startups — an 82% increase over 2021.
Startups can capitalize on this power shift by recruiting passive talent who have survived Big Tech layoffs — they’re often loyal top performers who are overworked after teammates were cut.
SignalFire can help startups find and hire top passive talent with its Beacon AI engine and recruiting team.

Mass layoffs and the “Great Restart”
To explain the tech talent market’s sudden implosion, here’s the timeline that led to an imbalance in talent supply and demand.
 

			Tech has seen nonstop layoffs that hit 166,044 workers in Q1 2023 alone. That’s more than all of 2022’s then-record 161,411 tech layoffs.					



The 2020 pandemic accelerated the move of commerce, collaboration and entertainment online, causing a boom for many tech companies through 2021.
Hiring accelerated in 2021, creating a candidate-centric market that, coupled with the Great Resignation, drove many companies to use above-market compensation to attract and retain top talent.
Entering 2022, the cost to do business in general steadily began to rise with inflation, coupled with a return to in-person activities, disrupting demand for online services that had fueled pandemic tech growth.
Midyear 2022, tech valuations and cryptocurrency prices recalibrated down.
Ambitious hiring ahead had been a strategic lever to hit ambitious revenue targets, and as those targets were missed, both public and private companies adjusted to decrease burn and extend their runway.

The result: Companies chose to equalize the decreased demand for their products and services by reducing their workforce. Notably, top engineers were not spared.

In this report, we share a data-based analysis of the shifting talent landscape starting May 15, 2022 — when some of the most significant changes were starting to take place — through March 15, 2023, which captures the bulk of relevant data but is not inclusive of all activity to date.
We demystify the talent market on behalf of top engineers, as well as the companies where that top talent might find a new home. We specifically looked at engineers who are in the top 25% relative to their peers — as calculated by SignalFire’s Beacon AI data platform, which leverages a proprietary machine learning algorithm we developed to gauge the quality of engineers — both individually and collectively at their companies.
We used a cohort data approach encompassing the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Layoffs.fyi to capture a point in time when tech layoffs peaked, sticking with the data long enough to understand outcomes for that impacted cohort. More on our methodology can be found in the appendix at the end of the report.
How we got here
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the number of U.S. workers who quit their jobs during the Great Resignation between January and December 2021 made it a record-breaking year, with nearly 47.8 million total workers quitting their jobs. That is twice as many as left or were laid off during the Great Recession of 2009 and 2010.

Over the years leading up to the implosion, fundraising grew in both velocity and size. Pitchbook NVCA Venture Monitor highlights that 2021 saw a peak in the number of deals closed (18,521) and dollars invested ($344.7 billion) followed by a substantial drop in 2022, with four consecutive quarters of declining deal counts. The conjecture is that investor demand went down in both early- and late-stage investments.
To avoid a down round — or perhaps due to a lack of new funding available altogether — companies began to focus on extending their runway by reducing burn. Headcount and salaries are almost always the biggest line item on a company budget. Many companies had used capital to hire in advance of expected revenue growth and then missed revenue targets. They were suddenly strapped with unsustainable burn due to payroll increases.
Cue layoffs.
As the chart below highlights, layoffs in tech nearly doubled in 2022 compared with 2020; and after just the first quarter of 2023, this is already another record-breaking year for layoffs.

For the past decade, FAANG companies were seen as the safe bet for job seekers, known for rich compensation packages and high job security. Starting in the summer of 2022, a new reality set in with hiring freezes and layoffs. "
Unicorn social app IRL to shut down after admitting 95% of its users were fake,Amanda Silberling,2023/06/26,"
Ironically, the social app IRL‘s users do not exist in real life.
An internal investigation by IRL’s board of directors found that 95% of the app’s reported 20 million users were “automated or from bots,” The Information first reported. So, after raising more than $200 million in venture capital, IRL is shutting down.
IRL was poised to become an event organizing alternative for Gen Z, who are using Facebook less and less. But after raising its SoftBank-led $170 million Series C round at a $1.17 billion valuation, the company’s internal troubles became more obvious.
Last year, IRL laid off 25% of its team, or around 25 employees. During the year prior, IRL had more than tripled its head count, so these cuts came as a surprise. In a note to employees, obtained by TechCrunch, former CEO and founder Abraham Shafi encouraged employees to “adapt” and “be disciplined,” citing that WhatsApp grew to 450 million users with a team of just 55.
“Becoming one of these iconic, impactful companies is akin to winning a gold medal in the Olympics. In fact, probably more challenging,” Shafi wrote in the memo, which was full of similarly outlandish analogies. “Like the Olympics, we know most people don’t want to be Olympians. In the same way, not everyone will want to walk the path we are walking. But for those that want to push their limits and find out what they are capable of, this culture is for you.”
In that same memo, Shafi said the company had “more than enough cash to last well into 2024.” An IRL employee told TechCrunch then that the company had more than $100 million in the bank. Though it’s unknown how much money IRL has left now, a company spokesperson told The Information that it would return its capital to shareholders.
Around the same time as these layoffs, IRL employees started doubting Shafi’s claim that the app had 20 million monthly active users; then the SEC began investigating whether IRL violated securities laws. By April, IRL’s board of directors suspended Shafi and appointed an acting CEO.
TechCrunch attempted to contact Shafi, as well as another IRL employee. Both of their IRL email addresses have been disabled.

Lilz brings its gauge-watching smart cameras to the US and raises $4M,Devin Coldewey,2023/06/26,"
When you run big real-life industrial operations, there’s always a gauge or readout somewhere deep in the facility that your engineers or field teams need to check in person. Lilz is a Japanese startup that builds devices you can set up to read these meters remotely, and the company just raised $4.1 million as they enter the North American market.
Lilz’s devices are basically battery-powered smart cameras that can last for years between charges, while monitoring something like a pressure gauge 24/7.
It may sound a little odd in this modern era — why not just have a smart steam gauge in the first place? The simple truth is much infrastructure and heavy industry doesn’t have that option, or retrofitting may be prohibitively expensive. Yet for safety or efficiency reasons, some simple readout needs to be looked at regularly.
Sending a human down is the simplest solution, or was until Lilz made its devices available a couple years ago. Their robust but low-power computer vision stack analyzes images of the gauge and relays that information digitally.
Now the Okinawa-based company has about 3,500 active cameras at 500 locations and has raised 590 million yen (approximately $4.1 million today) to fuel the next phase of their business. Its investors include JIC Venture Growth Investments, Mitsubishi UFJ Capital, Tokyo Century, Dimension Fund, Okinawa Development Finance Corporation, Okinawa’s Science and Technology Development Center, and Dogan Beta. That’s a Series B round, about twice their $2.2 million Series A round in 2021.
The company has received FCC and ISED certification for its devices and is preparing to launch in the U.S. and Canada. They plan to double their camera deployments and then rapidly expand afterward.
A Lilz device in a real-world situation, and an example of its readouts. (Not the same gauges, to be clear.) Image Credits: Lilz
As far as the hardware, Lilz has been working on getting “intrinsically safe” certification as well, meaning the cameras pose no risk of creating safety issues — for example, shorting out and causing a spark that could ignite inflammable fumes. This frequently involves large enclosures for devices, but Lilz designed for it from the start, and its intrinsically safe cameras will only weigh 550 grams.
They’re also planning on releasing a thermal camera with similar qualities to the RGB one; thermal monitoring is important in uncrewed power stations, where a person would simply have to visit with a handheld thermal camera to check. Naturally automating this process is desirable. As with other widely distributed businesses like gas storage and delivery, removing the need for these checks is not only safer, but also saves money, time, and fuel.
Although it would be a stretch to call Lilz an AI company, it’s certainly close enough to claim kinship while the AI market continues to expand. Though it regularly improves its computer vision algorithms and the methods of accessing the data, Jakub Kolodziejczyk, the company’s CTO, said they’ve seen interest beyond meter-reading, since the devices are often at key locations in facilities.
“While we focus on analog gauges, with our cameras, clients can also capture other aspects of their processes they couldn’t track before, and are asking us for capabilities to detect events of interest,” he told TechCrunch. “Some examples we see now are abnormal temperature changes (which ties back to our thermal vision camera offering) and leaks, for both equipment and surrounding environment.”
Lilz devices could learn to detect outliers with very sparse data, he said, but cautioned that “this project is still in exploration phase.”

How to identify, interview and hire a head of growth for an early-stage startup
Don’t wait to identify your startup’s ideal customer personas



One of the biggest mistakes startups can make at an early stage is not identifying their ideal customer personas (ICP). It is perfectly sensible though, as all your efforts at this stage of growth are usually being consumed with finding product-market fit and acquiring anyone and anything that walks through your front door.
By identifying your ICPs first, you will find product-market fit faster and identify the right customers to sell to.
To start, an ICP is simply a depiction of who your customer segments are — whether they are creative agencies of more than 10 employees or corporations with 100+ employees, or both.
Startups using ICPs tend to acquire more leads with higher quality and are able to shorten their sales cycles. Ideally, you have already identified a handful of ICPs, but no more than five, as that will lead to a dilution of efforts among your teams.
To begin leveraging ICPs in your growth marketing, we’ll dive into methods that will first help identify your ICPs efficiently, then examine how to use their newfound segmentation.
Identifying your ICPs
I’m a big fan of surveys that measure net promoter scores and overall customer feedback, but I don’t believe these are the best formats for identifying ICPs. In the early days of your startup, you should be speaking with every customer you possibly can to better identify your ICPs.
 

			By identifying your ideal customer personas first, you will find product-market fit faster and identify the right customers to sell to.					


Obtaining such information requires more than a simple multiselect answer, or a ranking score from 1-10. Rest assured, I’ve created a three-tiered methodology (conveniently dubbed ICP!) for guiding the conversational and questioning themes you should be using with your customers:

I: Individual (e.g., age, gender, etc.)
C: Current solution
P: Pain points

When speaking with customers, if you follow the general principle of understanding pain points and what an ideal solution looks like to them, you’ll have a pretty good idea of which ICP they fall into. Instead of providing a generic script for your conversations with customers, which can often come across as robotic, I’ve laid out a few questions that fall into each category:
Individual

What is your age range?
What is your gender?
What is your occupation or job title?

Current solution

What are you currently using to solve this problem?
How long have you been using your current solution?
What do you like/dislike about your current solution?

Q2 failed to bring a funding reprieve for web3 startups and unicorns,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/26,"
Lo and behold, we’re already halfway into 2023, which means we’re only a couple weeks away from brand new, sizzling data on the second quarter. However, it’s always wise to keep an eye on the horizon, so we’ve decided to draw the few conclusions about web3 and unicorn funding trends that we can from early data on the past three months.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

I think it’s fair to call the fervor that drove investors to throw money web3 startups a feature unique to the last venture boom. Neither capital nor enthusiasm around fintech were in short supply in those months, and investors poured tens of billions of dollars into blockchain-focused startups that wanted to shake up the world of money and value management.
Firm believers in crypto are resolutely holding the line, but early data on the second quarter indicates that many venture investors are running for cover.
Going by the early numbers, there’s been a decline in the value of venture investment in unicorns and companies close to growing a horn. Indeed, that metric is close to record lows. "
"ThoughtSpot acquires Mode Analytics, a BI platform, for $200M in cash and stock",Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/26,"
ThoughtSpot, an AI-powered analytics platform last valued at $4.5 billion, today announced that it’s entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Mode Analytics, a business intelligence startup, for $200 million in cash and stock.
Mode will become a wholly owned subsidiary of ThoughtSpot once the deal closes later this year, subject to customary closing conditions and the approval of Mode’s shareholders.
It’s ThoughtSpot’s fourth acquisition following (most recently) the company’s purchases of SQL-based analytics firm SeekWell in March 2021 and data integration company Diyotta in May of that same year. Enabling all the deals is ThoughtSpot’s massive war chest, which totaled over $663 million as of August 2019.
As for the Mode acquisition, ThoughtSpot CEO Sudheesh Nair says that it’ll bolster ThoughtSpot’s generative AI apps while doubling the company’s customer base and growing its annual recurring revenue to more than $150 million.
“With this acquisition, we’re giving both data teams and business users the tools they need to efficiently and quickly turn data into insights and those insights into actions,” Nair said in a press release issued this morning.
San Francisco-based Mode, which TechCrunch last covered in August 2020, was co-founded by Derek Steer, Benn Stancil and Josh Ferguson in 2013. All three previously worked at Yammer (they were early employees and stayed on after the Microsoft acquisition), where they were a part of a larger team building custom data analytics tools for the Yammer platform.
Steer told my colleague Ingrid Lunden that the impetus for Mode came out of gaps in the market that the three had found through years of experience at other companies. Specifically, they saw an opportunity to build a product that could provide business intelligence and big data analytics capabilities to help data scientists improve their employers’ decision making.
Mode indeed managed to find a foothold in the vast and growing business intelligence market (worth an estimated $27.11 billion in 2022, according to Fortune), raising $81 million in venture capital prior to the ThoughtSpot acquisition from investors including H.I.G. Growth Partners, Valor Equity Partners and Rev.
At one point, Mode claimed that its customer base covered more than 50% of the Forbes 500, including brands such as Anheuser-Busch, Zillow, Lyft, Bloomberg, Capital One, VMware and Conde Nast.
“At Mode, we’ve always focused on helping data analysts, and worked hard to remove the frustrations that interfered with their day-to-day workflows,” Stancil, who serves as Mode’s CTO, said in a statement via email. “By providing data teams with an integrated, code-first experience, we’ve enabled our customers to move far more quickly and find much more value in their data than they previously could.”
For Mountain View, California-based ThoughtSpot, which was founded in 2012 by a team of engineers who previously worked for Google, Oracle and other Silicon Valley companies, the deal makes perfect logistical sense.
ThoughtSpot’s platform is designed to allow “non-technical” users to conduct data analyses, leveraging tools that monitor information for changing patterns and trends from sources such as Snowflake and Databricks. Tapped by companies including Walmart and Apple, ThoughtSpot’s products focus on self-service analytics, primarily — with a dash of AI and machine learning thrown in for good measure.
What Mode brings to the table is a complementary product set, then. Nair sees the acquisition creating “new ways” for ThoughtSpot customers to provide value to data teams, for example enabling them to create analytics applications and modeled or visualized data in Mode that can then be served up through ThoughtSpot’s dashboards.
“For too long, data teams have been held back by the last generation of archaic data visualization tools like Tableau that forced them to endlessly tweak and update dashboards,” Nair said in a press release. “Whether you want to be code-free for your business users or code-first for your analytics engineers, now is the time to rethink business intelligence if you want to maximize value from your investments in the modern data stack.”
ThoughtSpot’s acquisition, along with other big exits in the big data analytics space, could be a sign of consolidation in the sector ahead of tough macroeconomic conditions to come. Also today, Databricks snatched up MosaicML, a startup developing open source AI tools, for $1.3 billion. And a month ago, Snowflake picked up Neeva, a firm that aimed to build out a new approach to search across consumer and enterprise using AI innovations. (The consumer part never took off, and Neeva sold up.)

We’ve officially entered a new era of ‘cultivated’ meat production,Christine Hall,2023/06/21,"
U.S. regulators met another alternative protein milestone Wednesday when they approved both Upside Foods and Good Meat to sell their cultivated chicken products within the country.
Known as “cell-cultivated” or “cultured meat,” these proteins are made from animal cells rather than slaughtered animals and are often developed using a fermentation process involving bioreactors.
Upside Foods and Good Meat, both based in California, will now be able to serve their food, initially in restaurants. Upside has already taken its first restaurant order and will provide limited quantities to Bar Crenn in San Francisco, while Good Meat has a partnership with a restaurant in Washington, DC, run by chef and owner José Andrés.
Today’s approval follows the U.S. Department of Agriculture last week approving the way both companies were going to label their products.
Both companies also received a grant of inspection from the USDA, Upside for its engineering, production, and innovation center, and Good Meat for its demonstration plant in Alameda, along with its contract manufacturing partner, JOINN Biologics. The inspection process includes examination of facilities and equipment; standard operating procedure for sanitation; and the systematic approach to identification, evaluation and control of food safety hazards, according to Good Meat.

Upside’s cell-cultured chicken is first to receive FDA blessing for its production method

Prior to today, Singapore was the only country allowing sales of cultivated chicken. Good Meat was the first company to get approval to sell its cultivated chicken product there and received a U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance in March, joining Upside Foods as the only two companies to move to that next stage of commercializing their products in the U.S.
Cultivated meat is a complex process that traditionally is expensive and takes time. There’s also consumer tastes involved. In addition to Singapore and the U.S., some regions, like the United Kingdom, are supporting this industry, while others (e.g., Italy) are questioning it.
Globally, there are dozens of companies not far behind in getting cultivated, or cell-cultured, meat products on the market, and following today’s announcement, we will likely see more companies fast-track their products through the regulatory process. In the U.S., companies have to receive approval from both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the USDA before commercializing their products in this country.
Despite the challenges, some venture capitalists investing in the space remain confident. SOSV/IndieBio general partner Po Bronson said via email that the new approvals were “great for the cell-cultivated meat sector.” He explained that much of the “cell-cultivated products coming to market are hybrid products” and that “as cell-cultivated meat grows, this will shape and alter the alternative protein sector, impacting who aggregates and who gets aggregated, where only companies with genuine technological advancements will survive and become part of the larger supply chain. Needless to say, the days of just buying some pea protein, an extruder, some vegetable oil and some methylcellulose — and hoping to print money — are long gone.”
He also noted that the cultivated meat industry is shifting, and it will be difficult for new startups to compete against early companies that have scaled, saying, “We’ve seen some acquisitions but not high value ones. More money will flow, absolutely, but only to companies who can demonstrate their technology is meaningfully different and not imitative or interchangeable. Those are the companies to watch.”
Meanwhile, in a TechCrunch+ investor survey last week, the investors specifically discussed companies working with the U.S. government.
One investor, Johnny Ream, partner at Stray Dog Capital, noted that his firm encourages portfolio companies to engage with regulators early and be transparent in their process.
“Having that open dialogue is critical to identify regulatory risk factors that might be present and should inform the product development strategy,” Ream said. “Without that engagement will be a greater chance of significant regulatory barriers and/or regulator education as a company approaches market entry.”

VCs remain confident alternative protein has a real future despite public-market woes

Dear Sophie,
I’m in the U.S. on an H-1B visa, but I want to leave my current job and pursue a couple of startup ideas: One with a few friends, and the other on my own. 
Do I need to get two separate visas to work at both companies at the same time? Can I transfer my H-1B to one or both companies?
— Energetic Entrepreneur
Dear Energetic,
Wow! Founding two startups and bringing them both to fruition will certainly keep you busy! I admire your drive and applaud you for your gusto and determination!
Let’s first provide some context on work visas versus work permits, and then offer up a few suggestions and alternatives.
Work visas vs. work permits
A work visa, such as the H-1B specialty occupation visa and the O-1A extraordinary ability visa, enables its holder to temporarily live in the U.S. and work only in the engagements included on the original visa petition, Form I-129.
Certain categories of people, such as F-1 students, some dependent spouses of work visa holders, and people pursuing green cards, may be eligible to apply for a work permit that is not tied to any specific employer. (Examples include F-1 OPT, F-1 STEM OPT, E-2 and L-1 spouses, and individuals who have been approved for a green card and have a pending Form I-485, the Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status.) Also known as an Employment Authorization Document (EAD), a work permit provides proof of authorization to work in the U.S. and enables its holder to get a job or jobs.
Compared to a work visa, an EAD offers wide flexibility to entrepreneurs and founders. That’s one reason we often ask our married entrepreneur clients whether their spouse is eligible for a work visa that offers an EAD to a dependent spouse.
H-1B transfer and concurrent H-1Bs
You can transfer your H-1B from your current employer to another employer for part-time or full-time work. You can also hold two or more concurrent H-1Bs from different employers at the same time.
Although an H-1B visa petition is tied to a specific job with a specific employer, there are no limits on the number of H-1B jobs an individual can hold and no standard minimum — or maximum—number of hours a person can work in any given H-1B position.
Since you’re currently on an H-1B — and already went through the annual H-1B lottery process — you can transfer your H-1B to another company and avoid having to go through the lottery process again. However, you should keep in mind that the maximum stay allowed under an H-1B visa is typically six years unless you apply for a green card.
So, if you’ve been inside the U.S. on H-1B status for a cumulative period of four years, transferring your H-1B to your startups would mean you can live and work in the U.S. for two more years in this status.
H-1B transfers and concurrent H-1Bs can be tricky, particularly for early-stage startups, so it’s important to create a compliant foundation for immigration sponsorship. You will need to structure your startups so that they are eligible to sponsor you for a position and that clear lines are drawn between the two startup entities. I recommend you work with both a corporate attorney and an immigration attorney. "
Quick commerce startup Getir plans to exit France amid regulatory issues,Romain Dillet,2023/06/21,"
In a press release sent to AFP, Getir has announced that it plans to exit France. As a reminder, Getir pioneered the concept of quick commerce. Those services allow you to order groceries without picking a delivery slot. Instead, companies like Getir start working on your order right away and can usually deliver your groceries in less than 30 minutes.
Originally from Turkey, Getir is one of the biggest players in this relatively new space. At the height of the instant grocery bubble, Getir reached a valuation of $11.8 billion and expanded to several European countries. Quick commerce requires some steep upfront costs as companies need to build a network of dark stores in big cities so that customers live just a few minutes away from the nearest dark store.
But funding dried up and many quick commerce startups couldn’t reach profitability in time. That’s why Getir acquired Gorillas in late 2022. Gorillas itself had already acquired Frichti, a French startup that delivered both ready-to-eat meals and groceries.
“The complex legal environment and regulations imposed by local authorities made the company’s success very difficult,” a Getir spokesperson told AFP in a statement. In particular, in March, the French government decided that dark stores should be considered as warehouses — not stores. This way, local governments can decide whether they allow warehouses in city centers or not.
It’s unclear what’s going to happen next. While Getir says that it plans to exit the French market altogether, the company has also filed for bankruptcy. Court-appointed administrators are still looking for another company that would be willing to take over some of Getir’s activities in France. In the meantime, Getir’s 1,800 employees in France don’t know if they’ll have a job in a few weeks as it depends on the result of this bankruptcy process.
Flink, one of Getir’s competitors, has also filed for bankruptcy in France. Flink had previously snapped up its French competitor Cajoo.
As for Gopuff, the company has already left the country in January. In other words, it sounds like the entire instant grocery delivery industry is disappearing in France… quick commerce indeed.

Databricks is proof that strong unicorns can grow their way out of a market correction,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/21,"
Databricks recently revealed that it recorded revenue of more than $1 billion in the financial year ended January 31. The company also said it grew more than 60% last year and its data warehousing product crossed the $100 million annual recurring revenue (ARR) threshold in April.
Databricks has always grown quickly, so it’s not surprising to hear that it has surpassed new revenue milestones, but these numbers are impressive even though we’ve been tracking this company for a while.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

Databricks reached ARR of $600 million when it raised a massive round in August 2021, reached $800 million in ARR at the end of 2021, and last August, crossed the $1 billion ARR threshold. However, as ARR is more of a forward-looking metric, the fact that Databricks managed to generate a full billion dollars in revenue is indeed a feat.
Today, we’re nearly half-a-year behind the company’s actual growth curve. Since Databricks saw revenue of $1 billion last year, it must have closed the year with higher ARR, and it has grown for nearly two quarters since then. It’s not easy to nail down how much revenue the company would be making today, but that’s not going to stop us from having a little fun with big numbers.
Databricks has been in the news lately for other reasons as well. Last month, it acquired Okera, a data governance platform with a focus on AI, and Bloomberg recently reported it bought Rubicon, a startup focused on data storage for AI-related work. Given that Databricks deals with corporate data, it makes sense that it is working with AI-related data services — in fact, the company open-sourced its own LLM in April.
But that’s all related to product. Today, we’re just talking about revenue, growth and how close Databricks is to harmonizing its private-market worth with what the public markets might afford it. Spoiler: The fact that it is deep in the AI trenches is not going to hurt its path to an eventual IPO, even if CEO Ali Ghodsi is in no hurry to go public.
The path to $1 billion
Rewinding through all our Databricks financial coverage takes a moment, but it’s worth our time. Here’s a rundown of what we have learned through time: "
20SALES closes $5M inaugural fund to invest in early-stage B2B SaaS startups,Dominic-Madori Davis,2023/06/21,"
20SALES, a venture capital fund led by eight women, said it has closed its $5 million inaugural fund, which it will invest mainly in early-stage, business-to-business SaaS companies.
The newly launched fund is an offshoot of venture firm 20VC, which was founded by Harry Stebbings, but it is a separate vehicle entirely. The fund plans to write checks of $100,000 and above for pre-seed, seed and Series A companies. It currently does not have any reserves for follow-on investments and instead will optimize for ownership on the first check.
The fund hopes to invest in at least 50 companies over the next two years. Although the focus of the fund is not just to solely back women, it hopes to focus its efforts there when possible.
20SALES’ founding partners are Jessica Arnold, Stevie Case, Kelly Bray, Liat Bycel, Kim Graves, Renu Gupta, Maggie Hott and Lauren Schwartz. All will be staying at their jobs and working at this fund part-time.
Stebbings, as a limited partner and advisor to the fund, managed its fundraising process and said the capital came from the LPs of 20VC. “They rarely do first-time funds, if ever,” he said of his own LP base. “However, they immediately saw the unique positioning of the fund and the immense quality of the partnership. Given both these elements, it took a very short time to raise.”
Other LPs include Harvard Management Company and Stewart Butterfield.
Speaking to TechCrunch, Hott said the fund hopes to inspire the next generation of women investors and have a material impact on the number of women operators in the space.
The fund also aims to help build a founder community for women. Female entrepreneurs receive less than 3% of all VC funds allocated in any given year. “We want to fund more of them,” Hott said. “Simple.”

Danti uses natural language processing to make searching Earth data simple,Aria Alamalhodaei,2023/06/21,"
Commercial and defense organizations have an Earth data overload problem: They collect vast amounts of heavily siloed data, with few ways to quickly synthesize insights and deliver them to the people who most need it.
Danti, a startup emerging from stealth today with $2.75 million in funding, wants to solve this problem with a powerful natural language search engine for location-based data. This should enable non-experts to quickly sort through huge amounts of diverse data and find the answers they need.
The search engine could completely change how location-based data is used and understood. On its website, Danti provides a number of possible queries an end user could pose. These span the mundane queries of an insurance underwriter (“What are the risks for property at 2340 River Bend Rd.”), to the more urgent questions of a warfighter (“battle damage assessment in Irpin in last 48 hours”).
The startup is headed by Jesse Kallman, whose career has spanned unmanned aerial systems, satellite data and geospatial intelligence. He eventually landed at Airbus, where he led a new business unit focused on developing geospatial market software, before moving to autonomous aviation startup Xwing, where he was VP of commercialization and strategy.
“I’ve learned the same lessons over and over and over again,” he said. “It was never about the drone, it was never about the satellite. It was always about, ‘what is the question that the user is trying to answer, and how do you get the right information [to them] based on what it is?’”
The solution to the problem, he says, is in the search layer. Just as the first search engines revolutionized the ability for the non-expert to find useful information online, Danti could similarly unlock Earth data end users — so its founder hopes, anyway.
“That’s where we were really inspired and what we really want to try to accomplish,” Kallman said. “How can you build something just purely at the search layer, not going into […] the really nitty-gritty geospatial work, for the [National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency] analyst or even better, the downstream deployed army user who’s just trying to answer a simple question about a property?”
To accelerate development of the search engine technology, Danti closed a $2.75 million pre-seed funding round led by Tech Square Ventures with participation from Radius Capital. The round also included Philip Krim and Raven One Ventures, SpaceVC, Overline, Tareyton Ventures, Jordan Noone, Keith Masback and Jeff Crusey.
Danti’s team stands at less than 15 people and is scarcely four months old, but the startup is moving fast. In April, Danti won an open challenge from the National Security Innovation Network, which asked competitors to pitch solutions to reduce the time-intensive data search process for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. Kallman said the follow-on feedback from NGA, as well as commercial customers, through the open challenge and other beta testing has been “incredible.”
“That’s where we are at this stage. It’s really, really getting deep with many different types of users to really understand what’s valuable to them.”

BetterBrand’s new dough raises company’s valuation to over $170M,Christine Hall,2023/06/21,"
BetterBrand, a food tech company known for creating “The Better Bagel,” closed on $6 million of Series A capital at a pre-money valuation of $170 million.
The company, citing Crunchbase data, also touts that the raise puts founder Aimee Yang among just 150 solo female founders to raise a Series A over $5 million from institutional investors and to achieve that valuation.
“The valuation reflects a combination of our growth, product differentiation, innovative technology and large-scale market potential,” Yang told TechCrunch via email. “There is a tremendous $10-plus trillion market that is largely untapped, for us to be able to dominate. With the results we have achieved at an unprecedented scale and speed, our vision to design the future of food is already being actualized — at this point, our biggest challenge is a race against the clock. We want to get there as quickly as possible to build the brand, and deliver on consumer demand.”
Founded in 2021, BetterBrand’s proprietary “grain-changing” technology combines non-GMO and clean label ingredients to create a line of better-for-you baked goods. For example, the company has created the traditionally carb-heavy bagel into “the net carb equivalent of two banana slices,” with “The Better Bagel” featuring 250% more protein, 90% fewer carbs and no added sugar.
In the past two years, the company has created new bagel flavors, most recently launching “The Pretzel” and “The Sesame.” Other flavors include  “The Classic,” “The Everything,” “The Cinnamon” and “The Chocolate Chip.” BetterBrand is also getting into new categories, and Yang expects to triple the SKU count by the end of this year with the launch of 16 new products.
The products have caught on with consumers. First starting as a direct-to-consumer offering, the products can now be found in more than 1,000 stores in the United States, including Whole Foods, Sprouts, Fresh Market, Gelson’s and Bristol Farms.

Between 2021 and 2022, the company saw over 800% growth, and in late 2022, Yang said BetterBrand “drove more than $1 million in gross sales at Whole Foods Market alone during our first five months on shelves.”
The company is on track to see a similar increase between 2022 and 2023, which is why Yang said it was a good opportunity to go after additional funding.
“Investors can see our results,” Yang said. “Our velocities on shelf have organically outperformed our best-case estimates. Product market fit had been proven, and the foundation had been laid out, so it was a good time to start adding fuel to drive additional innovation and distribution.”
The Series A gives the company nearly $10 million in total venture-backed funding to date. Verso Capital led the new round and was joined by existing investors, including Gaingels Fund, Seven Seven Six, Craft Lane and a group of individual investors, including Cruise founder and CEO Kyle Vogt, Chris Hollod and Jeff and Glenne Azoff. Existing investors Sean Thomas, of the Wendy’s family, and actors Patrick Schwarzenegger and Emmy Rossum, were part of BetterBrand’s earlier fund raises in 2021.
Meanwhile, the company is focused on growth, so the funds will be used to expand into new markets across North America and Europe and on continued innovation and product development poised to begin rolling out in coming months, Yang said.
Investors are also eager to see what’s next. Vogt said in a written statement that, “Aimee Yang is an incredible entrepreneur and a solid operator. Her company offers life-changing, clean, functional products for those who previously felt they had to give up some of their favorite foods to fit their nutritional needs. It’s an exciting journey to be a part of.”

Notarize launches Proof to ensure safe online transactions,Catherine Shu,2023/06/21,"
Notarize, the world’s largest online notary network, is launching Proof, a new company and platform for digital identity verifications. Beginning in August, Notarize’s business tools will be rebranded to Proof, and it is also changing its company name to Proof. Notarize will continue serving its online notary network, which is used by companies like Adobe and FedEx, and the two brands and platforms will exist side-by-side, said founder Patrick Kinsel.
Created in response to the rise in online transactions, Proof is an enterprise-grade platform, designed to serve large banks and real estate companies. It will continue to have all the main components of Notarize’s online notary service, which has been used by millions of users to process transactions like real estate e-closings, vehicle bills of sales and documents like affidavits of identity and power of attorneys. What’s new in Proof is an identity-assured transaction management platform meant to address gaps in online identity verification.
Some examples of the services it offers include verification identity using biometric tech (for example, scanning selfies to make sure they match ID photos), 24/7 human verification of identity and signature verification to ensure that the person signing is who they actually say they are. Proof also looks out for fraud risk in each transaction, the same way credit cards are monitored. For example, if a signature looks like it might be forged, Proof flags it for review.

Proof monitors fraud signals with a risk score based on data like location, device fingerprint, carrier network and prior rejections. All of its transactions are protected with encryption and are NIST IAL-2 compliant, and will be AATL compliant later this year. NIST is the National Institute for Science and Technology and it publishes standards used by government agencies and industries. For example, the National Highway Transportation Administration requires an IAL2 standard for electronic auto sales, which means consumers must provide a combination of identity evidence.
AATL, meanwhile, is the Adobe Approved Trust List, which dictates how PDF documents are cryptographically signed. Kinsel said that by meeting this, Proof will the first platform whose documents are tied to a valid legal identity in accordance with Adobe’s standards. “Our vision is that everything should be cryptographically signed with identity and Acrobat is the trusted reader to instantly confirm the authenticity of every action online,” he added.
If a signer fails to pass Proof’s digital safeguard for automated verification, they will be matched with one of Notarize’s more than 4,000 notaries to complete the document and transaction.
Kinsel told TechCrunch that Proof’s ability to confirm identity and flag risk leverages Notarize’s innovation in identity verification, including its ability to verify photo IDs like driver licenses and passports, present identity challenge questions, perform biometric selfie verification and confirm data attributes from information like consumer addresses and phone numbers. “When we swipe a credit card we know it’s being protected with active fraud monitoring and Proof will deliver the same for the agreements we enter,” he said.
Some examples of how Proof can be used include securing the seller in a real estate transaction, who don’t require notarization but are still at risk with only a basic e-signature, Kinsel said. Proof is also being used by the retirement industry to protect large withdrawals from fraud, and in the auto industry to notarize forms in some states and meet IAL2 standards elsewhere.
Since its launch in 2015, Notarize has been adopted by 2,200 companies, including First American, iPostal, Guaranteed Rate, Salesforce, SimpleNexus, SnapDocs, USAA and Zillow. Notarize says that almost 80% of those transactions were identity affirmations, as e-signatures are becoming increasing targets for fraud as online agreements become more common. Proof was created to expand Notarize’s services beyond notarization and create verifications of consumer identity with each transaction that it says are impossible to forge.
Notarize raised a $130 million Series D in 2021, at a valuation of more than $760 million, which it used to build Proof. Its investors include Camber Creek, Polaris Ventures and Realogy.

A whistleblower raised safety concerns about OceanGate’s submersible in 2018. Then he was fired.,Mark Harris,2023/06/20,"
The director of marine operations at OceanGate, the company whose submersible went missing Sunday on an expedition to the Titanic in the North Atlantic, was fired after raising concerns about its first-of-a-kind carbon fiber hull and other systems before its maiden voyage, according to a filing in a 2018 lawsuit first reported by Insider and New Republic.
David Lochridge was terminated in January 2018 after presenting a scathing quality control report on the vessel to OceanGate’s senior management, including founder and CEO Stockton Rush, who is on board the missing vessel.
According to a court filing by Lochridge, the preamble to his report read: “Now is the time to properly address items that may pose a safety risk to personnel. Verbal communication of the key items I have addressed in my attached document have been dismissed on several occasions, so I feel now I must make this report so there is an official record in place.”
The report detailed “numerous issues that posed serious safety concerns,” according to the filing. These included Lochridge’s worry that “visible flaws” in the carbon fiber supplied to OceanGate raised the risk of small flaws expanding into larger tears during “pressure cycling.” These are the huge pressure changes that the submersible would experience as it made its way and from the deep ocean floor. He noted that a previously tested scale model of the hull had “prevalent flaws.”
Carbon fiber composites can be stronger and lighter than steel, making a submersible naturally buoyant. But they can also be prone to sudden failure under stress. The hull that Lochridge was writing about was made by Spencer Composites, the only company to have previously made a carbon fiber hull for a manned submersible. (That submersible was commissioned by explorer Steve Fossett for a record-breaking dive, but he died in a light aircraft crash before it could be used.)
Lochridge’s recommendation was that non-destructive testing of the Titan’s hull was necessary to ensure a “solid and safe product.” The filing states that Lochridge was told that such testing was impossible, and that OceanGate would instead rely on its much touted acoustic monitoring system.
The company claims this technology, developed in-house, uses acoustic sensors to listen for the tell-tale sounds of carbon fibers in the hull deteriorating to provide “early warning detection for the pilot with enough time to arrest the descent and safely return to surface.”
Lochridge, however, worried in the lawsuit that the system would not reveal flaws until the vessel was descending, and then might only provide “milliseconds” of warning before a catastrophic implosion.

OceanGate plans an expedition to 3D scan the Titanic

Russell McDuff, a veteran oceanographer and chairman of OceanGate’s scientific and research foundation for three years, noted that contact with the Titan was lost on Sunday after only an hour and 45 minutes. “This suggests to me that they might have still been in the water column, descending to the Titanic,” told TechCrunch in a phone interview.
Lochridge also strongly encouraged OceanGate to have a classification agency, such as the American Bureau of Shipping, inspect and certify the Titan.
A day after filing his report, Lochridge was summoned to a meeting with Rush and company’s human resources, engineering and operations directors. There, the filing states, he was also informed that the manufacturer of the Titan’s forward viewport would only certify it to a depth of 1,300 meters due to OceanGate’s experimental design. The filing states that OceanGate refused to pay for the manufacturer to build a viewport that would meet the Titan’s intended depth of 4,000 meters. The Titanic lies about 3,800 meters below the surface.
The filing also claims that hazardous flammable materials were being used within the submersible.
At the end of the meeting, after saying that he would not authorize any manned tests of Titan without a scan of the hull, Lochridge was fired and escorted from the building.
Lochridge, who claimed he was discharged in retaliation for being a whistleblower, made his filing after OceanGate sued him in federal court in Seattle that June. OceanGate has accused him of sharing confidential information with two individuals, as well as with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). In the lawsuit, OceanGate characterized Lochridge’s report as false, and  accused him of committing fraud by manufacturing a reason to be fired.
The lawsuit was settled in November 2018. Neither OceanGate nor Lochridge responded to requests for comment. OSHA could not immediately provide details of the alleged report. A routine OSHA inspection of OceanGate in 2021 found only three minor workplace safety violations resulting in no financial penalties.
A few months after Lochridge’s dismissal, the company published a blog post that laid out its reasons for not having Titan certified by the American Bureau of Shipping or a similar organization.
 “The vast majority of marine (and aviation) accidents are a result of operator error, not mechanical failure,” it reads. “As a result, simply focusing on classing the vessel does not address the operational risks. Maintaining high-level operational safety requires constant, committed effort and a focused corporate culture – two things that OceanGate takes very seriously and that are not assessed during classification.”
In 2019, Rush gave an interview to Smithsonian magazine, in which he said: “There hasn’t been an injury in the commercial sub industry in over 35 years. It’s obscenely safe, because they have all these regulations. But it also hasn’t innovated or grown—because they have all these regulations.”
Following Lochridge’s departure, the Titan was tested safely on increasingly deep dives, including to 4,000 meters in the Bahamas. However, it seems one of Lochridge’s concerns would soon be borne out. In January 2020, Rush gave an interview to GeekWire in which he admitted that the Titan’s hull “showed signs of cyclic fatigue.” Because of this, the hull’s depth rating had been reduced to 3,000 meters. “Not enough to get to the Titanic,” Rush said.
During 2020 and 2021, the Titan’s hull was either repaired or rebuilt by two Washington state companies, Electroimpact and Janicki Industries, that largely work in aerospace. In late 2021, the Titan made its first trip down to the wreck of the Titanic.
Spencer Composites says that the Titan was not using its carbon fiber hull on Sunday’s dive. Presumably apart from the hull work, one source familiar with the company told TechCrunch that not much with Titan had changed at all since 2018.
At the time of publication, the Titan remains missing, with Rush, French diver Paul-Henri Nargeolet, British billionaire Hamish Harding, Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son reportedly on board. A massive search and rescue operation is underway.
“They’re doing everything that they logically can,” McDuff said. “But I’m a little pessimistic because of the amount of time that’s gone by.”

Tiger Global’s search for liquidity illustrates how busted the late-stage market is,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/20,"
The late-stage market is whacked. You only need to look at how Tiger Global Management, previously one of the most active investors in all of startup-dom, has failed to find a buyer for a large basket of its stakes in private tech companies.
The fact that Tiger did not, as PitchBook wrote, find a buyer for “a percentage of its stakes in about 30 companies [packaged in a] strip sale” implies the issue here was that Tiger did not find a buyer willing to pay however much it wanted for those stakes.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

LPs in venture funds put their money into an aggregated pool that is then used by the venture firm to purchase a number of stakes in a variety of companies. The difference between an LP in a new fund and Tiger, which is looking to sell a wide swath of stakes, is that the traditional LP can’t know where its pledged capital will end up.
Tiger, on the other hand, reportedly was looking to sell a basket of its stakes to what we presume is a similar customer base. Its failing to find a buyer for that collection implies that, in this case, more information is not helping move those shares.
PitchBook reports that Tiger is now looking to sell individual stakes in some of its portfolio companies to generate liquidity. Other investors are also struggling to sell collections of stakes, but they’re not seeing bids either, the report said.
Oof.
Tiger did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In the race for dominance in the AI travel industry, even a small lead matters right now.
Every player in the space trying to capitalize on the promise of new AI/LLM (large language model) technologies is struggling with the fact that major platforms like ChatGPT are limited by data that is outdated or not real time. In an industry like travel, where fickle plans and itineraries literally change with the weather, this is particularly problematic.
As both investors in AI travel and advisors coordinating deals for startups in this space with other investors, we like to see companies pushing boundaries and providing value for users in new, concrete ways.
For instance, Kayak and Expedia have launched ChatGPT plugins, but GuideGeek from travel publisher Matador Network provides real-time flight data (GP Bullhound has provided financial advisory services to Matador Network). Meanwhile, Roam Around has a strong visual element to its interface.
But travel information is complex, and incorrect information — or AI “hallucinations” — are a challenge. Roam Around sometimes recommends one site while showing a photo of another (and potentially linking to a third), and in one of our queries, GuideGeek conjured a cleverly named pub that simply doesn’t exist.
 

			Other than Airbnb, there really hasn’t been a major shift in how we plan and book travel online in decades.					


At this early stage, our firm and other investors in the space we work with don’t have an expectation of perfection. The advances between GPT-3 and GPT-4 are so apparent that it’s easy enough to look at the underlying technology and say, “Eh, they’ll figure it out.”
We’re more focused on how companies are shaping and augmenting this technology for travelers and the market segments within the travel industry they are positioned to capture.
Differentiation is key — you need more than a skin for ChatGPT
Most AI products seem to be built on ChatGPT. While each travel company may start with the same baseline, we really like to see proprietary data that can train the AI to produce superior outputs. OTAs (online travel agencies) like Expedia and Booking.com have an advantage here with massive amounts of information about their customers and how people plan and book trips.
Small agile teams have an opportunity to adopt this technology and rapidly scale up before the big guys can effectively implement or risk disrupting their existing business. If consumers can use an AI tool to search all airlines instantly, why does an OTA need to be in the loop?
The OTAs are built on recommending what the masses want, but the whole point of AI is that the answer is now customized to the individual. An average ranking of 8 for a hotel doesn’t apply to a specific person whose main priority is to be close to a lesser-known local surf spot an AI surfaced for them.
To try to drive utilization, startup players have to get more creative with product design. Getaiway and Roam Around have focused specifically on itineraries, with the latter simplifying the user input down to one word — type in a place and get an itinerary, then refine from there. Matador says it plans to include influencer videos from its wide range of content creators in the GuideGeek messaging interface. "
"Shaquille O’Neal will discuss investing in Edsoma, life as a mogul and more at Disrupt",Lauren Simonds,2023/06/20,"
Talk about a slam dunk. Shaquille O’Neal, 15-time NBA All-Star, four-time NBA Champion and three-time NBA Finals MVP, will join us at TC Disrupt 2023, which takes place September 19-21.
Following nearly two decades in the NBA, Shaq has built an estimated $400 million business empire — moving easily from superstar to mogul. He’ll join us in his role as lead investor in Edsoma, an AI-powered reading, education and communication platform for children. Kyle Wallgren, the company’s founder and CEO, will also take part in this fireside chat.
A committed advocate for children’s literacy, O’Neal has participated in charity basketball events and founded the Shaquille O’Neal Foundation to support underserved youth. It’s not surprising to find him adding edtech to his portfolio, but we’re eager to hear why he chose Edsoma. 
Wallgren is a visionary leader committed to making a positive impact through his work, with the ultimate mission to stamp out illiteracy around the world. As a parent, he experienced the challenges of Covid-related school closures, and he founded Edsoma to help parents instill the love of reading in their children and as a way to address decreased reading performance brought on by the pandemic. 
The app helps children learn correct pronunciation as they read aloud, and it also lets parents read with their children from any location — think parents who live separately or travel for work, deployed military personnel or far-flung grandparents.
A bona fide business mogul — Shaq earned his MBA in 2005 —  O’Neal has invested in companies like Google, Apple and Ring. He’s the second-largest individual shareholder of Authentic Brands Group, and he owns multiple franchising storefronts, including Big Chicken, Papa Johns, Krispy Kreme and many other entrepreneurial ventures.
Kyle Wallgren is a successful entrepreneur with a proven track record of building and selling multiple small businesses. He has sold 10 of the 13 companies he’s launched. 
We look forward to learning what qualities Shaq looks for in a founder and how he and Wallgren plan to grow and scale the company.

Jane Technologies launches innovative point-of-sale platform for cannabis dispensaries,Matt Burns,2023/06/20,"
Jane Technologies today announced the launch of its new point-of-sale (POS) platform that it says will improve the overall cannabis shopping experience with reliable online listings and in-store curated shopping recommendations.
Everyone knows the pain. You find your favorite strain on your dispensary’s online menu, only to go to the shop and discover it’s out of stock. You can either pick another strain at random or rely on the questionable advice of the local budtender. Jane’s new POS system aims to change that bummer of a situation, and it’s using its massive e-commerce data catalog to tackle in-store retail.
The new POS integrates with Jane Technologies’ existing e-commerce and advertising solutions product lines. The company started by building the back end for dispensaries’ e-commerce operations. To Jane Technologies, the future of cannabis isn’t a single destination like Amazon; the future of cannabis is the neighborhood dispensary that sells weed online. Jane wants to power their online store — and now the company wants to power their brick-and-mortar locations, too.
Jane’s POS platform includes a debit card payment system, custom hardware, and a personalized shopping experience. But the secret sauce comes from Jane Technologies’ long dedication to providing clean data assets. The company already tracks 1.5 million SKUs, and when new products are launched (or old products modified), Jane’s system pushes the data to its customer base. Shop owners can focus on selling weed while Jane’s platform does the heavy lifting around inventory management.
This new system provides dispensaries with a deep level of customer personalization. As Jane Technologies’ CEO Socrates Rosenfeld explained to me, the regulation around cannabis presents retailers with a unique opportunity. Before entering a dispensary, shoppers must scan their government-issued ID, and suddenly, the retailer knows who’s shopping and what they like to purchase. Jane’s new POS takes advantage of this process, and the system serves the budtender with a list of products previously purchased by the customer and a list of recommended products backed by verified reviews.
“In-store displays can be curated specifically for you,” Rosenfeld said. “Think about the Budtender who will know your preferences and purchase history, and they can recommend more curated personal items.”
This system has long been a staple of online e-commerce, including on Jane Technologies’ e-commerce platform, but now the same platform works in a retail environment that depends heavily on recommendations.
Jane Technologies says integrating the platform with a dispensary’s inventory takes just a couple of hours. They say competitors can take weeks to complete a transition because of the work associated with exporting important product information, imagery, and government tracking IDs.
The system also allows for stand-alone, vending machine–type kiosks that are designed for speed and efficiency, allowing customers to browse and purchase products using a large touchscreen instead of speaking with a retail associate.
Jane Technologies has been testing this system at three dozen partners across the Pacific Northwest, New Mexico, California and Colorado. The company expects its new POS platform to be in 400 retail locations by the end of the year.

Oso sees huge opportunity in simplifying authorization for developers,Ron Miller,2023/06/20,"
We all know what authentication is. You enter a username and password or use your face or your fingerprint, and you can access a device or an application, but what you can do with that application or device falls under the realm of authorization, authentication’s close cousin. For years, developers have been forced to build their own authorization tooling, and unless you’re one of the bigger companies, that takes resources that a lot of organizations simply don’t have.
Oso’s mission is to make it easier to add authorization to any application. “Authorization is a $25 billion market. It’s a problem that every company has to solve. But no one got out of bed to think about it except for my team and me,” company CEO Graham Neray told TechCrunch.
Investors see the same potential, and today the company announced a $15 million round led by Felicis with participation from Sequoia and Harpoon Ventures. While it was at it, the company also announced that a new version of the Oso tooling is now available.
Neray points out that companies like Slack, Google and Airbnb have spent a lot of time and engineering resources building authorization tooling. “The problem is most companies don’t have the resources of a company like Google or Slack, so they limp along. Their systems are terrible and the engineers’ experience is kind of like a Groundhog Day scenario of building these systems over and over again, even though no one wants to. And Oso solves that problem,” he said.
Part of the company’s approach to this is to educate people on the nature of the problem, and how important it is to solve, which has the added benefit of acting as a marketing driver to the open source version of the product, which can in turn lead to sales of the cloud product.
“We’ve also built an extensive library of technical documentation, not specific to Oso, to educate developers on the domain. And as part of that what we’re doing is we’re providing vocabulary and mental models to understand their own authorization problems. So we published a series called Authorization Academy. It’s a series of technical guides on how to build application authorization,” he explained.
In addition to the open source product, which Neray says has been downloaded millions of times, the company added Oso Cloud last year with ARR from that product growing 20% month over month. He says they are doing this without any outbound sales to this point.
“On top of that, our motion is entirely product led and inbound. So what I mean by that is we’re not doing outbound [sales and marketing]. We don’t currently have salespeople, though I’m sure we will in the future. And all of our paid customers started on the free tier, which is no small feat, especially given the microscope under which businesses are being put about how they spend their money and how efficient they are,” Neray said.
And being efficient has meant keeping the company lean with just 13 employees so far. But with the $15 million investment, the startup does plan to start hiring more people this year, and as he does, he is considering how to build a diverse workforce.
“So it starts from the top. It is much more common to find people who are interested in working for a leadership team with which they can identify, and so I think that’s a core part of the strategy,” he said. And that means making sure the leadership team is diverse as the company grows.
As the company puts the additional $15 million in capital to work, Neray is focused on the opportunity he sees in the authorization space.
“I think the combination of the size of the opportunity, and the strength of the business and the growth that we’re seeing is what led the team at Felicis to lead this round. We also have Sequoia who led prior rounds and Harpoon Ventures also participated. That puts our total funding raised over $25 million, which makes us the best capitalized authorization company,” he said.

Diabetes management startup Clivi wants to be ‘Livongo of Latin America’,Christine Hall,2023/06/20,"
Over 422 million people around the world have diabetes, with the World Health Organization noting that the majority of those with the disease are living in low-income and middle-income countries.
In Latin America, there are over 40 million adults with diabetes, according to Statista. And with the global digital health market poised to reach $1.5 trillion in the next seven years, Clivi, a Mexico-based diabetes management startup, wants to help control the disease through its comprehensive, technological and personalized approach to diabetes healthcare delivery.
“In Mexico, there is an average of one endocrinologist per almost 10,000 patients,” Clivi founder and CEO Ricardo Moguel told TechCrunch. “You might see a doctor every three months, but for chronic conditions, patients need to be making decisions every day.”
Clivi is making a balance between humans and technology by connecting patients with endocrinologists, nutritionists and psychologists and enabling users to access monitoring and treatment plans via their communication channel of choice (e.g., WhatsApp) so they can better achieve their treatment goals and adhere to lifestyle changes.
The company also provides all of the supplies, like glucometer, test strips and blood testing kits, as well as medication. Though health plans start at MX$790 per month, the average patient will pay MX$40 per month with private insurance, Moguel said.
He explained that people living with diabetes in Latin America often begin treating their disease late, which can lower their life expectancy by 10 years. Clivi’s goal is to help patients get back four of those years.
Since going live in October 2021, Clivi’s platform has helped thousands of patients so far, 94% of whom have achieved diabetes control within six months, Moguel said. The company is currently seeing an average of 2,000 new patients join the platform each month. It also reached $2 million in annual recurring revenue over the past 15 months, and Moguel expects 10x that growth within the next 12 months.
Over the next five years, the company intends to serve 1 million people through its digital clinic and diabetes remote monitoring service, Moguel said.
Today, it announced $10 million in seed funding toward that goal. The investment was co-led by Dalus Capital and Foundation Capital, with participation from a group of investors, including Cathay Innovation via its C. Entrepreneurs fund; Femsa Ventures; Quiet Capital; 500; Next Billion Ventures; and Conexo. There was also a group of angel investors, including Jüsto founder and CEO Ricardo Weder, Kueski founder and CEO Adalberto Flores, Trust Networks co-founder Suresh Batchu, 99 and Mara founder and CEO Ariel Lambrecht, Meta executive Tara Syed and Reina Madre co-founders Vicente Aristegui and Juan Moctezuma.
The new funding will be used to finish out the product, including its artificial intelligence technology, so that more of the functions are automated and doctors can increase their capacity for treating patients, Moguel said. The company is also going to expand its work with enterprises and public health organizations in Mexico. He expects to “dominate the Mexican market and become the No. 1 diabetes clinic in Mexico within the next year.”
“This will help us to prepare the ground before we start expanding our solution to other Spanish-speaking territories across the region,” Moguel said. “This is the master plan to become not just the Livongo of Latin America, but the largest player in terms of diabetes and chronic conditions in the whole of Latin America.”

"Parrot, an AI-powered transcription platform that turns speech into text, raises $11M Series A",Kate Park,2023/06/20,"
Artificial intelligence touches many aspects of professional industries, including medicine, legal, business, information technology and more. AI-powered transcription service is one example that has become an integral part of those fields.
Parrot, a transcription platform offering speech-to-text depositions for the legal and insurance industry, said Tuesday it has raised $11 million in a Series A round. It also unveiled a new feature that summarizes deposition in mere seconds for legal experts.
Amplify Partners and XYZ Venture Capital co-led the latest capital, bringing its total raised to $14 million since its inception. The company declined to reveal its valuation when asked.
Attorney Eric Baum, his brother Bryan Baum and a team of engineers with expertise in AI and speech-to-text transcription founded Parrot in 2019. Eric, a long-time prosecutor who conducted depositions for the special victims unit of the state attorney’s office of Florida, saw firsthand the shortage of court reporters as demand for the deposition service continues to grow every year. He wanted to streamline the deposition process by using large language models (LLMs), not only for the legal industry but also for other sectors.
“The improvements in LLMs are the next paradigm shift, akin to the internet and mobile,” Amplify Partners general partner Mike Dauber said in a statement.
The CEO of Parrot, Aaron O’Brien, who has been in the tech space for more than 15 years and previously worked at tech firms like Flexport, Uber and Facebook, told TechCrunch that Parrot’s founding team saw an opportunity to bring much-needed technology to the legal industry that has been overlooked and underserved for a long time.
“You’ll often hear that lawyers are resistant to tech, but this hasn’t been our experience,” O’Brien told TechCrunch. “Attorneys are eager to adopt new technologies, but the solutions need to be trustworthy and purpose-built for their workflow.”
O’Brien met the Parrot founding team in 2021, introduced by Parrot’s early investors. The CEO has since helped the AI startup scale a growing deposition provider with global insurance carriers.
Parrot AI’s ultimate goal is to allow users to gather and synthesize information more efficiently in order to achieve better and faster outcomes by leveraging AI.
The startup plans to use the proceeds to ramp up investment in artificial intelligence for the legal and insurance domains and continue developing tools to address the industry’s challenges.
Customers in need of court transcription services typically must call or email a court-reporting vendor and wait days for confirmation, O’Brien said. Parrot lets users book a deposition and secure capacity with one click, and meeting-ready calendar links will be sent to all parties, O’Brien explained.
Another challenge Parrot wants to address is related to deposition review: After a deposition concludes, attorneys must request an expensive transcript, which takes more than ten days to receive. Parrot’s deposition review tools help attorneys access a fully searchable, highly accurate rough draft transcript synced with video and audio, which is one of the company’s highest-value features, O’Brien continued. In addition, Parrot securely stores a comprehensive archive of deposition transcripts, video and audio recordings, and more in its cloud-based platform, he noted.
“At the core of Parrot’s differentiated model is our highly specialized models that are trained extensively on proprietary and domain-specific data,” O’Brien said. “Parrot’s approach is not another enterprise’s solution built on top of generic API — it’s a suite of highly customized models, infrastructure and domain expertise years in the making that offers unprecedented accuracy for legal professionals.”
One customer, Aaron Warner, attorney at Warner & Fitzmartin, described the experience of Parrot as like “going from a Nokia to an iPhone.” According to the startup, once customers begin working with Parrot — from C-suite executives focused on budget and outcomes to the support staff responsible for scheduling depositions — they’re saying there’s no going back.
Hundreds of enterprises’ customers, including law firms, insurance companies, law enforcement and corporations, use Parrot for depositions, witness statements, examinations under oath and more. The outfit didn’t share its business metrics but noted that the four-year-old company generates revenue in the millions.

Hyperline is a billing platform for SaaS products,Romain Dillet,2023/06/20,"
Meet Hyperline, a new product that handles pricing and billing for software-as-a-service companies. The company provides integrations so that you can quickly start billing. It then supports different scenarios, such as recurring subscriptions, usage-based billing, custom discounts and more.
This isn’t the first company that focuses on pricing and billing — examples include Recurly and Chargebee. But these are complex revenue management platforms that don’t necessarily work well for small SaaS startups that are just getting started.
Alternatively, some companies choose to develop these pricing and billing features in house. But B2B software has changed quite a lot with sales negotiation processes and usage-based pricing. It can lead to mistakes.
When you have configured Hyperline, the company handles all things related to revenue. You can import your customer data from your database, configure your pricing rules, connect the platform with your CRM and leverage popular payment providers, such as Stripe or GoCardless.
After that, Hyperline generates invoices directly. It handles different VAT rates — this isn’t a paid add-on like on some platforms. The product then orchestrates payment requests, which means that it can automatically charge a card or a bank account.
Finally, Hyperline provides a monitoring dashboard so that you can see if there is any failed payment. You can also perform billing actions from there.
The startup raised a $4.4 million (€4 million) funding round led by Index Ventures a few months ago. Kima Ventures and Cocoa also participated in the round. Several business angels invested in the company as well, such as Rodolphe Ardant, Guilhem Bellion, Steve Avani, Thibaud Elziere, Quentin Nickmans, Alexandre Berriche and Nico Rosberg.
Iterating on pricing more regularly
By default, tech teams can interact with Hyperline using the company’s API. But “if companies want to configure it and use it in a ‘no-code’ way, they can do so. If you want to tweak your usage-based pricing, you don’t have to through the tech team,” founder Lucas Bédout told me.
And this is key to understanding Hyperline’s appeal. Many SaaS companies define their pricing strategy and then work on the product roadmap. Pricing and product features don’t necessarily evolve at the same time.
“There are discrepancies between pricing and the product team. Pricing is a project that companies do every couple of years. The company brings in consultants and we put everything back in place – it takes six months to a year to implement everything,” Index Ventures partner Julia Andre told me. “But pricing has an impact on acquisition and churn.”
With a product like Hyperline, pricing can become a continuous project. At the same time, Index Ventures is betting on a next-generation pricing and billing startup that could potentially perform better than legacy products.
Dozens of companies are already using the product, such as Gladia, a startup I covered earlier today and is running a usage-based pricing. As Hyperline starts scaling, it will have more data on SaaS revenue strategies and it will be able to make some recommendations to reduce churn, improve the average revenue per customer, etc. And that should also increase Hyperline’s bottom line as the company takes a small cut on each transaction.

"India ordered an investigation into Byju’s days before auditor and board members resigned, report says",Manish Singh,2023/06/22,"
India’s corporate affairs ministry ordered an investigation into edtech startup Byju’s last week, television news channel CNBC-TV18 reported Friday, further complicating matters at the most valuable Indian startup that lost its auditor and three board members on Thursday.
The ministry has taken cognizance of “various corporate governance lapses” at Byju’s, the television channel reported, citing unnamed sources.
The new probe follows the ministry asking Byju’s last year to explain why it hadn’t filed its audited financials. In late April, India’s crime-fighting agency searched three premises of edtech giant Byju’s and its founder Byju Raveendran, it said Saturday, and seized various “incriminating” documents and digital data.
Byju’s attracted intense scrutiny last year from the government, investors and creditors after it repeatedly failed to publish its accounts. In September, Byju’s finally published its accounts for the year ending March 2021, revealing revenue figures that fell short of its own projections.
Global giant Deloitte quit as the auditor of Byju’s and three board members resigned from the startup on Thursday, sending a shockwave through the industry. In a letter to the board on Thursday, Deloitte said that it had not undertaken the auditing of the edtech giant’s accounts for the year ending March 2022 and cited the delay as a reason for its resignation.
The Bengaluru-headquartered startup, also the world’s most valuable education technology company, is grappling with a series of challenges. It refused to make a $40 million payment earlier this month and counter-sued its lenders. Byju’s said its lenders were operating in “bad-faith negotiating tactics.” Lenders allege that Byju’s has technically defaulted on the loan.
The startup is also cutting about 1,000 jobs as it pushes to improve its finances. BlackRock cut Byju’s valuation by nearly two-thirds to $8.4 billion at the end of March this year, TechCrunch first reported.

"Lithuania’s capital Vilnius to get ‘Europe’s largest tech campus,’ costing €100M",Paul Sawers,2023/06/22,"
Lithuania is vying to become one of the major European tech hubs, bolstered by a growing number of so-called “unicorn” startups and governmental efforts to attract a high-profile accelerator to the country. At the same time, a new €100 million private initiative announced today is setting out to create what would be Europe’s largest tech campus, situated in the heart of Lithuania’s capital Vilnius.
Building on the site of an old Soviet-era sewing factory in the city’s New Town, Tech Zity, as the project is called, is touted to open in 2024 with office space for 5,000 workers, auditoriums for meetings and events, and more. In addition, a core selling point will be its focus on hybrid working, with a 24/7 ethos supported by co-living spaces, restaurants and bars for out-of-work socializing.
At 55,000 square metres (592,015 square feet), Tech Zity would be nearly two-thirds bigger than Station F in Paris, which opened back in 2017.
Zity slickers
Lithuania doesn’t always fall on the mainstream tech startup radar, but there has been some notable activity there these past few years. Second-hand clothes marketplace Vinted, for example, hit unicorn status back in 2019, going on to raise some $562 million at a $4.5 billion valuation with notable backers including Accel, Insight Partners and Lightspeed Venture Partners.
Then there’s Nord Security of NordVPN fame, which hit a $1.6 billion valuation last year off the back of its first institutional fundraise from the likes of private equity firm Novator, VC firm General Catalyst and WordPress co-creator Matt Mullenweg. Elsewhere, fledgling Vilnius-based fintech Kevin scooped a $65 million Series A last year from big-name backers including Accel.
To capitalize on this, Lithuania’s Ministry of the Economy and Innovation announced a €13 million open tender back in March to attract an “internationally acclaimed startup accelerator” to the country. So now would seem as good a time as any for the private realm to take up the mantle and build what Tech Zity touts as an “infrastructure first” campus replete with all the amenities a tech company might need.
The Tech Zity project’s funding hails from several sources. Of the planned €100 million fund required to fulfil the project, some €30 million has been committed so far, with Vinted co-founder and chief operating officer Mantas Mikuckas contributing around 80% of the initial tranche and Tech Zity founder Darius Žakaitis making up the remainder. This “primary” phase has involved buying the land and buildings, and laying the groundwork for the reconstruction required to transform the site. For the next phase, Tech Zity is looking to secure the additional €70 million from various sources, including banks and private investors.
“Our main goal is to foster the startup community,” Žakaitis explained to TechCrunch. “Currently, this community is scattered in different locations. Startups and tech companies highly value the opportunity to be together, exchange knowledge and experience. Most of them go through similar stages, face similar challenges and problems, such as growth hacking and bootstrapping with limited budgets, entering larger markets, leveraging AI capabilities, attracting investments and developing funds and more. The best answers to these questions can come from those who have already walked this path and have built successful startups.”
It’s worth noting that the “Tech Zity” brand already exists, as it is the name of the overarching real estate company behind the project which has already launched four smaller hubs across the Lithuanian capital and surrounding area. These include Tech Park, which was converted from an old hospital back in 2016 and is now home to a number of businesses, including Google’s main regional hub; Tech Loft, which is primarily targeted at seed-stage startups; Tech Arts, a hybrid co-working and events space; and Tech Spa, a work-resort crossover about an hour away from Vilnius.
Collectively, Tech Zity’s four existing locations amount to some 20,000 square meters, meaning that with its eponymous flagship campus opening next year, Tech Zity’s sprawling footprint will hit the 75,000-square-meters mark across the region.
A “Lithuanian Silicon Valley”
The Tech Zity Vilnius site is located less than two miles from the city center, and just a 10-minute walk from Vinted’s HQ and Nord Security, which recently moved into its new HQ in the new Cyber City complex. At first glance, the two initiatives seem fairly similar; however, Cyber City appears to be centred largely around companies affiliated with Lithuanian incubator and accelerator Tesonet, which helped birth the likes of Nord and Surfshark, which merged last year, as well as startups such as Oxylabs and CyberCare.
“We are not competing,” Žakaitis said. “On the contrary, we will collaborate to make this part of Vilnius a kind of Lithuanian Silicon Valley.”

One of the main goals during the conversion is to upcycle much of the original materials at the site, including adapting old sewing machine parts for chairs and phone booths, and repurposing old ventilation systems for boardroom tables and kitting out new kitchens.

As for living spaces, well, the current plan for Tech Zity Vilnius is to build 70 to 80 co-living loft spaces above the offices.
“These lofts will be designed for both short-term and long-term rentals, as we see the demand for such accommodation,” Žakaitis said. “They will not only serve the needs of companies operating within the project who receive guests, but also contribute to the project’s vitality 24/7. Additionally, we also plan to provide various services for employees and residents, such as a sports club, beauty services, restaurants and more.”
While startups will be a major target market for Tech Zity, it’s ultimately aimed at everyone from individual freelancers who can work from cafes or other shared working spaces, to companies ranging from five to 300 employees.
“We estimate that there are currently 18,000 employees working in Lithuania’s startup ecosystem,” Žakaitis said. “We aim to have a diverse audience that fosters connections within Lithuania’s startup ecosystem and drives the creation of new products. We are also open to and engaged in discussions not only with local companies but also with international companies interested in establishing a presence in Vilnius through the Invest Lithuania program or invited by the Bank of Lithuania, particularly in fintech.”

Inflection debuts its own foundation AI model to rival Google and OpenAI LLMs,Devin Coldewey,2023/06/22,"
Inflection, a well-funded AI startup aiming to create “personal AI for everyone,” has taken the wraps off the large language model powering its Pi conversational agent. It’s hard to evaluate the quality of these things in any way, let alone objectively and systematically, but a little competition is a good thing.
Inflection-1, as the model is called, is of roughly GPT-3.5 (AKA ChatGPT) size and capabilities — as measured in the computing power used to train them. The company claims that it’s competitive or superior with other models on this tier, backing it up with a “technical memo” describing some benchmarks it ran on its model, GPT-3.5, LLaMA, Chinchilla and PaLM-540B.
According to the results they published, Inflection-1 indeed performs well on various measures, like middle- and high school-level exam tasks (think biology 101) and “common sense” benchmarks (things like “if Jack throws the ball on the roof, and Jill throws it back down, where is the ball?”). It mainly falls behind on coding, where GPT-3.5 beats it handily and, for comparison, GPT-4 smokes the competition; OpenAI’s biggest model is well known to have been a huge leap in quality there, so it’s no surprise.
Inflection notes that it expects to publish results for a larger model comparable to GPT-4 and PaLM-2(L), but no doubt they are waiting until the results are worth publishing. At any rate, Inflection-2 or Inflection-1-XL or whatever is in the oven but not quite baked.
So far the community hasn’t formally divided AI models into the machine learning equivalent of boxing weight classes, but the concepts do map to one another quite well. You don’t expect a flyweight to go up against a heavyweight, they’re practically different sports. Same with AI models: a small one isn’t as capable as a large one, but the small one runs efficiently on a phone while the large one requires a data center. It’s an apples to oranges thing.
It’s still too early to attempt such a thing, since the field is still comparatively young and there’s no real consensus on what sizes and shapes of AI model should be considered of a feather.
Ultimately for most of these models the proof of the pudding is in the tasting, of course, and until Inflection opens up its model to widespread use and independent evaluation, all its vaunted benchmarks must be taken with a grain of salt. If you want to give Pi a shot, you can just add it on one of your messaging apps, or chat with it online here.

Falling into these 3 traps means you will never raise VC funding,Haje Jan Kamps,2023/06/22,"
Over the years, I’ve spoken with a quite a few startup founders. Many of them are smart, likable and have really great ideas that they’re able to convey in a pitch deck. Yet many of them struggle to get funded. Why is it so hard to get a term sheet?
If everything seems to be going well, but you’re not getting the traction you think you need for your fundraise, it’s probably because you’ve run into one of these three problems.
The market is too small
There are a number of incredibly cool products that just don’t have a market that’s big enough for general adoption. For example, it’s possible that you are building an accessory that makes crop-dusting fields 30% more efficient. On the surface, this may seem like a good product in a great market. The people who want to buy your product are excited about it, and you make sales pretty easily.
The problem, however: There are only so many crop-dusting planes in the world, which means that once you’ve reached market saturation — that is, every crop-dusting plane in the world is using your product — you are unlikely to make additional sales.
Crop dusting is obviously niche, but there are less obvious examples, too.
I recently spoke with a founder who had a really elegant solution for how to help people optimize their meal planning so the produce in the fridge that goes bad the soonest gets eaten first. On the surface, it’s an important problem: Reducing food waste is objectively good. The founders had spoken to a lot of potential customers, and everybody agreed — food waste is a problem, and they would love to have a solution. The pitfall was that the startup hadn’t asked its customers what they were willing to pay for the product. It turns out that this was a $100 piece of hardware, and that was the problem: The Venn diagram showing people who care enough about the problem to spend $100 on a piece of equipment to fix it and didn’t just throw the food out and buy new food when it went bad turned out to be almost nonexistent.

AWS launches $100M program to fund generative AI initiatives,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/22,"
Amazon, keen to avoid being left behind in the hyper-competitive AI race, is launching a new program to bolster customers and partners focused on generative AI.
Called the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center, the program will put $100 million toward connecting AWS-affiliated data scientists, strategists, engineers and solutions architects with customers and partners to — as Amazon puts it in a press release — “accelerate enterprise innovation and success with generative AI.”
“Through free workshops, engagements and training, AWS will help customers imagine and scope the use cases that will create the greatest value for their businesses, based on best practices and industry expertise,” Amazon writes in a press release.
What’s that mean, exactly? I asked Sri Elaprolu, the head of the Generative AI Innovation Center and a senior data science manager at AWS, to explain in a little more detail.
Via email, Elaprolu clarified that the $100 million investment will specifically fund “people, technology and processes” around generative AI. That’s still a bit vague. But the idea, he said, will be to support work with AWS customers that helps them ideate, design and launch new generative AI products and services.
“We’ve been hearing from our enterprise customers that they’re very interested in generative AI — and they’re looking to AWS for help and guidance,” Elaprolu added. “The Innovation Center will help them build their plan for generative AI, identify and prioritize generative AI use cases that are aligned to business value, and develop proof-of-concept solutions and a path to bring solutions to a production-ready state, along with steps to scale.”
Participants in the Generative AI Innovation Center program will benefit from free workshops, engagements and training, plus access to AWS products such as the code-generating service CodeWhisperer and Bedrock platform for text-generating models.
As for who can participate, Elaprolu says that the Generative AI Innovation Center will initially prioritize working with customers who’ve previously reached out to AWS with “plans, goals or requests for assistance” with generative AI. Beyond that, the program will give precedence to organizations in the financial services, healthcare and life sciences, media and entertainment, automotive and manufacturing, energy and utilities and telecommunications sectors.
“Strategy and science experts from the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center will work with customers on brainstorming and problem formulation, help them identify best use cases for generative AI, work through challenges involved and define a clear path to success,” Elaprolu said. “It’ll also provide a wide range of expert services from advisory functions, such as exploring the best foundation model candidates to meet business objectives, and hands-on engagements, such as fine-tuning foundation models to meet specific needs.”
The launch of the Generative AI Innovation Center comes months after AWS kicked off a 10-week program for generative AI startups and debuted Bedrock, a platform to build generative AI-powered apps via pretrained third- and first-party models. AWS also recently announced that it would work with Nvidia to build “next-generation” infrastructure for training AI models — complementing its in-house Trainium hardware.
With these moves, AWS is trying — hard — to make the case that its platform is the one to beat where it concerns building and hosting generative AI apps. Can it? That remains to be seen, particularly in light of Bedrock’s… well, rocky start. Bloomberg reported in May that six weeks after Amazon demoed the tech with an unusually vague presser and just one testimonial, most cloud customers still didn’t have access.
To Amazon’s credit, though, AWS has managed to nab a number of high-profile customers in the generative AI space, including Stability AI (which selected AWS as its preferred cloud provider) and AI21 Labs. That counters — but perhaps doesn’t quite best, depending on who you ask — Google Cloud’s partnerships with Cohere and Anthropic and Microsoft’s tie-up with OpenAI.
Fortunately for Amazon, the market’s large — and growing. Grand View Research estimates that generative AI products and solutions could be worth close to $110 billion by 2030.
“Generative AI will be one of the most transformational technologies of our generation, tackling some of humanity’s most challenging problems, augmenting human performance and maximizing productivity,” Elaprolu said. “Our customers have always been at the forefront of innovation, and there are nearly endless possibilities and use cases for generative AI. It’s only just beginning.”
Amazon is only the latest to pledge substantial resources toward generative AI initiatives, it’s worth noting.
Salesforce Ventures, Salesforce’s VC division, plans to pour $500 million into startups developing generative AI technologies. Workday recently added $250 million to its existing VC fund specifically to back AI and machine learning startups. OpenAI, the company behind the viral chatbot ChatGPT, has raised a $175 million fund to invest in AI startups. And just this week, Dropbox launched a $50 million AI-focused venture fund.
Accenture and PwC, meanwhile, have announced that they plan to invest $3 billion and $1 billion, respectively, in AI.
Funds have steadily increased their positions in AI over the past few years, spurred recently by the growth in generative AI. According to GlobalData, AI startups received over $52 billion in funding across more than 3,300 deals in the last year alone.

Kibsi raises $9.3M for its no-code computer vision platform,Frederic Lardinois,2023/06/22,"
Kibsi is an Irvine, California-based startup that is building a no-code computer vision platform that allows businesses to build and deploy computer vision applications. Among the things that set Kibsi apart from many other players in this space is that it lets businesses reuse their existing cameras to create insights into virtually anything they want to track, be that in a warehouse, restaurant or on an airport ramp.
The company today announced that it has raised a total of $9.3 million in pre-seed and seed funding. The participants in these rounds were GTMfund, NTTVC (which led the $4 million pre-seed round), Preface Ventures, Ridge Ventures, Secure Octane and Wipro Ventures.

Tolga Tarhan, who is now Kibsi’s CEO, joined Rackspace in 2019 after the founding team sold AWS-focused consulting business Onica to Rackspace. He later became the company’s CTO. After the Rackspace IPO, he decided that his journey in the company had come full circle. Together with co-founders and former Onica execs Amanda McQueen, Amir Kashani and Eric Miller, the team looked at what they could build next.
“I wanted to go get out and go create again,” Tarhan told me. “We wanted something that had an IoT orientation to it — because we’ve done a lot of IoT at Onica, was a big part of our business. We wanted it to be software — we had done enough consulting for multiple lifetimes. And we wanted it to be something involving AI, because we thought IoT by itself was almost old news. How do we combine these things? And as we thought about that space and our experience and where we got into roadblocks with customers, we realized that many customers are having trouble implementing computer vision.”

He noted that too often, computer vision projects in large enterprises fail even though they have the cameras and the talent to work on models. But to ingest stream from their cameras to then run the models takes a lot of undifferentiated work — and integrating all of this with downstream applications presents another set of integration challenges. So the team decided to build a computer vision platform that enables businesses to use their existing cameras and then combine that with a user experience that quickly enables users to gain real business value from this data. The platform lets users run their own computer vision models or Kibsi’s own and it then presents the results in a way that matches the business intent, both in Kibsi’s own user interface and through an API.
“We don’t return X and Y coordinates of people and objects,” said Tarhan. “If you’re thinking about a business analyst’s job, they don’t really care that a person is standing at this coordinate — what they want to know is: did that person interact with that merchandise?”

Kibsi has already attracted attention from customers like Owens Corning. Yet while manufacturing is a natural environment for computer vision, the Kibsi team also counts the likes of Whisker, which is embedding Kibsi’s tech into their litter robot, and the Woodland Park Zoo among its customers.
“Tracking animal behavior and interactions requires our professionals to sift through hours of camera footage,” said Bonnie Baird, animal welfare scientist at Woodland Park Zoo. “We are excited to add Kibsi’s computer vision capabilities to our existing cameras to gain valuable
insights about our animals and their well-being.”
While there are also obvious use cases for Kibsi in the smart city space (and its investor NTT is a major player there), Tarhan noted that the sales cycles there are quite slow. “As a startup, it’s not the best place to play day one,” he said.
Kibsi offers a free trial of their platform for developers, with a more comprehensive developer plan starting at $99/month. For premium and enterprise pricing plans, potential customers need to contact the company directly.

Warming public markets are boosting the secondary market for startup shares,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/22,"
The late-stage startup market is sorting out how to value startups that had raised capital during the previous venture boom — Tiger Global Management recently resorted to selling individual stakes in its portfolio companies after failing to sell a basket of its stakes.
Frankly, it wasn’t shocking to hear that happening in this climate — when you can buy stakes in startups for cheap, why not pick and choose?

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

More interestingly, it appears certain venture investors are snapping up secondary shares in startups. According to a report by Insider, some VCs are even turning to secondary markets to buy shares in the hottest AI startups.
This uptick in secondary market activity is not new. PitchBook wrote last December that while “volume of shares being offered by sellers continues to greatly outweigh interest from buyers […] institutional buyers are slowly coming back to scoop up secondary stakes.”
And according to data from secondary exchange Caplight, bids for secondary shares perked up after tech stocks plummeted in early 2023. In turn, that led to a smaller bid-ask spread between buyers and sellers of secondary shares.
All we had to do was wait for late-stage startup shareholders to capitulate to new valuation realities and tech valuations to perk up slightly. The combination of seller pessimism and modest buyer optimism has seemingly done the trick.

Robinhood acquires credit card startup X1 for $95M,Christine Hall,2023/06/22,"
Robinhood announced on Thursday that it was acquiring X1, a no-fee credit card startup, for $95 million in cash.
X1, which offers an income-based credit card with rewards, raised a total of $62 million in venture-backed funding from investors like Soma Capital, FPV, Craft Ventures and Spark Capital since its 2020 inception. The company announced its most recent raise of $15 million in December, when it also touted a 50% boost in its valuation.
On the one hand, while X1’s valuation is not known, it looks like Robinhood is getting a good deal with $95 million. If you take a look at recent raises by other credit card companies, you might say that X1 raising $62 million should yield a high valuation in the hundreds of millions. So, the purchase price may reflect the dip in fintech valuations we’ve seen in the past six months. 
For example, Petal raised $140 million in 2022 at an $800 million valuation. Granted, Petal has been around longer and raised more. A better example might be Yonder, a U.K.-based credit card startup that raised $15.4 million in April at an $89 million post-money valuation, converted in today’s U.S. dollar from the pound. 
On the other hand, Robinhood noted in its announcement that this move is “an important step in our journey toward broadening our product offerings and deepening our relationship with existing customers.” Not only has crypto trading slowed down, but its core trading business overall saw declines in May, most likely prompting that desire to diversify its business. 
Indeed, the acquisition of X1 gets Robinhood into the credit card business with the interchange fee revenue that comes with it. Robinhood currently earns interchange fees from its debit card. The startup first made headlines for its unique model, which allows it to underwrite customers based on their income rather than their credit scores. (Since then, other players have emerged with similar models — such as Tomo Credit, which offers credit based on cash flow rather than credit). X1 doesn’t charge an annual fee for its stainless steel Visa card, has no late or foreign transaction fees and rewards users with “points.” The company also claims that its card is “smart” in that it has built software features that work with the credit card.
X1 co-founders Deepak Rao and Siddharth Batra will oversee the new business for Robinhood, and Rao will serve as general manager of credit cards. 
Robinhood said it expects the deal to close in the third quarter of this year.

Plaid unveils new collaboration network aimed at giving fintechs a way to share fraud intelligence,Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/06/22,"
Want more fintech news in your inbox? Sign up here.
Fintech startup Plaid got its start as a company that connects consumer bank accounts to financial applications, but has since been gradually expanding its offerings to offer more of a full-stack onboarding experience.
And today, Plaid is announcing even more new product releases that moves the company into a whole new direction while also helping to diversify its revenue streams.
At the top of that lies Beacon, which it is describing as a “collaborative anti-fraud network enabling financial institutions and fintech companies to share critical fraud intelligence via API across Plaid.”
Plaid is launching Beacon today with 10 founding members, including Tally, Credit Genie, Veridian Credit Union and Promise Finance. Its argument for the need for such a network is that banks today already have access to shared fraud intelligence networks, but most companies don’t have access to the same types of tools.
“The idea behind Beacon is that the vast majority of fraud that any one fintech sees has been seen by another fintech before,” Alain Meier, former Cognito CEO and current head of identity at Plaid, told TechCrunch in an interview. “So essentially, what that means is that everyone is rebuilding the same anti-fraud mechanisms in order to try to catch what is frequently the exact same fraud, which means there’s a lot of wasted money and there’s a lot of wasted time.” 
Beacon represents Plaid’s effort to give fintechs a way to report fraud instances to each other. Participating members of the network will contribute by reporting instances of fraud — including stolen, synthetic and account takeovers — to Plaid. From there, they can then screen new signups or users against the Beacon network to detect if a specific identity has been associated with fraud on other Plaid-powered platforms or already within their own organization. For example, a fintech can share that a particular stolen identity was just used to sign up for one of their accounts. When that same stolen identity is used to sign up for a different fintech, the business is able to “properly look at the transaction, protect the business and the consumers associated with that identity,” Meier said.

Beacon is now available to fintechs and financial institutions of all sizes and Plaid’s 8,000+ customers. A business will pay Plaid to become a member of the network.
The goal of the new offering is twofold, according to Meier. 
“One, it’s to help the businesses to more efficiently and accurately find fraud that’s going on in their systems and to stop it from having this chain reaction of moving between different fintechs,” he said. “And then, secondarily, we also want to give consumers a mechanism by which they’re able to protect their identities.”
It is also significant, in Plaid’s view, considering that regulators are giving increased scrutiny to fintechs, in an effort to make sure that they’re “adhering to the same levels of security and compliance that the banks have for many years.”
Plaid spent about a year building out the product, which Meier acknowledged was “a very hard product to launch.”
When it comes to mitigating its own risk, Plaid says that it is operating the network with the same goal of securing sensitive information in the same way it works to secure financial account data. Beacon, it says, does not share personal identifiable information back to participating companies, only whether the identity information they are screening has been associated with fraud on other platforms. The company also emphasizes that is not used for decisioning, noting that “what Beacon does is offer customers an additional layer of fraud intelligence that customers can then use to do step up verifications or other security checks.”
The company also last week announced a new feature called Remember Me, which allows a user who has completed verification of their identity to opt in and have their identity remembered the next time they are asked for verification.
In January of 2022, it acquired Cognito, which offered identity verification and help with issues like know your customer (KYC) rules, and anti-money laundering requirements, for $250 million. The company then moved into offerings related to what it called “onboarding optimization” and risk and fraud mitigation.
Plaid also made a push on the payments side, with products such as Transfer and Signal, which allow the movement of money and the evaluation of the risk of moving money, respectively. (It now claims to analyze more than $2 billion in transactions each month.)
“We’ve had really great success with having very high attach rates for our new products so we’re feeling good about our multi-product strategy right now,” said Meier.

Omeat emerges from stealth with beefy tech approach to cultivated meat growth media,Christine Hall,2023/06/22,"
If you’ve been paying attention to the food tech industry lately, you saw a lot of movement in the past week around both Good Meat and Upside Foods receiving U.S. Department of Agriculture approval to commercially sell their respective cultivated chicken products in the U.S.
Omeat, a cultivated meat startup out of Los Angeles, not only wants to be the next one to achieve similar regulatory approval, it believes it has cracked the code on how to reduce the traditionally high costs to scale production of cultivated meat that can run thousands of dollars per liter.
The company, founded by Ali Khademhosseini four years ago, was developed at the Terasaki Institute for Biomedical Innovation. Prior to starting Omeat, Khademhosseini was growing human tissues for medical applications after studying at MIT. As he learned more about animal agricultural practices, he shifted his focus to developing a scalable method for growing cultivated meat.
Omeat has a patent-pending technological approach that “enables the cultivation of any meat in a way that is orders-of-magnitude more sustainable and humane than the conventional approach,” CEO Khademhosseini told TechCrunch.
He explained that the process uses regenerative factors extracted humanely from cow plasma to make growth media, which is a big driver of the high cost of cultivated meat, and why some companies choose to make their own.
Plasma collection from the cows happens weekly and is similar to how humans donate plasma, Khademhosseini said. And not just from any cow, but Omeat specifically sources growth media from free-roaming herd cows that graze on its regenerative farm in California designed in collaboration with Kristina Horback at UC Davis.
It is then developed into the growth media, and that one type of media can then be used to grow any kind of meat, including beef, pork, chicken or fish. Omeat is starting with beef.
The company is currently building a pilot plant and expanding its team toward commercial readiness after raising $40 million of Series A capital in 2022 from investors, including S2G Ventures, Google Ventures, Bold Capital Partners, Tyson Ventures, Rethink Food, Trailhead Capital and Cavallo Ventures.
Omeat scaled its current plant capacity to 200-liter bioreactors, and the pilot plant will have the ability to scale bioreactors to 2,000 liters and 10,000 liters, which Khademhosseini said are the sizes needed, based on global demand, to generate meat at cost parity with traditional beef.
“One cow providing plasma weekly can create many cows’ worth of meat annually,” Khademhosseini said. “Our vision is to make this so economically viable that we will have lots of people from the existing food supply world actually encouraged to partner with us in order to raise profits and address the razor-thin margins that exist right now.”

We’ve officially entered a new era of ‘cultivated’ meat production

Acryl Data raises $21M to grow its enterprise data catalog platform,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/22,"
With the explosion of different kinds of data, companies are struggling to realize meaningful value from their stored data. Data teams are overworked — forced to cater to the needs of disparate departments within an organization while trying to maintain data policies consistently.
That’s the shared thesis of Shirshanka Das and Swaroop Jagadish, at least, the co-founders of Acryl Data, a startup providing tools to help companies organize and ostensibly better manage their data. Acryl today announced that it raised $21 million in a Series A round led by 8VC with participation from Sherpalo Ventures and Guillermo Rauch, founder and CEO of Vercel, bringing its total raised to $30 million.
Prior to launching Acryl Data, Das was a principal staff software engineer at LinkedIn and, before that, a member of the technical teams first at PayPal and then at Yahoo! (full disclosure: TechCrunch’s owner). Jagadish came to Acryl by way of Airbnb as well as LinkedIn and Yahoo!
“Acryl Data is a community-driven metadata platform that delivers central controls across the decentralized data stack,” Jagadish, the CEO, told TechCrunch in an email interview. “With a mission to bring clarity to data, Acryl offers a data catalog with solutions for data discovery, governance, lineage and observability.”
What exactly is a data catalog? Well, it’s an inventory of data assets in an organization. Data catalogs consist of metadata in which definitions of database objects are stored, such as base tables, indexes, users and user groups.
Data catalogs are a dime a dozen — see startups such as Castor, Stemma, Select Star and Alation offer them, to name a few. But Jagadish argues that Acryl’s approach offers several key advantages over rivals.
Chief among them, Acryl’s platform — which is built on the open source framework DataHub — operates on “event-driven” metadata. By only performing operations when triggered, Acryl can reduce the cost of data catalog maintenance while enabling a range of trigger-based workflows, Jagadish claims.
“The explosion of data over the past decade has led companies to embrace a range of new technologies, but has created a fragmented data landscape as well,” he added. “Some problems got easier, like data orchestration, transformation, storage, movement and visualization — but other problems re-emerged as challenges, like data discovery, data quality and data management. Attempts to solve the problem — like traditional governance and observability tools — have been unnecessarily siloed, leading to further inefficiencies and inconsistent solutions … Acryl is designed to help teams move from simple data visibility to data insight, from insight to action and from action to automation.”
Beyond this, Acryl offers an “observability” module designed for monitoring data quality in real time. The module, aptly dubbed Observe, monitors and attempts to spot data quality issues — in theory helping to prevent data breakages and drive faster resolutions where they do occur.
Using Acryl, customers can also perform metadata tests, which surface areas for cost optimization, like expensive or underused data assets. The configurable monitors driving these tests let users define and continuously evaluate a set of conditions on the data assets in an organization.
“Our most common ‘competitor’ is the status quo of custom development, as data engineers establish manual processes and protocols on their own rather than implement a more automated solution,” Jagadish said.
Acryl has ambitious plans for the future, including AI features that’ll “intelligently curate” metadata and suggest business glossary tags and terms to more thoroughly document data catalogs. In addition, the company aims to launch an AI-powered tool to generate summaries that describe the key characteristics of a given data catalog, like its reliability and usage.
Acryl, which has a 25-person workforce, isn’t disclosing too much about its customer base. But the startup did reveal that it counts Notion, Zendesk, Robinhood, OVO Energy, BetterUp and Riskified among its clients.
Das added that DataHub, which he founded while at LinkedIn and which Acryl’s staff maintains, is used by companies like Pinterest, Stripe, Optum, Expedia, Saxo Bank and Peloton. He’s optimistic that the features Acryl’s building on top of DataHub will convince at least a few of those to convert.
“The fast rate of change in the data ecosystem presents a challenge for businesses and vendors alike,” Jagadish said. “As issues inevitably arise, Acryl increases productivity for data teams. Business users have a central resource to ask and address questions, rather than ad hoc processes for each issue, while data professionals can use Acryl’s lineage and impact analysis features to reduce time to resolution of data issues significantly.”

Heard Technologies grabs another $15M to develop therapist accounting tools,Christine Hall,2023/06/22,"
It’s hard to run a business and help customers at the same time. And with more people seeking mental health practitioners these days, therapists are feeling a similar struggle to balance patients and paperwork.
Victoria Li and Andrew Riesen started Heard Technologies in 2019 to reduce the burden from all of that back-end office work, like bookkeeping, taxes and payroll, so therapists can spend more time with patients.
“There still remains a lot of opportunity to build provider-first and provider-focused solutions,” CEO Riesen told TechCrunch. “Much of the innovation has been around care accessibility or at the intersection of payers or employers. We’re building a solution that gives providers a bit more time and space back, both physically and emotionally, given the work that they do.”
Solo practitioners pay $199 per month to be a part of Heard, while group practices pay $299 per month. Annual subscriptions are discounted. There is also a payroll add-on for $40 per month.
Seattle-based Heard began in 2019 like some of those other companies — for example, Frame, Alma and Headway — helping provide access to care. The company had about 100 therapists paying for the solution, said Riesen, who saw this play out firsthand through his therapist wife.
However, after seeing how difficult it was to even start a practice, the team spent 2020 looking at pain points and challenges, which included integrating telehealth as the global pandemic surged.
Riesen explained that at the time, many therapists shifted from being part of a large group to starting independent practices, which presented new challenges of forming a business entity, tracking income and expenses, billing, payroll and taxes — things they may not have done before.

“We help them really understand their practice as a small business,” Riesen said. “Among the companies providing medical billing, electronic health record systems and care accessibility solutions, we’re slotted into that accounting back office, supporting them with those core bookkeeping, payroll and tax needs.”
Heard raised $1.3 million in seed funding to launch its general ledger offering in 2021 and then raised another $10 million in Series A funding in 2022. In the past year, the company saw both its customer base and revenue grow by five times, Riesen said. Meanwhile, employee count grew from 20 to 35.
Today, the company announced $15 million in new funding, which Riesen is calling an extension of its Series A round. It was led by Headline with participation from GGV Capital and follow-on from investors, including Footwork, Founders’ Co-Op, Act One and Heron Rock. The new investment gives Heard $26.3 million in total funding to date.
With the new funding, Heard will tackle automation and scaling technologies as it also expands its offerings in the areas of practice formation, banking and retirement.
The company also recently rounded out its leadership team with the addition of chief operating officer KK Mulligan and head of support Brandon Wolf. Heard is also hiring for a vice president of engineering and head of tax operations, Riesen said.
“There’s a lot of opportunity in the accounting space to both improve and automate the annual tax filing experience and build on our core accounting features,” Riesen added. “Our ultimate goal is to be the financial back office for therapists in private practice. We’ve also seen a lot of requests from our clinicians around financial planning and retirement planning, so we’re spending time on delivering a more effective and seamless solution there.”

SoulCycle to offer trainer-guided virtual work sessions with the FLOWN startup,Mike Butcher,2023/06/22,"
FLOWN is a startup that took the idea of “virtual co-working” some of us did during the pandemic and created a model of guided “deep work” sessions with actual coaches. Billing itself as a “Twitch for work,” the platform says it works best with remote workers, of which there are now millions, of course. Last year it raised a seed round to take the idea to the next level.
It’s now partnering with iconic exercise brand SoulCycle to bring its “energizing workout” methodology to the masses.
SoulCycle-led focus sessions — called “Flocks” — will be available to all SoulCycle and FLOWN members starting June 26.
One of the most recognized wellness brands globally — best known for its spin classes that border on a religious experience for some — SoulCycle is clearly tapping into a new area where charismatic “trainers” can motivate a group in a new setting.
FLOWN already runs 50+ live focus sessions a week, led by their own facilitators, where professionals and students work silently together, on-camera, using a technique called “body doubling.”
If you’ve ever preferred to work in a library, café or co-working space alongside other human beings, you’re doing something that comes pretty naturally, and is often more motivating that working at home on your own. Indeed, during the pandemic, many of us found ourselves switching on Zoom to work silently alongside friends or colleagues, just for the company.
This natural behavior has now evolved into a burgeoning new area for startups, and even now has it’s own nomenclature. So-called “body doubling” is the act of working alongside someone else, and is said to provides focus, accountability and feeling of community.
This trend of virtual, guided coaching seems to be gaining momentum and is morphing from fitness and exercise (witness SoulCycle’s move with FLOWN) into other forms. Peoplehood, led by SoulCycle founders Elizabeth Cutler and Julie Rice, is poised to launch “gathers,” where strangers discuss their deepest hopes and fears.
Body doubling has also become popular over the last few years as a way to alleviate the effects of ADHD, the rates of diagnoses for which have skyrocketed post-pandemic.
Although body doubling has ben recommended to people with ADHD, others are picking up on the technique. FLOWN claims its subscribers report a “5x increase” in their productivity as a result of a session — although it was not able to independently verify this claim.
SoulCycle instructors will now join FLOWN’s “Flocks,” injecting SoulCycle’s brand of motivation into the platform. These communal experiences can range from decluttering one’s home, to completing tax returns or practicing an instrument.
Alicia Navarro, founder and CEO of FLOWN, said in a statement: “In a post-COVID, AI-saturated world, there is a deep need for accountability structures that leverage real humans and secular rituals. I started FLOWN to bring these structures into how we focus at work, and SoulCycle’s approach was an inspiration to me at the time.”
I asked Evelyn Webster, CEO of SoulCycle, what the tipping point was that secured her decision to work with Flown.
“When Alicia and I were chatting about each of our respective businesses it became quickly apparent that we share a common purpose — to help our community live their best lives. With so much overlap in our purpose — and at a point when SoulCycle was looking to more actively engage our community in ways that move beyond the bike — the partnership seemed a natural one,” she said.
What does she make of this new “body-doubling” trend?
“I think whatever helps people succeed is great! As I have learned more about how body doubling has helped many people gain greater focus and therefore productivity, it’s clearly a tool that works. And of course when we ride as a community at Soul, what is keeping us accountable? It’s the instructor guiding us through a class, together with 60 other riders in the room keeping you focused, on beat and fired up…so we know it works.”
And why does she think Soul Cycle customers will gravitate toward FLOWN’s product?
“Wellness is so much more than just physical fitness. Our community is always looking for ways in which to make themselves stronger, whether that’s on the bike or in other parts of their lives. We believe this is a great addition to our offering, and a natural extension for the brand,” she added.

Avatar startup Genies launches $1M fund for developers building AR experiences,Lauren Forristal,2023/06/22,"
Genies, the Bob Iger-backed avatar tech company, announced Thursday the launch of its Developer Engagement Fund to reward developers that build AR experiences via Genies’ recently announced developer kit. The total fund size is $1 million.
Genies will reward certain developers based on the level of traction, such as how many users are participating in the avatar experience, how frequently they’re engaging and how many users are interacting with the digital items within the experience.
The startup introduced its developer kit in May, which gives select developers access to Genies’ full tech stack, allowing them to launch mini-apps, customize avatars to fit their aesthetic and create experiences from mini-games to virtual “social worlds,” according to the company.

Avatar startup Genies hits $1 billion valuation in latest raise

The mini-apps will launch within Genies’ upcoming super app, which is expected to roll out this fall. The network includes Genies’ Silver Studio, a DIY digital fashion app (still in beta) where users dress up and personalize their avatars.
The developer kit also includes XR (extended reality) compatibility, which means the avatar experiences have the potential to perform well in mobile AR, AR glasses and VR headsets. However, at the start, the experiences will launch on mobile.
“We think this is really important, especially in the context of Apple Vision Pro,” Genies CEO Akash Nigam told TechCrunch in an interview. “In 2017, when we were building this, we knew that at one point we were going to live in an augmented world. And when that did happen, any type of social or interactive experience that you wanted to do with your friends, whether it was a mini-game or some type of social network, or use case, you’re going to need an avatar as a prerequisite… The XR compatibility tech makes it so that any of these avatars or creations can spawn effectively and performantly in an AR world.”
The new engagement fund and the developer kit are by application only. The first batch of developers to be accepted for the fund will mainly be college students and other beginners that are selected for Genies’ Developer Incubator, which provide mentorship and tips for how to launch their own AR experiences.
The company will launch the first cohort this summer. Developers can submit their applications through the Genies website.
“We want to be able to work hands-on with each of the developers to be able to cultivate their experiences through the dev kit,” Nigam told us. “We really want to make sure that people are leveraging these avatars in a way that’s going to be additive to the entire ecosystem…We want to make sure that we can incentivize them to build experiences the right way.”
Nigam said Genies is selective about the developers they accept. The developers are required to have a few years of coding experience to fully understand the technology.
“We have built it in a way that, over time, you can have almost little to no technical expertise to be able to create an avatar experience,” he added.
Initially, the company plans on accepting hundreds of developers to participate in the million-dollar pool and be rewarded on a monthly basis. By early 2024, Genies will accept thousands of developers.
“It’s really based on how many developers we can best support in the very beginning,” Nigam said.

Avatar startup Genies scores $65 million in funding round led by Mary Meeker’s Bond

"Deloitte, three board members quit edtech giant Byju’s",Manish Singh,2023/06/22,"
Global giant Deloitte quit as the auditor of Byju’s and three board members resigned from the most valuable Indian startup on Thursday, sending a shockwave through the industry, a year after the Indian firm’s tardy financial reporting attracted global scrutiny.
Byju’s, valued at $22 billion, in a statement termed Deloitte’s resignation as a “planned transition” and refuted resignations of its board members. Deloitte, which fanned concerns as it submitted its resignation to Byju’s board, was slated to work with the Indian startup until 2025. The startup said it has appointed BDO (MSKA & Associates) as its statutory auditor.
In a letter to Byju’s board on Thursday, Deloitte said that it had not undertaken the auditing of the edtech giant’s accounts for the year ending March 2022 and cited the delay as a reason for its resignation.
It added:
The financial statements of the company for the year ended March 31, 2022 are long delayed. In accordance with the Companies Act, 2013, the audited financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2022 were due to be laid before shareholders in the Annual General Meeting by September 30, 2022.
We have also not received any communication on the resolution of the audit report modifications in respect of the year ended March 31, 2021, status of the audit readiness of the financial statements and the underlying books and records for the year ended March 31, 2022 and we have not been able to commence the audit as on date.
As a result, there will be significant impact on our ability to plan, design, perform and complete the audit in accordance with the applicable auditing standards. In view of the aforesaid, we are tendering our resignation as statutory auditors of the company with immediate effect.
Byju’s attracted intense scrutiny last year from the government, investors and creditors after it repeatedly failed to publish its accounts. In September, Byju’s finally published its accounts for the year ending March 2021, revealing revenue figures that fell short of its own projections.
The company did not address the concerns raised by Deloitte but said it extends its “sincere gratitude” to the outgoing auditor.
GV Ravishankar of Peak XV Partners (formerly known as Sequoia India and Southeast Asia), Vivian Wu of Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and Russell Dreisenstock of Prosus have stepped down from the board, a person familiar with the matter said.
In response, Byju’s said: “A recent media report suggesting the resignations of board members from Byju’s is entirely speculative. Byju’s firmly denies these claims and urges media publications to refrain from spreading unverified information or engaging in baseless speculation.”
Byju’s co-founders — Byju Raveendran and Divya Gokulnath — and Riju Raveendran continue to sit at the startup’s board.
The startup, also the world’s most valuable education technology company, is grappling with a series of challenges. It refused to make a $40 million payment earlier this month and counter-sued its lenders. Byju’s said its lenders were operating in “bad-faith negotiating tactics.” Lenders allege that Byju’s has technically defaulted on the loan.
The startup is also cutting about 1,000 jobs as it pushes to improve its finances. BlackRock cut Byju’s valuation by nearly two-thirds to $8.4 billion at the end of March this year, TechCrunch first reported.

Bridge 2 Technologies is making it easier for companies to find diverse vendors,Ron Miller,2023/06/22,"
Bridge 2 Technologies began with the notion that it should be easier for companies to find a diverse set of vendors. The company formed three years ago with the idea of bringing these two groups together in a two-way marketplace.
Today, the company announced the official launch of the Bridge 2 Technologies vendor marketplace with around 500 corporations and 3,000 vendors on an AI-fueled platform. It had been in beta for a couple of years.
Founder and CEO Eric Kelly says that he has been working to bring people together for years, but at a diversity conference a few years ago, he became enamored with the idea of creating a digital platform where corporations could find a curated set of diverse vendors.
It’s really about networking and communications. “If Slack and LinkedIn had a baby this is what it would look like,” Kelly told TechCrunch, but the platform was built with a focus on finding diverse vendors. “It really was the development efforts of the large corporations, the diverse companies, the leaders in that industry, saying what are the things that we need to do to actually connect everyone together,” he said.
Kelly said the idea for the platform was born at a one-day conference in New York a few years ago, which brought together corporate leaders and the leaders from diverse companies. It went so well, they wanted a way to keep these groups connected.
“As we talked about it, [the participants] said we don’t have a way of connecting in a meaningful way to find the corporations that are ready to scale, finding the talent. And so I raised my hand and said, ‘OK guys, I’ll build a platform if you help me build the ecosystem.’ And that’s how it started,” Kelly recalled.
While many companies such as government contractors have a mandate to work with a diverse group of vendors, it’s often a challenge to find and vet them. That’s why it was a goal for the platform to be highly curated, so the corporations looking for vendors would be working with a set of companies that have passed some sort of diversity certification from a vendor perspective, and can handle the needs of a large corporation.
“So that’s why it’s invitation-only. So when they go to the platform, they know that company has already been curated either by them or by one of the large certification bodies that they’ve already done business with,” Kelly said.
The plan was originally to launch with just 250 vendors, but they are actually launching today with ,ore than 3,000. Kelly said they took a very deliberate approach to building the platform, not taking any venture capital, so that they could take their time and get it right before launching.
The AI on the back end helps deliver the right content to the right person or company, while translating and taking care of other tasks that can make the platform easier to use.
While the platform is intended to help companies find diverse vendors, an altruistic goal to be sure, it’s still a for-profit venture, says Kelly. As such, both vendors and corporations pay for the privilege of being on the platform, driving revenue from both sides of the house. Pricing is still being worked out.

Plastic upcycling startup Kubik closes $3.34M seed to scale production in Ethiopia,Annie Njanja,2023/06/22,"
The amount of plastic waste produced globally is on track to triple to over 1,000 million tons by 2060. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report predicts that developed countries will continue to produce the most plastic waste per person, although emerging regions like Africa and Asia are expected to experience the fastest growth owing to rapid population growth and urbanization.
Plastic pollution is already a menace said to be altering environments and endangering lives, but there is a glimmer of hope as the share of recycled plastic is expected to nearly double over the same period to 17% as plastic going through waste management systems increases.
In Africa, Kubik, an upcycling startup with operations in Kenya and Ethiopia, is among the companies that are leading plastic waste reuse and sustainability efforts in the continent’s nascent recycling sector, which currently salvages only 4% of the waste produced.
The startup turns hard-to-recycle plastic waste (polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene) into affordable building materials, removing 45,000 kg of plastic waste from landfills every day. The startup is now planning to double down on the production of building materials in Ethiopia before scaling to other countries within Africa, against the backdrop of a recently closed $3.34 million seed funding round.
Founded by Kidus Asfaw and Penda Marre in 2021, Kubik plans to scale production at its plant in Ethiopia later this year, saying it has the capacity to build over a quarter million square meters of wall surface area every year.
“This can build anywhere up to 10,000 affordable homes per year, for example. Speaking of affordable housing, there is a 300M+ deficit of housing units globally that are considered affordable to the poor. This is a $2T+ market we have an opportunity to address, and we are just getting started,” said Asfaw, the CEO of the company, which won Startup of the Year at the 2023 Global Startup Awards and was declared the leading climate tech startup in Africa at last week’s VivaTech conference.
Investors that took part in the round include Plug and Play, Bestseller Foundation, GIIG Africa Fund, Satgana, Unruly Capital, Savannah Fund, African Renaissance Partners, Kazana Fund, Princeton Alumni Angels, and Andav Capital.
“We are thrilled to invest and partner with Kubik on their transformative journey. Their purpose-driven vision, exceptional team, and unique business model — combining positive social impact, circular economy, and low-carbon construction — positions Kubik as a scalable and sustainable solution to Africa’s most pressing challenges,” said climate tech VC Satgana co-founder Romain Diaz.
Kubik develops interlocking building materials, which include bricks, columns, beams and jambs, allowing developers to erect walls without the need for cement, aggregates, and steel. Asfaw says this does not compromise the building’s integrity and that the strength of walls built with its products is at par with cement-based walls.
He added that Kubik’s products cost at least 40% less per square meter and have chemical properties that make them safe, anti-flammable and nondegradable. Besides, he says, these products are low carbon, with a greenhouse gas emission of “at least 5x less than cement-based products.”
Asfaw says the materials’ affordability can play a role in bridging the current housing deficit that is partly driven by a growing urban population and hefty costs of construction. The startup is driving this change even as global appeals continue for governments to introduce policies that lessen plastic waste and encourage a more circular use of the plastics.
“The world is urbanizing dramatically fast today, and cities are feeling the burden of unmanaged plastic waste, unaffordable living conditions (especially in housing), and the impact of climate change. Our company plays a role in addressing all three of these challenges through a lower-carbon, lower-cost building solution that removes plastic waste from the environment. We believe this is why there is a lot of excitement in our company and its mission,” said Asfaw.
“We have a product that is transforming how we build sustainably and more affordably, and we see ourselves becoming a company that will continue to drive technology into the materials used for decarbonizing the built environment faster.”

"Sequoia debuts Atlas, an interactive guide to the European tech talent landscape",Paul Sawers,2023/06/21,"
There is an estimated 3 million software engineers in Europe, depending on what report you want to believe, but finding the right engineers for the job at hand isn’t all that straightforward. London or Paris might well have the highest concentration of software engineers, but knowing what locales offer the best access to specific disciplines is an entirely different ballgame, particularly in such a geographically distributed continent as Europe.
This is something that venture capital (VC) juggernaut Sequoia is seeking to address with a new online interactive tool called Atlas, which, while built primarily with its own portfolio founders in mind, it’s releasing to the general public today too.
Atlas meshes various qualitative and quantitative data collection methods, including a talent survey of 1,035 participants; a survey of 125 recruiters from European tech companies; 17 “in-depth” interviews with founders and recruiters; and aggregated data from third-party sources such as Dealroom, SeekOut, Remote, Ledgy, and GitHub. At its core, Atlas attempts to present a picture of the current European technical talent landscape, incorporating the 27 members states of the European union plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway (collectively known as the European Economic Area [EEA]), in addition to Switzerland, Ukraine, and the U.K.
Talent density spikes
London comes out on top both overall (i.e., “all disciplines”) and in each individual discipline (e.g., AI, DevOps, security) in terms of volume of engineers. However, Atlas comes at this from the perspective that cities with the highest talent volume aren’t necessarily the best place to go looking for specific skills. As such, Atlas shows the densest per capita (i.e., per the broader software engineering population) concentration for a given speciality among the local talent pool, highlighting two dozen cities across Europe and their respective density spikes in 14 specialization areas.
“So this is cities that are punching above their weight for a certain type of engineering specialism,” Sequoia’s European talent director, Zoe Jervier Hewitt, explained to TechCrunch in an interview.
Sequoia’s Atlas in action. Image Credits: Sequoia
For example, Atlas data suggests that Dublin’s general engineering quality across all specialities sits at just 37% in terms of the number of engineers with four- or five-star GitHub ratings. But when filtered down to engineers with an AI specialism, this figure jumps up to 60%. This positions the Irish capital as one of the hottest places for AI talent, along with several other key hubs across Europe, which tallies with separate reports from recent years that position Dublin as a top AI talent hub.

A curious omission from Atlas is that while it gives a percentage of GitHub users in a city with four- or five-star ratings, it doesn’t do this at a top level for the overall talent density of skill-specific engineers in the city — regardless of their level of experience, what their GitHub rating is, or whether they even use GitHub at all.
Indeed, while the circles serve as useful visual indicators of the biggest outliers in talent density — the bigger the circle, the bigger the talent density — it’s impossible to know how they actually compare to each other. How much higher is Dublin’s AI talent density than Zurich, or Paris, or Berlin, or Edinburgh? It turns out this was a deliberate design decision, according to a Sequoia spokesperson, who said that percentages wouldn’t do a good enough job of conveying the contrast between the densities, whereas splitting them into broad “Notable,” “Standout” and “Top city” made it easier to parse the differences.

Moreover, it’s also worth considering why a higher density of engineers with a particular talent in one location is more useful than another city with a lower density but higher overall number. The Sequoia spokesperson said that the correlation between specialization density and the quality of the engineers, as defined by their GitHub star ratings, is one reason why this matters — evidenced by the jump in four- and five-star GitHub ratings for Dublin when filtered by AI as their specialism.
“We see this pattern repeated across different specializations,” the spokesperson said. “[Also], outlier talent density in a particular city means a relative abundance of available talent for a specific skill set to recruit from. For instance, Amsterdam has the highest density of DevOps engineers, which means on a local basis it has the richest supply of DevOps talent. While London may have more DevOps engineers in total, they are in relatively short supply as a proportion of London’s overall talent pool, which may make recruiting them more difficult, particularly for early-stage startups competing against established tech giants.”
Other notable tidbits to emerge from the research provided in Atlas is that Germany (Stuttgart and Munich, specifically) is a hotbed for engineers focused on robotics, drones and autonomous vehicles, while Gothenburg in Sweden is something of an outlier for systems engineers.
Helsinki, meanwhile, is big for top gaming and graphics engineers.

Of course, if a fledgling startup really is just looking for the high-volume hubs, they can use Atlas to pick out places that might not be instantly obvious, such as Madrid, which apparently has the highest number of engineers outside of London and Paris across all specialities.

Users can also drill down into specific hubs and see what the lay of the land is in terms of volume of engineers; primary and secondary skills; percentage of female engineers; number of accelerators; and the “tech ecosystem value.”
While these various data points may prove useful, Atlas perhaps could benefit from proper data sourcing. For instance, Lithuania’s capital Vilnius apparently has a “tech ecosystem value” of €9.3 billion, but without knowing where this figure was derived from, it’s difficult to know precisely what it means. In this instance, Sequoia did confirm to TechCrunch that this was garnered as part of its integration with tech data provider Dealroom, which defines the “ecosystem value” as such:
[The] sum of the valuations of all startups in the ecosystem. Using estimated valuations based on most recent VC rounds, public markets and publicly disclosed valuations.
However, it perhaps would be more useful if Atlas showed exactly where its various data points have come from, using little clickable on-screen icons.

Use cases
While knowing where to find the best robotics or hardware or systems engineers is an important selling point of this tool, it could also be used by remote-first companies looking to set up satellite offices, for instance, or even base their entire HQ.
The founder of one of Sequoia’s portfolio companies, Robco — a German robotics startup that recently raised $14 million — apparently moved from Boston back to Munich because of its abundance of robotics talent. And this is the type of scenario that Hewitt reckons that startups, scale-ups, or even Big Tech recruiters might use Atlas for, which is particularly pertinent at a time when the remote-work trend is showing little sign of easing.
“I think founders can use Atlas as a lens for things like ‘where should we put our HQ‘ or ‘where should we put our main office,'” Hewitt said. “I think the other use case will be around how founders want to think about and evolve their philosophies around remote and hybrid work. I think it will help founders inform whether they choose to operate a fully remote engineering team or a hybrid. So we hope that it will be useful as many companies are trying to strike that balance of hybrid and in-person.”
A year in the making, Atlas is available for anyone to use today. But all this leaves us with at least one lingering question. According to Hewitt, they detected shifts in attitudes toward remote, hybrid, and office-based working during the course of developing Atlas, which leads us to wonder how useful this tool will be, say, a year or two from now as Europe’s diverse and distributed tech workforce continues to evolve.
Put simply, is the plan to make Atlas a living, breathing reflection of the European tech talent ecosystem?
“I think we want to see the response from founders,” Hewitt said. “I mean, we think it’s a really great tool, and I hope it’s going to create value for lots of hiring teams. Whether we will update it every year, I think we’ll wait to see what the initial reception is.”

"Supercritical, a carbon removal marketplace aimed at tech firms, raises $13M Series A led by Lightspeed",Mike Butcher,2023/06/21,"
Supercritical, the carbon removal marketplace aimed (at the moment) mainly at tech companies that want to hit “net zero,” has raised a $13 million Series A funding round, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners.
The round includes funding from RTP Global, Greencode Ventures, MMC Ventures and others. We covered Supercritical’s launch back in August 2021, when it pointed out that the carbon footprint of the technology sector had — embarrassingly — been proven to be greater than the entire aviation industry.
The startup aggregates business demand for cutting-edge carbon removal technologies. So in a similar scenario to Tesla starting out with an electric sports car so that it could eventually launch a family saloon, Supercritical gives companies access to these innovative technologies which have the potential to scale far beyond just planting some forests etc., allowing this new wave of carbon removers to scale up.
Supercritical’s marketplace allows companies to purchase so-called “fully-vetted and qualified” carbon removal credits, to the level of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) industry standard.
The funding will be used to scale its offering to tech companies, but, as co-founder and CEO Michelle You told me: “We are continuing to focus on tech companies but also will use the funding to broaden the offering. Every company in the world will have to get to net zero emissions if we’re going to stay below 1.5C of warming. There is no way of getting to net zero without buying permanent carbon removal to net out the remaining emissions.”
Clients for Supercritical’s approach include banking platform Tide, algorithmic trading firm XTX Markets, as well as Veriff, Multiverse and IMC.
She pointed out that there is already momentum in the market: “Already one-third of global market cap have made a voluntary commitment to net zero via the Science Based Targets initiative. Every single business will have to buy permanent carbon removal so the opportunity to scale CDR by serving other verticals is huge.”
Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) refers to approaches that remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. The alternative, carbon offsets, has frequently been found to be at best ineffective, and even fraudulent, at its worst.
In June an investigation by the Guardian newspaper, the German weekly Die Zeit and SourceMaterial, found that more than 90% of rainforest carbon offsets by the largest global certifier, Verra, were allegedly worthless.
By contrast, Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) offsets are the only offsets recognized internationally that count toward net zero, by actually taking carbon out of the atmosphere and storing it away permanently.
However, CDR capacity is disappointing to date, to put it mildly. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that only around 600,000 tonnes of CDR were purchased in 2022 — less than 0.01% of the 10 gigatonnes which we need to take out of the atmosphere annually by 2050.
As a marketplace, Supercritical says it focuses on “high-quality, vetted, durable CDR projects,” including biochar, direct air capture (DAC) and enhanced weathering, as well as afforestation. Because it aggregates demand from buyers, Supercritical says it acts as a market-maker, which means CDR projects can then scale up. It also buys from cutting-edge climate startups (see the Tesla analogy above) which have new approaches to sequestering CO2.
This last May, Supercritical went into a long-term agreement with Carbo Culture, a startup that converts carbon-containing biomass into biochar at a commercial scale. In 2021, Carbo Culture raised $6.2 million in a seed financing round led by Silicon Valley VC True Ventures.
In a statement, Paul Murphy, partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners said: “Supercritical is doing something unique. By focusing exclusively on carbon removal offsets, they are helping businesses invest in the places that will actually deliver climate impact while they work in parallel to decarbonize.”
Supercritical is backed by Lightspeed Venture Partners, GreenCode Ventures and MMC Ventures. It was previously backed by LocalGlobe and angel investors including Peter Reinhardt (Twilio Segment and Charm Industrial), Yancey Strickler (Kickstarter), Alice Bentinck (Entrepreneur First), Gustaf Alströmer (Y Combinator) and Evelyn Bourke (Bupa).
The market for startups either taking a marketplace or a market-maker approach is heating up. In May, I reported on climate startup CUR8, which had raised $6.5 million from GV for its market-making platform for carbon removals. While Supercritical is both a marketplace and does carbon accounting and removal sales, CUR8 only focuses on removals and driving demand and access to finance for the suppliers.
The fact that both these startups have come out of the U.K. is also testament to the fact that the U.K. is seen to be leading the way internationally on carbon pricing and regulation.

"Southeast Asia–focused Go-Ventures closes $240M second fund, rebrands as Argor Capital ",Kate Park,2023/06/19,"
Go-Ventures, backed by Indonesia’s GoTo, announced Tuesday it has raised a second fund at $240 million and rebranded as Argor Capital “to reinforce the investment firm’s independence and expanded capabilities to drive growth” for its portfolios.
Argor Capital started in 2018 with GoTo backing to invest in startups in Southeast Asia. Though GoTo will remain one of the investors in Argor’s latest fund, Argor’s investment decisions will continue to be independent of GoTo and other limited partners, according to the VC firm. The limited partners for Argo’s second fund include sovereign wealth funds, institutional investors, corporations, and family offices across the globe, from Asia to the Middle East, Australia, Europe and the U.S.
“While we are rebranding at a time of expansion, the word ‘Go’ embedded in our name is an important reminder for us of the strong support we have received from GoTo and our other investors since we started this journey back in 2018,” said Aditya Kamath, partner of Argor Capital.
The VC, which will continue to invest in early-stage and midstage companies in Southeast Asia, plans to construct a portfolio of 15 to 20 companies in its second fund. Argor’s initial investments are typically $2 million -$10 million, according to a spokesperson of Argor Capital.  So far, Argor has invested from the second fund in sectors such as B2B marketplaces, consumer, environmental tech, fintech and digital transformation platforms for SMEs.
“Argor focuses on companies that operate in or are expanding into Southeast Asia, with an emphasis on Indonesia and Vietnam as the key countries of focus,” the spokesperson of Argo told TechCrunch. In addition, the company will continue to make investments in countries such as the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, the spokesperson said.
In 2020, Argor closed on its Fund I with $175 million invested in 19 companies in Southeast Asia. Two partners, Siddharth Pisharody and Adrian Foo, have joined the VC outfit, which has expanded its team size threefold over the last two years.
The firm has made investments from the first fund in companies such as Vara, a Singapore-based staff management platform for small businesses; KitaBeli, an Indonesian social commerce app; Food Market Hub, a Malaysian cloud-based platform that connects food and beverage (F&B) outlets directly to suppliers; Juragan Material, a construction tech platform in Indonesia; eFishery, an Indonesian agtech startup; and SafeBoda, an Uganda-based ride-hailing app.
“Despite the challenging macro environment globally, we remain excited about the potential of Southeast Asia’s technology ecosystem, which is underpinned by secular consumption and technology adoption across both consumers and businesses,” said Kamath.

Gladia turns any audio into text in near real time,Romain Dillet,2023/06/19,"
Meet Gladia, a French AI startup that wants to change how companies interact with audio data. The company develops an audio transcription application programming interface (API) that you can integrate with other products and is supposed to work much better than what’s available out there. And this tech foundation unlocks new use cases around audio.
If you’re familiar with audio transcription APIs, you know that big cloud providers already have their own APIs. There’s Google’s speech-to-text API, Amazon Transcribe, Microsoft’s Speech to Text, etc. They work well, but they are expensive, slow and don’t have a ton of features.
Gladia’s co-founder and CEO Jean-Louis Quéguiner, who was the former head of AI for OVHcloud and co-founded the company with Jonathan Soto, told me about some of the limitations with existing APIs. According to him, there are three pain points with existing products. First, when it comes to prices, transcribing an hour of audio generally costs $1.50 to $2 an hour.
Second, the output isn’t always very reliable as some languages work well while others are barely supported. When it comes to advanced features, if people speak in multiple languages, chances are the API simply won’t be able to notice the language change and transcribe the audio in more than one language.
Third, transcription APIs are slow. It can take more than 15 minutes to transcribe an hour of audio. That’s fine if you don’t need transcriptions right away, but it means that you won’t be able to use these APIs in some industries.
Whisper’s whisperer
Gladia is based on Whisper, OpenAI’s open source transcription model. “We started from Whisper. We haven’t reinvented the wheel, but we listened to our customers and they told us: ‘What I want is something that works as well as Whisper,’” Jean-Louis Quéguiner told me.
But Whisper isn’t perfect. The vanilla version is still quite slow, so Gladia has spent a lot of time turning Whisper into a fast and responsive transcription model. That’s not the only issue.
“Half of Whisper is GPT-2. You’ve seen LLMs and ChatGPT, it tends to hallucinate. We’ve done a lot of work to avoid hallucination problems too,” Quéguiner said.
In particular, he told me that Whisper has been trained on closed captions that you can find on the internet, such as on YouTube. OpenAI’s model tends to hear common phrases that you can hear in online videos, such as “if you enjoyed this video, please like and subscribe.” There is a mathematical overrepresentation of some sentences like this one and Gladia tries to fix those shortcomings.
In addition to these modifications to Whisper and its implementation, Gladia also has some pre-processing and post-processing algorithms that improve the end results.
Gladia promises that it can transcribe an hour of audio for $0.61. And the transcription process takes roughly 60 seconds. Its API can detect when there are multiple speakers, add timestamps, detect languages and switch from one language to another if needed. Gladia also automatically adds punctuation and casing.
Like most APIs, the end result is in JSON format. But Gladia also supports SRT and VTT files for companies that want to generate subtitles.
I created an account and uploaded an audio recording of an interview to see how Gladia works. It took a bit more time than expected but it was definitely much faster than Google’s or Azure’s speech-to-text APIs.
The result wasn’t flawless, but it was extremely good — it understood acronyms and technical terms. I opened the same audio file in Aiko, a Mac app developed by Sindre Sorhus that lets you transcribe audio file locally using Whisper. As expected, the output was close to Gladia’s output — but Gladia was much faster than running Aiko on my MacBook Pro.
Overall, Gladia was the best transcription API I’ve ever used.
Becoming an audio intelligence API
The company currently works with call center companies, virtual meeting services, and video publishers, including Claap, Livestorm and Selectra.
Gladia raised a $4 million seed round in a funding round led by New Wave. Other investors include Sequoia, Cocoa and business angels, such as Solomon Hykes, Pierre Betouin, Miroslaw Klaba and Alexandre Berriche.
Having a rock-solid transcription API is just step one for Gladia. The company hopes that it can then build features on top of this strong technical foundation.
For instance, after an audio file has been transcribed, Gladia can translate text into another language. Combined with word-level timestamps, it means that a company can upload an audio file and get subtitles in dozens of languages in just a few minutes.
In the future, the company hopes that it can summarize the content of an audio file, categorize content into multiple topic categories, create chapters automatically, conduct sentiment analysis and more.
“Our longer-term vision is to move from 2D to 3D data. Audio is pretty flat, and the idea is to augment it with intelligence,” Quéguiner said. “We think that transcription will become a commodity. But we think that what’s going to matter more is the options we’re going to add.”

Philippines startup Shoppable Business smooths bumps in the business procurement process,Catherine Shu,2023/06/19,"
Shoppable Business Chris Blanquera, Sam Blanquera and Carlo Silva
Shoppable Business wants to make it easier for businesses in the Philippines to source and procure branded products and other inventory, with an emphasis on making sure products are authentic. The B2B e-commerce marketplace announced it has closed what it says was an oversubscribed pre-seed funding round of $1.15 million.
The round was co-led by Foxmont Capital Partners and Seedstars International Ventures, along with angel investors. Shoppable Business previously got backing from AHG Lab.
Shoppable Business was founded in 2022 by a team including Carlo Silva, who previously started and exited e-commerce business process outsourcing company 2ndOffice. The founders also include Sam Blanquera and Chris Blanquera, who co-founded and existed Openovate Labs and Galleon.ph.
Silva told TechCrunch that after working at startups and conglomerates in the Philippines since 2013, Shoppable Business’ founding team noticed that there was a huge gap in the marketplace for a efficient digital procurement process. “The traditional methods were slow, opaque and painstakingly manual and it was hard to find trusted suppliers,” he said.
One problem that businesses face when procuring online is not knowing if goods are authentic. While there have been a lot of e-commerce innovations in the Philippines, like social commerce, a lot of them are targeted toward consumers. But businesses often have to rely on Facebook Marketplace and classified ads for procurement, which means processing orders is a time consuming business.
Silva said that in the Philippines, the traditional procurement process is manual, with orders usually processed through messaging apps, email or in person. Quotations are sent through word documents or spreadsheets. “It’s also difficult to search for authentic products online, and to compare quotations as they are funneled through messenger apps and email, making it an inefficient process,” he said.
Shoppable Business is aimed at businesses that want to procure goods quickly and more cheaply, but don’t have a dedicated procurement team. It also works with companies that manufacture their own brands and distributors. The platform specializes in branded products and services for resellers.
Shoppable Business helps them by operating as a horizontal B2B marketplace for products and services from multiple categories. In addition to using the platform to find products, businesses can also access services like marketing, sales support, procurement outsourcing, logistics, financing and payment infrastructure. Shoppable Business also issues official BIR (Bureau of Internal Revenue)-certified sales invoices and receipts, which companies need in the Philippines to claim the full purchase. To ensure authentic products, Shoppable Business is a marketplace partner of GS1 Philippines (GS1 is the standard for barcodes and product identification in 116 countries, and has 2 million member companies).
In terms of convincing sellers and businesses to move off Facebook Marketplace and the other platforms they are currently using, Shoppable Business makes the process easier by providing a single product listing catalog feature, which means if a product is already in its catalog, sellers don’t need to recreate the product listing. Instead, they can start selling it with a few clicks, by inputting their selling price, stock and any bulk discounts they would like to offer.
Sellers also get their own store on Shoppable Business that enables them to accept payments from different options like Gcash, Maya, credit cards, bank transfers and even check or manual bank deposits. Shopppable Business also does away with the hassle of shipping by arranging deliveries through third-party logistic partners.
To make it easier for sellers to move their current customer base to Shoppable Business, the platform offers a program called Shoppable Direct which enables them to refer existing customers to become buyers. Shoppable will tag seller’s customers as their direct customers if they buy something from the seller that referred them. It also waives marketplace fees for the buyer.
Silva said the wide array of services Shoppable Business offers sellers and buyers, like sales support, procurement outsourcing and logistics, helps it compete with other B2B marketplaces. In addition, it guarantees the issuance of BIR-certified sales invoices and receipts for every transaction, and also protects product authenticity through its partnership with GS1 Philippines.
The funding will be used to hire for Shoppable Business’ business development team, product and feature development and expanding into new markets in Southeast Asia. Silva said the startup will target new markets by the first half of 2024.
In a statement about the investment, Foxmont Capital Partners managing partner Franco Varona said, “Sourcing and procurement have traditionally been a very manual and a very challenging experience in the Philippines. The lack of transparency in pricing and difficulty in finding goods at scale and quickly is something Filipino companies have had to deal with for too long.  Shoppable Business helps to directly solve that problem, and we believe Carlo and his team are exactly the right team to do it.”

"India’s Byju’s to cut up to 1,000 more jobs",Manish Singh,2023/06/19,"
Byju’s is cutting 500 to 1,000 more jobs at the firm, this time eliminating several non-sales roles as well, as the Indian edtech giant pushes to improve its finances, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The Bengaluru-headquartered startup, which has cut over 3,000 jobs in the past year, declined to comment.
The new wave of layoffs is aimed at improving the finances at the firm as it pushes to become profitable, the person familiar with the matter said, requesting anonymity discussing nonpublic matters.
Byju’s, valued at $22 billion, is the most valuable Indian startup. The firm, which employs over 40,000 individuals, is the largest edtech startup globally with one of the most expansive workforces of teachers.
The startup had planned to go public as early as last year, but delayed the deliberations as the market nosedived amid the weakening global economy. Byju’s said earlier this month that it plans to list its subsidiary, Aakash, next year.
Byju’s reported a gross revenue of $1.258 billion (unaudited) in the financial year that ended in March last year. Between April and July, the startup logged revenue of $570 million, it said earlier.
Byju’s counts Prosus Ventures, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Sequoia Capital India, Silver Lake, Owl Ventures, UBS and Blackrock among its backers and has raised over $6 billion to date.

PayGo solar startup Yellow raises $14 million to scale in Africa,Annie Njanja,2023/06/19,"
Yellow, an asset financier for solar energy and digital devices in Africa, has raised $14 million series B funding in a round led by Convergence Partners with participation from the Energy Entrepreneurs Growth Fund, managed by Triple Jump, in addition to follow-on investment from Platform Investment Partners.
Yellow was founded and launched in Malawi in 2018 by Mike Heyink and Maya Stewart, to initially bring solar energy to the country, which is among those with the lowest access to electricity in the world. It has since grown its footprint across Africa and increased its product offering to include electronics like smartphones.
Following the new funding, Yellow plans to deepen its reach in its current markets Malawi, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia and Madagascar, launch digital and financial products in the near-term, and prepare for future debt funding rounds to ramp up its growth. The new round brings total debt and equity funding raised by Yellow to $45 million.

Seven scaleups hog over 70% of funding to Africa’s solar pay-go ventures

“The newly injected capital is being used to leverage more debt finance to reach more customers with financed smartphones and solar systems. While the business will broaden its product offering to include other mobile financial services, growth will be fueled primarily by deepening our expertise in our existing product categories,” said Yellow founder and CEO, Heyink.
Yellow claims to be profitable having recorded a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 265% over the last four-year period. The startup says its network of 1,100 agents, who source and make applications for the asset finance on behalf of customers through its proprietary Ofeefee app, have enabled it to penetrate and reach over 400,000 customers in its five markets.
The startup’s small home solar system, comprising a 6W-10W panel, 20-50Wh battery, 4 lights, cellphone charger and radio, remains its most popular product. It also sells solar systems with bigger capacities, and smartphones.
For the small and large solar home systems, users pay a deposit of $10 and $68, respectively, and remit the balance through monthly payments spread over six and 24 months.
“It’s incredibly exciting to see the early stages of sustained growth in Africa. The team at Yellow is thrilled to be on the multi-decade journey with the African consumer, to a better life. We have a front-row seat to witness millions of people prospering as a result of joining the digital global economy for the first time,” said Heyink.
Yellow is among the asset financiers that have attracted VC funding this year indicating a sustained appetite for deals in startups making solar energy accessible, following last year’s trend that saw clean tech emerge as the second most-funded sector after fintech. Clean techs attracted $863M in equity or 18% of the total funding raised by African startups, according to 2022 Partech Africa report.
Overall, in the last 10 years startups in Africa’s off-grid solar sector have attracted over $2.3 billion in funding, according to the biennial Gogla-World Bank report released in October last year.
Commenting on the Yellow investment, Convergence Partner CEO, Brandon Doyle, said, “we are excited to be backing the Yellow team. We have been tracking the off-grid solar power asset finance space for many years but have failed to find a business model and team that we felt we could back until now.”
“Yellow’s offering also sits well with our promise to our investors of strong investment returns married with solid social development impact; in this case by tackling the triple challenge of financial inclusion, green energy distribution, and broadband penetration, and doing so profitably while servicing the unbanked communities of the lowest income countries of Africa,” said Doyle.
Asset financiers like Yellow, Sun King and M-Kopa operate pay-go models that offer asset-based financing (pay-to-own) for solar kits and lanterns, products that are hugely popular in Sub-Saharan Africa, where millions of people are off-grid, as national power grids remain underdeveloped. It is estimated that sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 75% of the world’s population without access to electricity.
These companies, some of which offer financing for other assets, have also been quick to add new revenue streams, and to tap debt-financing to further tap and increase their clientele base.

"Seedstars, Fondation Botnar partner to back African startups focused on youth wellbeing",Annie Njanja,2023/06/18,"
Seedstars Capital and Swiss philanthropic foundation Fondation Botnar have launched Seedstars Youth Wellbeing Ventures, a $20 million investment vehicle targeting early-stage startups in Africa that are focused on improving the wellbeing of people below 30 years in low-and-middle-income countries.
The evergreen investment vehicle will back pre-seed to Series A startups including those that advance health services, environmental sustainability and ecological resilience (like access to clean energy), local food security, water and sanitation, waste management, affordable housing, access to employment and safe and sustainable transportation in Tanzania, Ghana, Senegal, Morocco, and Egypt.
Seedstars told TechCrunch that startups will get an initial capital injection of $250,000 and follow-on investments of up to $500,000. It plans to make four initial investments, and two follow-on backing annually, over the next five years.

Seedstars Capital launches to support new fund managers around the world

Seedstars Youth Wellbeing Ventures will make co-investments alongside like-minded investors with the hope of encouraging more capital inflow into Africa. Alongside its co-investor network, it will identify, invest and scale startups with the potential to transform the lives of young people across its target markets.
“There is a major gap in the wellbeing of youth if we compare developed countries with emerging markets. Our goal is to transform cities by creating inclusive urban environments and systems that are truly fit and ready to support the health and wellbeing of the young people who live in emerging markets through the transformational power of digital technology,” said Benjamin Langer, partner at Seedstars Capital, an alternative investment platform launched last year to back new fund managers in emerging and frontier markets.
Langer added that, “by investing in purpose-related venture-backed companies, we can accelerate our target outcome to improve the wellbeing of young people in emerging markets. We are comparing the “acceleration” with some other actions that the partners are pursuing like grants or donations in emerging markets.”
Seedstars and Fondation Botnar have already made their first joint investment in Senegal-based logistics startup Chargel, which matches shippers with transporters. In addition to being a platform for owners of large fleets of trucks, Chargel also pools together independent shippers, giving them new earning opportunities.
Commenting on the launch of the Youth Wellbeing Ventures, Antoine Veyrassat, the venture philanthropy lead at Fondation Botnar said: “Fondation Botnar is excited to join Seedstars in supporting companies that are making a difference.”
“Our shared commitment to improving the health and wellbeing of young people aligns strongly with our investment strategy that takes a market-based approach to philanthropy in addition to our other philanthropic funding, especially as rapid urbanization and the increasing number of young people living in cities present both unique challenges and opportunities,” said Veyrassat.
Fondation Botnar is dedicated to improving the health and wellbeing of young people living in urban areas worldwide.
Seedstars Youth Wellbeing Ventures adds to the growing list of funds under the Seedstars Group, an accelerator and VC that is active globally in more than 30 emerging markets. Its other funds include Seedstars International Ventures I (SIV I), its first global fund for emerging markets with a focus on the pre-seed stage, SIV II, a fund launched last year in collaboration with Patricia Sosrodjojo targeting 100 startups in emerging markets, and Seedstars Africa Ventures, a pan-African early-stage fund.
It also adds to the increasing number of purpose driven funds that have been launched recently in Africa including the Africa People + Planet Fund, by pan-African venture firm Novastar, which is raising over $200 million to invest in startups developing agriculture and climate solutions on the continent, and another one by climate tech VC Equator, targeting startups alleviating the impact of climate change.
Updated to note that Seedstars Youth Wellbeing Ventures is a partnership between Seedstars and Fondation Botnar.

You.com looks to innovation to chip away at Google’s search dominance,Ron Miller,2023/06/18,"
You.com CEO Richard Socher may not be a household name, but if you travel in AI circles, chances are you know who he is. Beginning in 2014 when he wrote his influential doctoral thesis about natural language processing, he has helped pave the way for today’s headline-grabbing AI technology, a fact that doesn’t escape him as he tries to build his next-generation search engine.
He launched MetaMind, shortly after that paper was published, a startup that Salesforce acquired two years later. In fact, as chief scientist at Salesforce, he helped build the AI layer that the company calls Einstein.
After he left Salesforce, he started You.com, a consumer search engine, in 2020. Obviously he’s up for a challenge, but he also recognizes that with time on his side, and an ability to innovate, he has two advantages that could allow his company to begin to chip away at Google’s search hegemony.
He’s not intimidated by the fact that fellow search engine startup Neeva, launched by two Google veterans, was acquired recently by Snowflake after failing to find product-market fit. He says his search engine is already much larger in terms of users than Neeva ever was.
But he also understands that what he is doing is more than theoretical; it’s a business, and he has to look to a future where he is not just burning money but also bringing it in. He has reached the point, three years into his startup journey, where he has to switch focus from growth and start concentrating on revenue, having raised a modest $45 million.
We helped get this party started
While AI research has been ongoing for decades, Socher and his peers at Stanford helped open the door to today’s breakthroughs with their groundbreaking research in 2014. He has continued his research and has published papers as recently as 2020 when he began putting all his efforts into his current company.
He says as a scientist, it’s been amazing to see his research put to work in the ways that it has. “I had this realization the other week, which is as a researcher, if you’re ahead of your time, you’re a visionary. And you get a lot of credit for people using your ideas later, and you’re like ‘Oh, wow, we invented word vectors and contextual vectors, and then prompt engineering and the single model for all of NLP and LLMs for protein design,” Socher told TechCrunch+.

Still leading
VC firm Atomico projects that the amount of venture capital invested in European startups this year will be 52% lower than in 2021. I already wrote about these findings, but there’s a key nuance to the information that we haven’t unpacked yet: discrepancies between countries.
While the slowdown is visible across Europe, Atomico noted that Dealroom and Crunchbase data on capital invested during the first half of this year shows a steeper year-on-year decline in the U.K. than in other leading European countries.
Compared to France and Germany, where tallies are respectively 55% and 44% lower than in H1 2022, the U.K. fell further: 57%.

Deal Dive: Maybe venture debt works for asset managers after all,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/06/17,"
Blackstone last August was looking to put $2 billion toward lending to startups and tech companies, according to The Information. But venture debt lenders remain skeptical that the asset class’s small checks are worth it for asset managers and their large LPs. Recently, a few lenders told me they didn’t think we’d ever see the large credit shops add a venture debt strategy.
Now, BlackRock is saying, “Hold my beer!”
Last week the absolutely sprawling asset manager BlackRock, with its $106 billion market cap, announced that it was going to acquire Kreos Capital, a London-based venture debt lender. Kreos lends to startups across Europe and Israel and has originated €5.2 billion (around $5.68 billion) worth of loans across more than 750 transactions. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, and BlackRock said that the Kreos team would be absorbed into its existing credit group.
BlackRock declined to comment for this story beyond the release, and Kreos could not be reached for comment.
As someone who used to cover corporate debt, this news shocked me. If any of the credit asset managers were to move into venture debt, BlackRock wouldn’t have been my first choice, my second or even in my top 10, really. The firm is just so large and spread across so many asset classes already, I thought it would likely be a pure-play credit shop first. "

The event horizon for when we can expect to end up in (literal) hot water when it comes to climate has come a lot closer. You wanna know how close? The climate deadline is close enough that it is interesting to VCs again. VC is an asset class with a 10-year cycle. In other words: Some of the most powerful money people believe they will see a return on their investments in the next 10 years. In a nutshell, as I wrote in my TC+ column this week, that scares the crap out of me.
Social media dramaaaaaaaaaa
I’m sure Twitter is relieved to see that Reddit is taking many of the headlines this week. The Reddit leadership team seems to have hit the slow-mo button and taken control of a couple of trains before hitting the “full steam ahead” button and pointing the trains at each other.
This slow-motion train crash is quite a thing, and it’s all related to Reddit’s new API pricing. Popular third-party Reddit app Apollo announced it was shutting down, and Reddit’s CEO wasn’t a big fan of how that went down, giving the Apollo developer both barrels in a drama-filled AMA. Reddit goes down briefly, subreddits and moderators were protesting — thousands of them, in fact — and it seems like a lot of them are planning to stay shut down indefinitely. Good heavens, that’s a one-way ticket to Yikes City all around.
Elon shouldn’t be too relieved, though; the bird sanctuary got its own headlines, and most of them were … not super encouraging. On the bright side, Elon didn’t have to CEO anymore, as  Linda Yaccarino officially took the big chair as Twitter CEO. The very next news story was Twitter is being evicted from its Boulder office over unpaid rent. Whoops. Alex broke down how far Twitter’s advertising revenues have fallen. TL;DR: It ain’t pretty.

Easier money for YouTube creators: Ivan reports that YouTube is lowering the barrier to be eligible for its monetization program.
Dark clouds in the blue sky: Morgan reports that Bluesky’s growing pains strain its relationship with Black users.
LOL just kidding, as you were: Taylor reports that Twitch backtracks on changes to branded content rules after streamer backlash.

The robots are coming! The robots are coming!
AI keeps dominating our news coverage, as there’s a lot of movement in that space.
France’s Mistral AI blows raised a $113 million seed round to take on OpenAI. It may prove to have an advantage in the notoriously privacy-focused EU — but, not gonna lie, I also raised an eyebrow at the company’s $260 million valuation — that’s a lot of equity to give up in a seed round.
There was a whole bunch of corporate AI news, not all of which is relevant to startups, but the recap is that Meta open sources an AI-powered music generator, while Itoka wants to license AI-generated music via the blockchain. I have made little secret of my disdain for blockchain tech in general (and the painful irony of blockchain for climate in particular), but that one seems like a particularly potent nonstarter. Prove me wrong, Itoka, prove me wrong.
Apropos potent — Morgan argues that Blush, the AI lover from the same team as Replika, is more than just a sexbot. I’m kind of into it, actually — sexting is fun, and I’m intrigued by the creative possibilities of getting saucy with a robot. As long as I don’t get a textually transmitted infection. Ahem.

Half a b-AI-llion dollars: Kyle reports that Salesforce pledges to invest $500M in generative AI startups.

Dude, where’s my … do we even call ‘em cars anymore?
Carvana was on an incredible share-price rally, until it hit the guard rails. Harri and Alex pick apart the soaring heights, the crushing depths and the weird, in-between bounce-back the company seems to find itself in. The used-car platform saw an epic stock surge where the shorted stock surged 56%, as the company predicts record profits. Sucks if you were one of the WallStreetBets bros sure of the company’s demise, but I’m sure the startup itself was relieved.
The other big story that’s been on our radar is Tesla and its charging standard. We reported that GM and Ford could help spark a charging standards war and concluded that EV charger networks are turning to the Tesla standard, as support for it accelerates. On TC+, Tim wonders whether Tesla’s Supercharger network will strain under the weight of GM and Ford deals — but also that Tesla has a winner on its hands. Back in February, Google added EV chargers to its Google Maps product, and this week, Apple followed suit — Apple Maps will show open spots near you.
Also this week, I lamented that EVs are going backward, in that they are getting bigger, heavier and stupider — only for Harri to report on two counterpoints: Telo bets America is ready for a dreamy little pickup and Fiat’s little Topolino concept that looks totes adorbs. Yass.

Bad startup! No IPO for you! Alex reports that Turo’s Q1 2023 results indicate it may be awhile until we see its IPO.
Look East: There’s a lot of interesting EV news happening around the world, in particular in China. BYD is overtaking Tesla, but it chooses to forego the U.S. market for now. Meanwhile, Nio said it wasn’t going to join an EV price war, but now it’s cutting $4K across all models.

BuzzCutt steers the sober curious toward booze-free bar and restaurant options,Taylor Hatmaker,2023/06/16,"
If you don’t drink, navigating nightlife, bars and even eating out can be an exercise in frustration. Non-alcoholic options are popping up everywhere, but for every neighborhood haunt with a booze-free beer, there are 10 spots where you’ll be left high and dry — usually with a flat soda water plus sad lime in hand.
BuzzCutt, a new app out of Portland, Ore., might not change that overnight, but it does aim to shepherd non-drinkers, mindful drinkers and the sober-curious toward their best local options. The app, available nationwide now for iOS and Android, collects local hotspots with non-alcoholic options, all in a sunny, egg yolk yellow, map-based interface that’s easy to use.
BuzzCutt was created by Olivia and Sarah Sears, a queer married couple who started pining for more robust non-alcoholic options after the pandemic prompted some soul searching around their relationship with alcohol. Both Olivia and Sarah work full-time jobs in ad tech and launched the app together — their first — to create a tool they knew would be really useful for a lot of people.
Americans are drinking less than ever (prohibition notwithstanding) for reasons ranging from health and wellness to a more open dialogue around addiction to broader society-wide shifts in social habits. More people are becoming sober now, but a lot more people are either reducing their alcohol consumption or just becoming more thoughtful about how and when they drink. BuzzCutt is designed to capture the full spectrum of that experience.
Image Credits: BuzzCutt/App Store
“What has been really important to us from the beginning of the brand is like, we haven’t used language that exclusively implies ‘you have to be sober to do this,’” Olivia Sears told TechCrunch in an interview. “We like to think of it as like ‘access points’ for people; BuzzCutt is an access point to choosing non-alcoholic drinks for whatever reason.”
Those reasons have converged in recent years to prompt a parallel explosion in non-alcoholic drink options, with fancy bitters, canned mocktails, NA liquor and alcohol-free beer popping up everywhere. And by now, mercifully, a lot of it is getting pretty good.
BuzzCutt relies on all of those products to map out local non-alcoholic options, a trick it pulls off by sifting through distribution data and tracking what bars, restaurants, groceries and venues are stocking prominent N/A brands. This method sweeps quite a few options into the app’s directory, but wouldn’t catch a bar that specializes in bespoke mocktails, for example, if that spot doesn’t also stock a popular N/A brand like Athletic beer, Wilderton spirits or something else in BuzzCutt’s data flow.
The app launched this week with its core functionality, but BuzzCutt’s endgame is more involved. As it stands, an enthusiastic user could flag a missing entry from the app’s directory, like in the case of the database-eluding legendary mocktail menu, but the app generally plans to add a lot more community features across the board.
Sarah and Olivia Sears, BuzzCutt founders
“Right now, it is pretty bare bones; we wanted to make sure that we got a really solid tool framework out there for people to have in the palm of their hand,” Sears said.
BuzzCutt users can also rate different locations collected in the app and leave tips. The team initially planned to pull in external reviews for the listings it indexes but quickly realized that someone who doesn’t drink would have a “totally different” lens on a bar or restaurant’s selection. Now, the app only collects reviews from BuzzCutt’s own community — a smart way to build trust and avoid diluting its much-needed utility.
“[A local bar] might be really cool, but for somebody who isn’t comfortable being around like a giant wall of fucking whiskey, that might not be the vibe,” Sears said. “And that could be captured in user-generated reports about the place.”
As funding allows, BuzzCutt plans to add user profiles and other social features, as well as news and deals that would be of interest to sober and sober-adjacent users who are increasingly building community around a no-alcohol or low-alcohol lifestyle.
“Community is huge, especially for sober, sober-curious [and] mindful drinkers — you know, like having sources and support in that way,” Sears told TechCrunch. “So that’s definitely our next phase.”
Within BuzzCutt, users can filter local results by category (sports bars, wine bars, etc.), beverage type (spirits, bitters, canned mocktails and the like) and popular N/A brands, which they’ve been working closely with. The brand filter option in particular is useful since not all N/A options are created equal and sober people, this author included, will go to great lengths to find their favorites.
Personally, I’d drive halfway across the state if it meant I could enjoy my favorite alcohol-free wine by the glass out in a restaurant rather than in my kitchen. The luxury of abundant, good drink options is one that I definitely took for granted before I quit drinking years ago and it’s something that a surprising amount of social rituals are tied up in when you really get down to it.
Due to a relative dearth of alcohol-free options, sober and sober-ish people are often very motivated and enthusiastic when it comes to finding products they like and reestablishing social rituals that they may have been missing out on (happy hour, pre-gaming, wine tastings…. it’s a big list!).
That same passion, and the desire to unlock more non-alcoholic options — and thus more activities that people can enjoy without drinking – drives the BuzzCutt team, and ultimately the community it plans to serve.
“That kind of stuff is so powerful to us,” Sears said. “I definitely want to ride the wave of people getting curious and thinking about it as an exploration.”

Revolut sees its valuation reconsidered as public markets stir the fintech pot,Anna Heim,2023/06/16,"
What are neobanks worth? That’s a question on many people’s minds, especially the investors and employees of the richly valued fintechs that have been waiting for IPOs to make a comeback.
Overall, neobanks mostly seem to be doing OK, especially those across the pond. But new data from a venture capital firm indicates that at least some investors are still sorting out how to value them: U.K.-based Revolut saw its valuation being reduced earlier this year, and the company is once again in the headlines for reasons that it won’t like. One of Revolut’s backers, Molten Ventures recently reported its own financial performance and the data indicates that Revolut’s valuation is yet again being reexamined.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

Formerly known as Draper Esprit, Molten Ventures is listed on the London Stock Exchange and shares more information about its holdings than most VC firms thanks to its corporate structure. Importantly, this gives us good visibility into its portfolio companies’ changing worth as well. Molten notes that its fair market values for portfolio companies are set by its Audit, Risk and Valuations Committee and are sensitive to public comps.
The latest from Molten contains a wealth of useful data that we’ll dive deeper into in the coming days, but today, let’s focus on Revolut and try to sort the company more neatly with its peers.
Revolut by the numbers
As far as we’re aware, Revolut’s last major funding round was a massive $800 million Series E that afforded it a post-money valuation of $33 billion, per Crunchbase data. That round marked the neobank as not only one of the most valuable fintech startups in the world, but one of the most richly valued private tech companies, period. "

Can emerging managers do a better job of expanding access to capital than established VC firms?
Because many funds with less than $50M under management “are led by those from underrepresented backgrounds,” there’s “an opportunity for less experienced managers to step in and back the founders being overlooked and ignored on a higher level,” reports Dominic Madori-Davis.

Weaving data from the Bessemer Cloud Index and Altimeter Capital Partner Jamin Ball together with recent news coverage, Alex Wilhelm found reason for guarded optimism:

"It’s not just hype, corporate America is making huge bets on AI transforming their businesses",Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/16,"
Hype or not, the potential of AI has tech companies enamored, and businesses large and small have begun betting heavily on efforts that leverage AI in some fashion to spur their growth to new heights.
These wagers have come in many forms. Firms like PwC and Accenture have promised to spend heavily on the sector, while others are creating new AI-focused capital pools and directly investing in AI-focused startups. A large number of tech companies today are also tapping their operating cash flow to add AI to their existing products and services.
There’s an all-out race to leverage AI to add more utility and value to products, and to reap a portion of the resulting demand in AI-powered products and services.

For tech titans, AI prominence is the new measuring stick

It appears this sector is resilient to the broader macroeconomic headwinds that have been affecting deal-making and fundraising in the tech world. If trends in deal-making continue, this year could go on to see the third-highest number of deals completed by AI startups in the expansion stage, according to Deloitte’s latest Road to Next report.
Investors are paying attention, too, and nearly every tech company’s quarterly results conference call has been full of analysts asking how the company in question will find growth or operating leverage with AI-related tooling.
TechCrunch wrote earlier this year that a tech company’s AI posture was among the most important measures of their present worth. That has only become more true since.

VCs continue to pour dollars into generative AI

This afternoon, we’re sorting through major promises, investments and some product news to underscore how broad the AI push has been in the larger enterprise software space.
Is the current AI boom a startup story? Yes. It is a Big Tech story? Yes. Are we seeing an entirely new generation of software being built and sold? Yes. Let’s get our heads around just how broad the AI moment truly is.
Big checks, big bets
Today, it seems nearly pedestrian that Microsoft in 2019 put $1 billion into OpenAI for licensing its tech and built a custom supercomputer in the Azure cloud. The figure was later dwarfed by $10 billion arrangement between the companies, but Redmond did help set the tone for how much capital was going to flow — and perhaps how much the sector would need — into AI-related work.

Often, when people ask me how the venture and startup market is doing, I have to take a moment. The easy answer is that we’re seeing a downturn. The correct answer is more nuanced: There is indeed a downturn, but it is impacting some much more than others.
One example of this as clear as day is Mistral AI’s recent $113 million seed fundraise. The company, founded by three French white men, was started just four weeks ago and doesn’t even have a product yet. That round, which values the company at $260 million, is being hailed as Europe’s largest seed round to date.
Mistral AI’s fundraise is, in some ways, unique to this point in time. There is much frenzy around AI right now, and this round did see some U.S. and international investors participating, which you don’t often see happening for many French startups.
But there are some things that don’t change, regardless of what’s hyped. The market may be improving for AI startups, but we’ve yet to see much money going to women or people of color. Don’t get me wrong, women are receiving money for building in AI (Black founders, not so much), but not at the rates at which men appear to be. Of course, these three French men fit the profile of those who are likely to receive a $113 million pre-seed check: ambitious Google’s Deep Mind and Meta alums, two of whom have diplomas from the École Polytechnique, practically the MIT of France.
Sure, there is more of an effort to back women in France today, but the fundraising environment for some French Black founders remains both obviously and discreetly discriminatory, which is unsurprising given the overall treatment of Black individuals in the country. There isn’t enough data on how many women and people of color are even looking for funding in France (tracking minority metrics in France is illegal, so such data does not exist), making it hard to gauge how much underrepresented founders raise.

Pitch Deck Teardown: Netmaker’s $2.3M seed deck,Haje Jan Kamps,2023/06/16,"
In a world where people working from home still need access to networks and a ton of other use cases, Netmaker lets users create and manage VPN connections without the learning curve, as Romain wrote last year when the company announced its seed round.
Netmaker submitted its pitch deck to TechCrunch+, and today we’re taking a close look at the deck the company used to raise its $2.3 million round.

We’re looking for more unique pitch decks to tear down, so if you want to submit your own, here’s how you can do that. 

Slides in this deck
Netmaker has a tight, 14-slide deck. The company tells me it redacted certain sensitive data (such as financial information), but those parts have been marked clearly so the deck still makes sense in context.

Three things to love
Netmaker is sharing a lot of information in just a handful of slides about what could be perceived to be a pretty complex, technical space. The company has done an incredible job of keeping things accessible.
Traction is king
[Slide 8] Great traction forgives all other sins, and this graph is pointed in the right direction. Image Credits: NetmakerHaving powerful traction is great for any startup, as rapid growth implies a company has found something important in the market and can attract new customers.
That said, some of these stats seem like vanity metrics to me. For example, why is it important to have 5,500 stars on GitHub? Does that translate into customers? Why is the 1,000 community members number important? Netmaker could have tried to connect the dots: Why are these metrics important to the company and how do they show rapid growth?
I did find myself stumbling on the claim of “50% MoM growth for 6 months.” It’s hard to overstate how impressive that is, and as an investor, I’m finding myself itching to learn what the growth engine is here. How much did the company have to spend to acquire those customers? How can it continue along this trajectory?
How it works
[Slide 7] How it works. Image Credits: NetmakerWhen your target audience is people who design, implement and maintain network infrastructure, you can bet that most investors you’re speaking to will not be fully au fait with the intricacies of the market. I do know VCs who have deep domain knowledge, but even the ones who are experienced may have pretty out of date information. The landscape in this space, like in so many others, changes nearly every day.
This “How it works” slide may be a little too simple, to be honest. I’d have loved to see screenshots of the actual provisioning/set-up screens to understand how hard it is to configure a network or add machines. Having said that, this is a great base-level introduction to explain the “Here’s what we do and why it matters” part of the story.
A clear vision of the future
I love how Netmaker pulls no punches in its vision for the future of its industry. This vision may prove to be inaccurate, but the company is not confused. It’s refreshing to see such clarity and the company’s ability to hook into its vision:
[Slide 3] Clarity of its vision of the future. This is one of my favorite slides in this deck. Image Credits: Netmaker 

			The company does something very right here: It paints a clear, bold and differentiated view of the future.					


Now, you could argue whether this is correct. Will nobody at all own their own networking hardware? Will there be no need to configure complex networks? I’m not a network architect, but that sounds like a bit of a stretch. At the very least, the internet itself and the underpinning technologies that support Netmaker will presumably need some amount of hardware.
Nonetheless, I think the company does something right here: It paints a clear, bold and differentiated view of the future and backs that up with the steps it must take to put itself at the forefront of this movement.
In the rest of this teardown, we’ll take a look at three things Netmaker could have improved or done differently — along with its full pitch deck!
 "
Smaller VCs are having an impact on diverse investors and founders,Dominic-Madori Davis,2023/06/16,"
Smaller funds, those that have $50 million or less in assets under management, are helping to usher in a new wave of diversity within venture capital. And the reasons for this are simple.
The latest crop of investors stems from historically overlooked or marginalized communities that are setting up funds and then investing back in those funds. “Small funds operate with a sense of purpose, leveraging their limited resources to drive positive change and foster diversity in the entrepreneurial landscape,” B. Pagels-Minor, the founder of DVRGNT Ventures, told TechCrunch+.
Emerging managers often target early-stage companies with diversity in mind, which is important because many of these companies do not last long enough to make it to, say, a Series B. The dearth of later-stage Black companies is in part tied to a lack of early support at the pre-seed and seed-stage levels.
Though many small funds do not explicitly have a diversity mandate, a considerable number of these funds are led by those from underrepresented backgrounds; larger funds, on the other hand, are lacking talent from diverse communities. This in itself creates an opportunity for smaller fund managers to step in and back the founders being overlooked and ignored on a higher level.
Ramzi Rafih, the founder of the London-based No Label Ventures, has a fund that focuses on backing immigrant founders within Europe. He says that the community is still undervalued in the startup ecosystem compared to the U.S., where such immigrants account for more than 50% of all unicorns. “If we can focus on solving obstacles faced by immigrant founders and make them more visible to VCs, we think we can deliver outsized returns to our investors,” he told TechCrunch+. This means often being the first investor in a round and connecting a founder with other investors and corporate clients, as well as helping with visa issues.
 

			“It is crucial to recognize that a wealth of data supports the notion that embracing diversity can de-risk investments and lead to better financial outcomes.”							B. Pagels-Minor



No Label is trying to fill the gap left by some larger funds, which often don’t support diverse talent and instead leverage the network they’ve built over the years. Many larger funds also simply do not know how to diversify their network, or they don’t know or agree that investing with diversity in mind can create outsized returns. "
How two founders approach building ethical AI startups in health care,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/06/15,"
The speed at which AI companies are evolving is making a lot of people nervous. That’s because moving fast could lead to potential ethical issues that aren’t able to be addressed.
Building ethical algorithms takes time. Models that were built quickly are more likely to have ingrained bias while lacking the necessary guardrails in place to keep them from causing unnecessary damage. If done in haste, or done poorly, AI models have the potential to cause real harm in certain sensitive industries, such as health care.
But, of course, many of the worries center around new founders riding into the space on the hype train as opposed to the numerous entrepreneurs who started building models with care years before the current market dynamics.
Amy Brown, the founder and CEO of Authenticx, a startup that helps health care companies gain insights from their customer call center data using AI, said on TechCrunch’s Found podcast that those looking to build AI algorithms should recognize the potential negative consequences of models being built incorrectly.

VCs joining the climate race should scare the daylights out of you,Haje Jan Kamps,2023/06/15,"
Venture capital, as an asset class, is an industry of short-term wins. Most funds have a 10-year cycle: two years of initial investments; then two to three years of company building and follow-on investments; after that, five or six years of thumb-twiddling and waiting for the ship to come in, and maybe placing a last bet on the most promising companies in the fund portfolio.
This model forms part of a VC’s investment thesis; it also includes where the leads for potential investment come from (known as “sourcing”), along with the investment stage (pre-seed, seed, Series A, etc.), and any geographic or vertical or market limitations to the fund. The investment cycle has remained remarkably consistent over the history of venture capital: Wait 10 years, and the funds invested have (hopefully) multiplied.

Your investor has an investment thesis. Here’s why you should care

The upshot of these investment cycles is that venture capital is best positioned to invest in the type of companies that are in a hot market, with predictably high user and revenue growth, and a somewhat obvious liquidity event outcome, whether through acquisition or IPO. All of this is why subscription-based companies — and in particular cloud-based subscription software companies — are so well suited to VC investment. B2B SaaS companies that know the market, know how to leverage data-driven growth and have a clear customer acquisition funnel are as close as it gets to a safe bet in venture.
Another “sure-fire bet” for venture capitalists is when the future can be predicted, even a little bit. Big shifts in legislation is one example: Build software that helps companies stay in compliance with certain laws likely to pass soon, and you know you have a guaranteed customer base. Another sure-fire bet with a guaranteed user base: Watching the population curve and realizing there are a lot of people about to retire and need support. None of this is new; VC firms have built specialized theses around these types of huge moves.
A recent McKinsey report suggests that “investments in climate technology are still increasing, defying the headwinds that affected most capital markets.”
Both VCs and founders alike love to talk about how they want to make the world a better place. That’s lovely and all, and it may even be true for some of them. But make no mistake: Venture capital is an asset class like any other, and general partners have a fiduciary responsibility to their limited partners. Everyone may agree that it’s lovely to make the world better, but unless the investors start to see a return on their investments, that firehose of investment very quickly gets reduced to a trickle.

Luminoah’s quest to reinvent tube feeding attracts new funding,Devin Coldewey,2023/06/15,"
When someone is very ill or has had surgery that interrupts ordinary ways of eating and drinking, tube feeding is a life-saving necessity, but it’s cumbersome and uncomfortable to use. Luminoah aims to change this with a reinvented tube-feeding device that’s more portable, discreet and easy to use, and it has raised $6 million to bring its design to market.
Ordinary tube feeding setups are generally found in hospitals and are wheeled around like IVs and other gear. That makes sense in a controlled medical environment, but what if you or your loved one has to do it for months in and out of the hospital? Wheeling a tube feeding mechanism around a home or school is much more difficult and probably quite unpleasant.
Luminoah founder Neal Piper was confronted with this issue when his toddler required tube feeding during treatment for cancer (he is fine now, by the way).
“During his treatment, Noah was tethered to a pole-mounted tube feeding system for up to 15 hours per day. This outdated technology limited his mobility, reduced his quality of life, and presented numerous well-documented health risks,” explained Piper in a news release.
This is often the case with medical devices: The old way works fine but hasn’t been updated in years or decades due to the cost of development and complexity of entering the medical device market. Piper and Luminoah seem to have struck a chord with investors, however, leading to this $6 million A round led by Fry’s Path Capital, with participation from Sands Capital, CAV Angels, Virginia Venture Partners and 757 Angels.
“Our system has made substantial improvements to the size of the hardware allowing our engineering team to redefine the traditional approach to IV-pole bound infusion pumps,” Piper told TechCrunch. “Users will enjoy a modern UI/UX that affords them discretion while feeding paired with a device that allows them to go about their day unencumbered.” (As the design of the device is not final, the company is not yet publishing images of it.)
Being a connected device, it would also collect metrics for medical providers to check akin to what they would learn if the patient were in a hospital room with a traditional pole-mounted system.
The plan is to make the device reimbursable by insurance, though it’s a long road to get there. The funding should at least take it to prototype stage.
“With our newly raised round, we will rapidly advance development and prepare for the commercialization of our system. We are excited to grow our team further as we continue to march towards these exciting milestones,” he said.
Quality of life is a genuinely important factor in recovery, especially among young people who have yet to develop the kind of coping mechanisms adults use to get through tough times like cancer treatment. Reducing the discomfort and increasing the dignity of live-preserving treatments isn’t just a “nice to have” — it will likely contribute to better patient outcomes.

Psychedelics startup Nue Life Health rolls out free version of its ketamine therapy tracking app,Mike Butcher,2023/06/15,"
Nue Life Health is a U.S.-based telemedicine startup that combines psychedelic-assisted therapies and a health tracking app. Previously, the app was only offered as part of its own internal service. However, the startup is now opening up its “Nue app” and its “Nue score” available for free to any patient undergoing ketamine therapy, not just its own. The FDA has approved a variant of Ketamine called “Esketamine” as a medication for depression.
The Nue Life app allows patients undergoing ketamine therapy in the U.S. to join Nue Life’s membership services to complement their drug therapy. The app has biometric data integration (Apple Healthkit and Google Fit), and accesses the ‘Nue Score’ progress tracking. The at-home ketamine therapy combines music therapies and a data-led, ‘quantified self’ approach.
All users in the United States who are undergoing ketamine therapy across all treatment modalities, including via lozenges, intramuscular (IM) and intravenous (IV), will be able to access the Nue Life app.
As a result, it’s likely that this will expand Nue Life’s market reach, as it rolls out these new services.
Last year Nue Life said raised a $23 million Series A equity financing led by Obvious Ventures (co-founded by Ev Williams, co-founder of Twitter), which was part venture debt and part equity. This followed a seed round in 2021.
The company has also now completed an extra $1.9m financing round from existing investors to back the app roll-out for free.
Nue Life says it now delivers “at-home” ketamine therapy to over eight thousand patients across the U.S. combined with libraries, apps, and aftercare programs.
In a statement, Nue Life co-founder and CEO Juan Pablo Cappello said: “We have seen that patients who take advantage of our full program experience a 20-30% improvement over the baseline of drug-only therapy. We are now excited to make all these tools, content and preparation and after-care programs available to all users that may be undergoing ketamine treatment with providers across the US, including at-home or within clinics or offices.”
Nue Life has also appointed Dr. Frank Drummond as its new Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Drummond was formerly the national CMO of HCA’s behavioral health practice.
Nue Life competes with Mindbloom, as well as Field Trip Health, which also has physical treatment centers.
In March this year, TechCrunch interviewed Mindbloom’s CEO Dylan Beynon about how he saw the future of psychedelic mental health.

Glystn lets creators bulk reply to multiple followers across social media platforms,Lauren Forristal,2023/06/15,"
Founded by Google AdMob and Yahoo alums, Glystn is a tool for content creators that allows them to engage with followers, gather insights and read/answer comments from multiple social media platforms all in one place. The startup announced the public launch of the web app, as well as $4 million in seed funding.
The seed round was led by Eniac Ventures, Hannah Grey VC and Future Perfect Ventures. Glystn is also backed by angels Michael Spiegelman, Netflix’s VP of content and business product innovation, and Craig Sherman, managing director of Meritech.
“We really believe that Glystn and their multi-platform creator analytics is building that infrastructure and platform to solve the problem in this next phase of growth, customer acquisition, brand awareness and authenticity in the coming years,” Jessica Peltz-Zatulove, partner at Hannah Grey, told TechCrunch.
Glystn, dubbed a “community engagement engine,” uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to scan thousands of comments and threads from Discord and YouTube and categorizes them, giving influencers the ability to learn what the trending topics are within their community. Users have access to insights and analytics, such as top messages, repeat engagers and trending segments or videos.
Notably, influencers can individually and bulk-respond to subscribers, sending customized responses to multiple followers that comment about the same topic.
However, co-founder and CEO Ethan Fassett told us, “We do not enable creators to simply message their entire communities in mass direct replies… this keeps messaging targeted to relevant recipients at all times.”
Creators can also invite followers to their Discord, launch polls and more.
Image Credits: Glystn
Currently, the platform only integrates across Discord and YouTube—at least for now. However, the company plans to add others soon, Fassett explained, who previously worked at Yahoo as a senior product manager. Fassett declined to name which social media platforms it plans to add.
If the platform manages to combine most of the popular platforms like Instagram, Twitter and TikTok, we could see this being a relevant tool for creators. Influencers are increasingly relying on multiple social media channels to engage with audiences and earn enough revenue. YouTube ad revenue — which declined 2.6% year over year — arguably isn’t enough on its own for full-time creators to comfortably make a living. YouTube recently lowered the requirements for its YouTube Partner Program, giving smaller creators (500 subs or more) access to monetization tools.
The recent funding will mainly go toward the product, which will eventually adopt a tiered subscription model for solo creators, larger creators (over one million followers) and brands. Glystn is currently offering a free trial to users.
Founded in 2021 by Fassett and co-founder Michael Rowehl, former director of technology at Google AdMob, Glystn has over 20 pilot partners, including Louis Weisz, Steve Mould, EmperorLemon, AJ Rafael, Podcast Junkies, RollingLive Studios and Fox Sports, among others.
Weisz, a YouTuber with nearly 730,000 subscribers and over 4,000 Discord members, spoke with TechCrunch about Glystn, expressing how connected he feels to his followers since using the platform. From a brand perspective, Weisz also mentioned how helpful Glystn is for sponsors to get a better idea of the target audience and what products they’ll respond to.
“The biggest time save is how easy it is to see what your audience is talking about on the whole at a glance,” Weisz said. “[Glystn] is a way to get a hold of your audience in real-time as opposed to just making assumptions based on what videos your audience clicks on.”
Updated 6/15/23 at 11:30 a.m. ET with the correction to launch date (it launched today) and removal of the statement that the total funding raised was $4.75 million.

"Wargraphs, a gaming startup with only one employee and no outside funding, sells for $54M",Ingrid Lunden,2023/06/15,"
While the U.K. and U.S. try to block Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision over concerns it will kill competition in games distribution, competition appears to be alive and well in another (smaller) area of gaming: modding and analytics.
Wargraphs, a one-man-band startup behind a popular companion app for League of Legends called Porofessor, which helps players track and improve their playing stats, is getting acquired for up to €50 million ($54 million), half up front and half based on meeting certain earnings and growth targets.
MOBA Networks, a company founded out of Sweden that buys, grows and runs online gaming communities (MOBA is short for “multiplayer online battle arena”), is buying the startup and its existing products. The plan is to expand them to more markets, in particular across Asia, and to build analytics for more titles.
I write “startup”, but that might be with the loosest interpretation of the term. There is only a single employee, the mild-mannered Jean-Nicholas, and he has also entirely bootstrapped the business on his own. But that hasn’t held him back.
Wargraphs currently also builds analytics for Legends of Runeterra and Teamfight Tactics, but the League of Legends business has been its biggest it by far. Porofessor has had 10 million downloads of its app on Overwolf — which is where Porofessor was built — and more than 1.25 million daily active users if you combine traffic both from that platform and its own direct website.
The company, such as it is, has been around for some 10 years, has pretty much always been profitable with revenues of €12.3 million in its last fiscal year.
The acquisition underscores an interesting leitmotif in the current world of startups. We’re coming out of a particularly bullish 10 years, where startups raised huge amounts of funding at vertiginous valuations, sometimes (okay, let’s be honest, OFTEN) with very little in the way of revenues or sound business models behind them, sometimes without even legitimate products to their name.
Now, valuations are definitely lower, and funding is not as easy to raise, especially for consumer-focused products. But in that context, Wargraphs and Jean-Nicholas are examples of how a completely different approach can be just as lucrative, if not more, in the consumer segment.
The deal also speaks to an interesting evolution in consumer technology.
Gaming is huge business these days. At $68.7 billion Microsoft’s contested Activision acquisition would be not just the biggest in gaming but the biggest deal in the technology sector overall.
But companies like MOBA, Overwolf — last valued, in 2021, at a more modest-sounding $515 million, according to PitchBook data — and Wargraphs are examples of how that’s evolving: Games are at the center of larger ecosystems of products and services that can in themselves also become significant areas of value, even if they’re not the blockbusters at the center of those ecosystems.
(Case in point: The transaction closed a month ago, but Overwolf is trumpeting it at the moment to shine some light on its own platform as a ripe place to grow new avenues in gaming.)
Beyond that, new chapters in gaming — courtesy of new interactive headsets like the Vision Pro, and advances in areas like generative AI — will open the door to even more of that ecosystem development, I suspect.
Having said all that, Jean-Nicholas knows what he wants to build next — “a game,” he told me. Specifically, a card game that will compete against Hearthstone, coincidentally published by Activision Blizzard. He has no plans to raise outside funding for this, but he might hire an employee or two.

European startups still have a long way to go to achieve gender parity,Romain Dillet,2023/06/15,"
According to a new study from Sista and the Boston Consulting Group, women are still underrepresented in the European tech ecosystem. Only 22% of startups created in 2022 included a woman on the founding team. And when you look at women-only founding teams, that number drops to 10%. That means that, yes, 78% of European startups founded in 2022 only had male founders.
To put it another way, one in two women partner with men to create a startup, but only one in 10 men partner with women when it’s time to launch a startup.
This year’s study focused on five European countries in particular — France, the U.K., Germany, Spain and Sweden. While women are still very much underrepresented in France, the U.K., Germany and Spain, Swedish startups are faring better — at least slightly. In Sweden, nearly one in three startups have at least one woman on the founding team.
This is what it looks like:
Image Credits: Sista, BCG
In the U.S., startups with all-women founding teams received 1.9% of VC funds that were invested in 2022. In Europe, women-only teams capture 7% of angel and pre-seed funding. But that number drops drastically as you look at late-stage startups. Only 2% of Series D rounds (or later) were raised by startups founded by women only.
That means that the financing gap increases as startups become more mature. That also means that there are less role models even though role models play a critical part when it comes to inspiring newcomers to start a startup.
Startups with at least one women founder fare better. In 2022, mixed teams raised €12.1 million on average while men-only teams raised €17 million. As for women-only teams, investors only chose to invest an average of €4.2 million on those companies.
Image Credits: Sista, BCG
Those funding discrepancies could be explained with the original and main issue in the European tech ecosystem — women are underrepresented across the board, from startup founders to investors and tech executives.
That’s why Sista has a charter for investors and VC firms to enhance gender parity. By 2025, Sista hopes that 25% of startups funded by “investor allies” will have at least one woman co-founder. And that number should rise to 30% by 2030 in order to reach 50% by 2050.

Women-founded startups raised 1.9% of all VC funds in 2022, a drop from 2021

Deepchecks snags $14M seed to continuously validate ML models,Ron Miller,2023/06/15,"
As companies increasingly rely on machine learning models, it’s imperative that they continuously check the models to make sure they are working as intended and that the data is valid, unbiased and not corrupted in any way.
Deepchecks, an Israeli startup has come up with a solution to continuously test models from development through production. Today, the company announced a $14 million seed investment and the general availability of the open source version of the solution. The company also has a commercial product, Deepchecks Hub, that it began testing earlier this year.
CEO Philip Tannor and CTO Shir Chorev spent time in the Israeli military where they worked on machine learning. Chorev said they learned firsthand about the power and limitations of the technology, and that’s why they decided to start a company to work on quality-checking models.
“So both Philip and I were both in positions of leading AI research and bringing models to production. And we both saw the huge value potential that the algorithms in AI in general have, but alongside that we also noticed that they do face some quite significant challenges, specifically being able to actually do what they’re supposed to be doing and doing it properly,” Chorev told TechCrunch.
She says it’s hard to know what’s going on inside these models without tools like Deepchecks, which help data scientists make sure the data they are using are not biased, misinformed or based on corrupt input data – and generally performing well over time.
She and Tannor, being practitioners, realized that what was lacking was a tool to help continuously check these models throughout the process to test and validate different aspects of the model like the data’s integrity. So like any good entrepreneurs, they built the tool they wanted and open sourced it. More recently they also built a commercial version of the product, one that provides standard enterprise features like strong security and authentication.
“We brought quite a lot of understanding and hands-on experience in the field and also knowing the problem and what we would have wanted,” she said. Those experiences were relevant and helpful as they built the company. The company reports the open source product has been downloaded over 500,000 times and is being used by the likes of AWS, Booking.com and Wix, as well as regulated companies they can’t name publicly.
The company launched in 2020 and took about a year and a half to launch the first version of the open source tool.
Chorev recognizes that she is a relative rarity as a female co-founder, but she says she has always been interested in fields dominated by males and that has only driven her throughout her career. “Personally, I do feel that from a young age that this wasn’t something that was going to stop me. Instead, it’s like okay, it’s harder, so I’m gonna push and get it,” she said.
“I mean, it’s a challenging route, any way you choose it, but I do try to be accessible to help others to encourage people, whether they’re females or males, to take this path if that’s what they want.”
Today, the company has about 15 employees with plans to grow that number by 25-30% this year. She is concerned about building a diverse workforce, even while recognizing it can be a challenge for a young company. “It is a big challenge and we do put the effort in order to encourage diversity now, and also going forward as we grow,” she said.
Today’s funding round is really the combination of two tranches of money, a $4.4 million pre-seed round when they launched and $9.5 million, which closed at the end of last year. The investment was led by Alpha Wave Ventures with participation from Hetz Ventures and Grove Ventures.

"An investor, an operator, and their plan to upskill Africa’s workforce",Tage Kene-Okafor,2023/06/15,"
One out of three tech jobs globally are filled by necessary skilled labor, and according to the World Economic Forum (WEF), this is one of the biggest concerns of global business leaders.
Over 50% of the organizations that these leaders manage, in a survey, say they have lost competitive advantage due to talent shortages. The bad news is that the situation might not improve for these companies in the coming years, as the WEF projects that 77% of the 150 million new jobs created by 2030 will require digital skills and young people might not be prepared to fill them.
In Africa, hundreds of millions of youths are expected to join the continent’s workforce in the next decade. Over 200 million jobs will require digital skills in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the International Finance Corporation. But the challenge with Africa’s talent shortage, unlike the rest of the world, is that while the barriers to gaining these digital skills, such as the digital divide and unequal access to quality education, are conspicuous, what’s gone on the radar for so long is upskilling those with digital skills.
Upskilling employees (from soft skills such as communication, decision making and problem-solving to hard skills showing technical knowledge and foundational skills like teamwork) is a headache that most executives, managers and HR operators across small- to large- African enterprises have had to deal with for several years. And it’s a first-hand frustration that Seni Sulyman and Kayode Oyewole, both investors and operators, have seen founders complain about during extensive conversations.
Online courses and mentorship with a local context
A few years back, Sulyman was the vice president of Global Operations at Andela, where he helped scale the company across Africa and had teams in the U.S. With a decade of experience working at Andela, some Fortune 500 companies in the U.S. and angel investing (including as a venture partner at Ventures Platform) Sulyman clearly understands the role that deliberate growth and development played in improving tech talent. 
Same with Oyewole. As a partner at Ventures Platform, a $46 million fund where he helped back many of Africa’s most prominent venture-funded startups — and as an operator before Ventures Platform, Oyewole is familiar with the difficulty founders and senior leaders face when trying to scale their team’s capabilities to meet evolving needs.
“We had independently been working on overlapping ideas in this space when Kola Aina (founding partner, Ventures Platform) introduced us to each other to have a conversation,” Oyewole said in an interview with TechCrunch. “We talked to each other extensively for weeks and quickly realized that we share the deeply held belief that investing in upskilling talent to scale companies regionally or globally, with an end goal of creating more jobs and economic output, is Africa’s most important opportunity over the next three decades.”

India’s UpGrad enters unicorn club with $185 million fundraise

The operators-cum-investors-cum-founders left their roles to build Talstack, an all-in-one platform that enables businesses to upskill their employees with competency- and gap-assessment tools, content, courses and insights from Africa’s well-known professionals and entrepreneurs. 
Typically, most African businesses resort to training agencies when upskilling their employees. However, this limits their access to tailored and specific training programs from top experts, primarily seen in foreign upskilling products, including Udemy, Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, Go1, or verticalized offerings like Masterclass.
For Oyewole and Sulyman, both options are short-term fixes for Africa’s labor market because they are expensive, lack contextual relevance, and are difficult to connect to specific growth or development outcomes in Africa. 
The reasons are spot on. Even in this age of globalization, where the pandemic increased the appetite for online learning, an African employee working in a B2B e-commerce market cannot learn about the dynamics of that industry from, say, Udemy. In essence, though platforms based in the U.S. have tried to make generalized content and explainers on various skill sets, they miss many nuances concerning operating within different markets. That’s why startups like Platzi and UpGrad have capitalized on this, creating more curated growth and development products for emerging markets such as Latin America and India, respectively. Talstack, an abstraction from talent stack, aims to replicate the B2B elements of these platforms in Africa; it might explore a B2C offering similar to other local upskill platforms, including GOMYCODE and AltSchool, in the future.
“Our customers and those in the pipeline are telling us that the current learning options they have are not engaging enough for their employees, that the content and insights are not contextually relevant to their people, and that their feedback is not prioritized given Africa is not a priority for global upskilling companies,” said CEO Sulyman, who ran Black Ops, an Andela for operators over the last three years. “We are building Talstack with insights from the markets where our customers and their employees operate; we are in our customers’ offices, their WhatsApp messages, and their Twitter threads, learning about what drives the most value, iterating and building, quite literally, with them.”

Platzi picks up $62 million Series B to re-skill Latin American professionals

Talstack is currently running a closed pilot with eight paying customers (businesses), with at least three employees in each company taking the platform’s “self-paced courses and engaging in the learner community.” Currently, employees in its pilot have access to five courses on soft skills, including “Communicating Effectively in the Workplace,” “Giving and Receiving Feedback,” “Time Management,” “Goal Setting,” and “Problem-Solving.” 
Sulyman said the startup launched with soft skills because it was a pressing need for the companies in its closed pilot and through their research, “soft skills are the bigger problem for companies today.” He also stated that because these skills are necessary regardless of a company’s department and cut across roles, it was faster to deploy and test some hypotheses. The three-month-old upstart will shortly onboard more professionals as it develops a more robust course catalog to address Africa’s most sought-after cross-functional and domain skills and competencies. The upstart also plans to open access to a broader set of employers in the second half of this year.
Backing from local investors to drive experimentation
Talstack courses are taught by African professionals and operators with operating experience in Africa, working for prominent startups and multinationals such as Andela, MAX, Paystack and Google. Each course has several modules in video format (five minutes or less). While Talstack pays these instructors a flat fee per course, it might explore sharing its revenue (which it gets from currently charging businesses a monthly subscription of N10,000 (~$13.33) per employee) as it engages a broader set of instructors upon launch. 
“Many of our current instructors are experienced professionals who already have an appetite for sharing their knowledge and are being viewed as thought leaders. However, there is no scalable way for them to create and deliver courses to a large, engaged audience, which Talstack provides,” said Sulyman, adding that other companies and traditional training agencies can monetize their content on platforms like these professionals. 
On the other hand, employees can access tools and a journey map for self-assessment, an active community of other learners and opportunities to interact with these African operators through live Q&As. 
L-R: Kayode Oyewole and Seni Sulyman (Talstack co-founders)
The size of Africa’s workforce today is close to 400 million people and leaders of the continent’s most prominent companies have the same fears as their global counterparts. In PwC’s annual CEO survey, 87% of African business leaders expressed concern about the impact of talent gaps on their company’s productivity and ability to deliver on business outcomes, and 47% of them would like to prioritize training and upskilling to bridge skill gaps. 
Therefore, though Talstack is starting with small startups with tens to hundreds of employees, helping legacy companies such as banks, telcos and large consumer-facing companies deliver outcomes for thousands of their employees is critical to seeing exponential growth and adoption. For now, though, Talstack, buoyed by founders-market fit and an $850,000 pre-seed, will first experiment, then wait and see if Africa, which has the youngest population globally, wants what it’s selling. 
“We’ll continue running our ongoing closed pilot, fill a few important roles, launch more courses and tools, iterate on tech/product and open up the platform to more companies. Our pre-seed round aims to prove our thesis with customers ahead of our seed,” Oyewole noted. “The only way we build hundreds and thousands of regionally and globally competitive companies on the continent is for us to have a highly competent workforce across all levels and that’s the need Talstack addresses.”
Pan-African early-stage investor Ventures Platform led the pre-seed round while Voltron Capital and Golden Palm Investments participated. TLcom Capital, an Africa-focused growth fund, also backed the startup, its first pre-seed investment from the firm’s second fund (TIDE Africa Fund II), according to partner Eloho Omame.

ChrysCapital invests $100 million in India’s Lenskart,Manish Singh,2023/06/14,"
ChrysCapital has invested $100 million in Lenskart, the two said Thursday, pushing the Asian eyewear startup’s raise in the past year to $850 million as it expands its offerings and reach in international markets.
The Indian private equity firm is buying shares worth $100 million in Lenskart through both primary and secondary transactions, the two said. The new investment follows Abu Dhabi Investment Authority announcing plans to invest $500 million in Lenskart. That investment, like the capital infusion from ChrysCapital, is an extension to last year’s round. About 450 million of the $600 million fundraise this year is secondary transaction.
“ChrysCapital is one of the most esteemed Indian equity partners, and it is my privilege to have them by our side. Incidences of myopia are rapidly growing globally, especially in Asia, including India, with big unsolved problems of access, affordability, and awareness. We believe that with the help of technology, customer centricity, and big investments in supply chain and talent, we can eradicate the problem of vision correction,” said Peyush Bansal, founder and chief executive of Lenskart, in a statement.
The 12-year-old Indian eyewear startup, which counts SoftBank and Alpha Wave Global among its backers, sells eyeglasses, sunglasses, contact lenses and other eyewear accessories. It has become one of the largest eyewear players in India by undercutting the competition, offering premium glasses at affordable prices.
Lenskart has been able to keep the prices low because it’s bringing more efficiency into the eyewear sector, Bansal told TechCrunch in a recent interview. The firm has built the expertise to manufacture its own eyeglasses and contact lenses and for many technologies, it’s the exclusive licensing partner for global firms in India, he said.
The startup, which currently has operations in India, Southeast Asia and the Middle East, sells its eye products online and through over 2,000 stores, three-fourths of which are in India. The startup is opening more than seven stores a week and plans to manufacture 20 million pairs of glasses next year.
Hundreds of millions of Indians need vision correction, but only a fraction of this population is currently wearing glasses or contact lenses. Bansal said the company will continue to scale its operations in India and existing international markets where it has operations because they remain highly underserved.
But what has helped Lenskart, and the eyewear industry at large, is just how quickly Indians are adopting glasses, he said. People are buying as many as four pairs of glasses every two years, a figure that is closely growing to five, he said, pointing to a similar popularity in sneaker purchases.
The startup is also slowly expanding its premium offerings, thanks to the acquisition of Japanese eyewear brand OwnDays and its new in-house brands such as John Jacobs.
“ChrysCapital is excited to back a strong execution-focused management team that has established dominant market leadership in the eyewear segment. Lenskart has been instrumental in developing this market, driven by its unwavering commitment to exceptional customer satisfaction, affordability, and reliability. With the acquisition of Owndays, there is an opportunity for Lenskart to expand across 10+ Asian countries in addition to the already large Indian market,” said Rajiv Batra, SVP at ChrysCapital, in a statement.

Dear Sophie,
My startup is hiring and many excellent engineers need H-1B transfers, but I haven’t done one yet.
Approximately how much time and money will we need to set aside for the process? Are there alternatives?
— Careful Co-Founder
Dear Careful,
Congrats on making it to the next stage: hiring!
Working with an experienced immigration attorney can help you save time and money in the process so you can onboard your new hires rapidly and continue to build. It’s important that your attorney understands your startup’s vision and goals.
Transferring an H-1B
To start, it’s important to take the required steps to qualify your startup for sponsoring the H-1B visa before proceeding with the transfer. If you’re transferring the H-1B of an individual who was recently laid off and is still in the U.S., it’s important to take these steps quickly since that person’s 60-day grace period has already started counting down.
Your attorney will help you determine the best strategy and assist your company with petitioning for the new hire.
Most immigration attorneys charge flat fees for their services, but those fees can vary substantially, so consider your options. According to a National Foundation for American Policy report issued a few years ago, the government filing fees and attorney legal fees for preparing and filing an H-1B transfer range in the market from $5,000 to $30,000 (rare but apparently possible!).
An H-1B specialty occupation visa transfer for a startup can typically be accomplished in a month or so, and usually for less than $10,000 all in — often much less than a recruiter. Check out this podcast episode on how to save money in the immigration process.

How the process works
For a brand-new startup, your attorney will first get your startup’s Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) verified by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Foreign Labor Certification, which takes about a week.
Next, your attorney needs to file a Labor Condition Application (LCA) with the Labor Department to basically verify your startup will pay the H-1B transfer candidate the prevailing wage based on the job and geographical location of the job and that no qualified American worker is available to fill it.
The LCA has a dual purpose of protecting both American and foreign workers. There are posting requirements of various documents that can be accomplished digitally and/or physically depending on if you have a remote or physical office. The Labor Department normally processes LCAs in less than two weeks. "
Former SEC chair Jay Clayton feels ‘vast majority’ of crypto tokens are securities,Jacquelyn Melinek,2023/06/14,"

Former SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has reiterated his position that many cryptocurrencies could be defined as securities, even as the crypto industry continues to combat the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over the regulator’s prohibitive stance toward the industry.
“I’ve said this for a long time: I think the market has evolved, but many, if not the vast majority, of the tokens that were sold for cash would fall within the definition of a security in America,” Clayton, now a senior policy advisor and counsel at Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, said at the R3 CordaDay conference on Wednesday.
The definition of a security is “intentionally broad and flexible,” Clayton noted. But, he added that there’s a chance that something once labeled a security, “might not always be a security.”
So what could cause that shift? Present utility versus future utility, Clayton said.
Clayton pointed to Broadway tickets as an example: If someone bought 1,000 tickets for $10 and told their friends and family they would be able to resell those tickets for $100 or $1,000, then it’s a security, he said. “But if you just buy the ticket 10 years later, it’s just a ticket.”
“The confusion around that, and the horrible legal advice [that’s been] given has led to bitter, emotional fights over classification,” Clayton said.
For the former SEC chair, the bigger question is how to trade those tickets when they’re not securities. For example, Taylor Swift tickets, which have caused a bit of chaos for fans and Ticketmaster in recent months, can resell for thousands of dollars more than initially bought, but that would not be securities trading, Clayton said. “But we should have a digitized market for it.”

Synthesia secures $90M for AI that generates custom avatars,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/14,"
Once the pandemic normalized virtual meetups, the concept of “personalized AI” began to gain steam.
Startups creating “AI-driven” avatars — realistic-looking characters with synthetic voices that star in pre-recorded or live videos — have raised hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital over the past few years. As such avatars improve, they promise to deliver more personalized digital marketing and training experiences while reducing the costs typically associated with video production.
That’s at least the sales pitch from Synthesia, one of the startups using AI to create synthetic videos for advertising and other use cases. The company yesterday announced that it raised $90 million in a Series C round led by Accel with a strategic investment from Nvidia and participation from Kleiner Perkins, GV, Firstmark Capital and MMC. The round brings Synthesia’s total raised to date to $156.6 million, and it values the startup at $1 billion post-money (up from $300 million in December 2021).
Co-founder and CEO Victor Riparbelli tells TechCrunch that Synthesia is a “sustainable business” and wasn’t looking for an additional investment, but that Accel and Nvidia approached the company with a compelling offer.
“We now have over 50,000 customers,” Riparbelli said via email. “We don’t disclose revenue figures at this time, but the company has a year-over-year user growth rate of 456% and over 15 million videos generated on the platform to date.”
Founded in 2017 by a team of AI researchers and entrepreneurs from University College London, Stanford, Technical University of Munich and Cambridge, Synthesia, which now employs around 200 people, is developing AI tech that lets customers create instructional videos featuring stock or custom AI avatars. Users type in text, select an avatar and choose a language to generate videos.

Synthesia’s AI is trained on real actors, and actors are paid per video that’s generated with their image and voice.
Among Synthesia’s clients are Tiffany’s, IHG, Teleperformance, BSH, Moody’s Analytics and entities of the United Nations. According to Riparbelli, 35% of the Fortune 100 is using the startup’s for training and marketing purposes
“Synthesia is transforming physical video production into an entirely digital process that will enable creators to bring their ideas … to life with just a Synthesia account,” Riparbelli said. “Our mission is to make video easy for everyone.”
Some experts have expressed concern that tools like Synthesia’s could be used to create deepfakes, or AI-generated videos that take a person in an existing video and replace them with someone else’s likeness. The fear is that these fakes might be used to do things like sway opinion during an election or implicate a person in a crime.
Tech developed by Synthesia has also been misused to produce propaganda in Venezuela and false news reports promoted by pro-China social media accounts.
Synthesia, for its part, says that it vets its customers and their scripts and requires formal consent from a person before it’ll synthesize their appearance. Its disinformation team suspends accounts found to have violated its terms of service, which prohibit the use of its tech for “political, sexual, personal, criminal and discriminatory content.”
Riparbelli says that the investment from the Series C will be put toward making Synthesia’s avatars more expressive and the Synthesia platform faster and “more collaborative.”

"Rejoice, for startup valuations are slowly recovering",Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/14,"
We have good news for tech companies big and small this fine Wednesday morning: valuations are heading higher, though at a modest pace.
New public market data indicates that software stocks are rising to their highest points so far this year. To make it sweeter, the underlying revenue multiples at public companies are expanding as well, especially at the faster growing subset of software companies.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

Investors today seem to think public software companies are worth more per dollar of revenue in aggregate. That will lift some pressure from startups struggling to raise new capital at attractive prices or harmonize legacy private-market companies’ valuations with their hoped-for IPOs. Clearing the massive startup liquidity backlog will take more than a modest reinflation of software valuations, but it’s a start.
Starting with high-level numbers, here’s a look at the Bessemer Cloud Index’s performance this year. Note that the value of the constituent companies kicked off the year strong, gave back most of those gains, and then starting in May, began to pick up steam once again (YCharts data):

"Majority, a digital bank for US migrants, grabs $9.75M amid expansion in Texas",Christine Hall,2023/06/14,"
Majority, a mobile banking company offering financial services to U.S. migrants, closed on its fourth funding round in two years as it opens a community meetup space in Laredo, Texas.
The new location positions the company close to The Gateway to the Americas International Bridge that crosses the Rio Grande, Magnus Larsson, founder and CEO at Majority, told TechCrunch. Majority already has physical locations across Florida, in Miami, Hialeah and Orlando, and in Houston.
“We started off in Texas and Florida,” Larsson said. “Florida has been our main focus for a period of time now, however, our business is about trust, and there is an opportunity to be the first banking product that you can open when you enter the country. As an immigrant myself, I experienced how hard it can be to seek out the services and support you need.”
For a $5.99 per month membership fee, the company, founded in 2019, offers migrants a bank account and debit card, community discounts, fee-free international money transfer and discounted international calling.
Accounts don’t require a Social Security number or U.S. documentation, just an international government-issued ID and proof of U.S. residence, and don’t have overdraft fees or minimum balance requirements. There is also access to Majority’s “Advisor Program,” a network of over 250 trained support staff nationwide, who are immigrants themselves.

Majority, a mobile bank for migrants, closes third venture round in just over a year

Larsson didn’t provide specifics on the company’s customer base or revenue beyond saying that Majority’s transaction volume is growing 6x per year.
The $9.75 million in new capital is an extension to Majority’s $37.5 million Series B, announced last September. Existing investors Valar Ventures and Heartcore Capital were involved in this round. Majority has now raised over $86 million in equity, including $19 million seed and $27 million Series A rounds.
The new funding will support the expansion into Laredo and additional growth along the United States-Mexico border.
Along with the new presence in Laredo, Majority will release a “Financial Handbook for Mexicans” later this year that is a specialized version of its “Migrant Handbook” that provides information on starting a life in the U.S.
“The main thing for us is to continue following the plan and structure that we started at the beginning, which is to take a step-by-step approach, starting with one community at a time, then adding another and another,” Larsson said. “This funding is more of a step for us to continue the momentum and start doing more.”
If you have a juicy tip or lead about happenings in the venture world, you can reach Christine Hall at chall.techcrunch@gmail.com or Signal at 832-862-1051. Anonymity requests will be respected. 
Editor’s note: June 20, 9:32 a.m. PST, updated to note that the service includes “fee-free” international money transfers. The company said “This is the most competitive rate among remittances services, only charging mandatory production costs with no markups or extra fees.”

Dear Sophie: Does it make sense to sponsor immigrant talent to work remotely?

"Bootstrapped to 800,000 users, online programming community JDoodle lands funding",Catherine Shu,2023/06/14,"
Started as a side project, JDoodle, which lets developers practice more than six dozen programming languages on one website, hit 800,000 users while being bootstrapped. Now the Australia-based startup has set a goal of 8 million users within the next 24 months after getting $3.2 million AUD (about $2.2 million USD) in new funding. The round was led by Main Sequence, the venture firm founded by Australia’s national science agency.
JDoodle has tools aimed at software developers of all levels, ranging from students to professionals. These include zero-set up IDEs (integrated development environments) for more than 76 coding languages, including Java CloudIDE, that lets users write and run code in their browsers without having to set up local software or libraries.
Over the past year, JDoodle hit 800,000 users, including 3,000 educational institutions. JDoodle was started by software developer Gokul Chandrasekaran, who spent seven years working on it and reached 500,000 users before quitting his job to focus on it full-time. It grew out of a side project with one page and programming language that Chandrasekaran set up for $20, before spending evenings and weekends adding new features based on user feedback.
Chandrasekaran told TechCrunch that he wanted to start JDoodle because of the inefficiencies he encountered, like expensive and complicated development tools, while working on his bachelors and masters degrees in computer science.
“Those tools force every developer to waste so much of their time just getting the software environment ready for us to do our jobs. Even running one line of program is a headache,” he said. “You need sophisticated hardware and hours to set up a development environment with libraries, compilers, editors and more,” only to risk everything breaking if there’s an update to their operating systems.
For teachers and students, this means wasting time fixing development environment issues and manually verifying programming assignments. For professionals, this means time spent away from actually developing and instead used to manage their software development environments. By using JDoodle, Chandrasekaran said, they can get inexpensive access to programming environments and practice programming in a browser even on basic smartphones.
Main Sequence partner Mike Nicholls and JDoodle founder Gokul Chandrasekaran
“Software developers spend so much time setting up and managing their software development environments and focusing on small, unimportant tasks like changing the color of a button,” he said. “We need to free up developers to focus on the tasks that really matter because I’d say that organizations are currently wasting 20% of their software development budget.”
JDoodle’s growth to 800,000 users was organic, and it didn’t spend time or money on marketing until recently. “I believe the reason we’ve amassed so many users so far is because I listen to them,” said Chandrasekaran. “Over the years, I’ve taken so much feedback on board from developers and built the platform according to their needs. Every single feature in JDoodle exists as a result of a user request or feedback.”
Some examples of JDoodle’s customers include edtech Outlier, which offers accredited college courses. JDoodle’s plugins are embedded into its computer science courses, so students don’t need to switch between the class and a local practice environment. Another example is South American recruitment platform GeekHunter, which has used JDoodle since 2018 in its vetting process. Candidates pass coding exams produced by JDoodle before they are approved.
JDoodle monetizes through a freemium SaaS subscription model. Chandrasekaran said most of its revenue comes from its API and plugin solutions, which include standard and custom plans, but the startup is planning more income streams, including premium IDEs, hosting, courses, assignments and a talent marketplace.
The new funding will go toward JDoodle’s plans to scale up to 8 million users, including marketing, product development and hiring for its team in Australia.
Main Sequence met JDoodle while the startup was participating in The University of New South Wales’ 10x Accelerator Founders Program. Partner Mike Nicholls told TechCrunch about the investment that “Main Sequence has invested in more than 50 deep-tech startups and almost every one of them ends up hiring large numbers of developers and software engineers. Every startup is looking for a competitive edge and higher productivity from their software and hardware team. Essentially we want to turbocharge how companies and developers create the next generation of business systems.”

"With Equifax in its sights, TransUnion invests $24M in income verification platform Truework",Paul Sawers,2023/06/14,"
Truework, an income and employment verification platform used by banks, lenders, property managers and employers, today announced a strategic partnership and $24 million in equity funding from consumer credit reporting giant TransUnion.
Founded in 2017, San Francisco-based Truework integrates with third-party services, such as payroll providers, to help mortgage providers and similar lenders verify users and approve loans directly from within their own applications. It can also be used by landlords or would-be employers to carry out background checks.
With its latest partnership, which quietly went live a few weeks ago, TransUnion will effectively be selling Truework’s income verification product alongside its main credit product, meaning that a TransUnion customer such as a bank will be able to access both credit and income data through a single API.
“Having both data sets accessible via the same API and vendor is powerful for the lender and customer,” Truework co-founder and CEO Ryan Sandler explained to TechCrunch. “Especially for the thousands of customers who already use TransUnion for credit data.”
The Equifax factor
Today’s announcement comes some 10 months after Truework closed a $50 million Series C round of funding, and the fact that TransUnion has now made a direct $24 million equity investment is indicative of how deep the partnership between the two companies is. Although it’s far too early to make any wild predictions, it would not be all that surprising if this investment served as a pre-cursor to a full-on acquisition given the synergies between the duo. Indeed, TransUnion is no stranger to the world of M&A, having bought some 10 companies, including venture-backed startups, in the past five years alone.
In the nearer term, however, this partnership puts TransUnion in a stronger position to compete with the likes of industry heavyweight Equifax, which already offers income verification alongside its credit reporting toolset.
“Until recently, Equifax was the only [credit reporting] bureau that had an income verification product, and they were able to maximize distribution of this product through established credit channels,” Sandler said. “This advantage was especially apparent in mortgage, where income and employment verification has become required for conforming loans since the Dodd-Frank Act came into effect. This partnership now allows TransUnion to provide income data through Truework and compete directly in the multi-billion dollar income verification business.”
From Truework’s vantage point, meanwhile, the partnership helps it gain significantly more exposure among some of the world’s biggest companies.
“We are already in many mortgage lenders, and the product drives a ton of value for these customers,” Sandler continued. “Now, TransUnion will be distributing the product to new verticals and use cases, from property management to credit card applications.”

"Backed by Google’s Gradient, Versed wants to help storytellers create video games using generative AI",Paul Sawers,2023/06/14,"
Generative AI has undoubtedly been the big buzzword of the past year, driven in large part by Microsoft-backed OpenAI and ChatGPT. But while the ability to create all manner of fresh content from a simple prompt raises various societal and ethical questions, it also opens the door to myriad businesses that simply would not have been possible just 12 months ago.
Venture Capitalists (VCs) have been pouring bucketloads of cash into generative AI startups, with some investors launching dedicated funds specifically for it — just this week, Salesforce Ventures revealed it was upping its generative AI investment fund, announced in March, from $250 million to $500 million.
It’s against this backdrop that fledgling European startup Versed is looking to make its mark by allowing anyone to create their own role-playing game (RPG) simply by writing text-based stories and instructions. Versed claims that its AI interprets the narrative and assigns characters and locations from an in-house database to create immersive worlds.
Founded out of the Netherlands just four months ago, Versed is the handiwork of CTO and former Unity developer Cat Burton, and CEO Robert Gaal, a former Googler and entrepreneur with several startups to his name. In the intervening months, Versed has grown its remote-first team to seven people spread across the U.K., Denmark, Bulgaria, and the U.S. Now, in preparation for scaling the business from early-alpha to a full-fledged commercial product next year, the company today revealed that it has raised €1.6 ($1.7 million) in a pre-seed round of funding led by Google’s Gradient Ventures.
The generation game
Generative AI is already making inroads into the gaming sphere. Developers have shown how they can generate original visual assets, with the likes of San Francisco-based Scenario recently raising $6 million in seed funding to do just that. Gaming giant Roblox also announced new tools to let game developer generate entire virtual worlds through natural language prompts, while Microsoft is working on similar generative AI smarts for its hugely popular Minecraft franchise.
While Versed certainly runs tangential to these efforts, its attempt to let creators generate an entire RPG through story alone — zero coding — could take things to the next level.
“I would say that most of our competitors are more on the developer side, and that is not who we’re focused on,” Gaal told TechCrunch. “We’re not focused on engineering, or anything like that. We are building a way to make your own role playing video game, just by writing a story. We use that story to then generate fully 3D immersive worlds, with turn-based combat and branching dialogue, and everything that makes a role playing game great.”
To do this, the writer might describe the characters and their location, including specifics such as costumes they’re wearing or what era (e.g. medieval) a scene is taking place, and Versed matches the description with visuals that were created by its own in-house artists.
Sample Versed characters Image Credits: Versed
Under the hood, Versed uses a combination of LLMs and its own algorithms to match assets and build worlds. The role of the LLM here is to summarize the creator’s descriptions of the game’s content, after which it uses procedural generation — a method whereby computers create data — to build all the locations and match with assets in its internal library.
While Versed is currently using OpenAI’s GPT-4, Burton says that they have engineered their platform so that they can easily switch to a different LLM should a more suitable language model arrive on the scene.
“Because it keeps evolving so quickly, every week there seems to be a new LLM or a different advancement that comes out, we’ve decoupled it so we can switch it to any different LLM as they progress,” Burton explained.
For gameplay, Versed leans on the Unity game engine, which will allow games to be played on just about any platform, though initially gameplay will be limited to Mac and PC.
Immersive
There are some similarities here to what something like Twine has been doing for the past decade or so, with a focus on helping creators generate text-based interactive fiction on the web. “We basically go that extra step and make it fully immersive in 3D,” Burton said.
Ultimately, Versed is striving to remove all the technical and design knowhow from game development, hiding the game engine in the background to allow storytellers to focus on what they know best.
“There’s always that huge barrier to entry to those [game engines] if you want to build a game — you’ve got to know code, you’ve got to know art, you’ve got to know audio, marketing, editing all of that,” Burton said. “So we basically bridge that whole gap for people. So they can write a story like they would do in something like Twine, but what they get is a fully immersive 3D game.”

After TechCrunch viewed an early demo of a game created through Versed, it’s clear that there is potential for something truly revolutionary in terms of democratizing game development. But “generative AI” is surely all about allowing the user (i.e. the storyteller) to “generate” their own in-game assets, rather than relying on a library of characters and scenes created in-house at Versed? For now, that isn’t possible, but it is the ultimate end-goal. Burton says that they first need to create all their own assets, from which they can train their own text-to-3D models.
“We want to start by building the assets manually, because then when we train 3D, it’ll be trained using our own assets, our own art style, and we won’t be stealing somebody else’s IP (intellectual property),” Burton explained.
This is important for a number of reasons, beyond building its own brand and ensuring that it’s not encroaching upon someone else’s work. Indeed, it’s simply not possible to build a big enough library of assets by hand that will cover every requirement, which is why we’re seeing the likes of stock photo giant Shutterstock embrace generative AI too.
So while Versed plans to continue developing its own art, it will augment this with generative AI.
“In the long run, we want to generate the assets that are missing,” Burton continued. “We’re always going to keep our art team, that’s very important to us. But if someone writes a story, and they want a three-headed dragon wearing a top hat, the likelihood is we won’t have that in our database. So we’ll hopefully try and create that for them.”

Target market
At its core, Versed is targeting creators that are already active in the worlds of interactive storytelling, those who are perhap slooking to transition from offline to digital.
“We’re choosing role playing games first, because this is a very well established format to tell a story,” Gaal said. “A lot of our creators that we’re working with right now, a large part of them are gamemasters, they live stream on Twitch where they sell their own board games or their their own adventure novels that you can use in your board game. So this made a lot of sense, because they were already used to writing for interactive storytelling — they’ve just never done it in a digital format.”
The big elephant in the room here is the issue of business model — how, exactly, does Versed plan to make money? While the specifics are still being ironed out, Gaal said that they will likely pursue a subscription-based model where gamers subscribe to individual creators or types of adventures, with Versed taking a cut.
“Our goal is to ensure that this is a platform where our creators can make a living,” Gaal said. “We’re focused on making sure that creators can keep shipping every single week, or every single month, a new adventure for you to play. So it’s episodical, and it’s highly tailored to how creators currently work with their fanbase, which could be a weekly podcast or a monthly newsletter. So we’re trying to remain in line with that.”
For now, Versed is working with 10 creators as part of an early alpha program, with plans to introduce the first roster of games by around October time when it will launch its private beta at New York’s Comic Con. A full public launch is currently slated for the second half of 2024.
In addition to lead backer Gradient Ventures, Versed’s pre-seed round included participation from Berlin-based investor Cherry Ventures, and angels hailing from companies including Unity, Twitch, Remote, and Framer.

One Future Football’s virtual worldwide soccer league launches with backing from Blackbird,Catherine Shu,2023/06/14,"
Founded in Melbourne, One Future Football (1FF) bills itself as the “world’s first global soccer league,” and it’s goal is to attract first-time soccer fans. It launches today with more than 250 CGI generated players, who have backstories created so all fans have someone they can relate to (for example, there are players with diabetes and autism), and 12 founding member teams around the world.
1FF also announced today it has raised $3 million in pre-seed funding led by Blackbird Ventures, with participation from strategic investors like soccer players Chris Smalling, Patrice Evra and Jesse Lingard and UFC fighter Kamaru Usman. Tennis stars Naomi Osaka, Nick Kyriagos and Ons Jabeur will also be involved as ambassadors for the brand.
1FF’s sports code is completely virtual and consists of 12 weekly matches across two rounds, broadcast around the world with narrative-driven content. Teams play against each other in a league format. Founding member teams are located around the world, including London, Paris, Buenos Aires, Los Angeles, India, Indonesia and Japan.
Founded by serial entrepreneurs Peter Davis and Rohit Bhargava, who got to know each other while playing in the same Fantasy Premier League mini-league. Before 1FF, Davis founded LAUNCH accelerator-backed creator discovery platform Ampjar and Australian social media agency Get Glossy. Bhargava founded fashion crowdfunding platform StageLabel, was part of the AWS Startups Team and hosts The Startup Playbook podcast.
Before starting Get Glossy, Davis worked in sports, ranging from professional teams to big firms like talent management agency. “We’re both pretty big football fans, getting up at crazy times of the early morning to watch matches on the other side of the world,” Bhargava said.
Davis called Bhargava and asked him if he’d like to see the new thing he was working on, which turned out to be 1FF. One thing that piqued the co-founders’ interest in creating a global football league was a BBC article called “Why the most interesting clubs in the USA do not really exist.” It covered “faux football clubs,” or teams that created their own backstories, press releases and merchandise, but did not actually have players on the field.
“What the article laid out felt like a pretty special cultural moment. Football has become a big part of fashion and vice versa, and whether it’s what you wear to football training, to the office, or to the pub, what you wear says a lot about you,” Bhargava said. “Football clubs felt like the perfect way to shape a narrative that people want to say about themselves, because you can associate it with a geographic reason, causes like positive action in the climate sense, or even a style of play. As we delved deeper, we felt we could tap into trends around athlete investors and help build stories around each of the teams through them as well.”
To design each of 1FF’s 250 CGI players, which players’ sporting attributes were first set by one of 1FF’s engines. Then their personalities and lived experiences were inspired by different sources.
1FF founders Rohit Bhargava and Pete Davis with footballers Ondrej Sykora (left) and Jamil Skaik (right)
“We wanted to ensure we create a home for people that may never have connected with sport before,” Bhargava said. “You never hear of an athlete who’s into cosplay or LARPing in the park on a weekend or playing Magic the Gathering, but why shouldn’t they?”
1FF spoke with panels in each of their geographies in order to create characters that appealed to them, with background stories that include similar interests and experiences.
“We have players who have grown up very comfortably but also players who were refugees, players who are gay, players who are diabetic, anaphylactic or have been diagnosed with autism. For us, it’s about showing young people that this is for them, that they can feel safe and never ashamed of who they are.”
The geographies of the 12 founding member teams were picked to give 1FF a good representation around the world. Its players represent 88 countries, which means that even though 1FF doesn’t have a team in huge footballing countries like Mexico, Germany, Spain, Italy, Egypt, Turkey, South Korea and China yet, it does have hero players that people can follow and use as their stepping stone into 1FF.
Major League Soccer (MLS) is a big business, with Davis and Bhargava pointing to stats like Angel City valuation at $100 million despite launching only three years ago (they share some investors with 1FF), and the top 10 esports companies worth an average of $353 million, up 46% compared to December 2020.
Despite the rise of esports, Davis and Bhargava expect that their main competition will be stadium football. But 1FF’s goal is to reach fans in places like the U.S., Nigeria, India or Indonesia, who might never be able to go to a Premier League game. “Our job is to build something that resonates with them better than the Premier League, MLS, La Liga or the Bundesliga can,” Bhargava said. “This means clubs that exist for greater reasons than just to win matches, and players who look like them or have the same experiences and interests as them. We know that we an do special things with our players because they’re wholly owned by us, so we can give fans a level of control of their heres that has never been possible before.
In terms of monetization, 1FF will make money like other sporting teams, through kit sales, commercial partnerships and pitch side advertising. Some players have their own social media accounts, and brands, which 1FF will announce soon, have already signed sponsorship deals with players and teams. Some monetization channels specific to a virtual sports platform include player cards (with 10,000 available for each player) and Club Credits to give fans deeper experiences with their favorite players and clubs.
Season 1 of One Future Football starts on June 23, but before then, there will be pre-season games like matchups between Naija United (Nigeria’s team) vs Manhattan Football Club (US), Inter Nusantra (Indonesia) vs Paris St-Dennis (France) and Club De Sportivo Palermo (Argentina) vs Tokyo Youth Club (Japan).
In a statement about the funding, Blackbird partner and co-founder Niki Scevak said, “At the core of each sports fan is the desire to be an owner, to influence the decisions each club makes and to endlessly debate the merits of each small decision. Technology offers a unique opportunity to enable this at scale, and 1FF is the digital version of fantasy sports with an incredibly creative twist. As serial founders and lifelong sports fans themselves, Pete and Rohit are uniquely placed to build a modern media company like 1FF, and we’re proud to back them from the very beginning.”

Kaya Founders backs Philippines startups from ‘Day 0’,Catherine Shu,2023/06/13,"
The Philippines’ startup ecosystem is poised for strong growth, thanks to the country’s rising GDP, fast adoption of online services and a new generation of founders. Launched by tech and investment veterans, Kaya Founders wants to back the most promising startups from the very beginning. The venture firm announced today that it has closed $12 million in funding across two new funds, bringing its total committed capital to $16.5 million, with a target of $25 million. The new funding was led by the Gokongwei family.
Kaya (which means “can do” in Tagalog) was founded in 2021 by former Zalora Philippines CEO Paulo Campos, Summit Media president Lisa Gokongwei-Cheng and Locad CEO Constantin Robertz. Both Gokongwei-Cheng and Robertz are prolific angel investors, and have backed startups like Good Glamm Group, Kumu, Dali and Edamama.
The firm now has 32 companies in its portfolio, including e-commerce enabler Etaily, on-demand wage startup Advance, online clinic Kindred and MSME point-of-sale app Peddlr. Kaya’s Zero to One fund focuses on pre-seed companies, sometimes before they have gone to market. Its One to Ten Fund invests in more mature companies, from seed to Series A, that have already found product-market fit and are on their way to profitability.
Zero to One will invest $150,000 to $250,000 checks into 20 to 30 pre-seed companies, while One to Ten’s checks will range from $250,000 to $500,000 and go toward 30 to 40 startups.
Kaya’s investment thesis centers around the Philippines’ young population, economic growth (the country’s GDP is expected to double to $6,500 by 2030) and high adoption of online services.
Its founders point to a report by Foxmont Capital, another venture firm focused on early-stage Philippines startups, that show funding in the country grew to $1.03 billion in 2021 and $1.1 billion in 2022, despite the global slowdown in deal activity. Based on Kaya’s calculations, $4 billion in capital has been closed by local and regional funds over the past two years, which means Kaya’s portfolio companies have plenty of opportunities for follow-on funding.
A lot of funding in the Philippines comes from corporate venture capital, but new players are emerging, says Campos. These include regional and global investors who are investing for the first time in the Philippines, like Sequoia Surge in Locad; KKR in GrowSari; A16z in Yield Guild Games; Tiger Global in PDAX; and Cecano and SoftBank in Sprout Solutions, plus local funds like Kaya, Foxmont Capital and Core Capital.
Kaya Founders’ team
Campos compared the growth of the Philippines’ startup ecosystem to India in the 2000s and Indonesia over the past decade. One of the main reasons is founders who have experience working at large tech companies like Grab, Lazada and Zalora, as well as Filipinos who were educated abroad returning to start companies in their home country. Campos told TechCrunch that Kaya has seen four founder archetypes emerge thanks to a confluence of the Philippines’ economic, business and cultural development.
The first is “second generation tech talent,” or former employees of large tech companies that “had their eyes opened to how quickly a unicorn can be born when you hit product-market fit,” said Campos. The second is corporate executives who left their jobs to start companies and bring domain expertise to their new roles. Peddlr founder Nel Laygo is one example—he worked at Unilever and Proctor and Gamble before launching the company to provide a POS system for sari-sari, or corner stores.
The third segment are founders who have experience working abroad, including Filipino expats and members of the Filipino diaspora, and the fourth are non-Filipinos who decided to start companies in the Philippines, taking advantage of the fact that English is the main language of business (Kaya’s portfolio includes founders from countries like Germany, the U.S., Singapore and India).
An example of the third segment is Kindred founder Jessica de Mesa, who was chief commercial officer at Zalora and spent half a decade working at its parent company, Global Fashion Group, in Singapore and London. De Mesa returned to the Philippines to lead Zalora Philippines’ commercial team, but wanted to return to healthcare (de Mesa is a registered nurse). Kaya had previously developed Kindred as a concept under its healthcare-focused joint venture, Pulse-63, and backed de Mesa as a “institutional co-founder” from its beginning.
“We are really seeing an acceleration of the flywheel of startups seeing customer traction and adoption, attracting investors both locally and internationally, and those success stories and fundraising round announcements inspiring a new breed of founders to throw their hat in the ring as well,” said Campos. “We see this as being very similar to what has emerged in Indonesia the past six to seven years, with the Philippines being at the cusp of the inflection point, just before the rocket takes off.”
Some challenges the Philippines’ startup ecosystem still have to deal with include a fairly nascent venture ecosystem, dominated by local CVCs, and problems sourcing tech talent and finding strategic partners with experience in go-to-market strategies, Campos said. Kaya was founded to help bridge the gap, giving founders access to people like former Lazada Philippines CEO Ray Alimurung, who was recently appointed as general partner of the Zero to One Fund, and Gokongwei-Cheng, for mentoring and strategizing.
Other support founders can get from Kaya include recruitment, legal services, educational material, office space and product development support, and a network of downstream investors, strategic partners, beta testers and pilot customers.
“We feel strongly that from now until the end of the decade, we will be living through the ‘golden age’ of startups in the Philippines,” Campos said. “That opportunity is also not just for local homegrown ventures, but also regional SEA or global startups that target the Philippines as a growth market.”

Finfra lets Indonesian businesses add embedded finance to their platforms,Catherine Shu,2023/06/13,"
Finfra, an Indonesian startup that provides the tech infrastructure for online businesses that want to offer embedded finance products, has raised $1 million in new funding. The round included participation from DSX Ventures, Seedstars International Ventures, Cento Ventures, Fintech Nation, FirstPick, BADideas Fund and Hustle Fund.
The startup’s new funding will be used on product development and to grow Finfra’s engineering, data and finance teams. Finfra grew out of consumer financial services provider Danabijak, which is profitable and will continue operating as a subsidiary of Finfra.
Finfra is industry-agnostic, but it focuses on digital supply chain platforms, agtech companies and merchant e-commerce platforms, said co-founder and CEO Markus Prommik. It provides a loan management system so businesses can offer credit to clients through their platforms. The most popular way Finfra is used is by businesses that want to add invoice financing or purchase financing solutions. Finfra primarily serves B2B, but can also be used for B2C applications.
Prommik describes Finfra as a “one-stop shop to launch and scale white-labelled credit services,” explaining that without the startup, its clients would need to spend millions of dollars to develop the necessary tech and infrastructure, spend up to five years acquiring lending licenses and building a team. Instead, by using Finfra’s APIs, they can start offering embedded finance within weeks.
Finfra’s key value proposition is control over the customer experience. It integrates risk controls and data from clients’ platforms so they can extend affordable credit without taking on too much risk. Finfra also has portfolio analytics to help customers monitor performance and key lending KPIs.
Finfra’s team (left to right): Reinis Simanovskis, Dionysius Yogadhitya, Markus Prommik, Hilda Indriana, Varun Rathi
Prommik said that Finfra’s differentiator from other embedded finance platforms in payments, data and infrastructure is that they do not offer credit, even though it is the most in-demand financial service. Instead of seeing them as competitors, Finfra views those platforms as potential allies.
One thing that Finfra believes will bolster its growth is the Indonesian Financial Services Authority (OJK) to reach financial inclusion targets of 90% by 2024, up from 75% in 2019. Despite growth in online platforms in Indonesia, many people and small businesses still lack access to credit through traditional means, like banks and other financial institutions, and instead rely on alternatives, including embedded finance.
In a statement, Patricia Sosrodjojo, general partner at Seedstars International Ventures, said, “We’ve seen similar initiatives succeed in emerging markets where MSMEs face significant hurdles to accessing capital. Finfra’s approach not only aligns with national economic development goals but is well-positioned to take on the challenges of this rapidly growing market.”

Lorenzo Thione hopes to see more support for the LGBTQ+ community within venture.
Gaingels Managing Director Lorenzo Thione talked to Dominic Madori-Davis about his work leading sustainability and AI investments for the syndicate and his journey as an openly gay investor.
In a wide-ranging conversation, Thione shared his views on today’s frothy AI market, spoke about where the sector is headed, and emphasized why it’s important to support founders who identify as LGBTQ+.
“They simply were not getting any access to the venture engine because of who they were,” he said.

I am not an early-stage investor, which is why I was so surprised to learn that video-game startups led the pack with regard to the median amount of seed money raised in Q1 2023.
“Transportation came in second, followed by food, biotech, data analytics, and then CRM and SaaS,” reports Alex Wilhelm, who reviewed numbers from Carta.
At the Series A level, renewables, logistics and hardware startups topped the list.
“Don’t worry, the answer here is not just ‘build an AI startup,’ even if that does appear to be pretty solid advice for avoiding a down round.”

Turo’s Q1 2023 results indicate it may be a while until we see its IPO,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/13,"
Late last week, car rental marketplace Turo dropped an updated S-1 filing featuring its first-quarter results. TechCrunch+ previously covered the company’s full-year 2022 results, noting at the time that Turo was growing quickly while staying profitable and was posting revenue totals that, when compared with its last known private valuation, were attractive indeed.
“What’s not to like?” we asked back in March.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

But this new slew of data complicates that previously rosy picture a little.
Today, instead of comparing Turo’s pace of revenue growth in Q1 2023 to the same period a year earlier, we’re going to compare that with Turo’s revenue growth rate throughout 2022. We’re doing this primarily because the company was enduring COVID-related headwinds in early 2021, which means it would be a bit unfair to compare Q1 2023 growth rates to those set in Q1 2022. The post-COVID tailwinds it enjoyed last year have somewhat tapered off now, so the growth that the company is seeing today could be argued to be more “organic” than what it saw a year ago.
In the first quarter, Turo’s revenue rose at a slower rate than it had in full-year 2022, and the company was unprofitable to boot. Seasonality is a factor in this business, so we’ll need to figure out just how much these new results matter, and if they should change our opinion that the company should go public post-haste.
The backdrop has changed since we last talked about this company: Cava’s IPO is rapidly approaching, and the venture-backed company seems to be enjoying strong interest for its shares despite not strictly being a tech company, indicating that there could be more appetite than expected for IPOs. Turo would prove a better test for tech companies wondering if the time is right to go public.
It’d be lovely if Turo’s Q1 2023 results give us reason to hope that it would go public this year. Fresh and pertinent data on the demand for tech shares in the public market would be incredibly useful to our reporting on the late-stage startup market. After all, what is Turo if not a late-stage unicorn full of private capital?
Turo’s first quarter
In 2022, Turo’s revenue rose 59% to $746.6 million compared to $469 million in 2021. But that increase in revenue also came with higher spending, with operations and support expenses rising 92%, product development costs climbing by 66%, and sales and marketing costs increasing by 111% to $111.3 million in the year.
Still, the company enjoyed a 5% operating margin and an even better bottom line. It was a good year for Turo, which saw revenues stuck between $140 million and $150 million in 2019 and 2020. But there was an explosion in consumer demand for mobility options after COVID waned, and Turo’s revenues soared as a result. "
Zero-Error Systems raises $7.5M for its radiation-hardened semiconductor integrated circuits,Kate Park,2023/06/13,"
Space is a tough place for electronic circuits since radiation causes short circuits that result in mission failure, said Hwai Lin Khor, vice president of Zero-Error Systems.
Many companies currently build satellite electronics systems with commercial-off-the-shelves (COTS) semiconductor devices to meet the lower cost requirement. But according to Khor, the COTS chip devices can’t meet the radiation performance, causing system failure and data corruption in space. To address the issues using COTS semiconductor devices, Singapore-based startup Zero-Error Systems (ZES) built a patented radiation-hardened semiconductor integrated circuits technology for space and energy management applications.
The startup said today it has secured a $7.5 million Series A funding round, which brings its total raised to approximately $10 million, from investors, including Airbus Ventures and the Dart family office. The latest capital will support ZES’s research and development in Singapore and help increase global customers and grow its team, which has 10 people to date.
Three Japanese satellites and one European satellite operator use ZES’ technology, Khor said. Its target customers include satellite subsystems, rovers, space electronics manufacturers, and earth applications exposed to radiation, such as nuclear reactors, aviation, un-crewed drones and more. ZES’s power management solutions, initially designed for space applications for battery or solar power, could also be used for consumer electronics and industrial applications like smartphones, wearable devices and IoT companies.
In 2019, ZES was spun off from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, which has over 15 years of research on radiation-hardened integrated circuits and efficient power management designs.
“We [the founding team] observed growing demands for constellations and low earth orbit satellites to provide communication, data access, Earth observation, surveillance and reconnaissance,” Khor said. “Most of these satellites are using components that will not thrive in space; Hence, we saw the opportunity to launch the business.”
The radiation-hardened electronics market is estimated to reach approximately $4.5 billion by 2030, with a CAGR of more than 7.5% from 2021.
“Satellites, lunar landers and rovers increase demand for ICs and computing power such as artificial intelligence and power management,” Mat Costes, Partner of Airbus Ventures. “The space industry is growing and expanding beyond where we could imagine not that long ago. ZES could be [an] enabler for OEMs and new players to achieve their mission via cost and performance.”

"To boost greenhouse productivity, Skytree is using space station CO2 scrubbers",Tim De Chant,2023/06/13,"
Sucking carbon dioxide out of the air isn’t rocket science — the technology is decades old — but one startup thinks that maybe a little rocket science could help make direct air capture better.
Carbon dioxide scrubbers have been around since the 1800s, when commercial divers used them to extend their oxygen supply underwater. The technology got another boost when humans launched themselves into space. But it wasn’t until the specter of unchecked climate change that people began to consider its terrestrial applications.
A number of startups are racing to commercialize direct air capture of CO2, and most of them are chasing what you might call an open air market: drawing carbon straight from the atmosphere. Many use technology that draws on the same principles used in diving rebreathers and spacecraft life support, but Skytree is among the few that can claim a direct inheritance. The company was spun out of the European Space Agency in 2014 after its core technology saw service on the International Space Station.
On Tuesday, the company is announcing a $6 million seed round led by Horticoop and Yield Lab Europe, TechCrunch+ has exclusively learned.
Working in confined quarters seems to have shaped the company from its very founding. Its initial product was aimed at electric vehicles, of all things. Though the cars don’t produce any emissions, their occupants do, and carbon dioxide levels can build quickly in an unventilated cabin. But as anyone who has driven an EV can tell you, heating or cooling outside air can quickly sap battery’s range. Skytree figured that its scrubbers could remove carbon dioxide from the cabin, reducing the need to condition outside air.
Work on that product trundled along for a few years, but the automotive sector is a challenging market where volumes are high and margins are thin. Aware of this, the company began exploring other options. A new incoming CEO, Rob Van Straten, cemented the decision.
“Volkswagen will not sign with you with an eight-person or 20-person company — it will just not happen,” Van Straten told TechCrunch+. “And if that miracle does happen, they will squeeze you to the bone and you can’t build a profitable company. It’s a dead-end street.”
Van Straten instead directed the company to develop its other product, which was also tailored to confined spaces: greenhouses. "
Pollen’s approach to setting freelancers up for success is nothing to sneeze at,Christine Hall,2023/06/13,"
When Hillary Bush decided to leave the comforts of a full-time job at MasterClass to be self-employed, she said she “was met with scams, snake oil and SEO.” Not a pleasant thought given that 60 million Americans called themselves freelancers in 2022 and that two-thirds of Gen Z and Millennials want to work for themselves, Bush told TechCrunch.
That’s why she created Pollen, a new professional membership for those who have, or want, independent careers. Members get exclusive access to business advice and a network of peers and mentors to help grow their business.
“If you’re a freelancer and you’re leaving the safety and security of your full-time job, or school or whatever, you’re on your own,” Bush said. “People are leaving around 30% of potential income on the table because they don’t have business training. You don’t have a mentor, manager, blueprint and you don’t give yourself a promotion. You’re truly an entrepreneur.”
In putting together Pollen last year, Bush wanted to offer “the business coach that you wish you had” with a connection to peers, mentors and collaborators. Features include dozens of playbooks and templates and access to weekly drops of job opportunities.
Pollen’s private network has two membership types: annual and monthly, with the annual membership coming in at just over $1,000. Members also receive benefits, for example, over $100,000 worth of discounts on business and freelancer tools and coaching sessions. There are already over 15 active mentors.
Today, the company launches its platform with thousands of people on the waitlist and announces $4 million in funding from Animo VC, Founder Collective, XYZ, Precursor Ventures and a group of angel investors.
Bush intends to use the funding to power the next phase of Pollen, including growing the platform and its employee base. The company is hiring for its community and engineering team and for the content side of the business.
“Launching is a huge milestone for the business,” Bush said. “We really believe that anybody should have access to super-premium resources and to build their network. For anyone pursuing self employment, come to Pollen. There have been a lot of layoffs, and with that, massive reconsideration of the way work fits into people’s lives. People are really desperate for a support system whether they entered this lifestyle on their own accord or being laid off. We’re going to help you move your business forward throughout all phases — diversify your income streams, create new products and really power the future of work.”

How to pitch me: 10 investors discuss what they’re looking for in June 2023,Walter Thompson,2023/06/13,"
Let’s explode a few myths.
For starters: The tech industry is not a meritocracy. There’s a direct correlation between the size and strength of your network and your chances of success.
Second: It’s relatively easy to connect with reputable investors. Most firms’ websites have email addresses and contact forms.
There are many reasons why startups fail to get off the ground, but it generally boils down to three things:

You don’t have a billion-dollar idea.
You’re pitching the wrong investor.
They’re not sure if you can execute against the plan.

This month, all 10 “How to pitch me” participants shared their investment thesis, along with tactical advice for nontechnical founders and the questions they expect entrepreneurs to ask them during pitch meetings.
Consider yourself on notice: With deal flow down across the board, “applying fake time pressure to get a VC to make a quick decision” no longer works, said Blair Garrou of Mercury Fund.
“Artificially engineered FOMO is out,” said Monique Woodard, managing director of Cake Ventures. “Showing momentum is great, but I guard against being overly influenced by short timelines and the participation of other investors.”
Respondents also ballparked salaries for pre-revenue startups, discussed the pros and cons of using pitch memos vs. full decks, and all shared what they’re reading, watching and listening to. (This group loved “Succession” so much, they would probably take a pitch meeting with Kendall Roy.)
Thanks very much to everyone who took the time to respond! If you’re an early-stage investor who’d like to be included in future columns, email guestcolumns@techcrunch.com with “How to pitch me” in the subject line.

Vivek Ramaswami, partner, Madrona
What kinds of investment opportunities are you looking for in June 2023?
At Madrona, we invest from pre-seed to growth. Personally, I am excited about investing in Series A, B and C startups across B2B software, cloud infrastructure and AI/ML. Of course there is plenty of excitement in generative AI today, and we’ve made several investments in this space, but I believe there will continue to be great opportunities across the software stack that are either natively built on, or finding ways to leverage foundation models.
How do you prefer to be approached: a cold email, a warm intro or another method?
I’m always open to a cold email in the sector and geographic domains I focus in. A warm intro always helps, but I understand that not all founders will have an opportunity to get a warm intro. My email is vivek@madrona.com.
Many laid-off engineers are launching their own startups: What are some of the skills/experience you look for in nontechnical founders?
There is no reason why nontechnical founders can’t be successful in starting their own companies.
For nontechnical founders, I get excited about how they can lean into their strengths: (1) deep domain expertise in the sectors they are starting a company (something we often see in vertical SaaS companies where founders have “lived the problem; (2) an ability to recruit and hire amazing talent around them; and (3) a keen sense of customer focus, understanding of market dynamics and business model planning that is important and often the strength of nontechnical founders.
Generally speaking, how much salary should the founder of a pre-revenue startup pay themselves?
The range can be wide, as each case can be quite different (e.g., a second-time founder who raises again may be more comfortable with very little cash comp and more equity than a first-time founder, etc.). On average, when we look at the data we have, I would consider $130,000-$150,000 as a reasonable salary range for founders who have raised <$25 million and live in a “Tier 1” city.
In June 2023, what are some of the top questions founders should be asking investors?
Founders should be asking investors what specific sectors and stages they are investing in, because while funding was flowing freely in past years, it is less so today, and many investors are retrenching into the areas they know best. Additionally, founders should be looking at the track record of the firm, have they been able to successfully raise funds and do they reserve funds for follow-on rounds after the initial funding round.
This is very important in the current environment. And of course, take a look at the talent, marketing and biz dev help that an investor’s firm and personal network can bring to bear for your company.
Founders should also ask for references — what companies has that fund worked with, especially the partner leading the deal, so they can get a fuller sense of what the journey will be like with that fund and partner. This is a long-term relationship, so doing as much work upfront matters!
Are you open to reviewing pitch memos, or do you prefer a completed deck?
A pitch tactic I see that almost never works is having a banker cold email about a company that is completely irrelevant to the stage and sector that I look at. If anything, I would prefer the founder to reach out themselves and that way I can at least learn a bit more about the founder and it comes from a more authentic and genuine place.
It surprises me how many cold banker pitches me and my colleagues receive! A memo is fine as long as it is coherent, provides the necessary info and is concise.
Tell us about the best pitch you’ve received recently: At what point in their presentation did you realize you were going to invest?
I can’t name the company, but it was a growth-stage startup that started the presentation with the cold hard facts on the business: what scale they were at, how fast they were growing, their win rates against competitors and forward forecasts. They followed that up with what has both been going right and wrong in the business, but ultimately why they believe they are creating a generational business in a massive market, and why THEY were the right people to found the company.
Within the first 10 minutes they had laid out: (1) how well the company was doing; (2) how big the market opportunity was; and (3) why they had an unfair advantage as founders over everyone else. It was incredibly concise, straightforward and compelling to hear.
What are you reading/watching/listening to?
I’m currently reading “Chip War” by Chris Miller, a fantastic account of the development and subsequent battle over the most critical resource today — microchips. It’s an especially helpful lens to view the need for compute infrastructure in building AI companies today. I just finished watching “Succession,” so I need a new show!
Monique Woodard, managing director, Cake Ventures
What kinds of investment opportunities are you looking for in June 2023? 
We are aggressively investing out of Fund I and focus on U.S.-based pre-seed and seed stage companies that fit into one or more layers of the investment thesis at Cake. Cake Ventures has a clear investment thesis: invest in companies with global ambitions who are creating technology products that meet the needs of tomorrow’s internet users. We call this investing in demographic change.
The three key/markets we explore are:

The aging population whose size and spending power has created unique needs across categories like care and social isolation, preventative health, late-life financial services and longevity.
The increased spending power of women which are companies in technology categories like women’s health, commerce and the many ways women save, spend and invest money.
The shift to majority-minority and the changing technology consumption habits and needs that impact social, financial access, health equity and the future of work.

Right now, I’m very interested in companies that touch the future of non-white collar work. A lot of innovation has been focused on the office worker, but I want to see more innovation around healthcare jobs, service workers and other non-office careers.
How do you prefer to be approached: a cold email, a warm intro or another method
I want to hear from any founder building a company that will be accelerated by demographic change. How you reach me is up to you – just be prepared when you reach out to me to tell a concise, compelling story about the business you are building and why it matters. I can be reached on Twitter @moniquewoodard and you can can also reach out on our website.
Many laid-off engineers are launching their own startups: What are some of the skills/experience you look for in nontechnical founders?
I invest in the right person for the job and sometimes that is someone technical and sometimes it is not. The macroeconomic environment is leading many people to start companies who maybe would not have otherwise, and I think this is going to be a great thing. In lieu of technical skills, a great founder might have impressive sales skills — they will just have to know how to partner with a co-founder in order to get the product built.
The main thing I look for in founders is a big idea that can scale into a massive business, the ability to consistently execute and the resilience to get the business there.
In June 2023, what are some of the top questions founders should be asking investors?
I think asking questions around expectations on company growth trajectory, communication cadence and how the investor can best support the company as it scales are really important.
What’s a traditional pitch tactic that no longer works but is still a common practice? Are you open to reviewing pitch memos, or do you prefer a completed deck?
Artificially engineered FOMO is out. Founders who withhold information to be mysterious and put an aggressive time clock on investor decision-making (e.g., “we’re closing in three days”) are usually deals I’m going to pass on and I have never regretted that decision. Showing momentum is great, but I guard against being overly influenced by short timelines and the participation of other investors.
I will absolutely review a memo as long as it provides a full story and gives me an understanding of the business. Sometimes, memos do that better than decks.
Tell us about the best pitch you’ve received recently: At what point in their presentation did you realize you were going to invest?
The pitch I got from Jessica McGlory at Guaranteed was one of the most compelling conversations that I have had about the intersection of care and end of life. She was both mission-driven and dedicated to building a massive business in hospice care and the vision and thoughtfulness she showed in every conversation made me want to be on her team.
What are you reading/watching/listening to?
I’m reading “Palo Alto: A History of California, Capitalism and the World” by Malcom Harris and listening to the new Jelly Roll album, “Whitsitt Chapel.”
Adam Struck, founder and managing partner, Struck Capital
What kinds of investment opportunities are you looking for in June 2023?
We are especially excited about the technical innovation happening across fintech, e-commerce enablement, climate tech, and AI. Additionally, given the different macro environment than during the COVID boom, we have seen that more and more seed-stage companies are approaching funding in a more deliberate fashion.
To us, this means raising more appropriate rounds of funding that enable their companies to find robust product-market fit without exorbitant cash burn. I think this environment is more healthy and ultimately fosters more disciplined and efficient startups.
How do you prefer to be approached: a cold email, a warm intro or another method?
We want to speak to the best and brightest founders, regardless of if the introduction came from someone within our network or from cold outreach. With that being said, a warm introduction can help us cut through some of the noise, as we receive dozens of pitches each day.
If you’re comfortable doing so, please share your contact info. 
info@struckcapital.com.
Many laid-off engineers are launching their own startups: What are some of the skills/experience you look for in nontechnical founders?
We are excited about investing in nontechnical founders with robust information asymmetries that give their business an unfair advantage over the competition. For example, we get excited about a nontechnical founder that might have experienced this pain point in their previous role or sold into a similar buyer persona within their ideal customer profile.
Generally speaking, how much salary should the founder of a pre-revenue startup pay themselves?
Companies like Pave have become a great resource for founders and investors to benchmark salaries based on their role, location and amount of funding raised. It’s difficult to pinpoint an exact salary, as each individual’s financial situation is unique based on the stage of their career they are in, money saved and personal situation. We are in favor of more people pursuing entrepreneurship and becoming founders, so as long as a founder is most concerned with growing their equity value and not their cash composition, generally they can align with their early investors on a reasonable salary.
In June 2023, what are some of the top questions founders should be asking investors?
Founders should definitely look to speak with [other] founders within that VC’s portfolio and ask how the fund supported [them] during times of difficulty and uncertainty for their startup.
What’s a traditional pitch tactic that no longer works but is still a common practice?
We still encounter pitches that revolve around founders preferring to present their entire pitch deck and take questions at the end. We much prefer an engaging back-and-forth discussion around specific questions we are interested in learning more about. A discussion results in much deeper insights from a founder, which can be extremely helpful in deciding if we want to dig into further diligence.
Are you open to reviewing pitch memos, or do you prefer a completed deck? "
Nordic VC Voima Ventures launches €90M fund for deep tech startups,Paul Sawers,2023/06/13,"
Nordic VC firm Voima Ventures today announced its third fund with an initial closing of €90 million and a final target of €120 million, focusing on early-stage “deep tech” startups from across the science sphere.
Founded out of Helsinki, Finland, in 2019, Voima Ventures targets companies at the pre- and seed-stage, mostly involving startups emerging from university labs and related research institutions. Voima also occasionally delves into later stage investments where it involves existing portfolio companies, and its typical areas include companies working on sustainability, life science and health, and other “groundbreaking” technologies such as quantum computing.
Voima’s first two funds were launched back in 2019. Its €20 million Fund I was essentially the spin-off portfolio of state-owned technical research center VTT which remains one of the fund’s limited partners (LPs) today, while the second €60 million fund was announced simultaneously alongside the new Voima Ventures brand and a swathe of additional LPs. The first two funds have backed some 30 companies, including the likes of Solar Foods, Dispelix, Betolar and MVision, and it has a handful of exits to its name including Minima, which was snapped up by Bosch last year.
Voima’s latest fund includes capital from the European Investment Fund (EIF), Finland’s Tesi, VTT, Sweden’s Saminvest, and a handful of pension funds, foundations and family offices.
Bright and early
Europe has been ripe for fresh early-stage VC funds lately. In the past few months alone, we’ve seen the U.K.’s Amadeus Capital partner with Austria’s Apex Ventures for a €80 million ($86 million) deep tech fund, similar to IQ Capital which launched a new $200 million fund for early-stage deep tech startups. Moonfire VC, meanwhile, closed its second fund at $115 million; Playfair Capital closed a $70 million pre-seed fund; Ireland’s Elkstone closed its first formal VC fund at $108 million; Finland’s Lifeline Ventures closed a $163 million fund; and in France Emblem and Ovni Capital both announced new €50 million ($54 million) funds.
As with its previous funds, Voima’s third pot is focused firmly on Nordic and Baltic countries, though it occasionally dips into other countries across Northern Europe, and it’s aiming for ticket sizes ranging from €200,000 to €3 million spread across roughly 25 companies.
A core defining characteristic of Voima’s fund is that in addition to its collaboration with VTT, which is among Europe’s largest research institutes, it actively collaborates with universities from across Northern Europe. Voima founding partner Inka Mero says that nearly three-quarters of its portfolio hail from the academic world, including quantum chip startup Semiqon, which VTT recently spun out as an independent entity, and Cellfion, a clean energy materials company that emerged from the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) and Linköping University (LIU) in Sweden.
“We actively collaborate with all the Nordic and Baltic universities — we do this by visiting science teams and teams in incubation on a regular basis, hosting workshops, and coaching the most potential teams on a regular basis,” Mero told TechCrunch.
And while much has changed in the world since Voima first arrived on the scene some four years ago, from the global pandemic to major economic headwinds among other macroeconomic factors, Mero says it’s mostly business as usual in terms of what they’re looking for in startups and they’re approach to investing.
“Our investment strategy has remained the same — we continue investing in science-based and deep tech in the Nordics and Baltics,” Mero said. “With Fund III we are even more thesis-driven, and invest in companies tackling pressing global challenges.”

Indifi raises $35M to expand digital lending to more small businesses,Jagmeet Singh,2023/06/12,"
Indifi Technologies, an Indian startup offering digital lending to small and medium businesses, has raised $35 million in a new funding round led by ICICI Venture, the investment arm of ICICI Bank.
Existing investors, including British International Investment, OP Finnfund Global Impact Fund I, Omidyar Network India, Flourish Ventures and CX Partners also participated in the all-equity Series E round for the eight-year-old startup.
India is home to 63 million micro, small and medium-sized businesses. These enterprises form the economic backbone of the nation, contributing over 30% to the country’s gross domestic product and providing employment to over 113 million individuals. Despite their crucial role in the economy, these businesses continue to grapple with a significant obstacle — access to credit. The Reserve Bank of India’s Expert Committee shed light on this issue in its December 2018 report, estimating an alarming credit gap ranging from $243 billion to $303 billion (20–25 lakh crore Indian rupees) for the MSME sector.
Founded by Alok Mittal and Siddharth Mahanot in 2015, Indifi is attempting to plug this gap through different types of loans to businesses with turnaround of between $36,400–$1.21 million a year. The startup’s online marketplace enables businesses in various sectors – from travel to e-commerce, hotels, and retail – to conveniently secure unsecured loans tailored to their unique needs.
“That is a demonstration of the fact that other banks and NBFCs trust us to be able to run a tight lending ship not just from a technology and analytics standpoint, but from a core operations standpoint,” Mittal, Indifi’s managing director and CEO, told TechCrunch in an interview.
The Gurugram-based startup has disbursed over 73,000 loans across 400 cities, with a total disbursement value of over $497 million. In March, its assets under management reached $182 million, marking a growth of over 100% from the previous year.
Indifi’s client base includes about 30% of customers who have been in business for less than two years, typically below the cutoff for banks to provide loans. Additionally, more than 20% of Indifi’s customers are women entrepreneurs who often experience challenges obtaining credit from traditional channels.
“The idea is really to go to segments of the market that are not served well,” said Mittal.
In the last 12 months, Indifi grew 100% in value and 150% in volumes of loans disbursed, Mittal said, without disclosing specific figures. The startup had been profitable for six quarters in a row since February 2022, and its profitability numbers are improving, he said.
Over the last six months, Indifi has started making inroads in offering instant loans and enabling working capital finance for direct-to-consumer brands and software businesses. Mittal said the startup plans to utilize the fresh funds to continue to look for new segments in the markets it exists.
The startup also looks to improve its technology infrastructure and introduce new products to help more businesses get credit, the co-founder said.
In 2019, Indifi was processing a typical loan of $7,000 size. However, it has made technology investments to lower its average loan amount by 30% over a period of 18 months, bringing it down to about $6,000. It even processes loans of $600–1,200 to cater to the needs of micro and small entrepreneurs — alongside offering credit to medium-sized businesses.
“What we have been able to do in the last 18 months is to devise operating cost stacks that can serve a one-lakh rupee customer,” Mittal said.
Indifi has developed segment-specific models to accurately assess the risk of any particular model instead of relying on broad criteria, such as three years of vintage. It also incorporates a fully automated loan generation process, eliminating the need for manual data collection or underwriter oversight.
“Indifi has created a best-in-class digital technology platform for lending to the large MSME sector, enabling access to credit for this highly underserved segment of the Indian economy,” said Nikhil Mohta, senior director for private equity at ICICI Venture. “Indifi’s strong relationships with ecosystem partners and liability partners stand in good stead as it targets a rapid scale up. The robust governance and risk frameworks of the company inspire confidence, and we are excited to partner with Indifi in its onward journey.”
Although ICICI Venture’s investment comes as a financial one, ICICI Bank is already an Indifi partner. Mittal believes the funding from the bank’s VC arm would open up business conversations with the bank over time.
Indifi has raised over $81 million to date, including the latest funding and the Series D round of $45 million announced in November 2021. The startup has a headcount of about 700 people across product analytics, technology and business development as well as operational roles such as customer assistance and customer service.
When asked about plans to go public, Mittal said it would become a viable and attractive option at some point to raise further capital growth. Nonetheless, he emphasized that their current priority is to remain valuable to their customers by providing a diverse range of products and expanding their customer base. The startup also aims to increase the number of loans disbursed by up to three times “over the next couple of years.”
Indifi competes against the likes of Mayfield-backed LendingKart, Inclusive Fintech 50-invested FlexiLoans and Progcap, which counts Google and Tiger Global among its key investors.

Venture firm Black Seed raises £5M inaugural fund to invest in Black founders,Dominic-Madori Davis,2023/06/12,"
British early-stage venture firm Black Seed has raised £5 million ($6.2 million) as part of its inaugural fund to solely support Black founders in the country. The round was led by asset manager M&G Investments, with additional support from Atomico and Molten Ventures. The firm is hoping to raise an additional £5 million to close the round.
Black Seed was launched to address the lack of funding Black founders receive in the U.K., according to its founders: Karl Lokko, Cyril Lutterodt and founding member Yvonne Nagawa. Black founders in the country received only 0.24% of all VC funds between 2009 and 2019, and only 10 Black British women were able even to raise at all, according to a report by Extend Ventures. That’s worse in some ways than in the United States.
The dismal lack of funding has historically led to Black British talent leaving the country for the U.S. seeking funding opportunities. Lokko and Lutterodt said the firm also wants to address the fact that 88% of Black businesses in the U.K. are self-funded, and they want to decrease that number to at least 50%.
“We exist as a tech fund and a community,” Lokko said. “We exist to bridge that gap and give Black founders inclusion.”
Lutterodt said that the firm wants to cut to the chase by writing checks to help bring about change, as many Black founders in the U.K. are overmentored yet underfunded. “We have built a pipeline of Black entrepreneurs, primed and ready,” he said, adding that the firm expects to make at least 10 investments over the next three years and has a reserve fund for follow-on investments.
The firm will focus on early-stage investing, serving as a kind of “family and friends” round for those who lack access to angel investors — or, as they say in the U.K., the “Bank of Mum and Dad.” It is one of a handful of funds that exist in the U.K. that focus solely on Black founders. Black Seed is industry agnostic, though Lutterodt says it’s particularly interested in deep tech, health care and AI.
Black Seed also hosts events at its office in Brixton, the south London neighborhood known for its Afro-Caribbean population. The firm organizes the Brixton Startup Weekend as well as the pitch competition Lyan’s Den.
Humble origins
Launched in 2021, the firm was initially supposed to announce the £5 million raise late last year, but it ran into delays concerning regulatory compliance.
“We actually overestimated how long it would take to get £5 million worth of commitments,” Nagawa, who also serves as Black Seed’s chief of staff, told TechCrunch+. “It only took us six months to hit that figure. What we underestimated was the length of time it would then take to complete the legal side of things and the paperwork. It was a reminder of the complicated factors you face when raising a fund.” "

The 3 stages of building world-class growth funnels



Launching a startup usually means obsessing about whether product-market fit (PMF) has been achieved in its early days. More broadly, PMF is a term we use to describe a product or service that has generated enough organic demand from consumers. This demand is both sustainable and economically worthwhile for a startup to continue offering said product.
How can you find PMF in the most efficient and frictionless way possible? I argue that the answer to this question is paid acquisition. This article will help you select the best paid channel depending on your startup idea, deploy a battle-tested waitlist strategy, optimize messaging tests and more.
Which paid channel to select?
Typically, I recommend Meta as the first paid channel to explore for a multitude of reasons: targeting capability, relatively cheap traffic and a visual format for testing both graphics and copy.


			How can you find PMF in the most efficient and frictionless way possible? I argue that the answer is paid acquisition.					


By contrast, Google and paid search traffic is preferable if your offering is of high search-intent volume or in a complex B2B segment. For example, advertising a supply-chain AI startup targeting freight companies on Meta would be too complex and unlikely to find the right audience.
The easiest method for determining which paid acquisition channel is right for your startup is with the following three questions:

Is my offering highly visual (clothing, product-based, etc.)?
Does my product/service require an immediate solution to an event (moving homes, doctor’s visit for cold, etc.)?
How complex is my offering?

If you answered that your product/service is highly visual, you’d be leaning toward a paid social channel such as Facebook or TikTok. However, if you answered that your offering is either immediate-solution oriented, location-based or complex, you should pivot toward a paid search channel, effectively Google.
Example channels that startups could have selected to find PMF. Image Credits: Jonathan Martinez
The Venn diagram above illustrates which channels these established startups should have tested if they were looking to validate PMF. Certain startups, such as Forward Health or Canva, can get away with advertising on both channels because they’re visual, not complex, and have a large target market.
Most consumers can leverage a new healthcare plan or graphic creation, which is inherently very visual. Conversely, a startup such as Lugg, which helps people move homes, should leverage Google as their company offers a solution that consumers often need immediately and at very specific times.
As an additional note, if you’re looking to advertise on Meta, BusinessofApps is reporting that the latest cost per thousand impressions (CPMs) is hovering around $15 in 2023. This means that to have an estimated 1,000 people view your offering, you’ll be paying around $15. Not bad at all!
Battle-tested waitlist method
In college, I tested countless startup ideas with friends who were as excited about starting a business as I was. Unfortunately, none of them ultimately succeeded. However, an important, long-term success came from developing a strategy that I then employed many times to assess PMF. I’ve broken it down into five easy steps:

"Cava boosts its IPO price range, highlighting appetite for growth stories",Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/12,"
How about we kick off the week with some good news?
This morning, American fast-casual restaurant chain Cava raised its IPO price range from $17-$19 per share to $19-$20 per share.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

As we reported during Cava’s IPO run, the company shares a number of similarities with other venture-backed, tech-enabled businesses that went public in and around 2021. That means this IPO is not a precise comparable for many startups that are waiting for the IPO market to return. Instead, it will serve to help us track a bit of private capital through its recycling period and catch the current vibe for growth-y companies.
This morning, we’re asking: What is Cava’s new midpoint and maximum valuation given the new price range? When we compare those figures to its recent revenue growth and profit metrics, can we spy any good news for unicorns looking to go public as soon as they can gin up the courage?
So what’s Cava worth at its new IPO price range?
Increasing your IPO pricing range from $17-$19 per share to $19-$20 per share is not that big of a shift. We’ve seen larger changes in the past, especially when the IPO market has been hot. Still, Cava has brought up the floor price for its IPO to its previous ceiling.
That’s great for the company, as it will be able to raise more capital without diluting its shareholders any more than planned.

At $19 per share, Cava is worth $2.12 billion ($2.16 billion if underwriters purchase their full option).
At the midpoint of its new range, Cava is worth $2.17 billion ($2.21 billion if underwriters purchase their full option).
At $20 per share, Cava is worth $2.23 billion ($2.27 billion if underwriters purchase their full option). "
VCs remain confident alternative protein has a real future despite public-market woes,Christine Hall,2023/06/12,"
How well have alternative-protein companies done in the past year? It depends on who you ask.
The industry has had an interesting go of it between the U.S. getting comfortable with cultivated meat production, layoffs and countries banning production. Yet, startups and investors are hanging in there.
To get the pulse of what’s germinating in this fast-rising industry, TechCrunch+ surveyed five investors, all active in various areas of investment in alternative protein, and they had a lot to say on the subject.
Nate Cooper, managing partner at Barrel Ventures, bluntly pointed out the valuation mismatch that startups in the sector enjoy, saying too many “food tech” companies are today valued as if they were pure technology plays. “At the end of the day, they are selling a CPG product and should be valued as such,” he said. “Until this stops, there are unfortunately going to be a lot of investors and companies left holding the bag, and a lot of companies that, realistically, will never grow into the private valuations they were given.”
Many of the startups tackling food are doing so to help improve the Earth’s climate and change the dependency on animal-based foods. Rosie Wardle, co-founder and partner at Synthesis Capital, said it is also driven by consumer demand for the same.

“Shifting away from animal proteins and toward alternative proteins will be necessary for governments to address climate impacts and to reach their net-zero targets,” Wardle said. “To this end, we are already seeing alternative proteins highlighted by governments across the world as a key solution to the climate crisis, and we expect this focus to grow in the coming years.”
However, more infrastructure is needed to ensure alternative proteins can be produced at levels that will make an impact. While venture capital is helping here, companies are getting creative when it comes to additional funding sources to build manufacturing plants, said Alice Brooks, principal at Khosla Ventures.
“It’s likely that startups will need to fund their first plants largely with venture capital,” Brooks said. “However, we are seeing companies using creative ways to fund their buildouts with partnerships. We encourage startups to prove their unit economics and scalability with the minimum size plant possible so they can get out there and test with customers.”
Read on to learn how companies can get more consumers on board with eating plant-based alternatives, where the gaps are in the mainstream manufacturing of alternative proteins, and who they think are some of the “bright spots” in the industry so far.

Beyond Foods and Impossible are clear incumbents, but both cited declining sales last year as the reason for their layoffs. How can alt-protein companies reach more people and earn greater customer acceptance?
The market is still early for plant proteins and we are seeing them being adopted across a range of products. Any big change, like this one, takes years for customers to adopt. For new entrants, the key to a good product is taste and cost. Can it be as tasty as the conventional option? Can it be comparable in cost?
Have valuations in the alternative-protein space compressed in line with what we’ve seen with Beyond on the public markets? How has the changed investing landscape impacted your strategy in the sector?
In the past year, given recent economic conditions, the bar is higher for fundraising. In the food tech space, we have not seen valuations soar as much as they did in other areas, but we’re still advising our companies to focus on de-risking the most critical technical and commercial milestones with each financing.
The days of growth at all costs are abating, and there is now a greater focus on demonstrating valuable commercial proof points earlier in a company’s life.

"Oova grabs another $10.3M, unveils membership model for at-home fertility testing",Christine Hall,2023/06/12,"
One in six people are expected to be affected by infertility at some point in their lives, and with the cost of procedures, like in vitro fertilization, costing tens of thousands of dollars for each procedure, more people seek better ways to understand their reproductive health.
There are a number of startups tackling this issue, for example, Generation Prime, Flo, Future Family, Maven and Mate Fertility, which all received funding within the past few years.
Oova, a women’s health and fertility startup working in the fertility-tracking segment of the market, is the latest to get additional venture-backed funding, raising $10.3 million in Series A funding for its at-home approach to translating a woman’s fertility.
It is also launching the Oova Membership. Priced at $99 per month, the membership includes The Oova Kit and offers features, such as personalized support via the Oova Provider network of healthcare professionals and hormone experts and access to a community of people going through similar fertility journeys.

Oova raises $1.2M to develop a better at-home kit for detecting a woman’s best time to conceive

Oova was previously profiled in 2021 when founder and CEO Amy Divaraniya, Ph.D. officially launched its at-home urine test, called Oova Kit, with $1.2 million in seed funding. The test comes with 15 days of testing strips and measures the luteinizing hormone and progesterone to provide advanced personalized analytics and real-time action plans so a woman can know her most fertile days and confirm ovulation.

It is FDA registered, and the company touts it is the “only product that allows its users to sync and share results with their doctor in real time.” Divaraniya told TechCrunch that talk within the fertility industry, especially following the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, shifted to data security, and unlike other period and fertility tracking companies, Oova was always HIPAA compliant and invested in secure connections with its clinic partners.
Divaraniya was mum about the company’s growth over the past year, but did say Oova is now working with over 100 clinics, up from 75 at the launch in 2021. In addition, the company has trained its model on over 10,000 cycles monitored through the platform.
“We’ve also seen a massive increase in the adoption across both consumer and clinical channels,” Divaraniya said. “Because of the adoption, it led to one of the most powerful datasets in the industry. This is a dream of information to work with. Not only do we have daily hormone measurements across tens of thousands of cycles, but we also have treatment data. We’ve been able to train our algorithms on actual hormone information across thousands of women, and then even look at intrapersonal data to understand the nuances between cycles for a single woman, leading to a very personalized experience for our users.”
Meanwhile, Spero Ventures led the new round and was joined by US Fertility, Virgin Group, Jefferson Health, Connecticut Innovations, Hannah Bronfman and Spanx founder Sara Blakely. In total, the company raised $11.5 million.
“Oova has revolutionized the way we understand our hormonal health,” said Sara Eshelman, partner at Spero Ventures, in a written statement. “By making clinical-grade hormone monitoring convenient and cost-effective for daily use, Oova is empowering its users to understand their cycles, improve fertility outcomes and manage their symptoms.”
Divaraniya said Oova went after a new funding round when its technology reached some heavy adoption and the company received feedback from physicians asking for Oova to test additional hormones.
Patients are also using Oova’s technology for use cases that it wasn’t initially designed for, like the early part of pregnancy and postpartum, but are finding value in the data. In addition, the company is eyeing all other phases of a women’s health.
“We started off with fertility because it’s a place that I’m very passionate about, but what is also very clear is that all the different phases of a woman’s life are dictated by hormones,” she said. “If you can understand the different patterns that happen in classic urban spaces, you can actually start adjusting those.”

Salesforce pledges to invest $500M in generative AI startups,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/12,"
Showing it’s playing for keeps in the generative AI race, Salesforce today announced that it’s growing its Generative AI Fund, the part of the company’s Salesforce Ventures VC off-shoot backing startups developing “responsible generative AI,” from $250 million in size to $500 million.
In a canned statement, Salesforce Ventures managing partner Paul Drews said that the expansion would enable Salesforce to “work with even more entrepreneurs … accelerating the development of transformative AI solutions for the enterprise.
“We’re already seeing AI change the way the world works, and we’re excited to build on the momentum of our Generative AI fund,” Drews continued. “We’re excited to support the next generation of innovative founders.”
Launched in March, the Generative AI Fund has already invested in several firms on the frontier of generative AI tech, including Cohere, Anthropic, You.com, Hearth.AI and newer additions Humane and Tribble. While far from the only fund investing primarily in generative AI, Salesforce aims to differentiate its tranche by prioritizing what it describes as “ethical” AI technologies.
For example, go-to-market function automation platform Tribble recently partnered with Private AI, a privacy-focused AI company, to use Private GPT, a product that redacts personally identifiable information before sending it through OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot.
The Generative AI Fund is also distinguished by the diverse range of technologies it’s financing. Humane, for instance, is creating a wearable, screen-less AI assistant, while You.com hosts an AI-powered search engine with generative art and text tools.
Salesforce Ventures has a number of vertical-specific investment funds, including funds aimed at particular geographies such as Japan or Canada and a dedicated AI fund. But the Generative AI Fund is among the VC arm’s largest tranches to date; previous funds ranged from $50 million to $125 million.
The expansion of the Generative AI Fund coincides with the debut of Salesforce’s AI for Impact Accelerator, the company’s second-ever accelerator program. AI for Impact will grant $2 million to a cohort of education, workforce and climate organizations to “advance the equitable and ethical use of trusted AI.”
“AI for Impact aims to close the AI access gap by providing flexible funding, pro-bono expertise and technology to purpose-driven organizations, empowering them to accelerate generative AI-based solutions to the world’s most pressing challenges,” Salesforce said in a press release. “AI for Impact [is a] philanthropic initiative to help purpose-driven organizations gain equitable access to trusted generative AI technologies.”
Bloomberg notes that investments from Salesforce’s accelerators and funds may become more important to the company’s bottom line as activist investors, like Elliott Management, discourage large acquisitions. To date, Salesforce Ventures, one of the most active corporate VCs in recent years, has participated in over 140 deals for AI and machine learning startups, particularly in the areas of AI insights for sales, natural language chatbots for service requests, targeted marketing content and personalized e-commerce experiences.
Generative AI — assuming it lives up to the hype — could be a massive market opportunity. Grand View Research predicts that the sector could be worth roughly $109 billion by 2030.
The C-suite in particular expects generative AI to have an enormous impact on business. According to a recent KPMG survey, almost two-thirds (65%) of execs believe that generative AI will have a “high” or “extremely high”” impact on their organization in the next three to five years — far above every other emerging technology.
Beyond the Generative AI Fund and AI for Impact, Salesforce is investing in generative AI technologies internally, piloting tools like EinsteinGPT (which lets Salesforce customers ask questions about Salesforce’s content and services) and SlackGPT (which answers natural language questions about Slack content).
In addition, Salesforce has previewed the ability to create landing pages on the fly, compose sales emails and write code in Apex, Salesforce’s programming language, to programmatically trigger certain actions in a workflow, among other tasks.

Navan takes a swipe at expense management startups with new Mastercard and Visa partnerships,Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/06/12,"
Want more fintech news in your inbox? Sign up here.
In recent years, a number of startups have made a business out of providing corporate credit cards to companies. These players compete not only with each other but with legacy providers such as Concur and Expensify by offering automated expense management.
Many of these startups generate revenue from interchange fees, meaning that they receive a certain percentage of each transaction made on the corporate card they have provided. Ramp, for example, is one such company. Some of those startups also make money by charging subscriptions for their expense management software. Brex, which started out as primarily a corporate card provider, made a big push last year into software. 
Navan (formerly known as TripActions) offers both a corporate card as well as a subscription to its software. In a twist, the company today is announcing the launch of a new product called Navan Connect, which it describes as a patented card-link technology that gives businesses a way to offer automated expense management and reconciliation without having to change their corporate card provider. For the initial launch, Navan has partnered with Mastercard and Visa, with plans to announce additional network tie-ups in the near future.
The move is significant in that Navan is essentially addressing a presumably large market of companies that would prefer to continue working with an existing bank partner for a variety of reasons but want the option to offer more modern ways to manage expenses. Filing expense reports is by far one of employees’ least favorite tasks, but the rationale behind automating the process goes beyond simply eliminating expense reports – it also is aimed at giving companies more insight into how and where employees are spending so that it can identify ways to trim costs in the future and ensure company policy is applied onto the card.
Now, by integrating Navan’s technology, any corporate Visa or Mastercard user would have the option to do things like set policies and budgets they’re trying to administer and then have all expenses automatically reconciled and filed, according to Michael Sindicich, executive vice president and general manager of Navan Expense.
“When we talk with customers, some of them want our cards and they want our credit, but we also see – especially larger companies – some who have existing banking relationships and corporate cards who want better tools to manage their employees,” Sindicich told TechCrunch. “In the past when you are going with one of the new players, including Navan, you are beholden to taking the cards they issue. But what we’ve done allows us to connect with the Visas and Mastercards of the world and still get that real-time reconciliation.”
Image Credits: Navan
Navan appears to not be concerned about its new Connect product competing with its own corporate card offering.
Historically, Sindicich said, Navan has charged licensing fees and software fees for its expense and travel products. It charges trip fees, and sometimes implementation fees. And it makes “some commissions” from suppliers and some interchange commissions from card swipes. 
“But for us, it was never about being a bank,” he told TechCrunch. “So, Connect would cannibalize the money we can make from our Navan cards on the interchange. but we were giving that interchange most of it back as rebates to the customers anyway. And I don’t think that we or Silicon Valley has any right to say we are going to innovate by building a better bank against some of these larger banks that are out there. They’re better at underwriting. They’re better at managing capital and raising capital. What Navan can provide is this technology and partner with banks in order to offer this holistic solution. And so that’s where that’s where we’re focusing.”

"HSBC rebrands, expands its SVB UK buy as HSBC Innovation Banking",Ingrid Lunden,2023/06/11,"
Acquired by HSBC in an emergency sale for just £1 in March as SVB was melting down, SVB UK is now getting a rebrand and expansion under its new owner. Today the banking giant launched HSBC Innovation Banking, a new unit focusing on banking services to the startup, investor and wider tech community.
Rumored for weeks leading up to today, and now officially announced at the kick-off to London Tech Week, the new division — technically a subsidiary of HSBC UK — will be bigger than just the SVB UK assets: HSBC has added teams in the U.S., Israel and Hong Kong to the operation, with more than 700 people employed in the operation. For now, it sounds like the clientele is mostly U.K. — some 3,000 customers in all out of its home country, HSBC said.
The firm sets up arch competition between former bedfellows: First Citizens acquired the majority of SVB’s banking operations, which were in the U.S. and included some $72 billion in deposits and loans and had been operating under the name SVB Bridge Bank after holding company SVB Financial collapsed.
The two are going out of the gate in true competitive style: First Citizens is currently suing HSBC for poaching SVB staff — specifically people like David Sabow. who had been the head of SVB in the U.S. Sabow will now lead HSBC Innovation Banking out of the U.S. It also recruited what appears to have been the whole team of SVB Israel: Led by David Cohen, it also includes his whole team of Gadi Moshe, Alon Oz, Tamir Efrati, and Meir Slobodov, plus some 20 others. Indeed, that lawsuit was likely filed in anticipation of the announcement and push made official today.
Erin Platts, who had been the head of SVB UK, appears to be leading the new Innovation Banking business with the title “CEO of HSBC Innovation Banking UK”.
The large incumbent bank’s effort to tap into the fast-growing technology sector strategy is coming at an inflection point — or at least HSBC hopes that to be the case. Funding for technology companies had been gushing like a geyser for years leading up to and through the Covid-19 pandemic — one reason why SVB, originally a community bank for the nascent startup industry, had scaled into an outsized operation that regulators were struggling to keep up with. But in the last 18 months, all that has been reduced to a trickle — one big contributor to SVB’s failure.
Now, HSBC is making a bet that launching this new and redoubled effort, when the market is more quiet and at a low point, will set it up for big gains as it returns, with the added buffer that it will have a massive behemoth behind it to handle knocks more gracefully than SVB did.
It’s not clear what size the business is out of the gate with assets under management. When HSBC acquired SVB UK, the deal included assuming loans of around £5.5 billion and deposits of around £6.7 billion. In its last reported figures, covering the financial year ending 31 December 2022, SVB UK had recorded a profit before tax of £88 million, and HSBC said at the time of the acquisition that SVB UK’s tangible equity was expected to be around £1.4 billion.
“The UK’s world-leading technology and life sciences sectors are central to growing the UK economy and boosting global exports,” said Noel Quinn, Group Chief Executive of HSBC, in a statement. “HSBC now has a world-class team focused on innovation companies, their founders and their investors. We will protect this specialism and take it to the next level by combining these capabilities with our financial strength and global reach. Our new innovation teams will be there to support our clients’ international growth at every step.”
The operation will cover technology as well as adjacent areas, such as startup businesses and financiers in areas like life sciences.
“The UK is home to world-leading tech and life sciences sectors, and I am proud of the role the British government has played in securing their future and enabling them to thrive,” said UK Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, in a statement. ““HSBC Innovation Banking will help innovative businesses to unlock their potential, create more jobs and access new global opportunities – supporting my priority to grow the UK economy and cement our position as a science and tech superpower.”

Djust is a new commerce platform focused exclusively on B2B transactions,Romain Dillet,2023/06/11,"
Meet Djust, a French startup that essentially wants to build an e-commerce platform like Mirakl, but focused exclusively on business-to-business (B2B) activities. The company recently raised a $13 million funding round (€12 million).
NEA is leading the most recent funding round, with Elaia Partners also investing in the company. Elaia previously led Djust’s $4 million seed round in 2020.
The reason why I’m comparing Djust with Mirakl is that Djust’s co-founder and CEO Arnaud Rihiant was part of Mirakl’s founding team, working for the company for more than a decade. Mirakl is now one the highest valued French startup and competes with Adobe Commerce, Salesforce Commerce and Shopify.
Mirakl first started as a way to launch a marketplace of third-party sellers on an e-commerce website — a B2C strategy. Over time, Mirakl realized that marketplaces could also work well for B2B clients.
“Every time we would do a B2B project with Mirakl, I was shocked by the complexity of the project,” Rihiant told me. “When I looked into the matter, I realized that it’s not [Mirakl’s] fault. But the marketplace industry was designed for B2C.”
And yet, Rihiant believes that B2B commerce platforms represent an interesting opportunity as it has been an underserved market for too long. Many companies already have an ERP system, but they still deal with orders over the phone, via email and using Excel spreadsheets. In other words, it doesn’t scale well.
When it comes to the basics, Djust bridges the gap between legacy systems and its modern platform. It can connect with ERP systems and make data actionable.
From Djust, you can manage your catalog, your clients and your orders. And the startup offers advanced features in all those categories.
For instance, when it comes to catalog management, Djust lets you segment the catalog so that each client sees relevant products. Sometimes, clients also get different prices depending on what they agreed on when they signed the original contract.
When it’s time to order, Djust offers several options depending on the industry. For instance, you can enable a bidding process or facilitate re-orders for clients that mostly want to resupply their stores. You can also configure different payment options.
Djust is already working with clients in the construction industry, such as Bouygues and Eiffage, and with retailers looking for a platform to handle orders with their franchise stores, such as Monoprix, Franprix and Naturalia.
The startup is building a generic B2B commerce platform so it would work for different industries. For instance, restaurant chains could benefit from a product like Djust as their procurement system. Fashion brands that mostly sell their items in partner stores could connect with their retail partners on a Djust-powered platform.
The product can be used as a headless platform with your own frontend framework, or it can be used with Djust’s frontend customized to your needs. It works with different sales channels — clients can still offer phone or email orders without asking all their existing clients to go through a new website.
There are currently 45 people working for the startup. With today’s funding round, Djust plans to grow its team, iterate on its product and find new clients all across Europe.

Here are the most richly valued startup types in today’s early-stage venture market,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/11,"
If you want to score the largest possible early-stage valuation, what should your startup focus on? New data makes it clear that the seed and Series A markets are hardly equal when it comes to what venture capitalists are willing to pay for one category of startup over another.
Don’t worry, the answer here is not just “build an AI startup,” even if that does appear to be pretty solid advice for avoiding a down round.
Data shared by Carta when we interviewed the company’s CEO on the Equity podcast earlier this week provides a simple and clear stratification of early-stage valuations and fundraising sizing. Let’s start with seed data:

Consolidation continues in the world of fintech
Last week ended with a couple of significant news events in the fintech world. First up, Ingrid and I wrote about FIS acquiring banking-as-a-service startup Bond for an undisclosed amount. (Fintech Business Weekly’s Jason Mikula initially broke the news). The deal is both an example of the resilience of infrastructure in the fintech space and a year that is proving to be filled with consolidation – as expected in a no-IPO, less capital rich environment. 
Earlier this year, Marqeta acquired financial infrastructure startup Power Finance in a $275 million deal. JPMorgan closed its acquisition of Aumni. And Brazilian fintech infra company Pismo is said to be in the midst of being courted by the likes of Visa and Mastercard in a reported $1 billion transaction.
As Ingrid pointed out, not every M&A deal works out well, of course, with the biggest often being the hardest to digest. FIS made one of the largest-ever acquisitions in the world of payments when it acquired WorldPay for about $43 billion in 2019. That deal never really came up trumps, though. In February of this year, FIS confirmed that it would be spinning WorldPay off.
I also wrote about Better.com’s laying off its real estate team and the related shedding of its real estate business unit – a move that we knew was coming, but just didn’t know when. The company reportedly bet big on real estate in 2022, presumably before the housing market turned and mortgage interest rates soared. But as the refinancing market dried up and fewer people wanted to lose their lower interest rates by buying another home in a tight market, the unit was negatively impacted. The company declined to comment on the move but one person (who wished to remain anonymous) who was affected by the layoffs told TechCrunch via email on June 8: “At 8AM yesterday, after being praised in Tuesday’s meeting, our computers where disconnected and logged out of work emails. No warning.” Guess Better.com hasn’t learned from its past experiences of botching layoffs. – Mary Ann
FedNow set to launch
As you may recall, the imploding of banks, like Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank, shed a lot of light on payment rails, and the Federal Reserve’s new FedNow Service, set to launch in July, is being referenced as something that will ease some of the pain being felt by legacy payment rails. 
The Fed suggests that FedNow, an instant payment infrastructure, will be a faster payment rail for financial institutions, offering real-time, 24/7, every day of the year with immediate access to funds. Even investors are keen on it.
This week, we saw some movements related to FedNow. First, TX Zhuo, managing partner of Fika Ventures, noted that “FedNow presents both compelling opportunities and potentially complex challenges,” and many of the effects will be something we can see as early as next year. Zhuo points to one of the immediate opportunities being risk management, especially with the incidences of fraud and scams we read about each day. Read more.
The other has to do with companies working to integrate FedNow. Global digital transformation company GFT is drawing on its experience with Pix in Brazil and the Universal Digital Payments Network to provide a three-part approach for banks. GFT developed architecture and compliance measures so that banks can scale transaction volume and no longer be dependent on closed, third-party services for instant payments.
To illustrate the potential for FedNow, Brazilian instant payments Matera released a report in May highlighting how well Pix is doing in Brazil. Notably, in 12 months, Pix reached 100 million users and 24 billion transactions were made in 2022, with nearly 3 billion transactions made just in December 2022. – Christine

Affirm has become the first buy now, pay later player to be added to Amazon Pay, the two companies announced on June 7. As part of the new partnership, any Amazon Pay merchants in the U.S. can now choose to offer their customers the option to “buy now, pay later” using Affirm’s technology. Affirm first announced an initial partnership with Amazon in August of 2021, which was exclusive through January of 2023. The news gave Affirm’s stock a much-needed boost. Shares had closed at $15.82 on June 6, the day before the announcement came out. By Friday late morning, they were trading at $18.32 after having shot up as high as $19.58 – up 15.8%. More on the news here.
As reported by Sarah Perez, Apple on June 7 “two significant changes to Apple Wallet among a handful of other updates that didn’t make the keynote address last Monday, which kicked off the start of its Worldwide Developers Conference. With the launch of iOS 17 this fall, Apple says users will be able to set up recurring payments with Apple Cash — handy for regular expenses, like rent, or for parents paying kids’ allowances, for example. In addition, Apple is announcing a new system that will allow businesses to accept IDs stored in Apple Wallet.” More here.
Anthemis Group announced last week that it has named Harry Harrison CEO of Anthemis Asset Management. Besides being the husband to Anthemis Group founder and CEO Amy Nauiokas, Harrison is the former head of Barclays Non-Core in London. The fintech-focused venture capital firm has been in the news several times in recent months. In May, TechCrunch reported that Anthemis Group is trying to raise $200 million for a third fund, according to an SEC filing. That new fundraising filing came just months after Anthemis laid off 16 people, or 28% of its staff, as reported by TechCrunch in April. At that time, a spokesperson for London-based Anthemis told TechCrunch that the move was an effort “to better reflect current market conditions and to set up the business for future growth” against its “strategic priorities.”
In a TechCrunch+ guest post, Healy Jones, who runs financial planning and analysis for Kruze Consulting, analyzed revenue, spending and runway data from 2021 and 2022 for over 700 startup clients to find out just how well certain industries were doing, including fintech. We won’t spoil the whole thing, however, we will note that the data confirms some things we’ve seen in the fintech industry in the past year, including growth among startups was doing well until the third quarter of 2022, “suggesting that the collapse of the cryptocurrency market severely impacted fintech sector revenues.” Read more.

According to Capterra’s 2023 Accounting and AI Survey of 317 business leaders, “51% of SMBs say AI and ML will fundamentally change business finance operations for the foreseeable future, and 76% of businesses have adopted at least one form of AI or ML technology to handle accounting and finance needs.” More here.

In the era of quick judgments, it’s tempting to think we are more clever than anyone else. But from AI to Apple to senior tech, underestimating others comes at a risk: being seriously wrong. — Anna
Don’t underestimate your granny
When the U.S. surgeon general’s advisory called out “our epidemic of loneliness and isolation,” heads immediately turned to social media and its risks for children and teens.
I can only agree with Dr. Vivek Murthy that social connection and community have healing effects, but I am on the fence on where technology stands. Sure, it can make us more isolated, but it can also connect us.
Dor Skuler, a founder I met recently, thinks that age makes a difference. “While the surgeon general warns technology is a contributing factor for teen loneliness, the report and our data shows the opposite holds true for older adults,” he said.
Skuler is referring to the insights gathered by his company, Intuition Robotics. He has a horse in the race: Its flagship product is ElliQ, an AI companion aiming to achieve “healthier, happier aging.” But he also has data: After years in beta testing, ElliQ is being distributed to American seniors through several state aging agencies.

It turns out you can: By paying close attention to what the behemoths in your space are doing. Last year’s AWS Re:Invent set the direction for a lot of what Amazon is doing this year — including where it invests. Re:Invent 2023 is coming up soon.
Google I/O revealed that Google is investing heavily in computational photography, large language models and all things AI. As a startup, you can use these data points and draw a line into the future: Can you align yourself with the big-picture trends? Are you missing anything?
This week, at Apple’s worldwide developer conference WWDC, the company took the wraps off its AR/VR headset. Priced at $3,500 it won’t be a commercial success, but as a startup, you’d be very silly not to pay attention: It is a complete game-changer for startups.
Startup valuations are taking a pounding
After a frothy few years of don’t-call-it-a-bubble, it seems like the inevitable market correction is here. We’ve seen wave after wave of tech layoffs, and it seems like investors are starting to take a more realistic view of their investments, starting to mark them down.
Marking down an investment doesn’t necessarily mean drama; it refers to the common process of adjusting the value of an investment asset to reflect its current market value. In the case of VC, that often happens if the valuation turned out to be a bit on the optimistic side. Investors will typically mark down investments to avoid overstating their portfolio’s worth. In a nutshell, it’s best practice to acknowledge potential losses before they are realized. That’s what is happening now — and perhaps should have been happening for a while, as Rebecca argued late last year, when she noticed that a bunch of startups had quietly marked down their own valuations.
Jeremy Abelson and Jacob Sonnenberg, both at Irving Investors, argue that if you haven’t yet, you probably won’t grow into your 2023 investment valuation.

Just in the past few weeks week, we had another handful of examples of this:

Reddit gets a reread: Manish reports that Fidelity cuts Reddit valuation by 41%.
Canva gets redrawn: Connie reports that Rowe Price has marked down its stake in Canva by 67.6%.
NestAway moves to a smaller apartment: NestAway, once valued at over $225 million, sells for $11 million, Manish reports.

Life is a highway
The EV space is exploding (sometimes literally) at the moment, and there seems to be a huge amount of stuff in motion in the world of transportation.
Mercedes just got permission from the state of California to start selling a car that can self-drive without having to hold the wheel or look at the road. No doubt this’ll set Elon Musk’s little temperature gauge to “furious” as the company’s cars do attract a federal tax break but come up short on the self-driving front in its native California.
Price is often brought up as a major hurdle for EVs, but Volvo snuck out a small SUV that can cruise along for 275 miles and has a sub-$35,000 price tag. That still isn’t pocket change, but it’s a lot cheaper than a lot of the EVs on the road. Meanwhile, Fiat showed off a city vehicle it’s working on that made both Harri and myself squee with delight.
Safety is another theme across TechCrunch’s transportation coverage: Smarter cars should, in theory, mean safer roads. In practice, Waymo had to explain why one of its autonomous Jaguars ran down a dog in San Francisco last month, and Transportation’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recently proposed a rule that means all new cars and trucks would need to have emergency systems that “would have to be capable of stopping and avoiding contact with a vehicle at speeds of up to 62 miles per hour.”
Remember what we said about legislation driving innovation and opportunities for startup? That proposed NHTSA rule falls into that category. Thought experiment: Could your company tap into that shift somehow?

Wheelbarrow-sized EV: Harri reports that Arcimoto’s latest teeny-tiny EV is all work and no play.
Well they trucked that one up: Rebecca reports that Nikola’s bid to increase shares stalls after failing to get enough shareholders to vote.

Apple sets the pace
While Apple isn’t really a startup, it is the world’s first $3 trillion market cap company, so in a week where our servers have been melting from all of the exciting news that came out of the WWDC keynote, I wanted to highlight some of the things that are most interesting to startups and startup founders.
One thing worth paying attention to is the Apple Design Awards, which often foreshadow large trends in design and user experience best practices — along with what the Cupertino-based software giant celebrates at the moment.
Another trend worth paying attention to from Apple is its focus on health and safety: It released a check-In feature to ensure people get home safe, a nudity filter to shield you from unsolicited real-life aubergine emoji and mental health mood tracking. All of that is specific to this WWDC, but it continues a trend: Fall detection, car crash detection, ECG to detect heart events, and lots of other health and safety indicators. It has made it easier to find and disable AirTags that might be used for stalking, and a Safety Check and lockdown mode, which takes your iPhone off the radar to get away from an abusive partner (more from our security team here).
As a startup, all of the above should give you pause for thought: There are big trends at play here that Apple clearly wants to continue to invest in. Apple has gone heavy into the privacy of your data, and leaning into security, safety, mental and physical health and more. Build something truly innovative in these spaces, and you have the world’s most valuable company validating that these are problems worth solving.

"Deal Dive: Finally, a startup building a network for those who could benefit the most",Rebecca Szkutak,2023/06/10,"
The tech industry has tried hard to address its diversity problem, but hiring talent from different backgrounds is only the first “challenge.” A bigger one is retaining them.
Porter Braswell is no stranger to the statistics or to companies’ various excuses for why the numbers are so bad. Early in his career, he struggled to break into tech despite holding internships at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, and was repeatedly told it was a pipeline problem.
So, Braswell launched Jopwell, a career platform for people from underrepresented communities and backgrounds.
Nearly a decade later, the company says it has supported tens of thousands of professionals, and Braswell has moved into an executive chairman role, looking for his next problem to solve. It wasn’t far off: He found that while many companies had started hiring more people of color, they had a new issue in getting the employees to stay.
“Retention is a major challenge and still remains so,” Braswell told TechCrunch+. “My heart was pulling me toward the retention part of the equation, especially [the feeling of] belonging. What are the variables that lead people to feel like they belong or that ultimately lead individuals of color to leave organizations? It’s because they don’t feel seen, heard or valued.”
Braswell decided the best solution was to create a community that could help people feel valued and also involve the corporations they work for.
That came in the form of 2045, named for the year when communities of color are expected to become the majority in the U.S. The company recently raised a $4.2 million pre-seed round led by Ken Chenault Jr., the son of the former CEO of Amex.
“It was astonishing to me that no one was building a community for what will be the largest population in America,” he said.
An attempt to actually be inclusive
2045 is launching at an interesting time for community startups. "
This week in foodtech: Cultivated meat is still a sizzling topic,Christine Hall,2023/06/10,"
If you’re adventurous with your food, or just like to keep up with the fast-moving foodtech industry, here’s a roundup of this week’s stories and some notable news we weren’t able to cover.
Bring home the bacon
Some big news came from across the pond where the U.K.-based cultivated meat startup Higher Steaks raised $30 million and changed its name to Uncommon. Balderton Capital and Lowercarbon Capital co-led the round.
The cultivated meat segment of the alternative protein industry is one of those that often has highlights and lowlights. Perhaps it’s because they hold out hope that the United States government will catch up to the forward-thinking Singapore where these products are being served. The U.K. has already made some financial commitments even as Italy’s government puts forth a bill that would ban cultivated meat.
As mentioned in the story, “being able to produce large enough quantities of cultured meat at a low enough price is problematic.” Some companies, like Dutch foodtech company Meatable, said in May that its technology reached a milestone: creating cultivated pork products in eight days.
Whatever happens, it’s clear from this round that some venture capitalists remain bullish about investing into this space. On Monday, look for a special TechCrunch+ investor survey on alternative proteins.

Cultured meat startup Higher Steaks nabs $30M and rebrands as Uncommon

Steaming cup ‘o Joe
Speaking of a food segment where funding continues to brew, this week the Green Coffee Company closed on $25 million in Series C equity funding. The company touts itself as “Colombia’s largest coffee producer,” and is the latest to get some funding amid coffee companies, including Chamberlain Coffee Fellow and Blank Street.
Green Coffee Company’s operations span 9,000 acres across 39 farms. It also has over 11.5 million coffee trees under ownership.
Its funding was a bit unique: raising capital from a network of over 450 individual, high-net-worth investors that invest directly into portfolio companies that investment firm Legacy Group advises rather than into a pooled fund, company founder Cole Shephard told TechCrunch. In total, investors have injected over $60 million into the business.
Shephard noted that the company raises in this manner because “the team at Legacy has always felt strongly about offering unique and exciting deals that provide individual investors the ability to directly invest in companies that they like rather than into a blind or diversified fund model over which they have little control or in which they hand over decision-making to large funds and institutions who provide little personalized attention.”

Nutrition is fashionable
Meanwhile, we’re always trying to eat healthier, and as reported this week, Ahara is a new personalized nutrition company that “provides recommendations to its customers after they first fill out a health questionnaire that asks them about their diet and health history, and their age and location, after which they can take a variety of at-home tests for genetic, epigenetic and biomarkers.”
At the helm are Julie Wainwright, founder and former CEO of luxury online consignment company The RealReal, and celebrity physician-nutritionist Melina Jampolis. It’s currently in beta and reportedly will have both a freemium model and premium membership that will include special benefits.
Ahara joins a crowded nutrition startup arena. As noted in the story, most offer different things, but are increasingly pushing personalization. Venture capitalists like them, too. Within the past few years, we’ve seen daily health program Mighty Health raise $7.6 million, telehealth nutrition  platform Nourish raise $8 million and British nutrition and health tracking app Zoe, bring in £25 million.

Julie Wainwright is back with a new, venture-backed startup

Not so Impossible
I’ve not previously covered the lawsuit between Impossible Foods and Motif Foodworks that began in 2022, but in the past few weeks, the case got a bit interesting.
At the end of May, some disclosures came to light that Motif suspected Impossible hired some private investigators who allegedly used fake identities to get information on Motif products.
This week, a court ruled that this strategy by Impossible did not break any rules, according to a report.
Here’s a brief background: Impossible sued Motif related to Motif’s use of heme proteins in making its plant-based meat alternative. Learn more about Motif’s process. Impossible alleges that Motif is infringing on its patent that covers the use of heme in making such food items.
Motif says that its heme use is not the same as Impossible’s and has previously stated that, “If Impossible wins​ ​[its lawsuit in Delaware], it means no one else can experiment with heme in the plant-based industry.”​​

FIS acquires banking-as-a-service startup Bond,Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/06/09,"
Consolidation continues apace in the world of fintech. FIS, the fintech giant that runs a wide range of payment, banking and investment services, has acquired Bond, a startup that specializes in embedded finance, multiple sources confirmed today. 
Fintech Business Weekly’s Jason Mikula broke the news last week that the deal was in the works. Our sources confirm that the deal has now closed, as of today.
FIS is not sharing how much it paid for Bond, a San Francisco-based BaaS (banking-as-a-service) startup. But as a point of reference, PitchBook notes that Bond was valued at $182 million the last time it raised money, in 2020. Since 2019, Bond has raised a total of $42 million in funding, according to Crunchbase. 
It has an impressive list of backers. Coatue Management led the company’s last round, a $32 million Series A in 2020, which also included participation from Mastercard, Goldman Sachs, Canaan Partners, B Capital Group and former Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack. 
BaaS, sometimes called embedded finance, helps brands (sometimes those well outside the world of finance) integrate financial services like credit cards and bank accounts to in turn sell on those services to their customers.
Touting “an AI-powered infrastructure,” Bond works to help digital brands – including other fintechs such as Pocketbook and Everest – offer “personalized and compliant banking products.” 
With roughly 30 employees, Bond’s focus has been on building APIs and software that enables commercial and consumer credit card solutions, as well as debit cards and accounts.
According to an internal memo by FIS viewed by TechCrunch, the FIS and Bond leadership teams “will determine how the two companies will work together,” including how FIS will bring Bond’s capabilities into FIS’s existing relationships.
FIS SVP of Platforms Himal Makwana, in partnership with the company’s integration management office, will be leading post-purchase planning activities, the memo added.
It’s not clear why Bond has opted to get acquired, but the deal comes amid a very unsettled period in the worlds of technology, venture funding and financial services. Funding activity has largely ground to a halt in the world of startups compared to previous years, which partly contributed to the collapse of two major banks focusing on the tech sector.
It’s not clear what the financial state of play was at Bond, but it’s notable that it hadn’t raised money since 2020, and amid a decline in fintech venture funding in particular, M&A may have become an interesting option for the startup. 
On the other side of the equation, bigger incumbents like FIS, as well as larger fintechs, have been making a number of moves to buy companies like fintechs to bolt on talent and technology in a race to update their own products and services amid the competitive landscape. 
Earlier this year, Marqeta acquired financial infrastructure startup Power Finance in a $275 million deal. JP Morgan closed its acquisition of Aumni. And Brazilian fintech infra company Pismo is said to be in the midst of being courted by the likes of Visa and Mastercard in a reported $1 billion transaction.
Not every M&A deal works out well, of course, with the biggest often being the hardest to digest. FIS made one of the largest-ever acquisitions in the world of payments when it acquired WorldPay for about $43 billion in 2019. That deal never really came up trumps, though. In February of this year, FIS confirmed that it would be spinning WorldPay off.

"TechCrunch+ roundup: OKR basics, betting on Apple Vision Pro, why smooth onboarding is bad",Walter Thompson,2023/06/09,"
Airport runways are built to international standards, but civil engineers and architects must consider wind, terrain and a host of other factors before sketching out blueprints.
Startup runways are similar: Healthcare and fintech face different headwinds, which means companies in these sectors manage their cash differently.
According to Healy Jones, who oversees financial analysis and planning for Kruze Consulting, average startup runway length was 23.4 months in January 2023, up from 19.6 months in 2019.

Apple’s AR headset is a game-changer for startups

Creating demand for a new product is hard. Unless you’re Apple.
There is a built-in customer base for every SKU on Cupertino’s virtual shelves, and the upcoming Apple Vision Pro is no different, despite its initial $3,500 price tag, writes Haje Jan Kamps.
“Still, the preposterously over-engineered headset is a vital flag in the ground for startups,” he writes.
Spatial computing may not have a broad user base today, but “with a few notable exceptions, the company has a formidable track record of willing entire ecosystems into existence.”

You need to add some friction to your growth funnel

An onboarding flow that’s entirely smooth is a great way to lose potential customers, according to growth marketing expert Jonathan Martinez.
“One of the biggest misconceptions when it comes to user experience is that we must eliminate as many questions and barriers as possible to be the gold standard,” he writes in TC+.
In this week’s column, he explored three different types of friction and explains how to run lifetime value (LTV) experiments that drive conversions.

Five fundamentals for creating an effective OKR process
Image Credits: Caspar Benson (opens in a new window) / Getty Images
Now that easy money is off the menu, startup teams must demonstrate that they’re capable of setting (and reaching!) strategic goals.
Inexperienced founders often chase vanity metrics like social media followers or total user count that validate short-term efforts.
Successful companies, on the other hand, use objectives and key results (OKRs) to align their day-to-day efforts with long-term goals.
Whether you already have an OKR process in place or are setting one up, this comprehensive guide by Julia Daniel and Karl Alomar at early-stage VC firm M13 covers the essentials:

The OKR framework.
Setting annual objectives.
Creating an annualized roadmap.
Quarterly planning.
How to establish a rinse-and-repeat cadence.

How to approach the discovery process as an early-stage startup (and beyond)
Image Credits: A. Martin UW Photography (opens in a new window) / Getty Images
There are many ways to approach customer discovery, but two methods dominate:

Sales and product teams gather data, ask questions and run experiments.
People substitute their own judgment for user input and hope for the best.

Chasing the wrong audience wastes time and money, which is why Yousuf Khan, partner at Ridge Ventures, wrote a TC+ post with tactics for identifying qualified customers.
“Whether you’re pursuing customer number five, 50 or 500, the process of determining if there’s a fit remains largely the same.”

Unless the overall environment changes, a new report from European VC firm Atomico forecasts that startup funding in the region “will be 52% lower than in 2021,” writes Anna Heim.
“The adjusted market reality is here to stay,” Atomico predicted, including more down rounds and layoffs.
“2021 was a clear outlier, with investment volumes and valuations now returning to long-term averages,” according to Atomico partner Tom Wehmeier.
“That’s no bad thing, but it won’t be an easy time for everyone.”

Rebecca Szkutak interviewed three seed-stage investors to learn more about what it takes to close a Series A in June 2023:

Loren Straub, general partner, Bowery Capital
Eric Bahn, co-founder and general partner, Hustle Fund
Yoni Rechtman, venture principal, Slow Ventures

Now that ARR isn’t the north star metric it once was, their answers varied. “The goal posts seem to be moving a lot,” said Bahn.
“It really sucks for a lot of people,” said Rechtman. “I really feel for people who I think have been sold a false bill of goods.”

What’s being built in generative AI today?,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/09,"
If you look past the financial headlines, what are today’s AI startups building?
News coverage of the AI boom has been hectic and mainly covered a few categories: Financial, Big Tech, concern and hype, and startup activity. The financial side is simple: Investors are working to put capital into companies that are either building new AI-powered products or embedding it into existing products.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

The Big Tech collection is also easy to understand: Google and Microsoft are racing to own the cloud layer underneath major AI technology and building generative AI services into their existing productivity and search products. Meta, Amazon and Baidu are also busy. The list goes on.
Hype is not hard to find nor is the doomer perspective. Reality will likely be somewhere in between. I suspect that we’ll grow accustomed to having AI-powered tools and services around us at all times and some of the use cases will be positive while others will prove negative.
But these conversations often don’t actually discuss what is being built. So, this morning, I’ll go back through our recent generative AI coverage to provide a few notes on what folks are working to create. I am approaching the topic as a generalist who has a pro-tech, pro-progress and pro-capitalism perspective tempered by a dash of anxiety. Call me an optimist with an asterisk.
Fair enough? Let’s get to work.

Hear how Chronosphere is reinventing cloud observability on TechCrunch Live,Matt Burns,2023/06/09,"
Chronosphere aims to provide engineers with actionable insights derived from the company’s data. According to the company, this leads to lower spend and provides a better return on investment. Join this TechCrunch Live event on June 21 at 12 pm PDT to hear how Chronosphere is competing as companies look to reduce expenditures.
Martin Mao co-founded the company in 2019 and quickly raised $370 million, including from Jerry Chen at Greylock. The company had a valuation of $1.6 billion at the time of its $115 million Series C fundraise in November 2022. In April 2023, Chronosphere announced a partnership with Google Cloud to help customers address incidents while controlling costs. This allows customers to bundle Chronosphere through the Google Cloud Marketplace.
As the market fluctuates and capital becomes more expensive, companies like Chronosphere are looking for ways to help customers reduce spend — but this requires that companies spend with Chronosphere. It’s a delicate balance, and I hope you can join this TechCrunch Live event to hear Martin’s outlook. He’s in a unique position, and together with Jerry Chen, this should be an interesting conversation with actionable advice.
TechCrunch Live records each Wednesday at 12:00 p.m. PDT with the goal of helping founders build better venture-backed businesses. Register for this event right HERE. Watch past events on TechCrunch Live’s YouTube channel.

Pitch Deck Teardown: CulturePulse’s $1M seed deck,Haje Jan Kamps,2023/06/09,"
Sentiment analysis, which means generalizing a feeling expressed by people in, say, online reviews, has been around for a hot minute. It’s a powerful feedback and quantitative analysis tool with wide-ranging political, commercial and social applications.
Slovakian company CulturePulse recently raised just short of a million dollars to move the needle further in this area. The company’s pitch deck is bad enough that I’m surprised it raised money, so let’s take a look at why that is and what could be improved.

We’re looking for more unique pitch decks to tear down, so if you want to submit your own, here’s how you can do that.


Slides in this deck
The company submitted its deck to us a couple of months ago, claiming that this terse, nine-slide presentation is what it used to pitch to VCs. It comprises of the following slides:

Cover slide
Solution slide
Product slide
Business model slide
Customers and media slide
Roadmap slide
Team slide
The ask slide
Closing slide

Three things to love
I’m not going to lie: I really struggled to find three things I truly love about this deck. That said, here are a few things that stood out:
The solution space
The deck doesn’t have a problem slide per se, but this one passes as a combined problem/solution slide:
[Slide 2] CulturePulse’s combo problem/solution slide. Image Credits: CulturePulseAs much as I would have preferred a separate problem slide, this sort of works. On the left, it outlines the problem (presumably, that without CulturePulse’s product, it’s hard to capture the beliefs and motivations of customers) by stating what the solution does.
The part I really do like about this slide, though, is the illustration on the right: It shows some of the potential motivations that customers might have. For even better results, the company could have connected the dots with something like: “We enable you to spend more time focusing on your lifetime buyers than your one-time customers.” But the slide works as-is.
Cracking opening
[Slide 1] Powerful opening slide. Image Credits: CulturePulse“Show, don’t tell,” is one of the cornerstones of effective storytelling. “Make your message resonate,” combined with the product screenshot on the right is a great way to set the stage for an investment conversation. I particularly like the “resonance score” on the right — if it works, being able to test a bunch of copy to see what the AI believes will work best for the target platforms and audiences would make for a very smart approach.
I don’t like how this slide doesn’t take the audience into consideration: “Your” speaks to investors, and while there are investors on social media who might wish to use this product, they are probably not CulturePulse’s core audience. It’s needlessly confusing to have a “you” on a slide that’s talking to investors when it means your customers.
Great final thought
The deck closes with a poignant quote:
[Slide 9] Leave ’em on a high. Image Credits: CulturePulseIt’s a fantastic idea to give your would-be investors something to ponder at the end of a presentation. A quote from an economics Nobel Prize winner that essentially describes your business is as good a way to close as any. Very well done.
In the rest of this teardown, we’ll try to limit the things CulturePulse could have improved or done differently to just three things. Its full pitch deck is also included!

Nocnoc opens door to quicker setup of cross-border e-commerce in Latin America,Christine Hall,2023/06/09,"
Nocnoc, which facilitates cross-border e-commerce between Latin American merchants and global sellers, raised $14 million in Series A funding.
PayPal Ventures led the round and was joined by Mouro Capital, Quona Capital, Caravela Capital, Broadhaven and Ignia. This gives the company $22 million in total venture-backed funding to date.
Ilan Bajarlia, Joaquin Colella and Diego Szilagyi started nocnoc in 2018 to enable businesses to sell in Latin America through 16 marketplaces with a potential reach of nearly 500 million consumers, CEO Bajarlia told TechCrunch. The company is headquartered in Uruguay with offices in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Colombia, China and Spain.
Latin America’s cross-border sales grew 44% in 2022. The market is valued at $382 billion and expected to grow annually at a rate of 25% through 2025, according to Americas Market Intelligence.
“Cross border e-commerce is growing faster than local commerce in the last five years,” Bajarlia said. “People are keen to buy products that they can’t buy in their local market, so very large marketplaces from the world have been growing their share in Latin America, specifically, Chinese and U.S.-based marketplaces.”
Online merchants upload their product catalog to nocnoc’s platform and then can start selling on marketplaces, including Amazon, Mercado Libre, Americanas, Carrefour, Walmart, Magazine Luiza and Coppel. Nocnoc manages the product listings across all of those marketplaces and creates marketing campaigns for the products. The company also handles communication with consumers, delivery logistics, cancellations and returns.
When it comes to payments, nocnoc typically pays sellers every 15 days, in their local currency, even if the product has not yet made it to the buyer. This is compared to the 40 to 50 days that sellers typically wait to collect payment for a sale, Bajarlia said.
Nocnoc’s concept has caught on. The company introduced over 180,000 exclusive products to the region from more than 1,200 international sellers. In the past 12 months, gross merchandise volume grew 3x amid the company adding seven new marketplaces, expanding in Mexico, Colombia and Chile. All of that has made nocnoc “[become] the largest cross-border store in Latin America,” Bajarlia said.
The new funding will go toward helping its business and its customers grow and expand into Latin America. New features will include additional fulfillment centers and an “Advanced Payments” product that will pay sellers even faster, an average of three to five days, with cancellations and returns covered.
“We have been growing a lot in diversifying our consumer offer so everything related to which products we are selling have improved,” Bajarlia said. “We’ve improved our technology to understand what’s the best-selling product in Latin America, understanding supply and demand, understanding the elasticity of each product and what new categories we can introduce. As such, we are connected to the leading marketplaces in Latin America, and are usually the only or largest cross-border enabler for any consumer, for example in Brazil, willing to buy from an international seller.”

For LatAm payment orchestration startups, market fragmentation is a blessing in disguise

"
Runway’s Gen-2 shows the limitations of today’s text-to-video tech,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/09,"
In a recent panel interview with Collider, Joe Russo, the director of tentpole Marvel films like “Avengers: Endgame,” predicted that within two years, AI will be able to create a fully fledged movie. I’d say that’s a rather optimistic timeline. But we’re getting closer.
This week, Runway, a Google-backed AI startup that helped develop the AI image generator Stable Diffusion, released Gen-2, a model that generates videos from text prompts or an existing image. (Gen-2 was previously in limited, waitlisted access.) The follow-up to Runway’s Gen-1 model launched in February, Gen-2 is one of the first commercially available text-to-video models.
“Commercially available” is an important distinction. Text-to-video, being the logical next frontier in generative AI after images and text, is becoming a bigger area of focus particularly among tech giants, several of which have demoed text-to-video models over the past year. But those models remain firmly in the research stages, inaccessible to all but a select few data scientists and engineers.
Of course, first isn’t necessarily better.
Out of personal curiosity and service to you, dear readers, I ran a few prompts through Gen-2 to get a sense of what the model can — and can’t — accomplish. (Runway’s currently providing around 100 seconds of free video generation.) There wasn’t much of a method to my madness, but I tried to capture a range of angles, genres and styles that a director, professional or armchair, might like to see on the silver screen — or a laptop as the case might be.
One limitation of Gen-2 that became immediately apparent is the framerate of the four-second-long videos the model generates. It’s quite low and noticeably so, to the point where it’s nearly slideshow-like in places.
Image Credits: Runway
What’s unclear is whether that’s a problem with the tech or an attempt by Runway to save on compute costs. In any case, it makes Gen-2 a rather unattractive proposition off the bat for editors hoping to avoid post-production work.
Beyond the framerate issue, I’ve found that Gen-2-generated clips tend to share a certain graininess or fuzziness in common, as if they’ve had some sort of old-timey Instagram filter applied. Other artifacting occurs as well in places, like pixelation around objects when the “camera” (for lack of a better word) circles them or quickly zooms toward them.
As with many generative models, Gen-2 isn’t particularly consistent with respect to physics or anatomy, either. Like something conjured up by a surrealist, people’s arms and legs in Gen-2-produced videos meld together and come apart again while objects melt into the floor and disappear, their reflections warped and distorted. And — depending on the prompt — faces can appear doll-like, with glossy, emotionless eyes and pasty skin that evokes a cheap plastic.
Image Credits: Runway
To pile on higher, there’s the content issue. Gen-2 seems to have a tough time understanding nuance, clinging to particular descriptors in prompts while ignoring others, seemingly at random.
Image Credits: Runway
One of the prompts I tried — “A video of an underwater utopia, shot on an old camera, in the style of a ‘found footage’ film” — brought about no such utopia, only what looked like a first-person scuba dive through an anonymous coral reef. Gen-2 struggled with my other prompts, too, failing to generate a zoom-in shot for a prompt specifically calling for a “slow zoom” and not quite nailing the look of your average astronaut.
Could the issues lie with Gen-2’s training data set? Perhaps.
Gen-2, like Stable Diffusion, is a diffusion model, meaning it learns how to gradually subtract noise from a starting image made entirely of noise to move it closer, step by step, to the prompt. Diffusion models learn through training on millions to billions of examples; in an academic paper detailing Gen-2’s architecture, Runway says the model was trained on an internal data set of 240 million images and 6.4 million video clips.
Diversity in the examples is key. If the data set doesn’t contain much footage of, say, animation, the model — lacking points of reference — won’t be able to generate reasonable-quality animations. (Of course, animation being a broad field, even if the data set did have clips of anime or hand-drawn animation, the model wouldn’t necessarily generalize well to all types of animation.)
Image Credits: Runway
On the plus side, Gen-2 passes a surface-level bias test. While generative AI models like DALL-E 2 have been found to reinforce societal biases, generating images of positions of authority — like “CEO or “director” — that depict mostly white men, Gen-2 was the tiniest bit more diverse in the content it generated — at least in my testing.
Image Credits: Runway
Fed the prompt “A video of a CEO walking into a conference room,” Gen-2 generated a video of men and women (albeit more men than women) seated around something like a conference table. The output for the prompt “A video of a doctor working in an office,” meanwhile, depicts a woman doctor vaguely Asian in appearance behind a desk.
Results for any prompt containing the word “nurse” were less promising, though, consistently showing young white women. Ditto for the phrase “a person waiting tables.” Evidently, there’s work to be done.
The takeaway from all this, for me, is that Gen-2 is more a novelty or toy than a genuinely useful tool in any video workflow. Could the outputs be edited into something more coherent? Perhaps. But depending on the video, it’d require potentially more work than shooting footage in the first place.
That’s not to be too dismissive of the tech. It’s impressive what Runway’s done, here, effectively beating tech giants to the text-to-video punch. And I’m sure some users will find uses for Gen-2 that don’t require photorealism — or a lot of customizability. (Runway CEO Cristóbal Valenzuela recently told Bloomberg that he sees Gen-2 as a way to offer artists and designers a tool that can help them with their creative processes.)
Image Credits: Runway
I did myself. Gen-2 can indeed understand a range of styles, like anime and claymation, which lend themselves to the lower framerate. With a little fiddling and editing work, it wouldn’t be impossible to string together a few clips to create a narrative piece.
Lest the potential for deepfakes concern you, Runway says it’s using a combination of AI and human moderation to prevent users from generating videos that include pornography or violent content or that violate copyrights. I can confirm there’s a content filter — an overzealous one in point of fact. But of course, those aren’t foolproof methods, so we’ll have to see how well they work in practice.

But at least for now, filmmakers, animators and CGI artists and ethicists can rest easy. It’ll be at least a couple of iterations down the line before Runway’s tech comes close to generating film-quality footage — assuming it ever gets there.

Cultured meat startup Higher Steaks nabs $30M and rebrands as Uncommon,Paul Sawers,2023/06/08,"
U.K.-based cultivated meat startup Higher Steaks has raised $30 million in a Series A round of funding and revealed that it’s changing its name to Uncommon.
Founded out of Cambridge in 2017, Uncommon is one of countless companies pushing to make cultured “lab-grown” meat a reality in kitchens and restaurants around the globe, covering everything from synthetic sausages and bogus burgers to pseudo-seafood. Uncommon, for its part, is mostly focused on the $250 billion global pork market, developing bacon and pork belly products.
Hurdles
Uncommon founders: Chief science officer Dr. Ruth Faram with CEO Benjamina Bollag Image Credits: Uncommon
Regulatory hurdles has meant that meat made from animal cells in a test tube have been slow to gain a foothold, with Singapore currently the only market in the world where cultured meat is available for sale. The Food and Drug Association (FDA) in the U.S. also recently started rubberstamping such edibles as being safe for human consumption.
Some countries, though, are pushing back against the burgeoning fake-meat revolution, including Italy which is mulling an outright ban on lab-developed food to safeguard its culinary heritage.
But another longstanding challenge of bringing cultivated meat to market has been scalability. Being able to produce large enough quantities of cultured meat at a low enough price is problematic, with some companies pursuing a hybrid lab-grown meat / plant-based protein approach to get their products to market faster.
Uncommon, though, says it’s using a technique involving a polymeric molecule called RNA (ribonucleic acid), or more specifically mRNA, which essentially contains “instructions” that enable cells to make proteins from its own internal functions.
“This also means that Uncommon can create real meat without using genetic engineering,” Uncommon co-founder and CEO Benjamina Bollag told TechCrunch. “With countries becoming increasingly against genetically engineered food, Uncommon hopes that this means it can scale its cultivated meat across the world with regulatory challenges.”
Moreover, Bollag says that it’s using this patent-pending technique to help bring cultivated meat closer to price parity with traditional meat.
“With this method, it’s also possible to more directly target muscle and fat regulators in the cells when compared to growth factors and small molecules, in a similar fashion as gene editing,” Bollag said. “This in turn reduces the quantity of raw materials needed, which makes it possible to scale the process at a reduced cost compared to using genetic engineering.”
Uncommon’s $30 million Series A round was led by London-based Balderton Capital and New York’s Lowercarbon Capital, with participation from a number institutional and angel investors including OpenAI’s Sam Altman and his brother Max, as well as Redalpine, East Alpha, Miray Zaki and Sebastiano Castiglioni. The company said that it plans to use its fresh cash injection to scale up production and kickstart its regulatory approval process in Europe and Singapore, while keeping a “close eye” on the U.S. market.
“Singapore is likely to receive the approval first as it is the most developed ecosystem for cultivated meat, with other markets to follow,” Bollag said, though with little indication as to when commercialization might being. “We will be starting with high-end restaurants first before moving to supermarkets.”

Zero-based budgeting: A proven framework for extending runway



The startup ecosystem has gone through some substantial changes over the last few months, and founders need to understand current conditions to properly plan for the future.
I serve the accounting and financial planning needs of more than 750 startups, which provides me with a unique position to help founders stay informed about the different factors that affect funding, valuations, spending, startup management and other trends in the startup economy.
The data in this report is not from a survey — it’s created directly from anonymized accounting data from more than 700 of our clients. As such, it’s not subject to any optimistic thinking bias that so many startup founder surveys have.
Capital is tightening, forcing startups to react
Low interest rates over the last decade have fueled growth and boosted startup valuations across every industry. But in June 2022, the rate of inflation peaked at 9.1%. In response, the Federal Reserve dramatically increased interest rates, bringing easy access to cheap money to an end.
Startups included in this dataset raised more than $4 billion in 2021 but only in the high $2 billion range in 2022 — a dramatic drop.
The end of easy money is forcing founders to react. Startups that might have easily gotten venture funding in the past are going to have to get creative to extend their cash runway. The charts below contrast startup revenue, spending and runway in 2021 and 2022 in four sectors: software/SaaS, e-commerce, healthcare and fintech.
Startups are extending their runways
In general, the cash position of most startups remains solid, with some important nuances.
We watch the cash position and runway of our startup clients very closely, as their investors (and savvy founders) deeply care about this metric.
 

			The data in this report is not from a survey — it’s created directly from anonymized accounting data from 700+ of our clients.					


 
At the beginning of 2019, the average startup had 19.6 months of runway. As of Jan. 1, 2023, the average has increased to 23.4 months of runway. This directly reflects the expense reductions seen in 2022, plus the record amounts of funding raised by startups over the past two years.
However, the average can hide some important nuances.
There are other implications to this careful cash management as well — startups may not be in a position to hire, for example. Another expense that startups are aggressively reducing is rent, choosing to embrace remote work — our clients spent about 7% of their expenses on rent pre-COVID, but we’ve seen that expense drop to just over 3% at the beginning of 2023.

Early-stage companies are cutting back
While almost all early-stage companies have reduced their burn rates in 2022, fintech shows the greatest cuts to spending, reflecting the downturn in revenues at the end of 2022. Facing an uncertain economic environment and potential fundraising challenges, startups are clearly looking to extend their runways by reducing expenses.
Founders will need to shift from a “growth at all costs” mentality to focus on sustainable growth. That’s going to require careful cash management and cautious spending.

"AI startup Cohere, now valued at over $2.1B, raises $270M",Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/08,"
In a sign that there’s plenty of cash to go around for generative AI startups, Cohere, which is developing an AI model ecosystem for the enterprise, today announced that it raised $270 million as part of its Series C round.
Reuters reported earlier in the year that Cohere was in talks to raise “hundreds of millions” of dollars at a valuation of upward of just over $6 billion. If there’s credence to that reporting, Cohere appears to have missed the valuation mark substantially; a source familiar with the matter tells TechCrunch that this tranche values the company at between $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion.
“The new capital will fuel continued development of Cohere’s AI platform, which is focused on enterprise customers, allowing companies to use their preferred cloud provider to increase data privacy and make implementation simpler,” president and COO Martin Kon told TechCrunch via email. “The latest round allows us to invest in compute, grow our team, engage with more of the world’s leading enterprises and further advance our world-leading AI, ultimately empowering companies to build incredible products while keeping their data private and secure.”
Aidan Gomez, Ivan Zhang and Nick Frosst (who was one of the first employees at Google’s Toronto AI lab) co-founded Cohere in 2019. Before starting Cohere, Gomez co-authored the seminal paper “Attention Is All You Need,” which introduced the Transformer, the architecture behind popular large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT-4.
Kon joined in early 2023, jumping from his previous role as CFO at YouTube.
Cohere, which has developed multilingual language models trained on data from native speakers, among other AI, aims to stand out in the ocean of generative AI startups by focusing on enterprise use cases.
Cohere’s AI platform is cloud agnostic, able to be deployed inside public clouds (e.g., Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services), a customer’s existing cloud, virtual private clouds or on-site. The startup takes a hands-on approach, working with customers to create custom LLMs based on their proprietary data.
“Cohere was founded to create a platform that empowers all enterprises to transform their company and products with world-leading AI that’s cloud-agnostic, accessible, customizable and data-secure,” Kon said. “Our mission is to allow enterprises worldwide to leverage this transformational technology.”
Cohere holds its customer numbers close to its chest. But the startup claims that it works with companies like Jasper and HyperWrite for copywriting generation tasks like creating marketing content, drafting emails and developing product descriptions. Elsewhere, Cohere recently announced a collaboration with LivePerson, the conversational marketing company, to build fine-tuned LLMs to improve explainability. And the startup’s partnering with a handful of organizations, including news outlets and Salesforce Ventures, to help break down, analyze and summarize lengthy text using machine learning algorithms.
“Generally, we can share that we’re experiencing high demand from major enterprises, as both customers and partners,” Kon said.
Cohere, which has around 180 employees, has raised a lot of capital — $445 million — even by generative AI startup standards. Only OpenAI ($11.3 billion) and Anthropic ($450 million) have raised more, ahead of rivals Inflection AI ($225 million) and Adept ($415 million).

But lest it seem excessive, training AI models tends to be capital-intensive. Anthropic, for one, expects to need to raise billions more to train the next generation of its task-accomplishing AI.

“When it comes to AI, building and training language models requires a lot of capital, but we’re mindful and intentional about what we actually need and committed to securing funds that will ensure we can continue providing the best possible solution for our customers,” Kon said. “We’ve been intentional about maintaining a diversity of global investors and not taking one bigger check from one company — especially a cloud provider — because that may limit our ability to remain independent, service enterprises directly, remain cloud-agnostic and deploy data-secure solutions on any cloud according to our customers’ preference.”
That comment about cloud provider investments was a likely dig at startups like OpenAI and Anthropic, which have taken on significant backing from Microsoft and Google, respectively. But it’s curious coming from Cohere, which not long ago was reportedly in advanced talks with Google about an investment in the range of $200 million.
Regardless of where its future capital comes from, Kon says he sees “search and retrieval” as the next core area of growth for Cohere. Using techniques that give models or chatbots the ability to expand on their knowledge base and search the web for information that’s relevant to a query, like OpenAI’s experimenting with, Kon believes that Cohere can build significantly more powerful AI systems than it offers today.
“Today, chatbots don’t have access to the world. They don’t know about what happened 10 minutes ago. They have to memorize everything within themselves, and they only have memory of what they saw during training,” Kon said. “With search and retrieval, you can require a model to cite sources, so users don’t need to blindly trust a model; everything links out to a site that you can verify and fact check.”
Looking further ahead, Cohere plans to build models that can take action and “do work” for customers, like book a flight, schedule a meeting or file an expense report on a person’s behalf. In that way, it’s chasing after competitors like Adept, Inflection and OpenAI, all of which are building — albeit using different approaches — systems to connect AI with third-party apps, services and products.
Despite the competition, Kon asserts that Cohere’s in a position of strength.
“We’re differentiated as the independent, cloud-agnostic AI platform for enterprises,” he said. “We are solely focused on enabling our customers to create proprietary LLM capabilities leveraging their data and creating strategic differentiation and business value.”
Inovia Capital led the oversubscribed Series C round with participation from Nvidia, Oracle, Salesforce Ventures, DTCP, Mirae Asset, Schroders Capital, SentinelOne, Thomvest Ventures and Index Ventures.

Investors take note: Wildfire smoke will spark a surge in East Coast climate tech startups,Tim De Chant,2023/06/08,"
As smoke from Canadian wildfires has enveloped large swathes of the East Coast, millions of people have found themselves trapped inside, gazing out on orange skies and hazy cityscapes. The air quality index — which is usually ignored — has suddenly become an object of fascination and source of small talk.
It’s all remarkably similar to what happened on the West Coast three years ago, when skies there turned a sinister hue and people rushed to seal their windows and buy air purifiers. If the past is prologue, then investors should prepare themselves for a tidal wave of climate tech startups next year.
There’s no doubt that the 2020 fire season on the West Coast had a profound impact on a number of founders. Several have told TechCrunch+ that the apocalyptically orange skies of that summer played a large role in their decision to quit their previous jobs and start companies focused on addressing the climate crisis.

How one software company is beating the SaaS growth blues,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/08,"
The go-go days of software companies growing like crazy are now firmly behind us.
Data indicates that public software companies have added fewer sources of annual recurring revenue (ARR) in the first quarter of 2023 than they did a year earlier. In fact, that metric declined even more compared to the average quarterly number in 2022.

It’s tough out there, but not every company is reporting lackluster results. Samsara, which went public in late 2021, recently proved that it is still possible to expand fast, and perhaps even more impressively, that it’s possible to hold on to value even if you listed at the end of a venture capital bubble.
TechCrunch+ caught up with Samsara’s CEO and co-founder, Sanjit Biswas, to talk about his company’s performance and the pricing and sales choices that have helped it at least partially buck the slowdown.
Let’s start with a quick refresher on Samsara and its IPO pricing. Then, we’ll explore its first-quarter performance and dig into how its sales model is providing it with a more durable revenue base than most other modern software companies.
The Samsara growth story
It’s fun to go back and read 2021-era coverage, because it was such a wild time. We even noted during Samsara’s IPO pricing run that it felt like no one was paying attention:
One more note before we can sign off on this topic for the day: Doesn’t it feel like a somewhat muted day for a decacorn IPO? Samsara raised venture rounds through a Series F! And yet this IPO feels like it’s skating right under the radar.
At the time, we hypothesized that NFT hype was consuming all the oxygen in the room, or that there were so many IPOs that year that it was just not as exciting as before. Ah, what a good problem to have!
Samsara’s late-2021 IPO set it up to raise capital and go public at a valuation that made little to no sense. We saw that happen to a number of other companies that went public in 2021. "

"European startups on track to raise $51B this year, down 39% from 2022",Anna Heim,2023/06/08,"
The venture slowdown has long been established to be a global phenomenon, and per a new report from VC firm Atomico, this “adjusted market reality is here to stay.”
Based on Dealroom and Crunchbase data, Atomico predicts that if things stay the same, the amount of capital invested in European startups this year will be 52% lower than in 2021.
That’s a clear decline, but it isn’t much worse than what we are tracking in other major regions.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

We should note that the report comes with a caveat: It doesn’t include Israel, which is often part of many European data venture data summaries, and also excludes biotech, secondaries, debt or lending capital. Some of those sectors and funding avenues have been on the rise lately, which makes their exclusion notable. However, the geographic, sector and funding-type restrictions are consistent with prior Atomico reporting, meaning we have a solid basis for historical comparison.
Many of the same problems present in the United States are also showing up in Europe, such as infrequent exits and a dead IPO market. But we already knew that.
So, instead let’s look at recent European venture capital totals and see if there is cause for optimism despite yet another decline in anticipated funding levels.
The bad news isn’t actually that bad
Atomico reports that European tech investment volumes are tracking at around half of 2021, set to reach $51 billion in 2023, compared to $106 billion two years ago.
But that comparison isn’t that useful, given that 2021 was such a big outlier. We’re more interested in how 2023 will compare to years when the funding climate wasn’t so inflated. "
EvenUp wants to automate personal injury settlements — to a point,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/08,"
Millions of personal injury cases are settled in the U.S. every year, as few go to trial — but the vast majority are kept under wraps. This leaves lawyers guessing what they should propose as a settlement price, oftentimes resulting in victims being undercompensated.
It’s what led Rami Karabibar to launch EvenUp, a startup that taps AI to generate legal documents to assess injury cases. The platform, aimed at customers in the legal field, attempts to use raw case files, including medical records, police reports and bills, to create letters arguing for proposed compensation.
“We’re on a mission to level the playing field in personal injury cases,” Karabibar, who previously worked across private equity, venture capital and venture-backed startups, said.
Karabibar co-founded EvenUp with Ray Mieszaniec, a two-time entrepreneur, whose father was permanently disabled after being hit by a car involved in a police chase. Mieszaniec’s family got just 10% of the average payout for that type of accident — partly because their lawyer didn’t know what the appropriate compensation should be.
EvenUp aims to tackle all categories of personal injury cases, including motor vehicle accidents, police brutality, child abuse and even natural disasters. To do this, Karabibar, Mieszaniec and EvenUp’s third co-founder, Saam Mashhad (a former litigator), built a database of private settlements — including hundreds of thousands of medical records — and trained an AI to estimate fair compensation based on the details of each case.
EvenUp’s platform extracts the relevant info from documents and organizes them into templated “demand packages,” which state the legal and factual basis for a personal injury claim and include a demand for compensation. Designed to be a self-service solution for lawyers, paralegal staff and law firms, EvenUp summarizes notes and copies of raw records into medical digests “optimized for injury law.”
“The more documents and cases we see, the better we are at preparing demand packages, and the better we are at increasing case outcomes and reducing costs,” Karabibar said. “EvenUp reaches deeper in the legal workflow with a higher bar for accuracy than other AI assistants, from extracting data out of raw documents, to valuing what cases are worth, to generating final demand packages that bring that all together.”
As Karabibar alluded to, EvenUp isn’t the only startup applying AI to the tedious — and monotonous — task of drafting legal documents. Lawyaw, which emerged from stealth several years ago, is building software to automate the process of customizing standard documents like NDAs and wills. Elsewhere, Atrium’s software digitizes legal paperwork and builds apps on top to speed up fundraising, commercial contracts, equity distribution and employment issues.
But EvenUp claims that it’s one of the first to tackle personal injury — a law practice area not necessarily held in high regard. So-called “settlement mills,” which charge between 33% to 40% of total awarded compensation, settle a high volume of cases without necessarily focusing on maximizing the value of each claim.
Mieszaniec implies that EvenUp could change this by normalizing the practice of AI-aided personal injury litigation.
“By harnessing the potential of technology, we can create a future where the pursuit of justice is not marred by financial pressure or the representation you have,” Mieszaniec said via email. “It’s time to embrace innovative solutions that streamline the claims process, empower individuals, humanize the process and ensure that no one walks away with a fraction of what they deserve. That’s why we built EvenUp: to level the playing field for personal injury victims.”
EvenUp appears to have won over investors, who recently pledge $50.5 million in the company at a $325 million valuation (according to a source familiar with the matter). Bessemer Venture Partners led the latest round, a Series B, with participation from Bain Capital Ventures, Behance founder Scott Belsky and legal tech firm Clio, bringing EvenUp’s total raised to $65 million.
But can the tech live up to its promises — and address the outstanding legal and ethical implications?
With any AI tech, bias is a major concern. Algorithms trained on biased data can amplify those biases, perpetuating existing inequalities and injustices. For instance, a 2016 ProPublica analysis found that a widely used algorithm was twice as likely to misclassify Black defendants as presenting a high risk of recidivism than white defendants. One can imagine EvenUp’s AI recommending artificially high or low amounts of personal injury compensation as a result of dataset imbalances.
And what about privacy? EvenUp hasn’t disclosed where it sourced the medical and personal injury documents that it used to train its AI — nor whether it took steps to notify the original owners of those records.
That’s assuming once again that the tech works as advertised, even. If there’s any overarching takeaways from the generative AI boom, it’s that even the best AI algorithms today are far from perfect. (See: Microsoft’s Bing chatbot spouting vaccine misinformation and writing a hateful screed from the perspective of Adolf Hitler.)
If EvenUp’s customers share these concerns, it’s not obvious from their rush to adopt the platform. Karabibar claims that EvenUp counts “top trial attorneys” and “America’s largest personal injury law firms” among its customers and that it’s “close to profitable.”
Some, no doubt, are chasing after the chance to reduce filing expenses while maximizing returns. Karabibar doesn’t deny this.
“Injury attorneys are contingency-based, where they make a fixed percentage of the value of the case. Any increase in case outcomes directly impacts their revenue, while also increasing the amount clients receive,” he said.
But Karabibar also makes the case — rather optimistic, in my view — that automating aspects of the filing process could encourage litigators to “concentrate more on the human side of their work.” He’s also careful to suggest that EvenUp won’t replace lawyers outright. But, reading between the lines a little, it’s hard not to see how some paralegals, most of whom work on a contract basis, might find themselves out of a job if the tech were ever to be adopted on a mass scale.
“They’ll be able to support injury victims through the legal process, and advocating for the equitable outcomes their clients deserve,” he said.
We’ll see if that’s the case. In any event, EvenUp has broad ambitions, with plans to cover document generation in both the pre-litigation and litigation stages customized to each firm, jurisdiction and case type. Karabibar believes that EvenUp will eventually be able to handle 70% of the key documents in the personal injury law workflow.
“We are well-positioned to continue growing despite the turbulent economy, and we believe our products will only become more essential as time goes on,” Karabibar said. “Legal drafting has seen a fundamental step-change given the advent of generative AI. Legal professionals will need to be quick to adapt to this change or be competed out of the profession by more tech-savvy competitors.”

Charting the future of the early-stage venture market with Carta’s CEO,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/08,"

Hello and welcome back to Equity, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines. This is our Wednesday (Thursday, this week) show where we niche down to a single topic and dig deep.

All the cool kids are filling out the Equity listener survey. We want to hear from you! 

This week Alex brought on Carta CEO Henry Ward to chat through the early-stage market with us. We had a grip of data and a sheaf of questions, which were augmented at the last minute with a data dump from Carta itself.
Here’s what we got into:

The current state of the early-stage venture capital market: From Ward’s perspective, the early-stage market is in better shape than many folks think; it’s the later stages of venture capital that are torpid. We also riffed on the quality of startups that are raising today, and how much pain is coming for young tech companies that can’t quite attract more capital.
Carta’s new seed and Series A product: Carta recently announced a mostly automated method for closing early-stage rounds, so we wanted to better understand the economics of the effort — and why it’s more expensive to raise today than it was a few years back — and what the unicorn hopes to achieve from the work.
We ended with a look ahead, and a series of fun closing questions with Ward.

That’s just the high-level summary. We also discussed entrepreneurship more broadly, the importance of LLCs and even how to construct a podcast interview. It was good fun!
We are back Friday with our news roundup. Talk soon!

"Green Coffee Co. percolates on $25M to expand in Colombia, launch alcoholic beverages",Christine Hall,2023/06/08,"
The Green Coffee Company, which touts itself as “Colombia’s largest coffee producer,” closed on $25 million in Series C equity funding.
Coffee is big business, with the global market valued at an estimated $493 billion. In addition to legacy producers you see in the coffee aisle, smaller operations have brewed up in recent years. Most recently, I reported on Chamberlain Coffee raising venture capital, which joins companies, like Fellow and Blank Street, not to mention lots of celebrity coffee brands. There are even companies, including Compound Foods and Atomo, making coffee without traditional beans.
Green Coffee Co. was founded in 2017 by Cole Shephard and is a consolidated arabica coffee farming company, headquartered in the U.S., with operations in Colombia that span 9,000 acres across 39 farms. It also has over 11.5 million coffee trees under ownership, which Shephard said makes the company more than two times larger than any other coffee producer in the country.
“We started off as an asset management product, but in two years, we were running the company,” Shephard said. “It’s a massive opportunity to grow a business in an international manner from Colombia, and no one was really doing it. Others lacked human capital or economic capital, while no one was really investing in the sector.”
Having amassed a large operation, the company controls the supply chain from cultivation to processing to direct trade with end-clients, he said. Its technology includes sophisticated processing machinery in its wet mills that recycles water so it takes 0.3 liters of water per pound of green coffee compared to the 20 liters per pound it traditionally takes, Shephard said.
Last year, Green Coffee Co. saw $10 million in revenue, up from $1 million the year prior, according to Shephard. He expects that to grow to $27 million in the next year.
Green Coffee Co. is a portfolio company of Latin American investment firm Legacy Group, where Shephard is also a partner. Green Coffee Co. raises its funding, including the Series C, from a network of over 450 individual, high-net-worth investors that invest directly into portfolio companies that Legacy Group advises rather than into a pooled fund, Shephard told TechCrunch. In total, investors have injected over $60 million into the business.
Shephard noted that the company raises in this manner because “the team at Legacy has always felt strongly about offering unique and exciting deals that provide individual investors the ability to directly invest in companies that they like rather than into a blind or diversified fund model over which they have little control or in which they hand over decision-making to large funds and institutions who provide little personalized attention.”
Proceeds from the funding round will expand the company’s Colombian farming operations, accelerate its U.S.-based coffee roasting operations in Houston over the next year and enable the company to launch a line of liquors and spirits distilled from the coffee byproducts, which includes coffee cherries and other coffee “waste.” The company is currently seeking $65 million of institutional debt capital to execute on those expansion plans.
Meanwhile, Shephard expects Green Coffee Co. to “become the world’s largest producer of arabica coffee in the next two years.” In addition, he is eyeing a 2026 U.S. IPO exit.
“We’re building a large-scale distillery in Colombia to create our own pure ethanol, and using a quarter of our byproducts, we can produce around 5 million to 6 million bottles of vodka a year,” Shephard said.

Pigment secures $88 million for its business planning tool that will make you forget about Excel,Romain Dillet,2023/06/08,"
Paris-based startup Pigment has raised a Series C round of $88 million — the investment was led by Iconiq Growth. Pigment wants to take on Microsoft Excel and offer a business planning platform that works better than products from enterprise software behemoths, such as Oracle or SAP. It’s a new take on a critical product for large companies that need to forecast, budget and build comprehensive reports.
In addition to Iconiq Growth (which previously invested in companies like Adyen, Datadog, GitLab, Miro and Snowflake), existing investors Meritech, IVP and FirstMark are investing in Pigment once again. Julien Codorniou, who is an angel investor in Pigment, is now also investing in the startup through his VC firm Felix Capital.
The best way to describe Pigment is by describing what it can do. It’s a flexible product that can be used by multiple teams in big companies. Chief financial officers — and finance teams in general — use it to gather all business data to create reports and plan for the future.
Sales team leaders can use it to track quotas and see how everyone is performing against quarterly quotas. HR teams can see how they should scale the workforce up and down based on strategic changes and financial objectives.
Just like Microsoft Excel, Pigment wants to be a generic tool. If you want to use it for carbon accounting and track your total emissions, you can start importing data and create a dashboard for that use case. Pigment also recently added a new spreadsheet view so that Excel users feel right at home when they are typing formulas.

But what makes Pigment different from Microsoft Excel is that it’s a live product. Pigment has built connectors with dozens of enterprise software products, including ERPs (NetSuite, SAP, Sage Intacct, Xero), HR information system (Workday, BambooHR, etc.) and data lakes (Snowflake, AWS Redshift, Google BigQuery). Pigment also integrates with Salesforce, and more connectors are on the way.
Once the data is imported, teams can build their own views, create dashboards and generate reports just like they would do in Excel. The difference is that data will be regularly synchronized and updated across all views.
As a modern software-as-a-service product, Pigment is also collaborative. For instance, the finance team can ask questions to the HR team to understand why a particular budget is so high. Users can then create “what-if” scenarios and estimate how some changes would affect the business without messing with the main dashboards.
An accidental funding round
Here’s what I wrote when I covered Pigment’s previous $65 million round:
Pigment’s co-founder and co-CEO Eléonore Crespo told me that she doesn’t need to raise more money to turn her company into a long-term, stable business. Of course, market conditions could change and Pigment could end up raising more next year.
I talked to her once again and asked her why she raised a Series C so quickly after the previous funding round. “We weren’t raising money at all. Here’s how I work: I try to have investor catch-ups once a year with potential investors for the next round. Several American funds told me ‘we’d like to invest now and offer you great terms. You have a product that is truly mission critical for any company,’” Crespo told me.
She also mentioned that they still have a lot of cash in the company’s bank account, but you have to raise when the terms are right and market conditions are tough. “We still had all the money from the previous round and even a little from the round before that,” she said.
While Pigment isn’t disclosing the valuation of the company after this round, it is still growing despite the difficult market conditions when it comes to startup funding.
That’s because Pigment has grown its revenue by 600% in 2022 compared to 2021. Some well-known companies are using the platform, such as Klarna, Miro, Airtable, Figma, Webhelp, Poshmark, Eventbrite, Mozilla and an unnamed French CAC40 public company.
In particular, CFOs like the product and talk about it with other CFOs. Once a business unit or a subsidiary starts using Pigment, other teams tend to create accounts and use the product as well. Only 10% of Pigment’s clients use the product exclusively for financial planning.

Up next, the company is working on Pigment AI. The startup signed a partnership with OpenAI and is using the GPT-4 API to query data using natural language. For instance, customers will be able to identify trends and obtain key information without having to dig in the different views.
“The next step, which is going to be absolutely magical, is optimized business scenarios. Your investors are asking you to achieve 10% growth this year, but you need to optimize your costs and keep a large margin. What’s the best scenario for that?” Crespo said.
The product is currently available in beta and will be rolled out to everyone later this year. Crespo describes Pigment AI as a productivity tool so that you can save time when you’re building complicated models — but it isn’t going to make decisions for you. “Humans have to be there to keep all the intelligence. It’s something to help you make the decision, but not to make it for you,” she said.

Insify raises another $10.7 million for its business insurance startup,Romain Dillet,2023/06/07,"
Amsterdam-based insurtech startup Insify has completed its Series A funding round with another €10 million ($10.7 million at today’s exchange rate). Overall, the startup has raised €25 million as part of its Series A round ($26.7 million).
Munich Re Ventures, the venture capital division of the large reinsurance company, is leading the extension round. Insify has already been working with Munich Re for its insurance products. Existing investors Accel, Frontline Ventures and Berlin’s Visionaries Club are investing in the extension. There are some new investors as well, namely Formula 1 World Champion Nico Rosberg and Opera Tech Ventures.
As a reminder, Insify addresses the long tail of the business insurance market. While big companies usually have plenty of options when it comes to insurance products, if you’re a freelancer or a small company with a handful of employees, the current experience isn’t great.
Small and medium companies are most often underinsured or don’t have any insurance at all. And yet, many businesses could benefit from a professional or corporate liability insurance, or should get some form of coverage in the rare case that they are no longer able to work.
“As an entrepreneur myself, I have experienced first-hand how SMEs are underserved when it comes to business insurance, with many legacy providers failing to offer a digital-friendly, streamlined and competitive offering – meaning that many businesses simply go without cover,” founder and CEO Koen Thijssen said in a statement. “Our rapid growth since our previous funding round in 2022 shows the desire and need for better insurance solutions from freelancers and SMEs across the continent.”
With Insify, small companies can get a quote directly from the company’s website. In addition to the online form, the company uses advanced analytics to get some additional information about a potential customer. Essentially, Insify wants to lower the customer cost acquisition so that this segment of the market can make sense.
Since my last post on the company in February 2022, the company has grown from 1,500 to 10,000 clients. In addition to the Netherlands, the startup’s insurance products are now also available in France and Germany.

"Julie Wainwright is back with a new, venture-backed startup",Connie Loizos,2023/06/07,"
Julie Wainwright, founder and former CEO of the publicly traded, luxury online consignment company The RealReal, is back with a new startup.
Called Ahara, the Los Angeles-based outfit describes itself as a personalized nutrition company that provides recommendations to its customers after they first fill out a health questionnaire that asks them about their diet and health history, and their age and location, after which they can take a variety of at-home tests for genetic, epigenetic and biomarkers.
According to Ahara, for example, its tests can tell the company how effectively someone is metabolizing specific nutrients; how healthy his or her cells are; and which tests an individual’s blood levels for key nutrients like vitamin D and Omega 3s.
Wainwright isn’t a wellness expert, but after leaving The RealReal last June after running the company for 11 years, she teamed up with celebrity physician-nutritionist Melina Jampolis as co-founder. Jampolis is also the outfit’s chief medical doctor. Indeed, in a quiet press release published yesterday, the duo — who already feature half a dozen other employees on their site — including a performance marketer — say they have themselves contributed to a $10.25 million round that was led by Greycroft, with participation from Headline, SHAKTI and entrepreneur Sandy Sholl.
Ahara is currently in beta and, according to its own literature, will operate a freemium model that provides special benefits to “premium” members.
That the operation appears to require far fewer resources than The RealReal isn’t surprising. Wainwright — who earlier led the dot.com-era company Pets.com — is coming off of a business that’s beloved by its customers but highly challenging from a margins perspective.
In conversation last week with investor Ian Sigalow of Greycroft — the firm was also an early backer in The RealReal — he offered his theories about why The RealReal boasts a market cap of just $170 million after reaching a market cap of $2.39 billion the day of its IPO three years ago.
Though The RealReal was a “really good idea,” creating a far more vibrant second-hand luxury goods market, the “challenge with the model is that it is very capital intensive. The storage of the garments is expensive. The way that they procure in such a white-glove manner is expensive.” Wainwright “executed really well on the vision, but driving a profitable machine and taking the cost out of it is just very hard to deal with in that business because it’s all basically one-off unique pieces of fashion product, and they all have to be graded. It’s a complicated business to scale.”
Ahara joins a growing spate of digital nutrition startups. Though each has a slightly different flavor, over the last six months, Mighty Health, a four-year-old, San Francisco-based startup offering a daily health program designed for adults ages 50 and up, raised $7.6 million in venture backing; Nourish, a San Francisco-based telehealth platform for nutrition, raised $8 million in seed funding; and Zoe, a British nutrition and health tracking app, also attracted the attention of VCs, raising £25 million from investors, to name just a few.

Digibee raises $60M to help companies integrate their software apps,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/07,"
Digibee, a low-code integration platform geared toward enterprise organizations, today announced that it raised $60 million in a Series B funding round led by Goldman Sachs, with participation from Leadwind, Southern Europe, Vivo Ventures, Brazilian telco Vivo, Kinea and G2D.
The round brings Weston, Florida-based Digibee’s total raised to $90 million, which CEO Rodrigo Bernardinelli said is being put toward growth in the U.S. and Latin America with a particular focus on expanding customer support stateside.
“From a product perspective, Digibee will drive AI capabilities into the platform as well as substantially focusing on developer enablement,” Bernardinelli told TechCrunch in an email interview. “In terms of the market motion, Digibee expects to focus on relieving the pain of working with entrenched, legacy integration technologies that are not delivering value commensurate with their costs.”
Bernadinelli and Digibee’s second co-founder, Peter Kreslins, worked together for several years in sales and technical roles and met the startup’s third co-founder, Vitor Sousa, as a customer. Bernadinelli says they all saw a need to address a challenge — app and process integration — that’d been around for decades in a “modern” way.
The fruit of their labor is Digibee, which offers a set of automated tools that integrate apps that are then deployed in different environments. The startup’s cloud services support the development and governance of integration flows that connect on-premises and cloud-based processes, services apps and data across an organization.
With Digibee, customers can create integration flows, or pipelines, leveraging components like enterprise apps, files and other tools. Modules provide pre-packaged business logic that can be reused by internal teams and partners.
“Traditional and legacy integration platforms require months of training before certification and productivity can be achieved,” Bernadinelli said. “This makes the implementation of integration technology challenging and costly. By providing a low-code platform for pro coders, Digibee allows a wide spectrum of engineers the opportunity to be productive in days or weeks — helping to punch down technical debt.”
Bernadinelli acknowledges that Digibee competes with a range of legacy integration vendors including MuleSoft, Boomi, Software AG and TIBCO in addition to incumbents like Oracle, SAP, Microsoft and IBM. But he stressed what he sees as Digibee’s biggest differentiator, which is a consumption-based pricing model that doesn’t require customers to pay for the maximum potential usage.
“Although we sometimes run into Workato, Tray.io, Celigo and other companies focused on non-mission critical use cases in shadow IT, these are not our primary competitors,” Bernadinelli added.
Digibee also has the good fortune of occupying an industry in high demand. According to a survey by IDG and TeamDynamix, platforms like Digibee — known as iPaaS, or integration platforms as a service — are becoming the solution of choice for enterprises adopting new digital technologies. The survey found that 27% of companies had already invested in iPaaS as of November 2021, and that 66% had plans to do so in the next 12 to 24 months.
“The major challenge for the iPaaS industry is clearly delineating use cases for enterprise-class platforms like Digibee’s from point-to-point capabilities from many of the upstarts that have seen huge growth in the past couple of years,” Bernadinelli said. The former are strategic and core to enterprise requirements, including notable digital transformation initiatives, while the latter are tactical and tend to have very discrete, minor impact. In digital transformation initiatives, the value is at the point of integration.”
Digibee, which has roughly 280 employees and 250-plus customers, plans to expand its workforce to over 300 people by the end of the year.

What are Series A VCs looking for? Many seed investors aren’t so sure anymore,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/06/07,"
Long gone are the days where a startup could raise a Series A round based on vibes and the networks of its seed investors. But today’s Series A funding environment isn’t just a return to pre-2021 trends and metrics.
Series A investors are still taking longer to do due diligence, are more focused on the metrics, and are looking to participate in rounds at reasonable valuations. But seed investors told TechCrunch+ that this new environment sends founders mixed messages, and tracking what companies need to have accomplished to raise a Series A has become hard for them to decipher themselves.
The muted late-stage funding and exit environments have left investors with few data points and examples of how to price companies — and that now affects the Series A stage, too.
“The goal posts seem to be moving a lot,” said Eric Bahn, a co-founder and general partner at seed and pre-seed focused Hustle Fund. “If you were to push me in a corner and say, ‘Dude, what does it take to get to the Series A?’ I’m not sure I’d know the answer myself.”

Atlanta investors are bullish on where the city’s startup scene is headed,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/06/07,"

Atlanta’s venture scene is growing. To give you a look at the market’s strengths and areas of improvement, TechCrunch caught up with two local VCs as part of TechCrunch’s virtual spotlight on the city.
Zane Venture Fund founder and managing partner Shila Nieves Burney and Overline co-founder and managing partner Sean O’Brien both told TechCrunch what they love about investing in the Southern city.
Nieves Burney talked about how the city’s diverse talent pool and strong education system help lay the foundation for the city’s growing venture scene. O’Brien added that many in the city prefer being collaborative over competitive, which makes it a healthy environment for companies to grow in.
“We just have a different way of doing things down here in Atlanta,” O’Brien said. “And there’s a lot of resources that come together to support founders on the earliest stages all the way through their growth stages of their companies. So it’s a great city to build in and a great moment in time for our city.”
Plus, having a mayor who is pro business and pushing for local innovation isn’t bad either. Learn more about what Andre Dickens had to say about the space here.
They also talked about the fact that one of the biggest issues in the Atlanta scene currently is that it is often overlooked in the emerging tech scene when compared to cities like Austin or Miami.
“I think that’s one of our biggest flaws is that we have not been able to tell the Atlanta story,” Nieves Burney said. “What’s our secret sauce? Because there is one here.”

8 factors to consider when fundraising during a downturn

Julia Daniel is Chief of Staff at M13 and oversees the annual planning process and quarterly tracking of OKRs. Her previous roles include account manager at Condé Nast and executive assistant at Compass.	

Running a business is a lot like piloting a ship; above all, you need to know where you’re going and how you’re getting there. What’s more, you need a crew that knows how to back you up when you need it most.
Objectives and key results, or OKRs for short, are a time-tested methodology for ensuring that you and your company have the smoothest sailing possible. They make it easy to set and track company goals so that your entire team knows what needs to be done, how to do it and why it matters in the larger vision of your business.
The OKR framework has helped countless businesses synchronize their teams and realize ambitious goals, launching their companies to new heights.
This guide will walk you through the process of implementing OKRs in your own company, making them a value-driving component of your operating system.
In this guide, we’ll cover the five parts of an effective OKR process, including:

The OKR framework.
Setting annual objectives.
Creating an annualized roadmap.
Quarterly planning.
How to establish a rinse-and-repeat cadence.

Every step in this generalized guide will apply to the majority of startups, but some will benefit from additional frameworks that aren’t included. To get started, make a copy of the OKR framework and template. You may want to refer to the overview on slides 3 and 4 of the deck.
Framework and ownership
OKR framework
OKRs have a very specific framework that is integral to the success of the methodology. There are several key components of an OKR process, which will each be explored more deeply later. They are:

Annual objectives. These are the big picture items for your business. They’re your ultimate goals, your guiding light. Serving to unite a company’s vision and inspire teams, strong annual objectives are key to a successful OKR framework.
Key results are goals that drive progress toward your annual objectives. They are more data focused, including quantifiable metrics that prove your company is on the right course.
Initiatives are the projects and tasks that ladder up toward your key results. In other words, initiatives are the things that need to happen in order to achieve your key results.
If your company is a spaceship, your annual objectives are the destination. Image Credits: M13

If your company is a spaceship, your annual objectives are the destination. The key results are the dials on the console that show your speed and indicate whether you’re on course, and the initiatives are the actions of the crew and pilot that keep the course steady and the engines burning.
It’s important to understand the differences between each piece of the OKR framework, as it can be easy to confuse them in the beginning. Without a strong distinction between each component, it will be much harder to implement your OKR process successfully.
 
 

			OKRs make it easy to set and track goals so that your entire team knows what to do, how to do it and why it matters.					


 
Establishing ownership
A clear ownership structure is vitally important to the OKR framework. Without a dedicated captain, you’ll find yourself wasting resources and letting details fall through the cracks.
We recommend establishing a point person to take top-down control of the OKR process as early as possible.
This person should interact closely with leadership and understand the big picture of your business. Operations managers and chiefs of staff are typically good choices for this role.
Annual objectives
Annual objectives are the big picture items for your business. They’re ambitious, large-scale goals that you and your team can look to as a reminder of your company’s purpose and direction.
When setting your objectives, ask yourself what will move your company forward and create meaningful change in your business. Which company goals are most pressing? What would you like to see happen in the next year? What core tenants of your model can you expand upon and improve?
What makes a good objective?
Creating a good annual objective may seem simple at first glance, but it takes a bit of practice to get right. Annual objectives must have a specific format to function properly in the OKR framework.
Objectives are:

Big-picture goals that relate directly to the most important aspects of your business. They should be doable, but ambitious. There’s nothing wrong with falling a little short — in fact, failing some of your objectives is a sign you’re using them correctly. In a given year, around two-thirds of your annual objectives should be completed.
Clear and concise. An annual objective that is more than one sentence long is uncommon. You want a simple, punchy statement that your team will be able to remember easily.
Strategic and specific to your business. They should set a destination for your company, the path to which will be plotted by other elements of the OKR framework.

As a counterexample, let’s take a look at what you should avoid when creating your objectives.
Objectives are NOT:

One-off tasks that can be completed quickly. They should be ambitious, relevant for the entire year and push the limits of what you think your business is capable of achieving.
KPIs. While objectives can occasionally contain a measurable output, you should steer away from simply stating a metric as your objective. The goal of your objectives is to define the greater purpose of your work without focusing too heavily on data-based measurements.
Boring. When you set an annual objective, it should tell a compelling story. The best objectives use language that is inspiring and action-based.

Why the economics of equality is key to Atlanta’s future,Dominic-Madori Davis,2023/06/07,"

TechCrunch sat down with investor and entrepreneur Rodney Sampson as part of a fireside chat for our TechCrunch Atlanta Live program.
The topic at hand was his work with the Atlanta-based ecosystem OHUB, which was started by him and his wife in 2013 and seeks to engage the next generation of diverse startup and venture talent. Unsurprisingly, the battle is uphill. Discrimination within the startup ecosystem amalgamates racism, classism, and sexism. Black and Latine founders simply do not receive much funding; last year, Crunchbase said the number of dollars given to indigenous founders was too low to even track.
Atlanta seems like the perfect place to start advocating for change. Nearly half of the city identifies as Black and was a cradle for the 1960s Civil Rights movement. Sampson was born and raised in Atlanta and attended university at Tulane University and then Penn State. He came back to Atlanta, though, because he felt it was a place to build; there was a diversity of talent and thought that intersected with innovation and culture. It was also home, he said.
“I’m excited about the possibilities of Atlanta,” Sampson continued. “But there’s some critical work that has to be done that is more substantive with depth and with range, and it relates to us really continuing to be that leader, as it relates to being a Black tech hub.”
Rodney said it’s vital for leaders and those in power to be thoughtful as they continue to build and expand within Atlanta. He said he saw how Black policymakers were able to create economic opportunity for the community there through, for example, government contracting opportunities.
“That same strategy must be applied to the startup ecosystem,” Sampson said. “Therein lies the opportunity because I think we’ve just really started to have those types of conversations.”
He believes creating an entirely new investor class is necessary to drive a more equitable venture landscape. “It’s time for us to really stop chasing the current institutional and individual investors,” he said. “We can’t keep expecting the same things from the same people and the same institutions.”
There was a glimmer of hope in 2020, he noted, after the murder of George Floyd, when many corporations made promises to help alleviate the racial wealth gap. That glimmer of hope has since faded, along with those promises. In the meantime, it’s all can’t-stop-won’t-stop for Sampson. OHUB is working with colleges nationwide to help upskill more tech workers. It’s working with states like North Carolina and Alabama to invest socially and economically within disenfranchised communities. In other words, OHUB looking toward the future.

Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens explains why tech companies are moving to the city,Dominic-Madori Davis,2023/06/07,"

Atlanta mayor Andre Dickens sat down with TechCrunch to help open our first TechCrunch Live event dedicated to the city and spoke with us about the rapidly growing tech landscape.
Atlanta is home to many buzzy industries, including fintech and SaaS, and is also the abode for many investors looking to back the startups in the city. Some well-known unicorns from the city include Calendly, FullStory, and Kabbage. Atlanta startups raised around $1.65 billion, according to PitchBook, the second-highest amount of funding allocated to the city in recent years. With that, it makes sense why even the Atlanta Hawks and record label Quality Control have set up funds and investment portfolios.
Dickens was born and raised in Atlanta and had an extensive background in tech before becoming mayor. He said it has been “phenomenal to watch this city grow from a southern jewel with charm to now an international city, one of the epicenters of the tech ecosystem,” before giving a slight nod to all the companies that are moving in: Microsoft, Porsche, to name a few.
He said people are attracted to Atlanta because of the culture, business productivity, easy travel, and low cost of living compared to other tech hubs like Austin and especially San Francisco. The city is also a natural pipeline for talent, and is home to Georgia Tech and historically Black colleges and universities, like Morehouse and Spelman.
“Companies are coming here because they can access all this great talent,” he continued. “Technology growth happens right here because of that talent.”
One source of tension for talent looking to relocate to Atlanta could be that the city is politically blue in the historically red state of Georgia. This means that when a massive policy change is implemented, such as one that impacts women’s health, the blue bubble might not be enough to protect founders from such changes. With that, though, Dickens said change is perhaps on the front: Georgia voted for Biden and put two Democrats, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, into the Senate. This has turned the city purple in its political leanings, he said, which bodes well for the state and, therefore, the city.
“It keeps us at the center point of all political discussion,” he continued. “Republicans, Democrats, otherwise, folks want to do business in Atlanta; folks want to do business in Georgia.”
Dicken said one of his main interests is ensuring equity and opportunities for more people to enter the tech sector, especially those looking to overcome generational poverty. For example, he said the city had been focused on promoting tech certification rather than just four-year degrees. He also wants to make sure that companies moving to the city are making use of the talent and resources there.
There is also the possibility, though, that as Atlanta grows, it can become a victim of its own success, where the cost of living skyrockets and prices out blue-collar workers. Dickens said the city wants balanced growth that does not impact the legacy residents of the city. One way he’s been doing this is by stating explicitly to the corporations who wish to build in the city what his expectations are. “I can’t sign off on any incentives for your company to come here if you don’t have a local hiring plan,” he said.
To wrap up the interview, I asked for questions from Twitter. One woman asked about the availability of free co-working spaces, to which the mayor responded it was worth looking into. The last audience question was about the famous Atlanta water kids who stand on the side of roadways selling water to people in cars.
“Have there been any thoughts on efforts to convert those kids on the street into early tech programs?” the audience member asked.
“We actually do,” Dickens said. He said the city is working on placing them in entrepreneur programs so the children can hone their skills as natural business leaders. “We can’t just have them on a public right away selling water because they could get hurt,” the mayor said, adding that they are working to put them in the talent pipeline. “We’d like to do that times 10.”

Dear Sophie,
Why is there no movement in the June 2023 Visa Bulletin for India EB-3? 
Can’t the Department of State/USCIS track the interfiled applications between EB-2 and EB-3 and move the dates accordingly?
— Curious in Chennai
Dear Curious,
Thanks for your questions! The Visa Bulletin has been very volatile of late and I totally understand your frustration with retrogressions and lack of movement in the employment-based green card categories.
My dream is that any child born anywhere in the world has the opportunity to follow their heart to do things that will make the world a better place — and to that end I’m doing what I can to educate folks about immigration options and strategies to live and work legally in the United States!
Toward that end, let me provide a bit of context about downgrading from an EB-2 advanced degree or exceptional ability green card to EB-3 professionals and workers green card, the process of interfiling and movement in the Visa Bulletin. Check out this Ask Sophie column in which I talk about the availability of employment-based green cards and the Visa Bulletin.

Downgrading and interfiling
Downgrading is when an employer files a new Form I-140 green card petition for an employee in a lower employment-based preference category to take advantage of a more favorable priority date in that lower category, which may lead to a green card number becoming available sooner. Most often, downgrading occurs when an employee born in India or China has an approved I-140 EB-2 green card application and is waiting for a green card number to become available. (If the employer, job, location and pay have not changed from the original PERM application, a new PERM application is not required.)
When the downgraded I-140 is approved, the employer can file an I-485 application to register permanent residence or adjust status for the employee as long as the employee’s priority date is current in the downgraded category. The priority date is the date that the U.S. Department of Labor received the PERM labor certification application for the EB-2 or EB-3 green card or the date that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services received the EB-1 or EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver) I-140 green card application, which do not require PERM.

Contextual AI launches from stealth to build enterprise-focused language models,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/07,"
Large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT-4 are powerful, paradigm-shifting tools that promise to upend industries. But they suffer from limitations that make them less attractive to enterprise organizations with strict compliance and governance requirements. For example, LLMs have a tendency to make up information with high confidence, and they’re architected in a way that makes it difficult to remove — or even revise — their knowledge base.
To solve for these and other roadblocks, Douwe Kiela co-founded Contextual AI, which today launched out of stealth with $20 million in seed funding. Backed by investors including Bain Capital Ventures (which led the seed), Lightspeed, Greycroft and SV Angel, Contextual AI ambitiously aims to build the “next generation” of LLMs for the enterprise.
“We created the company to address the needs of enterprises in the burgeoning area of generative AI, which has thus far largely focused on consumers,” Kiela told TechCrunch via email. “Contextual AI is solving for several obstacles that exist today in getting enterprises to adopt generative AI.”
Kiela and Contextual AI’s other co-founder, Amanpreet Singh, worked together at AI startup Hugging Face and Meta before deciding to go it their own in early February. While at Meta, Kiela led research into a technique called retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which forms the basis of Contextual AI’s text-generating AI technology.
So what’s RAG? In a nutshell, RAG — which Google’s DeepMInd R&D division has also explored — augments LLMs with external sources, like files and webpages, to improve their performance. Given a prompt (e.g. “Who’s the president of the U.S.?”), RAG looks for data within the sources that might be relevant. Then, it packages the results with the original prompt and feeds it to an LLM, generating a “context-aware” response (e.g. “The current president is Joe Biden, according to the official White House website”).
By contrast, in response to a question like “What’s Nepal’s GDP by year?,” a typical LLM (e.g. ChatGPT) might only return the GDP up to a certain date and fail to cite the source of the information.
Kiela asserts that RAG can solve the other outstanding issues with today’s LLMs, like those around attribution and customization. With conventional LLMs, it can be tough to know why the models respond the way they do, and adding data sources to LLMs often requires retraining or fine-tuning — steps (usually) avoided with RAG.
“RAG language models can be smaller than equivalent language models and still achieve the same performance. This makes them a lot faster, meaning lower latency and lower cost,” Kiela said. “Our solution addresses the shortcomings and inherited issues of existing approaches. We believe that integrating and jointly optimizing different modules for data integration, reasoning, speech and even seeing and listening will unlock the true potential of language models for enterprise use cases.”
My colleague Ron Miller has mused about how generative AI’s future in the enterprise could be smaller, more focused language models. I don’t dispute that. But perhaps instead of exclusively fine-tuned, enterprise-focused LLMs, it’ll be a combination of “smaller” models and existing LLMs augmented with troves of company-specific documents.
Contextual AI isn’t the first to explore this idea. OpenAI and its close partner, Microsoft, recently launched a plug-ins framework that allows third parties to add sources of information to LLMs like GPT-4. Other startups, like LlamaIndex, are experimenting with ways to inject personal or private data, including enterprise data, into LLMs.
But Contextual AI claims to have inroads in the enterprise. While the company is pre-revenue at the present, Kiela claims that Contextual AI is in talks with Fortune 500 companies to pilot its technology.
“Enterprises need to be certain that the answers they’re getting from generative AI are accurate, reliable and traceable,” Kiela said. “Contextual AI will make it easy for employers and their valuable knowledge workers to gain the efficiency benefits that generative AI can provide, while doing so safely and accurately … Several generative AI companies have stated they will pursue the enterprise market, but Contextual AI will take a different approach by building a much more integrated solution geared specifically for enterprise use cases.”
Contextual AI, which has around eight employees, plans to spend the bulk of its seed funding on product development, which will include investing in a compute cluster to train LLMs. The company plans to grow its workforce to close to 20 people by the end of 2023.

Cava’s sensible IPO ambitions could spur more companies to go public,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/07,"
Even as the technology industry and investors wait for heavily venture-backed companies like Turo, Reddit and Instacart to go public, Cava is heading out and powering its own debut.
The company set an initial IPO price range this week, indicating what it may be worth once it’s public. This is also a chance for us to check our valuation estimates.
Cava intends to sell 14.4 million shares between $17 and $19 each. The IPO will raise hundreds of millions of dollars. (Note that if Cava’s underwriters exercise their option to purchase more equity at the IPO price, that number could go up to 16.6 million shares.)

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

Cava, a fast-casual chain that serves Mediterranean food, may seem like an odd choice for TechCrunch to cover. However, the company has raised extensive private capital, including venture funds, and is worth more than $1 billion. This IPO will recycle funds currently locked up in its illiquid shares back to investors, and that matters for the companies that do come under the ambit of our usual coverage.
That said, Cava sits neatly next to other tech-enabled businesses that have gone public in recent years. I’m thinking about names like Sweetgreen, and Rent The Runway, even if the latter has a very different business model.
If you want to learn how Cava has grown and operates its business, head here. This morning, we’re digging into the company’s valuation.
Is it better to have “tech-enabled” in your description?
I was chatting recently with the CEO of a multibillion-dollar startup about what went wrong during the 2020-2021 venture capital bubble. In their view, one of the core issues was the homogenization of revenue and how it was valued. "

Bonside launches with $4.35M to provide growth capital to brick-and-mortar businesses,Christine Hall,2023/06/07,"
Online shopping is typically where much of the commerce financing has focused on over the past three years. However, during this time, some retailers that started in e-commerce are diversifying and going the brick-and-mortar route. That’s probably because 54% of consumers still prefer to go into a physical store.
Like other businesses, they need money for a shop, but finding financing isn’t easy. Banks have been slow to offer better growth capital options, while some startups — such as Onramp Funds — focus on e-commerce. And venture capital isn’t for every business.
Enter Bonside, a financing platform designed for brick-and-mortar businesses that provides growth financing through revenue. Today, the company launched out of beta with an equity financing round of $4.35 million from a group of investors, led by Floating Point, that also includes 81 Collection, TMV and Philz Coffee’s Jacob Jaber.
“Venture capital is a beautiful instrument for tech businesses or businesses seeking some form of hockey stick growth, but it’s less transferable if you’re going after a slightly more linear growth or not a software play,” Bonside founder and CEO Neha Govindraj told TechCrunch. “Also venture capital is so expensive for a business like mine. It doesn’t make sense for me to give up like 2% of my business or 10% of my business every time I want to open a location.”
In 2018, Govindraj co-founded Glowbar, a New York–based company offering skincare treatments. It was while considering Glowbar’s real estate footprint that she realized businesses like hers didn’t fit the model of a traditional venture-backed company.
As a result, she created Bonside with a unique financing model structured via Repeatable Revenue Agreements, which Govindraj described as similar to what Y Combinator does with SAFE notes for startups.
Here’s how it works: The agreement is capital in exchange for a percentage of that business’ revenue. Business owners maintain ownership and repay via the revenue until they reach a fixed cap. Meanwhile, accredited investors benefit from overall reduced risk, exposure to their localities and a passive income source that outperforms market standards, Govindraj said.
There are also two ways to finance a deal — one is through a network of investors and the other is through a fund Bonside created.
“There’s no collateral, no personal guarantees, no equity triggers — it’s just that straightforward,” she added.
Businesses seem to like it. So far, Bonside has deployed nearly $2 million across five businesses, cumulatively grossing $25 million in annual revenue. More than 100 brick-and-mortar businesses are currently in its pipeline.
Investors like it, too. Bonside received over 500 applications to join its accredited investor marketplace and has already onboarded 200 members.
“Coming from a background in brick-and-mortar business, the solution Bonside offers resonated with me deeply,” said Jacob Jaber, founder of Philz Coffee, in a written statement. “The dream of expansion, of opening a second or even third outlet, is one held by many entrepreneurs, but the path to realizing it can be fraught with obstacles. Bonside streamlines this journey, providing successful business owners with a smooth conduit to growth-friendly capital, free from the complexities and stumbling blocks of traditional financing methods.”
Meanwhile, among the five businesses the company has provided the revenue-based financing to, she said each of them are overperforming against its underwriting, noting that each business owner has expressed that they are quickly working to reach their respective multiple on the invested capital.
“All of them are beating the clock right now,” Govindraj added. “The ‘best-performing’ business is 63% ahead of their timeline, and ‘slowest’ business is 15% ahead of their timeline.”
Govindraj intends to deploy Bonside’s new funding into development of data-driven underwriting, financing and analytics for the businesses it invests in. The company is also currently hiring additional engineers.
“We want to create this gold standard of what underwriting looks like for brick-and-mortar, and we have the unique opportunity to do that,” Govindraj said. “Small business lending has been explored in the past, however, SMB is 99% of the businesses in this country. That’s not a target demographic, that’s a really wide net. By focusing on brick-and-mortar services, we can tailor the technology that we’re building and make it verticalized in a way that is impactful.”
Editor’s note, June 7, 6:23 a.m. PST: Updated to add Floating Point as lead investor and other investors.

4 problems venture capital can’t solve

"
Mosaic raises $26M to help inform companies’ financial decisions,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/07,"
Typical financial planning and analysis teams spend the bulk of their time on data-gathering and administering processes. That’s because they often have to deal with cumbersome systems and software tools, leaving little time to focus on generating insights that might drive business growth.
At least, that’s according to Bijan Moallemi, the co-founder of Mosaic, a startup building a platform that attempts to centralize operational data from across an organization. Mosaic today announced that it raised $26 million in a Series C funding round led by OMERS Ventures with participation from Founders Fund, General Catalyst, and Friends and Family Capital, bringing its total raised to $73 million.
Moallemi co-launched Mosaic with Joe Garafalo and Brian Campbell, who he met in 2012 at Palantir, the big data analytics company, while helping to build Palantir’s finance team.
“Tasked with supporting business decisions for a company — Palantir — in hypergrowth, we were frustrated by the slow speed, high complexity and inefficiencies of existing tools in the market,” Moallemi told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Realizing that the role of the CFO had grown in scope, but our toolkit had not, we set out to build a platform that would address the technical challenges modern-day finance and business teams face.”
Moallemi describes Mosaic as a “real-time planning and analytics” platform. Stripping out all that marketing jargon, Mosaic provides dashboards, modeling and data visualization tools geared toward financial planning use cases, allowing users to quickly share insights with stakeholders.

With Mosaic, companies can gain a better sense of when to execute on their plans, Moallemi says, like when to expand their sales teams or raise another round of funding. Users can create department or executive views for due diligence and go-to-market analysis, providing a unified — but custom-tailored — source of truth.
“In the past, implementing a legacy FP&A platform took months, bogging down the IT department with significant demand for engineering resources,” Moallemi said. “We’ve architected Mosaic to eliminate the need for IT resources in implementation or maintenance … Instead of needing IT to respond to requests for data, business users can get real-time insight into the metrics that impact their daily activities.”
Mosaic, who counts Emerge, Sourcegraph and Drata among its customers, claims business has “tripled” each year since its founding in 2019 and that the burn rate — the rate at which it’s spending money in excess of income — is steadily decreasing. Moallemi credits the pandemic with the growth, in part, as well as the current general economic uncertainty.
There’s truth to what he says. According to a recent survey from Capterra, the majority (73%) of financial professionals plan to spend more on software this year than they did in 2022. They listed managing a hybrid workplace, security concerns and cyberattack risks as their top motivators.
“During the pandemic, the rise of remote work created more demand for collaborative workflows in finance,” Moallemi said. “Macro slowdowns require everyone to do more with less. And the answer to that is implementing technology that increases the amount of work people can do without forcing the company to add headcount.”
In the near term, Mosaic, which has 80 full-time employees, plans to build out the platform’s AI capabilities and introduce tools along the lines of its recently-launched Metric Builder, which lets customers create, analyze and plan custom financial metrics. Added Moallemi: “We’ll continue to expand our planning and analysis features while also making AI a core part of the platform to empower this generation of agile, strategic finance leaders.”

Positive Ventures’ new impact fund will be triple its flagship fund,Christine Hall,2023/06/07,"
Positive Ventures, a São Paulo–based venture capital firm, secured $25 million in capital commitments for its impact fund. This represents a tripling of its previous fund, raised three years ago.
The firm, which also has an office in San Francisco, invests at the pre-seed and seed stages in Latin American founders building tech-driven solutions in climate change, education, healthcare and financial services in underserved communities.
Andrea Kestenbaum, partner and CEO, told TechCrunch that this new fund represents a tripling of its assets under management in less than two years, which amounts to an aggregated market value of $1 billion.
Fábio Kestenbaum, partner and chairman, said in an interview that backing the new fund is a group of limited partners, including large institutional investors and family offices, as well as Fabio Barbosa, CEO of Natura & Co.

Brazil’s Positive Ventures closes on $10M fund for impact investing

From its flagship fund, Positive Ventures invested in such companies as carbon credit provider Pachama and social commerce startup Favo, pioneering the social commerce revolution in Latin America.
By last October, the firm had raised $20 million of the second fund and co-led, alongside Collaborative Fund, in the pre-seed round of Ruuf, a Chilean marketplace connecting homeowners, solar panel installers and lenders.
More recently, it invested in Apprenty, which provides shipping high-quality apprenticeship programs that combine work, training and community in Brazil.
Overall, with the new fund, Positive Ventures intends to invest in between 20 and 25 companies at the pre-seed and seed levels, Fábio Kestenbaum said. Average check size for a pre-seed company will be around $250,000, and for seed rounds, $600,000. The firm is also exploring minority stake opportunities where it will take between 5% and 10%.
“We want to team up as early as possible to develop a nice acumen, business-wise and impact-wise, and be super founder-centered,” he added. “We’re gonna double down on climate investing, AI and all the nature-based solutions popping up especially since Latin America is the world’s hotspot for nature-based solutions and carbon, so we really want to be first movers here.”

"GetHarley, a skincare telehealth and consultation platform, raises $52M",Paul Sawers,2023/06/06,"
GetHarley, a platform that connects consumers with skincare clinicians and related products, has raised $52 million in a round of funding led by existing investor Index Ventures.
Founded out of London in 2019 by Charmaine Chow, GetHarley is a telehealth platform that gives anyone a direct channel to qualified skincare professionals, including dermatologists and plastic surgeons, who recommend products and treatments for conditions such as acne, uneven skin tone or hyperpigmentation, rosacea, melasma and more. Online consultations cost £40 ($50) for 30 minutes, though where more complex medical histories are involved, patients can pay £150 ($186) for a more senior-level consultant dermatologist.
Part of GetHarley’s business model involves selling skincare products as part of a personalized plan, catering to specific individual factors such as whether the individual has dry or oily skin, or how light / dark their skin is. Products may include anything from cleansers and serums to moisturizers and eye creams.

Skin in the game
The broader global skincare products market was pegged as a $130 billion industry in 2021, however, GetHarley positions itself in a narrower niche categorized as “medical-grade skincare” or “cosmeceuticals” as they’re sometimes called. These are sort of hybrids between cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, formulated with a “higher concentration of active ingredients” than what you might find in a store and are often only available through clinicians. This was estimated as a $45 billion industry in 2021.
The skincare market size has been a boon for skincare startups too, with LA-based Topicals and Mother Science, and Kenya’s Uncover, all raising venture capital (VC) cash in recent months to expand their own-brand skincare products.
GetHarley is taking a slightly different approach, instead curating established products and using qualified clinicians to recommend specific plans. With thousands of products on the market, many with their own unique pitch on why they are the best thing since sliced bread, it’s difficult to filter through the noise — GetHarley promises to make things a little easier.
“The skincare industry is overflowing with false claims, celebrity marketing and thousands upon thousands of choices about how to care for your skin,” Chow said in a press release. “You end up wasting huge amounts of time, money and energy trying to figure out what works for you. I should know — I looked everywhere for solutions for my challenging skin. And while consumers are being pulled in multiple directions, clinicians are time-poor and overstretched and you can never quite get hold of them. GetHarley solves all this, giving experts a one-stop platform, and helping global consumers get access to the best advice in a crowded marketplace.”
Prior to now, GetHarley had raised around $15 million in funding, and in the four years since its foundation, the company says it has garnered some 100,000 active users and amassed a team of 70 — a figure it expects to double over the next year.
In addition to lead backer Index, GetHarley’s latest funding round included participation from Headline, Visionaries Club and Village Global.

"Apple acquires Mira, a startup building lightweight AR hardware",Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/06,"
Apple has acquired Mira, an augmented reality (AR) headset startup, for an undisclosed amount, according to The Verge.
Founded by entrepreneur Ben Taft in 2016 and based in Los Angeles, Mira has been making AR headsets for customers, including Universal Studios for attractions at its Nintendo World theme parks. Investors, including Blue Bear Capital, Happiness Ventures, and Sequoia, poured $17 million into the startup prior to the acquisition, betting big on its heads-up displays and software to create AR apps, games and experiences.
Mira, which TechCrunch covered in 2020, originally pitched its hardware as a lightweight introduction to the world of AR, emphasizing consumer apps. But it later pivoted toward industrial rollouts — a more profitable market, presumably.
As The Verge notes, Mira had several military contracts at one point, including agreements with the U.S. Air Force and Navy. We’ve reached out to the company to see whether those contracts will continue under Apple’s ownership.
News of the acquisition follows the unveiling of Apple’s Vision Pro headset, the company’s long-rumored — and first — stab at AR. It’s unclear to what degree Mira might play a role in Apple’s AR roadmap, but The Verge reports that Jony Ive, Apple’s longtime former product designer, was an advisor to Mira at one point.

Instabase lands $45M investment to help companies automate document processing,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/06,"
Instabase, a startup providing an apps platform that can be used to understand and analyze “unstructured” data, today announced that it raised $45 million in a Series C round led by Tribe Capital, with participation from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), New Enterprise Associates and Spark Capital.
 The round values Instabase at $2 billion — double its previous valuation — and comes as the company looks to increase its investment in generative AI.
“At Instabase, we’ve built a platform that’s trusted by some of the most demanding global enterprises in some of the most highly regulated industries,” Anant Bhardwaj told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Instabase is a platform that enables organizations to apply the latest AI innovations to understand their unstructured data and build applications.”
Bhardwaj founded Instabase in 2015 while working on his PhD at MIT. The inspiration came from the gap he saw in the market for a platform where enterprise apps and data could be quickly built and deployed, he says.
At a high level, Instabase offers tools to help with content understanding. The platform processes documents and data companies can use for their operations, querying large corpora of files — e.g. academic papers, legal paperwork, financial data, etc. — at once.
Beyond this, Instabase delivers tools companies can use to deploy workflows for analyzing similar types of documents. For example, using Instabase, a customer could build an app to automate things like income and identify verification processes, invoice processing and receipt verification.
Companies can alternatively opt for pre-built apps from Instabase’s marketplace. There are apps for verifying a passport or driver’s license, cross-checking a person’s income, prefilling tax forms and more.
“Instabase continually identifies and evaluates emerging AI models and technologies for content understanding,” Bhardwaj said. “With the innovation in this space and multiple players entering the [generative AI] race, it will be critical for customers to leverage modular technologies that can quickly take advantage of the latest innovation.”
San Francisco-based Instabase, which has a workforce of close to 350 people, competes with both startups and incumbents like Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services and Azure, all three of which offer cloud-based, AI-powered document processing and workflow automation tooling. Bhardwaj, for his part, asserts that Instabase’s advantage is its ability to minimize the need for time-intensive — and often costly and labor-intensive — data science work.
For example, Bhardwaj says, companies using Instabase’s platform don’t have to fine-tune or train an AI model themselves to automate certain kinds of workflows or build apps. And they don’t have to annotate documents to get a model to learn to extract the sorts of data they might want.
One might argue that many of Instabase’s rivals are on a par, there. But that hasn’t prevented Instabase from attracting paying customers. Bhardwaj claims that four out of the top five U.S. banks use Instabase, as well as firms in the financial, insurance and consumer packaged goods industries.
Martin Casado, a general partner at a16z, had this to say via email:
“The market is going through a massive transformation and I believe companies that can build deeply integrated applied AI solutions will win. Instabase has consistently applied the latest innovation in AI to very difficult enterprise content understanding problems. We’re excited to continue to partner with Instabase as they take this technology and make it accessible to all segments of the market.”

How to approach customer discovery as an early-stage startup (and beyond)
Build a solid deck for your quarterly board meetings



Throughout my various stints as a CIO, I’ve had a number of opportunities to assist sales teams as they worked to land or close significant deals. But even more frequently, I was brought in to help with discovery — essentially determining whether a prospective customer was a good fit for our product.
In my experience, the sales teams that are most successful have a complete and well-established discovery playbook that allows them to determine whether a potential customer is the right customer for the organization to have at its current stage.
For fledgling startups, this is especially critical. New technologies are inherently fluid, and they require customers willing to make a long-term bet. Startups also have to move quickly and efficiently. The discovery process can’t be long and protracted, so its foundations must be sound.
Whether you’re pursuing customer number five, 50 or 500, the process of determining if there’s a fit remains largely the same. Here are some tips for approaching discovery in the early days and as your organization scales.
Start with key questions to determine fit
Determining whether your solution or technology is right for a prospective customer is critical. But it’s just as important to know whether that customer is a good fit for you. Questions to ask yourself might include:
 

			Whether you’re pursuing customer number five, 50 or 500, the process of determining if there’s a fit remains largely the same.					



Is your tech displacing an existing product? If so, there’s at least a logical fit from a solutions standpoint.
When was the last time they purchased new technology? As a startup, you don’t want to spend months going back and forth before deployment. You want your product in use and generating feedback.
Are they forward-looking? Some customers truly want to invest in cutting-edge technologies. Some are just going through the motions because it’s what their bosses expect. Others are just trying to learn or plan for the future. Figure this out early on.
Do they care enough about getting it right to spend the time and money required? New technologies necessitate ongoing investment and two-way participation to improve and evolve over time. Get a sense of how effective they would be as collaborators.
Have they been burned in the past? Some companies have a tremendous appetite for new technologies but have simply tried too many that haven’t worked. Find out what other technologies they’ve tested, what worked and what didn’t.
Are they the type of customer you’d want other prospects speaking to as a reference? If not, they’re not the ideal early customer. "

How to identify, interview and hire a head of growth for an early-stage startup
Don’t wait to identify your startup’s ideal customer personas



A bit of friction in your growth funnel is a good thing. In fact, I will go even further and declare that some amount of friction in this area is great!
One of the biggest misconceptions when it comes to user experience is that we must eliminate as many questions and barriers as possible to be the gold standard. That is a false conclusion. In fact, without even realizing it, most of today’s hottest startups have added friction to their onboarding flows to improve their users’ end experiences.
Most startups seek to avoid friction and look to pump their “vanity metrics,” especially signups. It is only later that firms learn that to retain users, the user experience must be personalized to induce their signups to keep jumping back in.
This is no different with B2B products, service-based industries or any other type of startup. Some friction is great and I’m here to show you the types of friction to consider, how to straddle the fine line between frictionless onboarding and excessively time-consuming onboarding, and the propensity metrics you will need to track.
 

			One of the biggest misconceptions when it comes to user experience is that we must eliminate as many questions and barriers as possible.					


Types of friction
There isn’t a manual that will show you where to add friction to your onboarding flow and growth funnel. Instead, this process involves exhaustive testing to perfect. To start, there are a few major types of friction to consider implementing:

Question-based
Setup-based
Waitlist-based

Below are some examples of how both startups and mature companies leverage friction to improve their users’ experience and north star metric.
Question-based friction
Canva, a graphic design platform that’s experienced explosive growth over the last few years, asks questions about why a user is signing up. Are they a student? A corporation?
This data allows Canva to preload the right templates that a student would find useful (presentations, study templates, etc.) versus what a corporation would need (posters, social media, etc.). What at first appears to be a simple onboarding question likely took multiple rounds of growth tests to perfect.
Outside of the onboarding experience, added friction in the form of questions can help startups with growth pillars such as lifecycle and retargeting. Keeping with the same example, now that Canva understands that user X is a student, they can retarget that user with ads centered around improving their grades and performance in school with Canva. Similarly, Canva can send out emails tailored specifically to this user who intends to use the product in their role as a student.
Question-based friction is especially vital for B2B startups who are seeking to narrow in on their ideal customers early on. Are they businesses of five employees in the marketing vertical or perhaps a business of 100 employees in the logistics vertical? These types of findings are expedited and can be tracked in the form of revenue per contract and lifetime value for each business vertical that signs.
Without these questions that add slight friction, it becomes increasingly challenging to double down on segments that can accelerate business growth.
Setup-based friction
LinkedIn has done a phenomenal job with setup-based friction, where they have users add a variety of details about themselves to create their profile. This creates a feeling of satisfaction and users will then desire to add their colleagues to show it off. "
"TechCrunch+ roundup: 10 questions to ask a VC, AI and antitrust, Japan investor survey",Walter Thompson,2023/06/06,"
The nature of my work isn’t cyclical: VC activity has slowed down dramatically this year, but I still keep pretty busy.
According to the National Venture Capital Association, deal count for seed-stage startups decreased 52% year over year in Q1 2023. When I saw that number, I couldn’t help but wonder: What are VCs doing with all their spare time these days?
For a seed-stage investor, this might be a great opportunity to learn a new language or do some traveling. For a seed-stage startup, however, this is a time to find out how much value your investors actually provide.

Despite the obvious power imbalance, founders need to know whether the people they’re getting into business with understand how to operate during a downturn, says Navin Chaddha, managing partner at Mayfield Fund.
In this article, he looks at different ways inception-stage investors and board members can support early-stage teams and includes a ten-question checklist that can help founders assess whether the VCs they’re talking to are a good fit.
“While it might seem daunting for founders to question potential investors in today’s climate, remember that you need to build a mutual zone of trust for the long journey,” he writes.

10 questions early-stage founders should be asking investors

How to prepare a hardware startup for raising a Series A

In recent months, two tech-friendly banks failed, the Fed raised interest rates, and SaaS startups started focusing on long-term profitability instead of short-term growth.
“The world we used to live in — the one that revolved around using cheap money to pump up ARR — is gone,” writes Champ Suthipongchai, co-founder and GP at Creative Ventures.
“So how can a hardware company raise a Series A amidst yet another ‘new normal’ in this post-low-interest-rate era?”

Competition concerns in the age of AI

There’s a lot of excitement about current and future use cases for AI-enabled technology, but are the companies boldly charging forth into this new world creating legal problems for themselves down the road?
According to attorneys Henry Hauser, Shylah Alfonso and Chris Williams from law firm Perkins Coie, using AI to develop pricing algorithms, make purchasing decisions, or set compensation could run afoul of federal and state laws regarding consumer protection and antitrust.
“By implementing policies and processes that preserve human control and accountability, organizations can minimize legal exposure and avoid unintended consequences,” they write.

Life insurance startup Getlife becomes Life5 and raises $10.7M,Romain Dillet,2023/06/06,"
Spanish startup Life5 has raised its third funding round and has been growing nicely since my previous post. The company also has a new name — it used to be called Getlife. In addition to its home country, Life5 now sells life insurance products in France.
After raising a €1 million pre-seed round and a €5.5 million seed round, Life5 recently raised a €10 million Series A round (that’s $10.7 million at today’s exchange rate). Existing investor Singular is investing once again, along with Mundi Ventures and Global Brain (Sony Financial Ventures).
Life5 started with a simple premise. Many people, for one reason or another, want to subscribe to a life insurance product. And yet, it’s often a painful process as insurance companies sometimes require medical exams. In other cases, they simply don’t want to insure you due to a preexisting condition or because you don’t fit the bill.
In order to modernize this industry, Life5 works with several insurance companies and simplifies the subscription process. Customers can sign up in a few minutes through Life5’s website. They only need to fill out a form.
The company’s underwriting engine can handle 700 illnesses and risk professions, which greatly increases the acceptance rate. The startup acts as a managing general agent and partners with insurers and reinsurers, such as Axa and CNP Assurances.
Depending on your age, your answers and your needs, Life5 will recommend a specific life insurance product to protect your loved ones in case you die suddenly. In Spain, you can insure a mortgage or leave a lump sum, for instance.
“At Life5 we want people to have access to fair and modern life insurance policies, with no small print. Our aim is to banish the idea that taking out life insurance is a complicated process, which is why we offer users the chance to purchase life insurance simply and quickly,” co-founder and CEO Guillermo Alén said in a statement. “This new round of financing will allow us to continue growing and revolutionise the life insurance sector by offering distinct solutions.”
While Life5 has already raised quite a bit of money, it is still a small player in the insurance industry, as only 9,000 families are currently covered by a Life5 insurance product.
In addition to the direct-to-consumer distribution channel, Life5 partners with brokers, agents and affiliates to distribute its products. After Spain and France, the company plans to expand to Germany and Portugal.

Announcing the final agenda for the Builders Stage at TechCrunch Disrupt,Richard Smith,2023/06/06,"
TechCrunch Disrupt, our flagship startup event, returns to San Francisco on September 19–21, and you can bet TechCrunch+ will be in the house.
It’s going to be the biggest and best Disrupt we’ve ever hosted: Along with a few to-be-announced surprises, we’ll have Startup Battlefield and six new stages with targeted materials for founders of all types.
With that in mind, I am very proud to announce the final agenda for the Builders Stage, which we teased a few weeks back.
If you went to Disrupt 2022, you’ll recall the TechCrunch+ Stage hosted dozens of panels and interviews focused on the nuts and bolts of building and funding new tech enterprises. This year, you’ll swing by the Builders Stage for more of the same great programming: We’ll be talking operations, hiring, fundraising and more, hitting on key topics for a new generation of startup founders.
And the TechCrunch+ lounge will make a return as well, so whether you’re busy taking notes inside or drinking coffee with the rest of us just outside, there will be a lot for you to do.
With excitement and pride, here’s what we have in store for you on what I predict will be the most whip-ass stage at the event. I’ll be hosting, and Equity will be kicking off the entire show.
See you soon at the 2023 Disrupt Builders Stage!

What Do You Need to Raise a Series A Today?
with Jennifer Neundorfer (January Ventures) and Loren Straub (Bowery Capital)
Gone are the days when you simply needed $1 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) to raise a Series A. Some startups have raised a Series A with a lot more, and we’ve seen many manage the same feat with far less in recent quarters. So before raising a Series A, how can a founder ensure their business has the right metrics and that their pitch is tuned for the current venture climate? If you’ve raised pre-seed or seed capital, this is a conversation you shouldn’t miss.
How to Build a New Venture Firm in Public
with Noramay Cadena (Supply Change Capital), Mac Conwell (RareBreed Ventures) and Turner Novak (Banana Capital)
Venture funds aren’t new, and neither are solo GPs. What is a fresh innovation in venture land, however, is building a new fund or firm in public. Some newer investors are as well-known for their online presence as for their investments. And that’s no diss: Raising capital is tough, and building a brand is no sin. Still, we want to know both the pros and cons of building something as complicated as a venture fund without a filter. Founders, there will be learnings for you as well, even if you are a few exits away from hanging up your spurs and taking the other side of the deal-making table.
How Founders Can Leverage a Soft Labor Market into a Competitive Edge
with Nick Cromydas (Hunt Club) and Samara Hernandez (Chingona)
It seems like it was just yesterday that the tech talent market was so hot that mega-corps hoarded staff to simply keep them off the market and out of the reach of their competitors. Today things are different: Layoffs are more common than hiring binges, and suddenly perks have a bad name. How can startups use a new, and perhaps more attractive, talent market to their advantage? Let’s find out.
When to Follow the Hype and When to Ignore It?
with Sophia Amoruso (Trust Fund, Business Class) and Sarah Kunst (Cleo Capital)
Chasing the next big thing is often a pretty good idea for founders and investors alike. But when folks are chasing the wrong trend, the hype can be more siren song than victory march. When should founders follow the hype? When should they ignore it? Let’s talk about it.
How to Construct an Equitable Cap Table
with Ashley Mayer (Coalition Operators), Amanda Robson (Cowboy Ventures) and Richie Serna (Finix)
Venture investors are no longer all located on the same road at the same time in the same city in the same state of the same country. They’re all over the world and are increasingly — if slowly — diverse across a host of metrics. How can founders construct an investor pool that reflects their values? In this discussion, we’ll dig into the brass tacks of building a truly equitable cap table.
How to Stretch Your Venture Dollars
with Anamitra Banerji (Afore Capital), Frédérique Dame (Google Ventures) and Rick Yang (NEA)
Cash is worth more this year than last year, and certainly more than the tech industry got accustomed to during the last venture supercycle. With the dollar now more powerful than ever, how should startups ensure that their raised capital — equity, debt, whatever floats your burn — goes as far as possible? After all, the more you can do before you need more cash, the higher a price you can charge in your next round.
How Founders with Nontraditional Backgrounds Can Use Their Experience to Excel
with Phaedra Ellis-Lamkins (Promise), Ruben Harris (Career Karma) and Ritu Narayan (Zūm) 
While the hoodie-wearing, twentysomething college dropout from a world-famous school still has their place in today’s startup founder makeup, they’re hardly the only sort of person raising big rounds and building hot companies. How can founders who don’t fit the Hollywood or HBO stereotype use their experiences to their benefit? We’ll find out in this highly anticipated panel.
When Should Founders Provide Early Liquidity to Retain Staff?
with Amir Ashkenazi (Switchboard), Maria Dramalioti-Taylor (Beacon Capital), and Tyson Hendricksen (Notice)
Look, we all want more IPOs. But they’re still far rarer than startups need them to be if they want to retain staff who want to see their hard-earned shares turn into something other than paper. So when should founders take a little pre-IPO liquidity as a treat, and when should they let staff do the same?
How to Build a Capital-Intensive Startup in a Tough Venture Market
with Sophie Bakalar (Collaborative Fund), Nikki Pechet (Homebound), and Chris Power (Hadrian) 
Every VC wants you to think that they’re bravely funding expensive hardware that will revolutionize the future. You know, space launches that use twigs, and satellites that can also zap aliens. That sort of thing. And then you read about new NFT fundraising. The good news is that even in a more conservative venture environment, it’s possible for founders to tackle big, hard and capital-intensive projects. Let’s talk about how it’s done.
How Founders Should Approach the TAM Question When Venture Capital Is Scarce
with Jomayra Herrera (Reach Capital), Helen Min (Phenomenal Ventures) and Monique Woodard (Cake Ventures)
Writing a good market slide is an art. You don’t want to oversell your total addressable market (TAM) and look silly, or post a number that’s too small to be exciting. Nailing TAM for both external pitching and internal planning is no small feat. Let’s dig into the matter with today’s more picky venture market in mind.
How to Build Intelligent Startup Ops that Will Scale with Your Business
with Naba Banerjee (Airbnb) and Asha Sharma (Instacart)
Lost amid glossy founder profiles and funding announcements are the nuts and bolts of scaling a startup’s internal operations. The real stuff that comes with building a scaling startup. From this panel, expect operational notes and tips that you can put to work to avoid known pitfalls and to generally kick maximum ass.
Why Bootstrapping Is No Longer a Dirty Word in 2023
with Erica Jain (Healthie), Carey Smith (Unorthodox Ventures) and Hussein Yahfoufi (Arta Finance)
It’s possible to build huge companies without venture money. So long as your startup brings in more cash than it burns, you’re in business. But bootstrapping in tech circles often carries negative connotations — phrases like “lifestyle business” are sometimes thrown around. But with many startups realizing that they aren’t going to be able to raise more money, perhaps it’s time to give bootstrapping another look?

Binder maker For Them is launching community for queer and trans folks,Haje Jan Kamps,2023/06/06,"
Meeting the needs, practical and emotional, of the queer, trans and nonbinary community is both sensitive and pressing. This is something that For Them, a genderqueer wellness company founded by Kylo Freeman, is leaning into.
“We started as a binder company,” said Freeman, For Them’s CEO, in an interview with TechCrunch. “Or at least that was our first product.”
For Them’s first binder was created in response to Freeman’s own need for a breast tissue compression garment that was effective, comfortable, and safe. For too long, trans people seeking to compress their breast tissue have been forced to resort to bandages or hacked-together products to meet their needs. These were not, however, conducive to good health or feeling confident in oneself; some are actively dangerous.
“The first productized chest binder was made essentially as a corset for the chest. This causes lots of issues,” explained Freeman. “Over time, people’s ribs were becoming cracked; their bodies were becoming deformed around this product. And more importantly, if you put one on you strap it to your chest, like you really struggle to breathe, which is the opposite of wellness.”
It was an important, but not necessarily easy, problem to solve.
“We were solving the very specific niche issue at the beginning of how do you solve for dysphoria,” said Freeman, “Make someone feel really well in their clothes and feel like themselves, but allow them to do it safely and with breath, and with fun, right walking around life.”
Freeman noticed how New York–based ballerina Misty Copeland had launched a product that held her breast tissue in place while she danced, which obviously meant that she could breathe and move freely while wearing it. For anyone needing a binder, the required product was similar, but different.
“I saw that, and I thought that is sort of the same technology as we need,” said Freeman. “Her product sort of holds up and ours pushes down, but ultimately, the idea that one can either move or manipulate breast tissue and still breathe is what I’m looking for.”
For Them’s first binder was developed in conjunction with designer Radha Shadick, using breathable, recycled materials, and a great deal of design knowledge.
“We have two layers in the garment,” said Freeman. “And they work against each other to create compression. And they have notches that pull inwards and downwards.”
Playground, the community platform
Having sold 40,000 units of the first version of the binder, For Them knew they had created a product that wasn’t just needed by the trans community, but that the community was also prepared to rally around. It has now launched Binder Max, which offers more compression but is designed to be worn for shorter periods of time than the original binder. Think: for parties, nights out, or photo shoots. The new binder was created in response to community feedback.
Listening to the needs of the queer community and providing what it asks for is at the heart of For Them’s mission. In order to listen better and give back better, it has now launched its own app-based community platform, Playground.
“The whole premise behind Playground is the idea that we’re responding to genuine need and an under-served audience in general,” says Em Chadwick, For Them’s chief operating officer, in an interview with TechCrunch. “The big challenge our community is facing is that it’s all being hacked together by finding ways to [queer-ify] existing heteronormative products and services or whatever to fit our way of being.”
For Them wants its Playground membership to go further than providing a feedback loop for necessary products for the queer community — and commercial opportunities for the company. Freeman says membership offers tangible rewards and access to new wellness tracking opportunities aligned to the trans community.
“Membership is the sticky glue of this,” said Freeman. “You pay a monthly cost to be one of our members. And with that you get discounted products. So any For Them products that come out and will continue to drop products every six weeks, will be discounted for members; they [also] have access to our chat rooms, and special features in the app that we’ve just built.”
The new products being offered every six weeks by For Them fall into three categories: innovation-focused utility products, lifestyle products such as candles or slogan T-shirts, and what they are describing as a “community play,” something similar to an artist-in-residency program where their designs can be printed onto T-shirts.
The wellness element of the app is based very much on tracking mental and bio indicators of its members’ mental health and gender expression.
“It’s like biometric tracking, but for a sense of self-identity and sexuality,” said Chadwick. “And I think right now, just even this idea of being able to facilitate understanding, insight, and leveraging data for people’s sense of self and identity is quite a new concept. People have been hacking mental health trackers and stuff in order to follow their gender journey and use of hormones. But for a company to be building tech specific to this audience is pretty new and exciting.”
The app allows people to track their euphoria, mood, and confidence, but it also has customizable tracking tags that users can adjust to their own needs and wants, enabling people to chart their own journeys.
“We have an algorithm, so essentially, you put this data in, it tracks it over the week, and then it spits it back out to you,” explained Freeman. “It says, this week, you’ve been feeling like this, I knew I did this, you felt like this. And it’s just sort of wanting to check in with internal sense of self, because I think that’s where well-being sits.”
The company says this is just the beginning of For Them’s wellness path and that it has a strong vision for what Playground can provide for the queer community.
“The vision is that eventually this will be used to give proactive solutions where the data is then used to help people make positive progress in whatever direction they plan to go,” said Chadwick, “Whether that’s like cultivating more joy, feeling more confident.”
For Them sees the future in Queer Social, and bringing together and strengthening the community. But for now, Freeman is intensely proud of the company and community they have created.

"Eric Schmidt backs Keeta, a startup working to make cross-border payments ‘as easy as Venmo’",Christine Hall,2023/06/06,"
Keeta, a new startup developing an instant and secure way to make cross-border payments, raised $17 million in funding from a group of investors led by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. The investment values the company at $75 million, according to Ty Schenk, founder and CEO of Keeta.
Schenk has been a software engineer since his teenage years, and much of his work prior to starting Keeta was building PayPal-like experiences in the cryptocurrency world. That kicked off his idea for the company and he started working on it in 2021.
Schenk explained that a traditional cross-border payment, for example, between the U.S. and Brazil is slow, and it’s difficult to calculate how much it will cost. The money may go through three or four “stops” at various banks before reaching the intended party. At each bank, there is a transfer fee collected and the money is verified, which could take a whole business day to complete.
“With Keeta, we want to make international payments as easy as Venmo,” Schenk told TechCrunch. “We want to make it very simple, very fast and we want to send your money where it’s going so you don’t have to worry about it.”
The team at Keeta built its platform from the ground up so it controls the whole process within its system. Fintechs and financial institutions can access Keeta via APIs or custom integrations.
The core technology is a proprietary ledger capable of processing more than 50 million transactions per second — something Schenk says is already operational — and a network of interconnected real-time payment rails. Thus, the company is able to offer money transfers across borders in seconds and for 50% to 70% less than the cost of traditional options, Schenk said.
Keeta’s strategy to fix cross-border payments is not new, in fact, it joins a crowded landscape of fintech companies developing similar approaches, like Stripe and PayPal, but also startups. For example, last week, NomuPay raised $53 million for its unified payments platform. Others, like Tazapay, Airwallex, Routefusion, UPI and PayNow, are also working on global platforms.
Schenk said payment transaction provider SWIFT is more closely related to his company, However, he noted that while Swift is “the de facto international wire,” it caters more to high-value payments, those over $1 million. Keeta’s target is payments under $1 million, which is an area with “a huge amount of opportunity,” Schenk added.
Meanwhile, Keeta launched Tuesday and is still in the very early stages of attracting customers. It is initially available by invitation in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Brazil, the United Kingdom and the European Union. The company has several revenue streams planned, including transaction fees.
Next up, while the company is focused on business-to-business payment transfers, it plans to launch a consumer-facing mobile app to enable instant transfers between friends and family worldwide.
“The next three to six months will largely be focused on working with early customers, making sure that we have things in place for what they need and getting us in a position where we can scale,” Schenk said.

Decentralized finance may be the answer to banking’s payment rails problem

Curri nabs $42M for its construction-focused last-mile logistics platform,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/06,"
In 2018, Matt Lafferty and Brian Gonzalez co-founded Curri, a tech platform focused on last-mile logistics for the construction industry. Their goal, they say, was to help customers, specifically distributors, save on operational costs and convert more sales — solving inefficiencies in construction along the way.
“Curri provides last-mile logistics for construction and industrial supplies,” Lafferty told TechCrunch via email. “By offering end-to-end logistics services and a nationwide elastic fleet, our customers can quickly and securely deliver complex loads ranging from heavy machinery to lighter loads such as pipes, pallets, large appliances and water heaters.”
Investors are evidently drawn to the concept, pouring $42 million into Curri’s Series B round that closed recently. (Bessemer Venture Partners led with participation from Initialized Capital, Brick & Mortar Ventures, Rainfall Ventures and others.) To date, Curri has raised $48.2 million in venture capital, which Lafferty says is being put toward product development, infrastructure and sales and marketing initiatives.


At a high level, Curri delivers on-demand, last-mile logistics for construction with a nationwide fleet of cars, trucks and flatbeds. Curri users arrange an order, open the Curri app and enter pickup and drop-off locations to book the service. Curri’s drivers then pick up the supplies and ensure the order is correct before fulfilling the delivery.

Curri offers live updates via the app to let customers follow and share the status of their deliveries. It also provides proof-of-delivery signature and photos for tracking and compliance purposes.
There are countless startups attempting to tackle the last-mile logistics problem, either from the software side, fleet side or both. For example, Fez Delivery, based in Lagos, operates on-demand hubs across Nigeria. Elsewhere, there’s HyperTrack, a startup creating APIs for freight order planning, assignment and tracking. Not to be outdone, Treggo is developing tech to make it easier for merchants to provide an Amazon-like service for their customers.
Curri’s focus on the construction industry sets it apart, Lafferty asserts, along with its ambitious product roadmap. The platform recently launched an API that allows companies to book vehicles on demand, from their tooling of choice, and plan routes that (in theory) reduce the number of unnecessary miles on the road.
Lafferty claims that Curri, which has a 110-person workforce, now accounts for “tens of thousands” of factors in matching orders with more than seven million delivery providers “within minutes.” Current customers include Sherwin-Williams, Johnstone Supply and United Rentals.
“The Curri platform provides unprecedented visibility into all aspects of the last mile supply chain, from real-time tracking to historical analytics and reporting, segmented down to the branch and customer level, giving the C-Suite the level of insight that they need to manage their business effectively,” Lafferty continued. “Macroeconomic headwinds and uncertainty only help Curri since we help our customers save money, increase sales, and reduce risk. Curri has grown revenue over the last year and has a line of sight to profitability.”

Hello’s founder is back with Config to make hardware development simpler,Catherine Shu,2023/06/06,"
Config is the software that founder James Proud wishes he had at his last startup Hello, maker of sleep tracker Sense. “Config would have been a lifesaver for us at Hello and had a massive positive impact on our team,” he told TechCrunch. The platform pulls together different elements of the hardware development process, ranging from CAD files to supply chain documents like bills of material and procurement tracking, so hardware team members can not only collaborate with each other more efficiently, but also with external vendors like suppliers and manufacturers.
Founded in 2019 by Proud, Config announced today it has raised $5 million in seed funding from angel investors including Twitter founder Biz Stone; Coatue chairman and former Facebook vice president Dan Rose; Future Positive founder Fred Blackford; former Stripe early employee and investor Lachy Groom; early Spotify investor Shakil Khan; Coda founder and former YouTube vice president Shishir Mehrotra; and Soleio Cuervo, Facebook’s second product designer and Dropbox’s former head of design.
Before starting Config, Proud, one of the first Thiel fellows, founded and ran Hello for five years, where it got backing from investors like Temasek and reached deals to sell at Best Buy and Target before shutting down in 2017.
When asked if Config would have helped keep Hello from shutting down, Proud said building a hardware company means “you constantly fight to avoid death by a thousand cuts. I saw how simple coordination mistakes in a build process could end up costing us thousands of dollars, weeks of delays and lead to a far higher opportunity cost of lost revenue.”
Proud drew on his experiences scaling both Hello’s hardware and software teams to create Config. “As our software team grew, I watched how they efficiently collaborated with tools such as GitHub and everyone was on the same page,” he said. “But as our hardware team grew, the complexity grew at an even faster pace, and there were no great software tools designed to help.”
As a result, teams had to add more processes, stand-up meetings, reviews and documents, all of which were necessary for shipping, but slowed down Hello’s work a lot.
Config helps hardware companies avoid the same issues by serving as a central platform to manage the entire lifecycle of building a hardware product. Its customers range from consumer hardware to large industrial machinery companies. The two that Config is currently disclosing publicly are Mill, the kitchen equipment maker, and Humane, which is building an AI hardware and software platform.
Proud explained that hardware teams have computer-aided design (CAD) programs, but beyond that, they have to rely on manual processes, like Google Sheets and Excel, to collaborate with one another and external vendors like suppliers and manufacturers.
“Building a physical product at scale is one of the most complex coordination challenges possible, both internally and externally, for a company. Currently, startups are forced to do this with terrible tools or none at all. It always felt wrong to me that a hardware company’s most significant cost center, the hardware team itself, had the least amount of money invested in software,” Proud said.
He added that one of the reasons tech giants like Apple can ship a new iPhone every year is their internal software, which helps their teams, supply chains and operations coordinate.
“With Config, we want to give every other company the same level of sophistication for managing their hardware design and build processes that a company like Apple has internally,” Proud said.

To do this, Config’s team carefully tapped into CAD programs’ existing APIs and built desktop tools that could easily be adopted by hardware engineers, so they don’t interrupt their current workflows. Another challenge is that each CAD program uses proprietary file formats, so Config spent a lot of R&D making sure they integrate smoothly into its platform. Config supports Solidworks and Siemens NX for mechanical CAD and Altium for electrical CAD, and has plans to integrate into other tools like Autodesk and KiCad.
To start using Config, companies that don’t have existing processes can begin with best practices like part numbering, revisioning and release management. If they have processes in place already, they can import them directly into Config, including part numbering schemes and a set of bills of material.
Proud said Config’s competitors are the various software tools hardware teams cobble together to collaborate, like spreadsheets, Google Drive and Dropbox. With Config, they can share documents on Config’s desktop app, instead of through Google Drive or Dropbox, which often leads to confusion about which part is the plan of record of what to build. They can also see what their colleagues have in the works, similar to how a software engineering team would use GitHub.
For Mill and Humane, Proud said Config has helped them work with outside partners more efficiently. For example, instead of sending design files through email for feedback and modification, Humane onboarded their overseas manufacturer onto Config. This meant they were able to work with them more closely, as if they were also engineers at Humane.
As Config grows, Proud said its development will be less focused on the types of products it helps teams build, and more on the sizes of the teams. “The challenges of supporting a 50- to 200-person team are undoubtedly different from a 10,000-person hardware team,” he said. “So far, we have been bringing near-whole companies onto Config. Still, as we work with larger companies, we will start working with individual product lines before spreading across the entire organization.”
Proud said that Config decided against raising large sums at high valuations during the fundraising craze of 2021-2022. Instead, the startup kept a small team and focused on solving the problems their customers face on a daily basis. The new funding gives Config ample runway, but Proud said it remains focused on generating revenue from clients.
“It is important to acknowledge that hardware founders and their teams are heroes in our minds. Creating a physical product out of nothing is one of the most terrifying, challenging and rewarding things to do,” said Proud. “With software, there is close to zero cost of experimentation, but in hardware, you have to make big choices and live with them.”

"BOND brings inspirational-driven approach to livestream shopping, raises $2M",Christine Hall,2023/06/06,"
Livestream shopping may not be as popular in the U.S. as it is in other parts of the world, but BOND founders Maddie Raedts and Sam Robinson believe they’ve cracked the code with an inspiration-driven shopping platform that focuses on creator influence rather than product-led.
To Raedts and Robinson, “inspiration-driven” means taking a creator and content-first approach to livestream shopping and putting the “creator in the driver’s seat and at the forefront of the experience,” Robinson said. BOND offers a place where creators can connect with their audience in a more interactive way and then with a frictionless shopping experience.
“BOND connects creators, brands and consumers across more premium lifestyle categories,” CEO Raedts told TechCrunch. “For the first time, there is a platform that aligns all incentives and is the missing piece of the puzzle that hasn’t been there before. Based on the amazing traction that we’ve already been getting from our creators and our brands, the hunger is there for something to happen in this space.”
Prior to starting the company in 2022, Raedts, who has a background in influencers, fashion and beauty, was founder and former chief creative officer at influencer agency IMA, which was acquired by S4 Capital in 2019. Robinson has an operations background and previously spearheaded the North American rollout of Soho House’s Soho Works and worked in operations and strategy for WeWork’s expansion into Japan.

Whatnot’s valuation doubles to $3.7B as livestream shopping gains popularity in US

The company launched its platform Tuesday with over 65 creators and 50 brands already enrolled. Some of the creators include Valeria Lipovetsky, Kit Keenan, Allegra Shaw and Alyssa Lynch. Together, those initial creators have an audience reach of over 35 million, Robinson said in an interview.
Attracting new customers has become more difficult in recent years amid privacy regulations and new technology that has increased the cost of acquisition. So much so that Business of Fashion reported that “brands spent more than three times the amount to acquire each customer in 2022 than in 2013.”
BOND is in a crowded space that is working to solve this problem. The space includes social media giants, like TikTok and YouTube; retailers like Walmart; and commerce tech companies, including NTWRK, WhatNot, PopShop Live, ShopThing, Upmesh, buywith, Firework and Drip. Others, like Instagram, started livestream shopping, then decided to shutter those programs when they didn’t rise in popularity.
It also means that creators and brands have to get creative. Traditional marketplaces have creators sharing their story on social media and then selling on separate platforms. With BOND, creators can engage with consumers via either live content or prerecorded content that continues to sell as long as the product is available, Raedts said. Shoppers can check out creator profiles and product discovery.
On the back side, BOND manages data insights and post-purchase operations, including logistics, customer service and returns. In addition, APIs connect to a brand’s real-time inventory so the brand can utilize BOND as a new sales channel.
In terms of revenue, BOND gets a small take rate from brands on each product sold on the platform, a portion of which goes to the creators.
“The creators are incentivized to sell products to their audiences,” Robinson said. “The brands are incentivized to participate in the platform because they see it as a new channel. And shoppers are incentivized because they have a new way to discover products and be inspired.”
The launch follows a $2 million pre-seed investment that closed earlier this year. Nordstar led the round that included participation from Day One Ventures, Nomad Capital and a group of individual investors, including Daniel Gutenberg, Intermix founder Khajak Keledjian, Magic Mind founder James Beshara and Mint House CEO Christian Lee.
The company plans on using the new funding on product development, hiring additional employees and on overall growth.
“We are definitely heads down on launching and making our product really great,” Raedts said. “New features will be released on a regular cadence that focus on enhancing the shopper, brand and customer experiences. You’ll see personalization of the data and a loyalty and rewards program. Long-term, we see BOND as the ultimate destination for discovery, entertainment and commerce by making BOND part of people’s everyday lives.”

OurX adds tech spin to Black hair care regimen,Christine Hall,2023/06/06,"
Ceci Kurzman has spent much of her career building and investing in brands and serving as one of the few Black female board members for companies, including Lanvin, Revlon and Warner Music+.
While investing on behalf of some clients interested in beauty and personal care, Kurzman saw a gap in what kinds of products were available for multicultural groups and decided to do something about it.
“I started looking for sort of a best-in-class, high-performance business that was direct-to-consumer and used all the business model innovations that were table stakes at that point, like e-commerce, personalization, clean, data driven, inclusive and sustainable, and I couldn’t find anything even close,” Kurzman told TechCrunch. “When I couldn’t find something to invest in, I went out and put together groups who targeted a demographic that was professional millennial, avid consumers, and we polled 30,000 of them, and we found 60% weren’t getting what they wanted and still felt stuck.”
Out of that research came OurX, the latest company entering the Black hair care industry, currently valued at $2.51 billion. The company’s proprietary technology taps into six years of research and data mining to create hair regimens and education for the scalp and tightly textured hair.
The first step is to take the four-step hair assessment that asks about your hair’s health, the kind of styling and treatments you do, your daily routine and your lifestyle. At the end, it presents a regimen of products, a hair coach and peer community to best help you utilize the products. It also includes a series of guided at-home video-based tests to provide an even-more accurate read on their hair and scalp attributes. Throughout the entire assessment experience, users receive feedback and educational tips based on the inputs they provide.
OurX founder Ceci Kurzman (Image Credits: Lisa Houlgrave Photography) and CEO Meghan Maupin (Image Credits: Ourx for Maupin).
OurX has seven products currently, and the average regimen of products offered is between $115 and $130. One-on-one access to hair coaches is available through a subscription.
The product regimen is influenced by a group of experts, including dermatologist Jenna Lester, celebrity hair stylist Johnny Wright and hairstylist Cataanda James.
Along with the launch, OurX announced that it has a new CEO, Meghan Maupin. Maupin, an MIT graduate, previously founded personalized skincare brand, Atolla, which was acquired by Function of Beauty in 2021.
“When I dove deeper into haircare, I saw that there’s actually a huge need for personalization, for this consumer in particular,” Maupin said in an interview. “For consumers with textured hair it’s not one-size-fits-all, but is actually much more complex in terms of what’s needed for the day-in and day-out.”
Like Kurzman, Maupin went into the beauty industry to change things, noting that she saw “a lot of things in beauty that were broken,” and with her background in data and technology, knew that she could fix some of those issues.
Meanwhile, OurX also launched with a $2.5 million seed round led by Reign Ventures.
“We were very intentional to have a diverse cap table so to be able to pick and design our cap table was really important,” Kurzman said. “We wanted investors who understood the mission, understood the need and understood the market. We’re lucky that we’ve been able to fund this round primarily with women and women of color, and there’s some allies in there, too.”

At 0.69% in Q1, the dip in funding for Black founders ‘no longer evokes an emotional response’

"How Evroc plans to build sovereign, hyperscale data centers in Europe",Paul Sawers,2023/06/05,"
While cloud computing has transformed just about every industry on Earth, a burgeoning backlash has led some businesses to seek alternatives to the Big Tech-dominated public cloud. Vendor lock-in, spiraling costs, security concerns and a lack of control over how their data is processed are just some of the reasons companies might retreat from cloud-first strategies.
For European companies specifically, a growing digital sovereignty agenda has led the likes of AWS, Microsoft and Google to focus their efforts on bringing granular data controls and storage closer to their customers, while consumer juggernauts such as TikTok have had to invest significant resources in localizing their infrastructure.
But for many, such measures don’t go far enough — a data center might well be located in Europe, but it’s still controlled by a company headquartered thousands of miles away. And that is why a new Nordic startup is launching out of stealth today with €13 million ($14 million) in funding as it looks to build fully localized, hyperscale data centers across Europe.
Founded in 2022 by serial entrepreneur Mattias Åström, Evroc is aiming to establish an inaugural pilot data center in the Stockholm region next year, with plans for eight data centers — and three software development hubs — by 2028. The ultimate mission, according to the company, is to create Europe’s “first secure, sovereign, and sustainable hyperscale cloud,” and end the “foreign dominance of the European cloud market.”
The company’s €13 million cash injection, with backers including EQT Ventures and Norrsken VC, will go some way toward helping Evroc achieve its lofty mission — but building data centers from scratch is a fairly capital intensive endeavor. This is why Åström says Evroc is planning to raise an additional €3 billion in equity, debt and “various sources of public funding” to get its first two data centers off the ground. “The first one will be established in 2025,” Åström told TechCrunch.
In terms of locations, details are not yet set in stone, but the first two will be split across Northern and Southern Europe, with the next six likely to be anywhere in the European Union.
“The location will be determined though a site-selection process that we will initiate in the coming year,” Åström explained. “The decision will be based on a number of factors including access to renewable energy, engineering talent, capital and support from public authorities. We have not excluded the U.K., but initially we are looking at the EU as our primary market.”
Of course, data centers also require a significant amount of power, something that Åström says they plan to address with “next-generation energy-efficient technologies,” namely something known in industry parlance as “eco load balancing,” which it will offer to customers on an opt-in basis.
“Data and workloads will flow seamlessly between Evroc’s data centers to where renewable energy is most readily available and affordable,” Åström continued. “This, in combination with other investments in energy efficiency, will allow us to build the world’s cleanest cloud from day one.”
Scrutiny
The timing of Evroc’s launch is notable, coming amid heightened scrutiny of the European cloud market. In mainland Europe, Microsoft has faced criticism from rivals (including AWS and smaller European competitors) for using its dominance in business software to tether customers to its Azure cloud platform, though settlement discussions are currently underway to avert formal antitrust procedures. And the U.K. is currently mulling anti-competition maneuvers over how AWS and Microsoft make it difficult for companies to switch cloud providers.
All this serves to highlight the growing tensions between Europe and U.S. Big Tech. And, coupled with the “digital sovereignty” push underway in Europe, this could position a young cloud upstart favorably. On top of that, Evroc is pitching its local development and R&D efforts as a major differentiator to its deep-pocketed rivals, arguing that this will help create significant jobs across the continent.
“If you look at the major cloud companies today active in Europe, their data centers themselves do not create many jobs, but their development and R&D do — in other parts of the world,” Åström said. “We think this is a core skill for Europe to have in Europe, and we want to enable a European ecosystem for cloud development.”
Indeed, physical data centers are only one facet of Evroc’s plans — the company’s product development and R&D hubs will serve as the foundation to its network of servers, and is where it hopes to hire some 3,000 people in the coming years.
“This is where the majority of our employees will sit, and it is something that Europe has been missing out on to a large extent, given that most of the development connected to cloud takes place in other parts of the world,” Åström added.
This all sounds great in principle, but there’s no escaping the Herculean undertaking involved in building a cloud infrastructure business from scratch, and taking on the trillion-dollar behemoths from the other side of the Atlantic. But Åström is convinced the opportunity, will and regulatory support exists to do just that.
“Given the uncertainty surrounding U.S. authorities having access to European data, there are a lot of European companies, such as banks, hospitals and tax authorities, that cannot put their data in the cloud,” he said. “Instead, their only option is to put their data in their own, very inefficient and unsustainable, on-premise server halls. We want to provide them with an alternative to that. We also think we have an advantage in starting without any legacy compared to the established cloud companies.”
It’s worth noting that there are already some home-grown cloud computing options already, including France’s OVHcloud, but Åström is quick to stress that his company is tackling the problem completely afresh — with “hyperscale” at the root of its business. This basically means at least 100,000 servers in a single data center, and a combination of hardware and software to store and manage data at scale.
“The traditional European providers come from a different type of legacy and business strategy, offering web hosting, domains, bare metal, etc., and have not really had the same scale as the global cloud providers,” Åström said. “We want to build Europe’s first truly hyperscale cloud.”

Escape dynamically scans APIs to find security flaws,Romain Dillet,2023/06/05,"
French startup Escape has raised a $3.9 million (€3.6 million) funding round shortly after ending Y Combinator’s winter 2023 cohort. The company provides a cybersecurity product focused on securing APIs before they are rolled out publicly.
French VC firm Iris is leading the round with Frst also participating once again after leading the pre-seed round. Existing investors Irregular Expressions, Tiny Supercomputers and Kima Ventures are participating in the round. Some of the company’s angel investors include Philippe Langlois, Mehdi Medjaoui and Roxanne Varza.
“We decided to create a custom algorithm powered by artificial intelligence that can simulate cyberattacks. Once it has found security flaws, it will give you remediations,” co-founder and CEO Tristan Kalos told me. He founded the startup with Antoine Carossio, and there are now 10 people working for Escape.
In more technical terms, Escape is an agentless solution as it integrates directly in your development pipeline. Every time the dev team commits some new lines of code in the code repository, it will trigger Escape using an integration in the continuous integration/continuous delivery flow (CI/CD).
For instance, Escape can identify an issue with rate limiting. That means that a bad actor could leverage this flaw to extract large volumes of data. Escape can also see if invalid actions are properly blocked to prevent data manipulation. It integrates with Snyk so that Escape issues appear in your Snyk’s code issues.
“These are dynamic tests. We don’t test the source code itself, but rather the application as it runs. What’s complicated with an API is the business logic — how to interact and how to attack the API. We use reinforcement learning, a mix of deep learning and heuristics,” Kalos said.
Escape first decided to focus on GraphQL APIs as the startup identified that it would be the best go-to-market strategy. But the company is currently rolling out support for REST APIs, which are more widespread than GraphQL-based APIs.
The company has already convinced around 20 clients, such as Sorare, Shine and Neo4J. As you can see, Escape wants to focus on bigger clients working in sensitive industries, including banks and financial services companies. Each contract could potentially be worth tens of thousands of euros per year.
Before Escape, making sure that your company’s APIs were secured was mostly a manual process. Every now and then, big companies work with security analysts to conduct a penetration test (or pentest, for short).
“Once or twice a year, they come in, look at everything that’s going on and hand you a security report. Companies review the findings internally and list the issues: we’ve got to resolve this, we’ve got to resolve that,” Kalos told me.
But then, companies have to find the developers who are in charge of this specific part of the product or that API in particular. In other words, it’s a reactive and imperfect process.
Escape doesn’t want to replace pentests altogether. Pentests don’t just focus on APIs either, they are much larger than that. Escape just wants to surface security flaws at the API level so that they are fixed when they first appear. This way, most issues are already fixed when a security firm conducts a pentest. It’s a more proactive and dynamic security model, and that could be a nice selling point.

Sensi.AI and Flint Capital speak on developing and deploying AI solutions in healthcare,Kyle Wiggers,2023/06/05,"
Remotely monitoring customers without violating their privacy is a challenging task. But one co-founder believes that she’s cracked the code.
On a recent episode of TechCrunch Live, TC’s weekly event designed to help founders build better venture-backed businesses, Romi Gubes, the CEO of Sensi.AI, spoke about how she built a company that uses audio-based AI software to detect and predict anomalies that can impact the health of those receiving in-home care.

Gubes, a software engineer by training who’s worked at Fortune 500 companies, including Cisco, Dell and Vonage, says that she was inspired to found Sensi.AI after an episode of abuse in her daughter’s daycare center.
“It was one of the things in life that really changes your life,” she said. “And I wanted to leverage my technological background in order to help those vulnerable individuals be safe in any kind of care environment.”
That turned her on to the massive shortage of in-house care professionals in the U.S., as well as the effects that “aging in place” without the proper infrastructural support can have.
“As most of you know, as time goes by, there are more and more older adults and less younger people that can potentially take care of them,” Gubes said. “Very soon, I understood how big the pain in the senior care industry is.”
Image Credits: Sensi.AI
Sensi.AI, founded in 2018, grew rather quickly, scaling today to 70 employees across two countries — the U.S. and Israel — and to customers in 37 states serving thousands of individuals. Along the way, Sensi.AI raised $25 million from investors, including Sergey Gribov, a general partner at Flint Capital and a board member at Sensi.AI, who joined the TC Live discussion.
Bolstered by the pandemic, the market for remote care monitoring solutions is quite large. So how did Sensi.AI manage to stand out from the crowd? Gubes attributes it to the company’s differentiated technology, which uses a combination of AI and audio monitoring to detect key events in and around clients’ environments.
Sensi.AI spent years collecting data from the field to train its AI system. To date, the company has captured more than 10 million caregiver interactions from tens of thousands of people throughout the U.S., Gubes claims.
“For example, we know to detect if a caregiver has a specific problem with transitioning the older adult from bed to the chair, where this is a huge risk factor for both of them, actually,” she explained. “We’re more focused on the prevention layer in order to really allow professionals to act before something’s happening.”
But what about privacy — both the privacy of the clients and of the caregivers?
Gubes pointed out that Sensi.AI doesn’t use cameras for monitoring, unlike some of its competitors. On top of that, the system is compliant with HIPAA — the major medical records privacy bill in the U.S. — and anonymizes data so that the audio data isn’t tied to any individual being monitored.
That contributed to Sensi.AI’s funding success as well, according to Gribov. But the pandemic arguably played a larger role.
“When the pandemic hit, many caregivers weren’t able to get to the homes of the older adult and really serve them, and older adults stayed at home by themselves,” Gubes said. “And this is where the need for solutions such as Sensi was very, very clear.”
Image Credits: Sensi.AI
One might assume that Sensi.AI’s grand ambition is to replace care workers entirely. But Gubes asserts that this isn’t the case. In fact, she thinks it isn’t feasible from a technical standpoint — and won’t be for the foreseeable future. She hopes, rather, that Sensi.AI can grow into a care tool that clinicians — and even children of older adults — can use to keep track of what’s going on in the home of a vulnerable patient.
“We can make their work much more efficient, and to get them make better decisions,” Gubes said.

Can Medicare save the insurtech market?
For startups choosing a platform, a decision looms: Build or buy?



The payments industry is on the cusp of a revolution.
Thanks to the Federal Reserve’s new instant payments initiative FedNow, transactions will soon be faster, more secure and more cost-effective than ever before. This initiative promises to benefit consumers, small businesses and banks of all sizes. As such, given its potential to completely overhaul the way we make payments in the years to come, many opportunities, as well as challenges, are likely to arise.
Say hello to the tax man
The IRS estimates that nearly two-thirds of income goes unreported due to a lack of third-party reporting. A significant portion of small and mid-size businesses (SMBs), which are highly dependent on hourly workers, typically handle payments via cash and, similarly, consumers do the same with many of their everyday service providers (i.e., gardeners, dog walkers, etc.). The key factor contributing to this is independent contractors’ reliance on instantaneous payments.
 

			The Fed’s initiative has opened up a window for innovation, the effects of which could be realized as early as next year.					


With the advent of FedNow, contractors can now get paid immediately, specifically via ACH, which will result in many transactions moving away from cash as the primary medium of payment. Yet, while this is cause for celebration among independent contractors, increased transaction traceability brings with it increased tax reporting requirements and liabilities.
Moving forward, we foresee a heightened focus on assisting independent contractors with tax management navigation, as well as financial planning.
Main Street can now compete with Wall Street
Smaller financial institutions like community banks can now offer the same level of service as larger banks or modern fintech companies and support further migration to online banking. In effect, this could reduce the need for physical locations, due to the reduction of check flow and improve the margin profile for these smaller financial institutions that have historically shouldered the cost of a large retail footprint.
Given the absence of risk in overdrawing one’s bank account or paying overdraft fees (as banks verify fund levels before initiating instant payments), this will greatly diminish the costs that banks currently incur for settlement fees and fund verification. "

10 questions early-stage founders should be asking investors
Mayfield’s Navin Chaddha: I’ve looked at clouds from both sides now



When I wrote this post in August 2021, we were at the peak of exuberance in VC investing and startup valuations. I bemoaned the decline in early-stage investing and feared that innovation would suffer as a result of it.
The VC industry is turning back to its roots of investing at the early stage, although activity is still dramatically lower, with Q1 US 2023 data showing a 53% decrease in deal value and a 52% decrease in deal count at the seed stage year over year. Similarly, we’re seeing a 60% decline in deal value and a 47% decrease in deal count at the early stage of investing year over year. While I welcome this focus back to early-stage investing, I am sorry that it has come at the cost of hundreds of thousands of layoffs and continued challenges for startups.
However, I am sounding another note of caution today. As a pure inception-stage firm that has partnered with founders for more than five decades and guided over 225 companies to successful exits (including 120 IPOs and over 225 acquisitions), I know that early-stage investing is a craft that is honed over time, not a hobby or tourist destination.
 

			While it might seem daunting for founders to question potential investors in today’s climate, remember that you need to build a mutual zone of trust for the long journey.					


Similar to a master chef or carpenter, the ability to work closely with founders at the fragile stage of company formation until they bake the perfect soufflé or build a bespoke coffee table takes time, skill and patience.
It may not be the right mode for every investor and is best pursued by those who believe that company building is a marathon, not a sprint. In an era where everyone’s dollars are green (albeit with fewer floating around today), I believe it is important to help founders with ways to evaluate investors before committing to a partnership.
Let me share some specific examples of what it means to be a “roll-up-your-sleeves” inception-stage investor:

A semiconductor company with a breakthrough chip for cooling devices is evaluating where to establish its first beachhead. Over a multiday whiteboard session, we work with the founders to go beyond the obvious and attractive large market of smartphones to settle on the smaller market of surface devices as their initial entry point. This is informed by our experience in working with other inception-stage chip companies, as we know how long it takes to go from design to tape-out, and then to scale production to fulfill the needs of hundreds of millions of customers.
A consumer fashion marketplace has ignited the love of its community of seller stylists, but its e-commerce infrastructure is breaking down. Its CEO has just raised a round of financing based on growth projections but now tells the board that they need to slow down to strengthen the platform. In a growth-at-all-costs environment, the inception-stage investor, a former three-time serial entrepreneur, knows that the journey often takes a decade or more for a successful outcome. Consequently, we are willing to support the CEO in a slower growth plan, knowing it is so that they can build a sustainable marketplace platform. "
6 investors explain why they are bullish about Japan’s startup scene despite an uncertain economy,Kate Park,2023/06/05,"
Thinking of Japan often evokes notions of bleeding-edge tech mixed with deep tradition and culture. The country’s startups, however, haven’t seen the sort of growth that upstart tech companies in other parts of the world have. There are signs that those tides are turning, though, with startup funding increasing along with the number of active domestic venture capital firms. The Japanese government has also promised enthusiastic support to boost the startup ecosystem in an effort to ramp up annual startup investments tenfold to 10 trillion yen ($71.5 billion) by 2027.
2022 was a record year for the Japanese VC market, in stark contrast to global VC investments trending downward. Even in the first quarter of 2023, Japanese VC investment slightly increased owing to active seed and Series A funding deals; but later-stage funding was tough for startups, per a report by KPMG.
Gen Isayama, co-founder and CEO of World Innovation Lab, said this might be because “most of Japan’s startups are early-stage startups that tend to be isolated from periods of economic uncertainty and downturns — a function of being seven to 10 years from the time of the IPO.”
Startups in Japan received 877.4 billion yen ($6.2 billion) in 2022, up from 850.8 billion yen ($6 billion) in 2021, per a recent report by Initial. The amount of funding raised by Japan-based startups was estimated at $625 million in 2013, the report said. To put this in context, startups in New York alone raised $2.9 billion in 2013.
We spoke to investors who actively invest in Japanese startups to get a better understanding of how the startup scene in Japan has changed from before and after the pandemic and their following plans.
The money managers are optimistic despite uncertain macroeconomics, which could have a limited impact on Japan’s startup ecosystem, and geopolitical risks between the U.S. and China, which could benefit Japan. However, they pointed out that later-stage funding would still be challenging for startups in the country in 2023.
“The decline is happening in all markets [in the world] and at all stages … the impact on Japan is somewhat limited, but it is also true that Japan is a smaller market compared to its GDP and should be growing much more,” said the CEO of Sony Ventures Corporation Gen Tsuchikawa.
“There have been two things that have benefited Japan recently. One is that the rising concerns around China have caused investors to look at neighboring Japan as a more predictable alternative,” said James Riney, founding partner and CEO of Coral Capital. “Another is Warren Buffet’s investment in and endorsement of Japan. Many investors seemed to be listening to the Oracle of Omaha and locking in on Japan’s opportunities.”
Although global macroeconomics doesn’t help at this time, Japan is gearing up to accelerate its startup scene.
“We expect the amount of funding to increase with the government’s support,” said Tsuyoshi Ito, CEO of Beyond Next Ventures. “The Japanese government has designated 2022 as the ‘First Year of Startup Creation’ and announced a five-year plan to foster startups, which includes a record amount of approximately 1 trillion yen in startup support measures.”
“Large Japanese corporations have slowed down quite a bit in recent years. Startups and their innovation can help boost the Japanese economy one more time,” said Anis Uzzaman, founder and chief executive of Pegasus Tech Ventures. “… the current government’s initiative can help the country prepare and get ready for the next challenge and give birth to lots of startups.”

We’re seeing a significant drop in VC funding in Asia’s first quarter this year. How has your VC investment strategy changed along with the market condition? 
Our strategy has not shifted per se. Yes, the market is slowing down, but the top companies will always have something to offer. For example, according to the STARTUP DB ranking, the top 10 Japan deals in Q1’23 raised more money (59.2 billion yen) than the top 10 deals in Q1’22 (53.1 billion yen). Even during the VC funding boom, we were strategic and cautious and tried to pursue companies with what we found to be good intrinsic value instead of paying inflated valuations, and we plan on doing that going forward as well.
What caused the lowest funding in Asia since 2021? Do you think the VC funding will continue to decline this year? What are your prospects regarding funding volumes in Asia in 2023 and 2024? Do you expect it will bounce back anytime soon? 
We are facing increasing uncertainty around the world. The rise in geopolitical risks, such as the Ukraine invasion and all-time high U.S.-China tensions, as well as increasing interest rates and uncertainty about economic stability, are all leading people and firms across the board to be more cautious about how they deploy their money.

Revenge of the mutual funds,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/05,"

Listen here or wherever you get your podcasts.
Hello and welcome back to Equity, the podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.
Our Monday show covers the latest in tech news from the weekend and what’s making headlines early in the week. This fine Monday we are celebrating the start of June, and the fact that there are still earnings rounds for us to cover and enjoy! Here’s the show rundown:

Stocks are mixed around the world this morning while crypto stays pretty flat. Earnings this week that we’re excited about include GitLab, Couchbase, Yext, Smartsheet and HashiCorp. (We’re also keeping an eye on the Atomic Wallet hack.)
Reddit’s proposed API changes (charges, more like) are having a pretty big impact on the service’s userbase; there are calls for a blackout of certain forums in response to the proposed updates. Reddit, on the other hand, is a business and needs to make money.
Sticking to social media, news broke this morning that Twitter’s revenues are down sharply compared to year-ago totals, at least when we consider its American advertising incomes. Twitter does more than just ads in North America, but given that it’s likely a pretty big chunk of its total top line, it’s not good news.
Canva’s valuation was slashed by a mutual fund (something that we have seen a lot lately), the latest in a string of similar headlines for other unicorns.
Closing, WWDC is today. Get. Hype.

"For startups, growth still trumps cloud cost control",Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/04,"
There’s room for startups to cut their cloud costs, even if they have to balance the implicit costs of doing so, such as the time required and the potential for slower development. The question then becomes: How much of a priority is finding incremental savings for young tech companies?
A recent survey of founders by TechCrunch+ indicates that a change in investor expectations is spurring startups to take a closer look at their cloud spending and move away from a position more focused on speed than cost efficiency — just not too much.
The changing economy and the resulting impact on both venture capital availability and the price of money keeps showing up in our investigative work. Put another way, rising interest rates are having a knock-on effect on cloud spending at tech companies, and therefore, slowing growth at public cloud incumbents.
TechCrunch+ also recently asked startup founders if new startups should pursue a multicloud strategy. They answered mostly in the negative, with some caveats regarding edge cases.

5 cloud investors illustrate the various paths ahead for startups

This morning, we have a sheaf of perspectives to digest, building off our work in late 2022 aiming to understand how startups picked their first major cloud provider and why.
Finding fat to trim
Last year, Boldstart Ventures partner Shomik Ghosh told TechCrunch+ that for startups still “in early product or go-to-market stages, optimizing cloud spend should be the last thing on a founder’s mind besides utilizing as much cloud resource credits as possible.” "
Inside Stripe’s latest moves,Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/06/04,"
Welcome back to The Interchange! If you want this in your inbox, sign up here. While there is always a lot going on in the world of fintech, this week felt a little subdued overall — at least when it came to funding rounds. But there was definitely still other fintech news to cover, and we’ll dive into it here.
Stripe has been busy
Stripe made headlines more than once this week as it acquired a (non-fintech!) startup and announced an expansion of its issuing product into credit.
In each case, I covered the news exclusively, which helped give me some insight into the fintech giant’s motivations behind each move.
Let’s start with the acquisition. Stripe picked up Okay, a startup that developed a low-code analytics software to help engineering leaders better understand how their teams are performing. Okay is a small startup, with just seven employees, that over time had raised $6.6 million from investors such as Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins after graduating from Y Combinator’s Winter 2020 cohort. I didn’t talk to Stripe directly about the deal but Okay’s co-founder and CEO Antoine Boulanger told me that “by increasing engineering effectiveness, Stripe will be better positioned to attract and retain talented engineers.” It also presumably will be in a better position to compete in an increasingly crowded space.
In other words, Stripe deciding to acquire a startup that helps engineering leaders build performance dashboards to gauge how their teams are doing feels like the company is very serious about making sure its own engineering team is working effectively enough to not only move faster, but also be more productive. I found it interesting that one of Okay’s customers is Stripe competitor Plaid. Or I should say was. Of course, now Okay will be folded into Stripe’s engineering team and will no longer serve outside customers.
Stripe also announced this week its plans to give companies the ability to create and distribute virtual or physical charge cards that allow their customers to spend on credit rather than using the funds in their accounts.
“Among our suite of products, Issuing [which it launched in 2018] has been doing really, really well,” Denise Ho, Stripe’s head of product for BaaS, told TechCrunch. “And the No. 1 top demand within Issuing has been the ability for Stripe to enable our platforms to offer credit to their users.”
This has a twofold benefit for Stripe — giving it a new revenue stream as well as the option to offer new financing capabilities to their customers “with little additional operational cost,” Stripe touts. It also gives companies like Ramp and Karat, among others, the ability to give their clients access to credit at a time when credit may not be as easy to come by.
Ho also told me that Stripe has worked hard to make sure all its products work well together. For example, she said, its Issuing product is built on top of its Connect offering so customers “don’t have to KYC every single [one] of the thousands of businesses on their platform.”
“And when these businesses need to pay you back for, say, the couple [grand] they spent last month, they can use Stripe Invoicing and Stripe payments. And then we have the ability to move the money from the payments balance into issuing.” One Twitter user speculated that the expansion might mean that Stripe “is going towards becoming a bank.” While we don’t know about that, we can say that Stripe’s efforts to become a one-stop-shop for its customers appear to be advancing.
Stripe, which is one of the world’s highest-valued private companies, has had some struggles as the payments space in which it operates only continues to get more competitive and the IPO market has dried up. In the past year alone, companies such as Plaid and Finix have released competing products, for example. And Stripe, which has yet to go public via a long-awaited IPO, earlier this year raised $6.5 billion at a $50 billion valuation after being valued at $95 billion in March of 2021. Stripe’s latest raise took place months after the company laid off about 1,120 workers, or 14% of its workforce, in November of 2022 after saying it had “overhired for the world we’re in.”
On that note, CB Insights pointed out in an email this past week that despite laying off 14% of its staff last year, Stripe still has nearly 2x the employees of Adyen while its valuation ($50 billion as of March 2023) is essentially equivalent to Adyen’s market cap. — Mary Ann

Spend management update
Another week, another spend management company providing milestones.
This past week, two players in the space provided us with some business updates worth noting.
For one, Brex shared that two of its products — Empower, Brex’s spend management platform, and Brex business accounts — “have each achieved $100 million in ARR.”
When TC+ editor and my Equity podcast co-host Alex Wilhelm and I pressed Brex on what this meant exactly, a spokesperson told us the following via email:

ARR in this case means annual recurring revenue.
To clarify, it’s revenue that is contracted on Empower, which includes software and interchange from committed spend.
The revenue in regards to Brex business accounts is from its deposits where the company is “paid by banks and asset managers for providing funding / assets under management. That is highly recurring as customers rarely move their funds.”

The company added that since launching Empower last year, Brex has signed on companies such as Coinbase, Indeed, SeatGeek, Lemonade and DoorDash, among others. It also said that its business accounts, which it describes as cash management accounts with a suite of money movement tools across ACH, wires and checks, have seen “rapid growth due to the ease of use and up to $6M in FDIC insurance coverage.”
You may recall that Brex also recently announced it was going global.
It’s not the only one.
Mesh Payments this past week also announced an expansion to support global multinational businesses operating in Europe, the United Kingdom and Asia in local currencies. The company believes that by doing so, it can work to solve “a major pain point companies encounter when managing spend for remote workforces and across multiple entities.”
I hopped on a call with Mesh co-founder and CEO Oded Zehavi, who shared that the expansion comes during a period in which the fintech company saw its payments volume (and revenue as a result) climb by 3x compared to the first half of 2022. He was candid about the fact that while that volume came both from existing and new customers, the company could definitely see a decline in spending from existing clients — but was making up for that by continuing to sign on new ones, including an unnamed Fortune 100 company.
Mesh aims to serve mid-market and enterprise companies, and Zehavi said the expansion into Europe, the U.K. and Asia is just the beginning as the company continues to explore other territories. Acknowledging that it is challenging to serve global customers, he said that in some cases Mesh partners with local banks and with other fintechs that serve multiple territories.
He was also adamant about the fact that disruption of this space still has a long way to go.
“We just came from a Gartner event and I will not exaggerate and say that more than 90% of the companies that attended this event are using Concur, and don’t use any one of the new players in this space,” Zehavi said. “So it means that the space is still far from being disrupted.” – Mary Ann

Weekly News
TC+ editor Alex Wilhelm did a couple of fintech-related deep dives this week, including his unique take on Klarna’s first-quarter earnings that led him to conclude that while “a few good quarters do not make for a comeback…there’s lots to like about the company best known for its buy now, pay later services.” He also dug into U.K.-based neobank Monzo’s fiscal 2023 results and “what its recent profitability tells us about its performance this past year (spoiler alert: good things).” Alex also took that opportunity to make some other observations on other neobanks worth $1 billion or more. As he put it, “We are compiling an IPO list in our heads, after all.”
This week, Mary Ann caught up with personal finance guru Suze Orman, who made her debut into the startup world about a year ago with SecureSave, a company that enables employers to offer employees sponsored emergency savings accounts. Mary Ann and Suze discussed a number of hard-hitting topics, including why SecureSave isn’t like its competitors (it doesn’t try to go after all your money) and how Americans aren’t saving enough (people like to spend — spoiler!). Oh, and we found out her weapon for success. There was more fintech talk on Friday’s episode of the Equity podcast as well. Check it out here.
As Ivan Mehta reports, Amazon may have gotten out of the food delivery business in India but recognizes that dining is big business. The company is now testing dine-in payments at select restaurants. Read more.

Eligible consumers can, in a few clicks, sign up for biweekly and monthly payment options. Check out TechCrunch’s coverage of Affirm, including what happened with Affirm’s earnings earlier this year and the buy now, pay later boom.
Speaking of FIS, rumor has it that the company is acquiring BaaS platform Bond, according to fellow fintech enthusiast Jason Mikula.

Fidelity sours on Reddit: This week, Fidelity, the lead investor in Reddit’s most recent funding round in 2021, slashed the estimated worth of its equity stake in the social media platform by 41% since the investment. The devaluation, part of a broader trend that has hit a variety of growth-stage startups across the globe in the past year, raises uncertainties about whether Reddit will maintain its initial intent to reportedly go public at a valuation around $15 billion.
Amazon Prime Data: Amazon is considering offering low-cost or possibly free nationwide mobile phone service to Prime subscribers in the United States, according to a new report from Bloomberg. The tech giant is reportedly in talks with Verizon, T-Mobile, Dish Network and AT&T.
Gig workers get paid: Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and other app-based ride-hail and delivery companies will have to reimburse California gig workers potentially millions of dollars for unpaid vehicle expenses between 2022 and 2023. The back payments come from a provision in Proposition 22, the controversial law that classifies gig workers as independent contractors rather than employees and promises them half-hearted protections and benefits.
Volkswagen’s ace in the hole: Volkswagen is betting big on the upcoming ID.Buzz electric van. With availability of the vehicle still a year out, the automaker is counting on years of pent-up anticipation to not only sell the bus shrouded in nostalgia, but to also have it act as a halo product to bring customers to the brand’s entire EV lineup.
Shopify launches Shop Cash: Shopify’s Shop app is introducing a new rewards program called Shop Cash, the e-commerce platform announced on Friday. The new program is funded by Shopify and earns shoppers 1% back on purchases made using its Shop Pay online checkout service.
Stripe gets into credit: Stripe wants to make it easier for businesses to access credit. The private financial infrastructure giant announced a new charge card program today from Stripe Issuing, its commercial card issuing product. Denise Ho, head of product at Stripe, gave TechCrunch the exclusive details — go read the piece by Mary Ann.
AI conquers Minecraft: AI researchers have built a Minecraft bot that can explore and expand its capabilities in the game’s open world — but unlike other bots, this one basically wrote its own code through trial and error and lots of GPT-4 queries. Called Voyager, this experimental system is an example of an “embodied agent,” an AI that can move and act freely and purposefully in a simulated or real environment.
YouTube Shorts, in minutes: Dumme, a startup putting AI to practical use in video editing, is already generating demand before opening to the public. The Y Combinator–backed company has hundreds of video creators testing its product, which leverages AI to create short-form videos from YouTube content, and it has a waitlist of over 20,000 pre-launch, it says.

Need a new podcast to get your weekend started right? Good news — TC has you covered (and then some). On Equity, the crew took a look at the latest from Web Roulette, Stripe’s acquisition of Okay, what Klarna’s Q1 means for the fintech market and QED and a16z’s early-stage strategies. Found spoke with Dr. Stacy Blain, the co-founder and chief science officer at Concarlo Therapeutics, about the company’s novel therapeutic solutions for drug-resistant cancer. Over at Chain Reaction, Gary Vaynerchuk, the chairman of VaynerX and the CEO of VaynerMedia and NFT collection VeeFriends, spoke on his experiences in the creative media industry. And the TechCrunch Live folks dove into how AI doomerism is overblown — and why the blowhards doing the blowing want it that way.

Deal Dive: Doing venture math on the non-alcoholic spirits industry,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/06/03,"
Hangovers suck. Especially so for those who felt pressured to drink the alcohol that inevitably caused the hangover to begin with.
Drinking is slowly starting to fall out of fad, especially among younger generations. According to 2022 Gallup polling, 60% of adult Americans drink alcohol. This is down from 65% in 2019, and while 5% doesn’t seem like a huge change, it’s a pretty drastic shift when it comes to consumer spending dollars.
Founders are taking full advantage of the shift as numerous startups have popped up just in the last few years looking to offer low- and non-alcoholic options. Aplós is the latest one to secure funding.
The Miami-based startup announced a $5.5 million Series A round this week led by McCarthy Capital, a Midwestern private equity firm. Co-founder and CEO David Fudge told TechCrunch+ that he wanted to launch the company because he’s always considered himself a “reluctant drinker” but didn’t think there was a product that would fill what he was looking for: something that gave the same relaxation benefits and vibes of alcohol but without the next-day regret.
“The vision is to reimagine the adult beverage category for the new era, to create the first super premium non-alcoholic spirit brand,” Fudge said. “We want the sophistication, complexity, versatility and functionality of a high-end spirit. That’s something that we didn’t see in the market and what we were really interested in ourselves.”
As a consumer, I love that there are entrepreneurs trying to both innovate in this category and bring in new options. Non-alcoholic spirit brands like Aplós feel like a win-win because it not only is giving people more of an incentive to choose perhaps a healthier, lower-calorie option over alcohol, but it gives bars and restaurants a better way of providing comparable non-alcoholic cocktails to their customers and can price them the same. Capitalism!
But while I think the growth of this sector has societal benefits, how it plays out for investors isn’t clear.

3 ways to hire well for your startup



The world we used to live in — the one that revolved around using cheap money to pump up ARR — is gone.
It came to a screeching halt with rising interest rates, and it’s not on its way back anytime soon. VCs responded as VCs do: by quickly shifting from a “growth-at-all-costs” mindset to focusing on instant profitability while funding metrics shifted from just revenue and growth to including costs as well.
Since the beginning of Q2, a spur of companies, including hardware companies, have come out of the gate and started raising money. The Silicon Valley Bank (and, more recently, Free Republic Bank) debacle has been relatively short-lived, but, given the multiple rollercoasters the industry has been on, one has got to wonder where the goal posts are nowadays.
There’s no debate that the SaaS game has changed, and yet a consensus on Series A funding metrics for these companies hasn’t emerged. However, it is not too difficult to guess that it would be roughly around double the revenue bar at the same or lower cost. It’s a challenging proposition, but a clear and tangible goal to strive for — and one that cannot be applied to hardware companies without revenue in their early stages.
So how can a hardware company raise a Series A amidst yet another “new normal” in this post-low-interest-rate era?
Commit to having deployable hardware
Most hardware companies barely get their product to function — and can only do so using their own engineers and technicians. Hardware in this situation is not deployable on any meaningful scale.
At the Series A stage, VCs want to know that they can pump money into a product that will start going into the market. This does not mean that the product needs to be pitch-perfect; it just means it has to be sufficiently mature to function in a more unconstrained environment outside of the startup lab.
 

			At the Series A stage, VCs want to know that they can pump money into a product that will start going into the market.					


Use your ratio of engineering support per hardware as a metric for whether your product is deployable in the way it needs to be. If you have one engineer for the hardware piece you are deploying (not to be confused with non-engineer technical support personnel for customers), you do not have a deployable product.
Now, at a one-to-four ratio, the unit economics become more reasonable. As a stretch goal, you should target to get the human out of the loop entirely, but everything eventually boils down to unit economics.
If you’re hitting 70+% gross margin at a reasonable price, then you can afford to have more support — but it is going to be exceptionally difficult to maintain as an early-stage company with an immature product.

Private lenders won’t fill the venture debt gap left by SVB,Rebecca Szkutak,2023/06/02,"
The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank left a small but noticeable hole in the venture debt market that private lenders don’t find attractive enough to fill.
When SVB went under in March, the startup ecosystem was primarily concerned about what would happen to startup and venture capital firm bank accounts. The second worry was what would happen to the venture debt market and the existing loans SVB had issued.
While SVB didn’t manage a massive loan portfolio by any means, it was in the minority of banks that provided credit to really early-stage companies based on their sponsors as opposed to their underlying business metrics and fundamentals. Most banks aren’t willing to do that.
While it remains unclear whether First Citizens Bank, the current owner of SVB, will lend to startups the same way SVB did, private venture debt lenders have made it clear to TechCrunch+ that they aren’t interested in filling that gap if First Citizens doesn’t.

"TechCrunch+ roundup: Rethinking PLG, AI-enabled SaaS pricing, traveling with a green card",Walter Thompson,2023/06/02,"
In an era when no one worried too much about IT spending, startups leaned into the bottom-up sales approach and driving product-led growth.
But that was then, and this is now.
“It’s too soon to pronounce bottoms-up dead, but it’s looking pretty moribund,” according to Battery Ventures’ State of Cloud Software Spending Report, which surveyed 100 CIOs, CTOs and “other large tech buyers” who “represent $30 billion in annual technology spending.”
The report shows that contract approval times are slowing down as “CXOs are tightening restrictions on self-procurement, even in the dev/test environment.”

According to one estimate, founders who identify as LGBTQ+ receive less than 1% of startup funding. To kick off Pride Month, Crunchbase announced that it has started measuring how much venture capital flows to members of this community.
“Having concrete data helps in advocating for policy changes, funding initiatives and resource allocation to support LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs,” said Ryan Husk, Crunchbase’s director of business development.
“It enables us to make evidence-based arguments for greater equity and access within the startup ecosystem.”

Factors to consider before pricing AI-enabled SaaS

SaaS pricing is an art and a science, but the advent of artificial intelligence as a service “has created a mad dash to sprinkle AI pixie dust across the SaaS ecosystem,” writes Jake Saper, general partner at Emergence Capital.
“This is a time for learning and iteration,” he writes in a detailed TC+ article that contains his framework for AI feature pricing and a matrix that compares monthly costs from eight major SaaS companies.
“Even if you aren’t able to charge much for your AI features today, they can create meaningful value by making your current product more valuable and perhaps stickier.”

Many startups are built off research, so why don’t more scientists become founders?

Scientists generally have experience with managing budgets, shepherding complex projects to completion and raising funds, but many investors still don’t see them as founder material.
On the Found podcast, Rebecca Szkutak and Dominic-Madori Davis interviewed Dr. Stacy Blain, co-founder and chief science officer at Concarlo Therapeutics, about the challenges she faced when transitioning into tech from academia.
“The beauty of being a scientist is that we can learn a lot,” she said.
“That’s what we’ve been trained to do for decades: Look at a situation, figure out what’s important, troubleshoot and learn the appropriate things.”

Deal Dive: Why this startup chose to sell itself over raising a Series A

You know the story: A plucky startup achieves product-market fit with support from savvy investors before it goes public and makes billions of dollars for everyone involved.
Reality, however, is much more complicated.
Career platform Heroes Jobs raised $9 million in funding, reached $2 million in ARR and had a signed commitment for a Series A round when co-founder and former CEO Cyriac Lefort realized acquisition costs were just too high.
Instead of swimming against the current, Heroes Jobs sold to work marketplace JobGet “for an undisclosed amount,” reports Rebecca Szkutak.
“We all know that you don’t want to start doing down rounds,” Lefort said. “It becomes complicated for the company and the rest of the people in the company.”

Now that we’ll likely blow past the 1.5 degree Celsius target that would have slowed down our worsening climate crisis, investors and entrepreneurs need to focus on scalable solutions.
With that in mind, climate reporter Tim De Chant examined three technologies “that deserve a closer look:”

Enhanced rock weathering
Fusion
Grid management software

“Fusion may not pan out, but if it does, the winners could make Exxon look small by comparison,” he writes.

Startups may have room to innovate as enterprise providers puzzle out how to price AI tools
Image Credits: Anadolu Agency (opens in a new window) / Getty Images
AI-enabled tools are having a moment, but even as companies uncover new use cases, there’s no broad consensus on how they should price these offerings.
Alex Wilhelm reviewed statements by Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, Box CEO Aaron Levie and CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz to see how they’re each thinking about these products before adding his “thoughts on where startups might have an edge and where they probably won’t.”

Dumme’s AI video editor creates YouTube Shorts in minutes,Sarah Perez,2023/06/02,"
Dumme, a startup putting AI to practical use in video editing, is already generating demand before opening up to the public. The Y Combinator-backed company has hundreds of video creators testing its product, which leverages AI to create short-form videos from YouTube content, and a waitlist of over 20,000 pre-launch, it says. Using a combination of both proprietary and existing AI models, Dumme’s promise is that it can not only save on editing time but also — and here’s its big claim — do a better job than the contracted (human) workforce who is often tasked with more menial video editing jobs, like cutting down long-form content for publication on short-form platforms like YouTube Shorts, TikTok or Instagram Reels.
Founded in January 2022 and a participant in startup accelerator Y Combinator’s Winter 2022 program, Dumme co-founder and CEO Merwane Drai said he was originally focused on building a search engine for video. But around six months ago, the team realized that a better product might be to repurpose the same AI models they were developing to edit video clips instead.
Joined by co-founders Will Dahlstrom (CPO) and Jordan Brannan (CTO), all with AI backgrounds, Drai realized Dumme may have landed on the right product-market fit after their app went viral, crashing their servers.
“We didn’t really expect that it would get a lot of traction or anything, so we just put something out there,” Drai explains. “Then what happened is that overnight, we woke up to overloaded servers — like, nothing actually worked. So we took everything down and actually put together some sort of waitlist,” he continues. “The next morning, we probably woke up to 5,000 people in there, which was interesting.”
The team later discovered that a TikTok creator had posted a short video about the product, which sent a flood of traffic to their site.
“It actually never calmed down from that,” Drai notes.
The product, pronounced “dummy,” appealed to creators because it aimed to simplify and speed up the work involved with video editing.
Image Credits: Dumme
Using Dumme is as simple as the name implies. To get started, the user pastes in a YouTube video’s link, then clicks on “generate” and the AI will output a number of short videos showcasing highlights from that ingested content. The company says it’s using YouTube as the source, instead of supporting raw video footage, in order to outsource content moderation — that is, if it’s allowed on YouTube, it’s allowed in Dumme.
The processing time and the number of resulting clips will depend on the length of the original video.
But as an example, an hour-long video podcast might take around 20 minutes to process and you’ll start receiving clips after about five minutes, Drai says. When complete, creators can download the video clips, which are less than 60 seconds by default, and upload them to any platform that supports short-form content, like YouTube Shorts, but also other platforms, like Reels or TikTok.
Image Credits: Dumme
How this all works on the back end, of course, is much more complex. The company says that, initially, Dumme will learn as much as it can from the source video via the metadata. It then transcribes the video and tries to understand the semantics of what’s being said while also looking at the frames to try to decode the emotions of the person speaking. These findings are correlated and passed to a language model that tries to determine what parts of the video are worthy of clipping. That’s then handed off to another model that tracks active speakers and handles cropping.
Dumme says it’s working with existing AI models like GPT-4, a fine-tuned version of Whisper and others it built in-house — like the model that tracks the active speakers in a video frame. One of its models is also trained on a bunch of YouTube Shorts to learn what makes for a good opening hook to pull viewers in. And, though not yet live, the team is also experimenting with an open source model, LaViLa from Facebook Research, to better understand the context of the video.
The AI work is being done on GPU Cloud provider CoreWeave, not AWS, as it’s more affordable, the company tells us.
Because Dumme relies on AI that processes spoken words, the tech is not appropriate for things like long gameplay videos or others where people aren’t talking. Drai says the startup is initially targeting YouTube creators, podcasters and agencies — the latter, they believe, would be the best bet for monetizing the product.
Image Credits: Dumme
Agencies, explains Drai, today often outsource this type of work with hit-or-miss results.
“They just pay contractors in cheap jurisdictions to edit their own content. And the problem is that it’s still actually pretty expensive and it takes a lot of time — it takes weeks, not minutes,” he says.
Asked how he feels about creating a technology that would actually put people out of work, Drai was not worried.
“The way I think about it is that, eventually…I think this is like telling me that math teachers are going to [be put] out of work because there’s something called a calculator…,” he explains. “People are going to adapt. And then there’s going to be someone teaching you about the calculator, right? So I think it’s just a matter of adapting to this,” Drai says.
Currently, the pricing being considered involves tiers where a business would pay $0.40 per minute of video processed, while smaller creators may instead opt for a monthly subscription that’s capped at 10 hours of content per month. (These numbers may change.) During testing, the product has been free to use.
Early adopters have been using Dumme for a variety of edits, including generating clips from their video podcasts to publish to Shorts, as well as cutting down other new videos and going through their back catalogs.
The product appears to be competitive with other AI technologies on the market, including that from creator company Jellysmack, which has been leveraging AI to turn longer YouTube videos into shorter videos, by cutting them, resizing them and optimizing them for specific platforms — a result of its 2021 Kamua acquisition. Other tools doing similar work include things like Vidyo.ai, Detail, TubeBuddy, Wisecut and others. To what extent Dumme succeeds or fails will be on outperforming competitors on the quality of work and cost — metrics that are yet to be determined.
But some investors are placing their bets on Dumme. Ahead of launch, the startup raised a $3.4 million seed round from Y Combinator, Caffeinated Capital, Max and Nellie Levchin (through SciFi VC), Suhail Doshi, Nico Chinot, Protocol Labs, Chris Puscasiu and other angels.
Given the interest and the sizable waitlist, Dumme says it’s aiming to onboard around 500 people every week. TechCrunch readers can jump the line using the invite code TECHCRUNCH until the slots run out.

The web3 winter isn’t going to thaw anytime soon,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/02,"
There’s something phoenix-like about the crypto world. No matter how high the highs, or how low the ensuing lows, blockchain enthusiasts, founders and investors remain confident that their favored sector will rise again. You have to give it to them: It always has bounded back.
We saw this happen in the wake of the initial coin offering (ICO) boom, for example, when NFTs and DeFi took off, helping propel the web3 startup and token world to new heights.
Today, we’re checking on the vital signs of web3 as the sector struggles up the crater left by major tokens, blockchains and startup projects falling back to Earth after 2021. If there’s another rollercoaster ride coming in crypto land, we want to be ready for it.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

Sadly, there isn’t going to be a resurgence anytime soon. From an initial read of data from the past month, we can infer that the current crypto winter is far from thawing — it could even be getting colder. Let’s dig in.
Boom to bust?
Data from Crunchbase paints a jarring picture of investment in web3, crypto and blockchain startups.
Companies in the sector collectively attracted $1.2 billion in VC funding in April and May of this year, according to the firm’s web3 tracker. There’s still one month left in this quarter, but it’s pointless to expect any miracles: At the current rate, Q2’s tally would reach $1.8 billion, less than the $2 billion raised by web3 startups in Q1 2023.
That $2 billion wasn’t anything to write home about either. Though Q1 2023 was slightly better for web3 companies than 2020’s quarterly numbers, it was about five times less than Q1 2022 ($10.8 billion). "

Pitch Deck Teardown: Oii.ai’s $1.9M seed deck,Haje Jan Kamps,2023/06/02,"
The award for the best/worst startup name I’ve seen in a while goes to Oii.ai. This company’s name is weird enough that Google Chrome insists on doing a search for the term “oii.ai’ when you type the URL into the address bar. In any case, a confusing name doesn’t mean it’s a bad business.
The company claims it raised a $1.85 million seed round with this deck. We didn’t cover this round, and the company is tight-lipped about who its investors are, but the deck was interesting enough that I’m choosing to break my usual rule of needing press coverage to do a pitch deck teardown.

We’re looking for more unique pitch decks to tear down, so if you want to submit your own, here’s how you can do that. 

Slides in this deck
Oii.ai has an 18-slide deck plus a couple of appendix slides. Some of the slides have been lightly redacted, but the company says it is including every slide so we can get a full picture of the deck that helped it close the round.
Here are the slides:

Cover slide
Vision slide
Interstitial slide
Overview slide (“Welcome to Oii”)
Solution slide? with a side of business model slide
Problem slide?
Market trend slide
Traction slide
Team slide
  TAM slide 1 (Pharma sector)
  TAM slide 2 (Retail sector)
  Market overview + competitive landscape slide
  Competitive advantage slide
  Sales pipeline slide
  Product roadmap slide
  The ask + opportunity slide
  Use of Funds slide
  Closing slide + contact detail slide
  Appendix slide 1: Competition (Llamasoft)
  Appendix slide 2: Competition (Llamasoft)
  Appendix slide 3: Acquisition opportunities

Three things to love
I have to admit that I’ve rarely found it as hard to categorize slides as I did with this deck. The information isn’t organized the way I would expect. It does work sometimes, but it often does not.
Excellent “what we want to change” narrative
This slide paints a concise and clear picture of the change Oii wants to see in the world. It’s a simple and effective way to show why the company needs to exist.
[Slide 6] An unusual take on the value proposition slide. Image Credits: Oii.aiThis slide is unusual because it falls somewhere in the middle of the problem, solution and value proposition narrative. In this case, it works because it helps draw a clear line between what the company is seeing in the world right now and the future it envisions.
I like the creative approach and can see this type of slide being more commonly used in the future.
A good take on early-stage traction
The company doesn’t have much in the way of traction, but it does avoid falling into the trap of leaning into vanity metrics:
[Slide 8] Here’s some traction for ya. Image Credits: Oii AIIt took me a couple of moments to realize that PoC probably meant proof of concept rather than people of color; I do enjoy brevity on slides, but I also think that you can afford to spell out abbreviations.
Now, technically, only the top-level revenue number is the one with the actual traction; the other figures are all benefits and value propositions. The traction that flows from these numbers is efficacy, so the story here is, “In our proof-of-concept phase, we generated X amount of revenue and were successful in proving that our product works.”
In most cases, graphs that show revenue growth over time are better than snapshots when it comes to traction. Having said that, I appreciate how hard it is to show traction as an early-stage startup, and this slide actually does better than most, so we’ll chalk this one up as a win.
Overall, good visual storytelling
I like that this deck has clearly had some design attention and that it relies on imagery to tell its story. Good images go a long way in helping a deck come to life, and from that perspective, Oii AI’s deck is pretty compelling. Colorful images and fun design choices all work in its favor.
Although, if I were to pick a nit…
[Slide 3] The future looks retro. Image Credits: Oii AIIf you are building the cutting edge of AI to disrupt an industry, maybe don’t use a stock image of a GPS device that nobody has used since Apple introduced built-in GPS with the iPhone 3G in 2008.
In this case, I believe the device pictured is one of the Garmin Nuvi 700 series, which was launched the same year as Apple started putting GPS into iPhones and was essentially the beginning of the end for the entire category. Visually aligning your company with a product category that met its very public and extremely painful demise 15 years ago may not send the right message.
In the rest of this teardown, we’ll take a look at three things Oii AI could have improved or done differently, along with its full pitch deck!

Okay startup names and why fintech is rebounding,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/02,"

Listen here or wherever you get your podcasts.
Hello, and welcome back to Equity, a podcast about the business of startups, where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines.
Mary Ann and Alex were a busy pair this week, so much so that they tagged in Dominic-Madori Davis from the TechCrunch+ crew to help out.
Before we get into what we covered on the episode, Equity is holding its annual listeners’ survey. If you listen to the pod, we’d love to hear from you. The questions are here, and you have our thanks.
Here’s the show rundown:

Fraud is bad: Elizabeth Holmes is in jail, and the SEC wrapped insider trading charges against a former Coinbase staffer. Our take? Breaking business law is bad and perhaps people should not do it. Controversial, we know.
Deals of the Week: Alex is enamored with Web Roulette, while Mary Ann wanted to talk about Stripe’s deal to buy Okay.
Klarna’s Q1 2023 results led Alex to share some enthusiasm that the fintech market could be rebounding, a topic that he’s been going on about for some time.
QED’s plans to invest its new funds carefully is a clear example of the new investing climate, Mary Ann argued. The show also touched on our latest check-in on the a16z early-stage strategy.
And we closed, thanks to Dom, with a chat through the Atlanta startup scene in advance of our upcoming City Spotlight.


TC City Spotlight: Atlanta

Whew, and with that, we are done for the week! Chat with you Monday!

"NestAway, once valued at over $225 million, sells for $11 million",Manish Singh,2023/06/02,"
Proptech firm Aurum is acquiring NestAway, a once high-flying Indian startup operating in the same space, for up to $10.9 million, in a deal that marks a near complete erosion in value for the startup’s investors.
Eight-year-old NestAway raised $115 million over the years and was valued at $227 million in a funding round in 2019. The startup counts Tiger Global, Goldman Sachs, Yuri Milner and Chiratae Ventures among its investors.
Aurum, which earlier acquired a unit of NestAway for about $6.8 million, said it will invest $3.6 million to stabilize NestAway’s business. “This capital infusion in NestAway is a testament to Aurum PropTech’s conviction in India’s $20-billion Rental Housing market,” Aurum said in a stock exchange filing.
NestAway’s revenue shrank to $3 million in 2022, down from $9.5 million two years earlier.
The erosion in NestAway’s value can at least be partially attributed to COVID. The home rental platform NestAway features 18,000 properties on its platform, down from 50,000 before the pandemic.
“When we started NestAway, our vision was to revolutionize the way people live in cities by providing them with convenient, affordable and hassle-free housing solutions,” said Jitendra Jagadev, founder of NestAway, in a statement. “Over the years, we have grown and expanded, serving thousands of customers, becoming a trusted brand in the PropTech industry.”

Fidelity has cut Reddit valuation by 41% since 2021 investment,Manish Singh,2023/06/01,"
Fidelity, the lead investor in Reddit’s most recent funding round in 2021, has slashed the estimated worth of its equity stake in the popular social media platform by 41% since the investment.
Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund’s stake in Reddit was valued at $16.6 million as of April 28, according to the fund’s monthly disclosure released over the weekend. That’s down 41.1% cumulatively since August 2021 when the asset manager spent $28.2 million to acquire the Reddit shares, according to disclosures the firm has made in its annual and semi-annual reports.
Reddit was valued at $10 billion when the social media giant attracted funds in August 2021. Fidelity — which has marked down its stakes in many startups including Stripe and Reddit in recent quarters — also slashed the value of its Twitter stake, it disclosed in the filing, valuing Elon Musk’s firm at about $15 billion.
The substantial markdown of Reddit’s value by Fidelity predominantly occurred by the previous year. Nevertheless, it merits pointing out that Fidelity has persistently implemented minor reductions in the worth of Reddit’s shares in the ensuing months. Fidelity, also an investor in Indian startups such as Meesho and Pine Labs, has effected considerably less dramatic valuation cuts in these holdings in the past two years.
Reddit declined to comment.
This devaluation, part of a broader trend that has hit a variety of growth stage startups across the globe in the past year, raises uncertainties about whether Reddit will maintain its initial intent to reportedly go public at a valuation around $15 billion.
Reddit, which has raised over $1 billion to date, counts Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz among its backers. The firm was valued at as high as $15 billion in secondary markets late 2021, according to people familiar with the matter.
The current wave of valuation cutbacks sheds new light on the impact of deteriorating worldwide economic conditions on fledgling startups. Despite the diminished funding activities for startups globally over the past year, valuations of numerous larger startups have stayed constant.

Fintech giant Stripe is getting into the credit game,Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/06/01,"
Stripe wants to make it easier for businesses to access credit.
The private financial infrastructure giant announced a new charge card program today from Stripe Issuing, its commercial card issuing product, Denise Ho, head of product for BaaS at Stripe, told TechCrunch exclusively.
The company originally launched its Issuing product in 2018, and since then it’s helped companies such as Shopify and Ramp issue more than 100 million cards in the U.S., the United Kingdom and the European Union. Today, the product is one of Stripe’s fastest-growing, Ho said — supporting half a million transactions a day. Fintechs like Klarna “build entire businesses on it,” the company claims.

Klarna’s Q1 results show that the fintech unicorn’s turnaround is in full swing

Previously, Stripe-issued cards could only be used to spend money from a prefunded account. Its expansion into charge cards, according to Ho, will give companies the ability to create and distribute virtual or physical charge cards that allow their customers to spend on credit rather than using the funds in their accounts.
“Among our suite of products, Issuing has been doing really, really well,” Ho told TechCrunch. “And the No. 1 top demand within Issuing has been the ability for Stripe to enable our platforms to offer credit to their users.”
This has a twofold benefit for Stripe — giving it a new revenue stream as well as the option to offer new financing capabilities to their customers “with little additional operational cost,” Stripe touts. (Operational efficiency is in vogue, after all.)
For example, platforms that use Stripe Connect can white label products from Stripe and provide a range of embedded financial services, such as financial accounts, working capital loans and now charge cards as well, Ho said.
Further, she added, Stripe Issuing provides the core components of a charge card program — such as funds flows, network connections, printing, and integration APIs — and then aims to “streamline” all the necessary compliance, bank partnerships and ledgering.
Ramp, Emburse, Karat and Coast are among the current users of the charge card program, which is available in beta in the U.S., and will later expand into the EU and the U.K.
“In the U.S., the banks are the ones that have been our sponsor … and that’s regulated,” Ho explained. “And because you’re letting the small businesses spend, that is a form of lending so that lending compliance has to come from the bank.”
For its part, she said Stripe is partnering with startups to help guide them through the process and help provide the necessary compliance and risk oversight so that they don’t get in over their heads.
When it comes to underwriting, Ho said that Stripe has received feedback that its clients ultimately want to own the underwriting decision.
“What we do is we help them put together the set of policies and ensure that these policies are actually compliant,” she said. “So we offer both . . . flexibility and the control but with guardrails.”
Over time, Ho said its clients may want “more modules” to do their own underwriting, so that’s something Stripe will work on over time as it matures its offering.
Anyone can sign up for the new program, she said, even if they are not an existing Stripe user.
For its part, Stripe will make money off of interchange fees, so as customers’ volume grows and users spend more, Stripe will earn more. There will also be compliance fees associated with the program.
On May 31, TechCrunch reported exclusively on Stripe’s acquisition of Okay, a startup that developed a low-code analytics software to help engineering leaders better understand how their teams are performing.
Note: The original post said that Stripe would be expanding into the UK and EU in coming months. That has been amended to say the expansion will take place at a later date.

Ceibo unearths $30M Series B to extract more copper out of existing mines,Tim De Chant,2023/06/01,"
When it comes time to fret about minerals critical to the energy transition, lithium, cobalt and nickel may get all the attention, but another metal is keeping plenty of analysts up at night.
Though those other minerals are key ingredients for batteries, copper is used across every sector that will be touched by electrification. Transmission wires, electric motors, inverters and battery packs all rely on the 29th element.
“There’s no energy transition, no decarbonization without some critical minerals,” Ceibo CEO Cristóbal Undurraga told TechCrunch+.
But less than a decade from now, demand for copper is expected to outstrip supply by 6.5 million metric tons, according to McKinsey. That portends a 25% shortfall.
One answer to that dilemma is to find more copper buried in the earth and dig it up. But that costs a lot, takes a ton of time and damages the environment. A better approach is to extract more copper out of the mines we have today.
There are several ways to do that — bacteria is an option; more on that later — but the one that helped Ceibo dig up a $30 million Series B relies on tweaking a century-old process. The round was led by Energy Impact Partners with participation from existing investors Khosla Ventures and Aurus Ventures and new investors including CoTec Holdings, Audley, Orion Industrial Ventures, Unearth Capital and Pincus Green. "
"Many startups are built off research, so why don’t more scientists become founders?",Rebecca Szkutak,2023/06/01,"
Many founders start their companies because they’re looking to build a career around finding a solution to a problem or pain point. Scientists are no different, and yet, you don’t see as many scientists becoming founders as you would engineers or operators.
It’s common to see biotech firms started by scientists and researchers, but many other fields have companies that utilize and base their work on research done by scientists who are unlikely to become entrepreneurs.
So why is it so common to see outsiders bringing research out of the lab and not the scientists themselves? Sure, some scientists would rather focus all of their time on research, but bringing the fruits of that work into the real world is generally the only way to apply them to the problems all that labor was meant to solve in the first place.
It’s a complex knot to unravel. First off, there is the stigma in the startup ecosystem that scientists generally don’t make for good founders. This opinion seems to largely exist because they often hail from academia, which can be a pretty isolated field with very different structures and nuances than startups or most businesses. That gives rise to the notion that they wouldn’t have the skills needed for the job.
But like all generalizations, it’s often not true. Stacy Blain, the co-founder and chief science officer at Concarlo Therapeutics, said on a recent Found podcast episode that she’s heard all the reasons why certain investors don’t think scientists make strong founders, and she doesn’t buy it.
Blain came to entrepreneurship after spending more than two decades researching the same type of protein that could lead to treatments down the line for drug-resistant cancers. But she realized it was time to launch a company when her research was moving toward developing drugs, which caused her grant requests to be denied. "
8Flow.ai raises $6.6M to automate customer support workflows,Frederic Lardinois,2023/06/01,"
Working in customer support often means navigating disjointed tools to find data and solve issues. However, many of these actions are routine and repeatable, making them ideal candidates for automation. 8Flow.ai, which is launching out of stealth today and announcing a $6.6 million seed funding round, wants to do exactly this.
The company is rolling out an enterprise-grade, self-learning workflow automation engine that integrates with tools like Zendesk, ServiceNow and Salesforce Service Cloud to assist agents in their daily tasks. But that’s only step one. The company then plans to use all of this data to train machine-learning models to generate AI-led workflows that are tailored to each user’s needs.

“Ultimately, where we are headed is that we’re building a tool that learns what an agent is doing today,” 8Flow co-founder and CEO Boaz Hecht told me. “But in the end, it really doesn’t matter if you’re a support agent, or you’re a finance person, or you’re an HR person, or whatever — the point is, we’re building an engine that learns in order to build a model that is then rich enough to be used.”
Right now, though, the team is still focused on phase one and on optimizing the user interface and experience. Hecht noted that this already helps out agents quite a bit and creates enough value for enterprises to pay for the product today. In addition, it also allows 8Flow to capture data and collect feedback.
“The idea is that we’re capturing data — we’re collecting the feedback — meaning we’re iterating for the agent on what they’re doing,” he explained. “Then, as they do that, we observe what they do and then we create — I almost think of it like building Lego bricks from the bottom up — we learn what bricks need to be built. Once we build the bricks, we learn how you put them together. And once you put them together, we see what you’ve built and we recreate those into pre-built workflows.”

Currently, this takes the form of a Chrome extension that can automatically copy and paste relevant data from one application to another. The tool automatically learns common steps for each agent and then presents them as actions they can trigger with a single click.
As Hecht noted, fulfilling an order return, for example, may take dozens of clicks for a support agent, but it should really only be a handful because most steps are about copying and pasting data from one application to another. There are only a few steps where the agent has to make a decision (to issue the refund or not, for example) — and ideally, that’s what a tool like 8Flow allows those agents to focus on.

“8Flow has allowed my team to significantly increase efficiency and accuracy,” said Heather English, a senior customer support manager at FloorFound. “We save hours using 8Flow to eliminate the need to switch between browser tabs to copy and paste data. We’re excited about their roadmap ahead, as each release results in freeing up more valuable time for our team members.”
There’s also an additional benefit here for businesses, as they get data about which tools their agents actually use (and which they can cancel because they aren’t being used) and how they use them.

Hecht is no stranger to workflow automation. He was also the co-founder and CEO of SkyGiraffe, an early enterprise mobility platform, which he then sold to ServiceNow in 2017. After that, he stayed at ServiceNow until March 2022, ultimately becoming the VP of Platform, leading the company’s teams that focused on its core platform, mobile, AI chatbots and most employee-facing products. By late 2021, he decided that he wanted to build another startup, though, taking former SkyGiraffe and ServiceNow colleagues Josh Russ and Yev Goldin with him to co-found the company.
While 8Flow’s focus right now is on support agents, largely because that’s the market the founding team knows best, there’s no reason it couldn’t add just as much value to businesses in other verticals as well.
8Flow‘s seed round was led by Caffeinated Capital, with BoxGroup, Liquid2, HNVR and Trilogy also joining the round. A number of prominent angel investors, including former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, Airtable co-founder and CEO Howie Liu and Snowflake CFO Michael Scarpelli, also participated.

Startups may have room to innovate as enterprise providers puzzle out how to price AI tools,Alex Wilhelm,2023/06/01,"
Nearly every tech company seems to be working on AI tooling, and everyone is at least talking about using it. But how the heck are companies going to charge for it?
There’s little clarity on the business model front, which contrasts with the clear optimism on the part of corporate leaders and their customers about the potential impact of new AI technology on their products and markets.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. 
Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

Regular readers of The Exchange will recall that we touched on this very question in May. At the time, we took a broader view, considering how consumer-focused AI services and AI-powered business services would charge.
This morning, we’re narrowing our focus to the enterprise software space, the target of an enormous number of startups. Let’s start by hearing what the CEOs of Salesforce, Box and CrowdStrike have to say on their AI-related work and customer interest. Then, we’ll go over their answers to industry analysts regarding how they intend to charge for new AI products.
We’ll wrap with a few thoughts on where startups might have an edge and where they probably won’t.
If you build it, they will come
Box, Salesforce and CrowdStrike are very different from one another. Box focuses on enterprise storage and productivity, Salesforce is a CRM giant and CrowdStrike is a cybersecurity company. However, they share a very interesting facet: They store or create lots of data for their customers.
Box, of course, started as an enterprise file storage and sync (EFSS) company, though its remit has expanded with time. Salesforce has oodles of its customer and sales data, in addition to a variety of other information. CrowdStrike has an enormous historical archive of cybersecurity-related data that it uses to help predict and interdict new cyber threats. "
Xonai looks to reduce cloud bills by optimizing data infrastructure,Ron Miller,2023/06/01,"
There are many companies out there looking at how to reduce your cloud bills by eliminating waste, or finding more cost-effective ways of doing the same job. Xonai, an early-stage startup, is taking a different approach to cloud cost reduction.
It’s looking at ways to make your data software run more efficiently, and thereby reduce the cost of your overall workload, starting with Apache Spark. It plans to support other packages over time. Today, the company announced a $3.5 million seed investment.
“We are helping organizations that need to scale data- and AI-driven products to reduce cost, and accelerate time to value,” company co-founder and CTO Leandro Vaz told TechCrunch.
The company has chosen to focus on these data and AI products because by their nature, they require scaling of cloud resources in proportion to the business growth in order to maintain the quality of service. While Vaz couldn’t share customer names, or the number of companies using the product at this point, he talked in general terms about the types of organizations that could benefit from using Xonai, such as adtech, financial services, retail, gaming or just about any data-heavy business.
“They need to scale because they keep growing the amount of data they have to process as the business grows. Essentially what happens when engineers implement these things is that they have to scale the infrastructure horizontally and this almost always means that they use more machines,” he said. And this essentially scales the cloud costs in proportion to the number of machines that they are using in the cloud.

This is where Xonai comes with a solution designed to bring down those data infrastructure costs. “We are doing something to really make these very demanding applications for AI and data run faster and use fewer resources,” he says.
The beauty of the approach is it’s fully automated, so you don’t have to monitor the level of resources. The software takes care of that for you automatically via hardware acceleration that makes these workloads run faster with fewer machines. “We are leveraging novel developments in compilers and building a layer that allows you to essentially write these steps into a common language. Then we can optimize all these steps together, and by doing that these applications run compute much faster,” he said.
How much faster? He says anywhere from 2-5x.
The company currently has around a dozen employees with a few open roles coming soon. At this early stage, they have gender and geographic diversity and he says as he hires, he is going to continue to make an effort to bring people from different backgrounds into the company.
The seed investment was led by Kadmos Capital with participation from Adara Ventures, Deep Science Ventures, Nauta Capital, Notion Capital and various industry angels.

YouTuber Emma Chamberlain adds to coffee empire with ready-to-drink line,Christine Hall,2023/06/01,"
Many people can’t start their day without a hot cup o’ Joe, or since it’s June now, perhaps a tall cold brew. Coffee drinkers also have refined tastes and like a brand they can relate to.
Enter Chamberlain Coffee, a company started in 2019 by YouTuber Emma Chamberlain, who has over 12 million subscribers and creates videos about her life and travels. Chamberlain sells high-quality organic coffee roasted in California and that is sustainably sourced via Food4Farmers, supporting coffee-farming communities in Latin America.
It is among a number of startups trying to bring something different to coffee consumers. For example, Fellow and Blank Street are putting their spin on it, as are lots of celebrity coffee brands.
Today, Chamberlain Coffee announced $7 million in additional funding and an expanded national retail presence in Sprouts and Walmart. This follows the launch last month of its ready-to-drink line of cold brew lattes.
Company CEO Christopher Gallant explained that Emma Chamberlain has been a coffee lover for a long time, and her videos often show her drinking it and talking about it. Wanting to create her own brand, she found a roaster and released a single-serve coffee.
“It took off like crazy, so she brought in folks that had worked in the beverage and branding spaces to help build it from that single-serve product into a full suite of products that was relaunched in 2020,” Gallant told TechCrunch.

How Fellow bootstrapped for 8 years to build a coffee empire

Coffee products include cold brew singles, instant sticks, coffee pods, ground and whole bean options in fun names like “Fancy Mouse Espresso,” “Social Dog,” “Sweet Otter Cake Batter” and “Breezy Butterfly.” There is also matcha, chai and other teas.
“We’re really focused on making sure we make great products that can be used for cold brew, whether it’s already a drink, latte or whether that’s single-serve,” Gallant said. “And we have Emma, one of the most powerful voices of Gen Z. It’s leveraging her creative genius to help us create a brand that speaks to her cohort of consumers. If you walk down the coffee aisle and take a look, it’s a very ‘brown’ aisle. We’ve come in with bright colors, fun characters and just a much different approach to the brand than what’s out there already.”
Previously, much of Chamberlain Coffee’s business has been direct-to-consumer through the company’s website and Amazon; however, with the move to retail, Gallant said the company can reach even more customers while out for their ritual shopping trip.
Sprouts has carried Chamberlain Coffee’s dry goods line for the past year and it will now be in 4,000 Walmart stores, Gallant said. It is also launching in “a bunch more retailers this year” that are unannounced at this point.
Meanwhile, both of the new moves are buoyed by that new round of $7 million in venture capital that closed in April. This follows a $7 million Series A in August 2022. The company has now raised close to $20 million in total.
Blazar Capital and United Talent Agency joined Emma Chamberlain in the investment round that also included existing investors Volition Capital, Electric Feel Ventures and Noah Bremen, founder of PLTFRM.
Creating a ready-to-drink line wasn’t easy. It was a big challenge that required building both a new supply chain and downstream distribution team, Gallant said.
“Our team was amazing and did it in eight months when the process normally takes at least a year and a half,” he said.
Gallant declined to go into specifics about the number of customers Chamberlain Coffee served, but did say that over the past year, its subscription business has become a significant portion of online revenue now. The company also plans to double revenue this year.
The new investment plays into that strategy. Gallant intends to deploy the funds into innovation of new products, marketing and hiring to add supply chain, marketing and sales to support the new lines of business.
“We want to continue to come up with new exciting products that consumers love and go deeper into retail,” Gallant said. “We’re really focused on the national and conventional grocery spaces. From there, we are thinking about the next step for us, like drugstores or non-traditional retail. We are also considering expanding geographically. We’ve got a nice foothold in Europe.”

Back-end development platform Platformatic raises $3.5M,Frederic Lardinois,2023/06/01,"
Platformatic, a new back-end development platform, wants to make it easier for enterprises to modernize their infrastructure by giving them the tools to build and deploy microservices-based architectures with the simplicity of a monolith. The company, which was founded by Node.js veterans Luca Maraschi (CEO) and Matteo Collina (CTO), also today announced a $3.5 million seed funding round led by Decibel, with Panache Ventures and a number of angel investors (including GitHub founder Tom Preston-Werner) also participating.
Unsurprisingly, given the co-founders’ background, Platformatic uses Node.js and, maybe even more importantly, the popular Fastify web framework created by Collina, at its core. Fastify is already in use at large enterprises like Capital One, Walmart and American Express and Platformatic essentially takes Fastify and extends it with enterprise capabilities, managed services and a dedicated support team. That’s pretty much the modern playbook for monetizing popular open source projects.

It’s Fastify’s extensibility and plug-in architecture that enables the team to build this new platform, the company explains.
“In today’s digital world, businesses of all shapes and sizes are undergoing digital transformation initiatives in order to keep at pace with the growing need to deliver robust, reliable and scalable software,” write the founders. “However, with application architectures moving from monolithic to distributed, building and operating these distributed backends is becoming increasingly complex. While frontend application development has benefitted from modern frameworks and platforms, backend development has lagged far behind due to its complex and rigid nature.”
The promise of Platformatic is that it abstracts away all of the routine work of setting up the back-end infrastructure, database integrations, authentication, security settings, API gateways, observability and more, and allows developers to focus on writing their code, no matter where it will later run.
“Platform engineering teams keep reinventing the wheel with components that are virtually identical across companies,” said Decibel partner Sudip Chakrabarti. “It holds developers back from building products that make an impact. Platformatic offers the best of all worlds: a great developer experience and peace of mind for enterprises with lower dependency risks and deployment costs.”
The platform includes the Platformatic Runtime and Runtime API for consolidating an enterprise’s Node.js applications and microservices into a single unit; Platformatic Taxonomy for creating a visual map of these microservices and how they are connected; Platformatic Composition for composing these microservices into one ecosystem with a single API; and Platformatic Cloud, the company’s cloud environment for deploying these Node.js applications.
“We plan to build Platformatic such that it just works out-of-the-box and yet provides all the reliability, security and scalability that developers and enterprises so desperately need,” said Maraschi. “Additionally, while the out-of-the-box Platformatic experience provides an opinionated view of how distributed backends should be, it allows for customizations to address bespoke enterprise needs. Our goal is to be ‘opinionated without being prescriptive’ and the rich plug-in ecosystem around Fastify provides the best platform to accomplish that vision.”

Ariga is helping developers define database schema as code,Ron Miller,2023/06/01,"
As companies look to update their databases, especially in a cloud-native context, with so many different databases out there, it’s a huge challenge for developers when migrating from one environment to another. Ariga, an early-stage startup, wants to help by letting users define database schema as code, and greatly simplify how they interact and manage databases over time.
Today the company announced a $15 million Series A along with a previously unannounced $3 million seed as the open source project gains traction and they begin taking on paying customers for the SaaS version of the product.
Ariga CTO and co-founder Rotem Tamir says managing a database is hard to do and if you make a catastrophic mistake, you could lose all your data. That’s why companies tend to be conservative when it comes to adjusting the database. He and co-founder and CEO Ariel Mashraki founded the company with the idea that companies have been able to reduce the complexity of managing infrastructure by defining it as code in a declarative way.
They have been working to create a solution that delivers on that idea for databases. “This hasn’t been done yet in the database space for various reasons. We really think that to be able to capture what you want, the desired state of your database, the desired state of your data topology in your organization, you need a smart tool to plan, verify, then execute and monitor the database – and this is what our platform is about,” Tamir told TechCrunch.
They started by developing an open source tool called Atlas, written in Go, that helps manage a number of databases. “It accepts the desired state of your database, and is either connected to a live database, or the previous state. It knows how to do these calculations. It has a safety engine inside that does something that’s very similar to static code analysis. It can analyze and verify changes against policies,” he said.
Atlas has proven popular; Mashraki says it’s been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times since it launched in 2022. Users run it thousands or sometimes tens of thousands of times per day, so it appears to be solving a real pain point.
By making it open source, database makers can download the program and add their own database support to Atlas, allowing the founders to support many more products than they could on their own as an early-stage startup.
The company came out with Atlas Cloud, a SaaS version of the database management tool, earlier this year, and are currently working with a handful of paying customers. They have around a dozen employees working at the company, and are hiring for some open roles.
As an open source company, the pool of people interested in the product tend to be diverse by the nature of these projects being spread out across the world, Mashraki said. That means he has people from Iraq, Gaza, Germany, Australia and Brazil.
Today’s investment announcement was led by Tiger Global and TLV Partners with participation from unnamed angel investors.

Crunchbase will begin tracking venture dollars allocated to LGBTQ+ founders,Dominic-Madori Davis,2023/06/01,"
Crunchbase announced Thursday that it is starting to track the amount of venture capital dollars invested in founders who identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community.
The new data source is an addition to Crunchbase’s Diversity Spotlight, which tracks the amount of venture capital funding raised by founders within marginalized communities. Similar to its other diversity tags, LGBTQ+ founders will have to self-identify and opt-in to wanting their information publicly shared. Crunchbase said its intention is to help raise awareness of LGBTQ+ founders looking for funding, as well as offer data and transparency around investments within the community. The announcement coincides with the first day of Pride Month.
“Having concrete data helps in advocating for policy changes, funding initiatives and resource allocation to support LGBTQ+ entrepreneurs,” said Ryan Husk, Crunchbase’s director of business development. “It enables us to make evidence-based arguments for greater equity and access within the startup ecosystem.”
It was estimated by Backstage Capital that less than 1% of all VC dollars are raised by companies with founders openly within the LGBTQ+ community. Members of the community often face hurdles while fundraising, whether it’s dealing with openly transphobic investors or code-switching to hide one’s sexuality in trepidation of homophobia.
“I’ve heard founders say they delete any mention of same-sex partners, advocacy work or involvement in anything LGBTQ+ while raising capital as they fear investors will see it during due diligence,” said Chasing Rainbows General Partner Patrick Driscoll. "
"Revolut alums raise millions for Vault, a startup offering banking services to Canadian SMBs",Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/06/01,"
Vault, an online banking platform serving small-to-medium sized business (SMBs) in Canada, is launching to the public today after raising $3.7 million in seed funding.
Founded in late 2021 by Saud Aziz and Ahmed Shafik (who previously worked at sunday, Revolut and Koho), Toronto, Ontario-based Vault says its mission is to “revolutionize” the banking experience for Canadian entrepreneurs and SMBs by giving them a place “to manage their money more efficiently and effectively while saving on costly banking fees.”
Vault touts the ability to sign up customers — in this case entrepreneurs and business owners — “quickly,” or in less than five minutes.
While startups offering banking services to SMBs abound in the U.S, they are far less common in Canada, Shafik told TechCrunch. His and Aziz’s parents were small business owners, so the pair saw firsthand the challenges they faced when it came to managing their finances.
“In Canada, there are five big banks, so many business owners have to deal with antiquated processes such as going to a branch to make a $50,000 wire transfer, plus paying an exorbitant amount of fees,” he added. “What you have on the U.S. side with Mercury, Brex and Ramp — it just doesn’t exist here. People are used to going to the branch, calling a branch manager just to deal with daily banking operations.”
Shafik acknowledges there are products that exist for specific use cases. For example, Canadians have access to TransferWise to make transfers, or credit unions if they want to take out a credit card or a loan. But for banking in general, the options are limited.
“It took us about a week and a half just to open our business account,” said Shafik. “In Canada, we’re probably three to five years behind.”
Vault’s customers, the startup claims, pay no monthly or annual fees and don’t have to carry minimum balances. Features include the ability to have local accounts in CAD, USD, GBP and EUR to hold, send and receive funds; a real-time currency exchange that it claims is “10x cheaper” than the big banks; a multi-currency Mastercard corporate card with 1% cashback; spend management for employees; free domestic and international bank transfers to 180 countries and accounting integrations “to automate bookkeeping.”
Vault also announced the ability to purchase investment products, including GICs (guaranteed investment certificates) that it says will earn up to 5.00%. Its goal is to expand its offerings to include lending, savings products, payment automation and more complex FX products later this year. 
Gradient Ventures and Fin Capital co-led Vault’s US$3.7 million seed raise, which closed last year and included participation from The Fintech Fund, Exponent Capital and Thirdbase Capital. Angel investors in the company include founders and executives of companies such as PayPal, Google Pay, Affirm, BNY Mellon, Airbnb, Coinbase, Revolut and Robinhood. 
Vault says it partners with regulated financial institutions and that its customers can see which financial institution is holding their funds via their accounts page. Its Mastercard card is issued by Peoples Trust Company.
Building infrastructure from the ground up
Shafik said that Vault spent its first year just building out the infrastructure for the card transfers and account products in house.
“Infrastructure for fintech is essentially nonexistent here [in Canada],” he told TechCrunch. “We don’t have products to build on top of. You have to build the infrastructure in house, do the diligence with banking partners to come up with compliance programs and launch from scratch.”
Vault targets all industries, Shafik said, and conducted a pilot initially with about 25 companies. Now, he said, the startup is “growing into the 100s per month.” Companies ranging from two employees up to 100 are users, he said with the company’s sweet spot so far being in the “up to 100 employee mark.”
Vault co-founders Ahmed Shafik and Saud Aziz. Image Credits: Vault
When it comes to revenue, Vault says it makes money off interchange and transaction fees.
“We’re excited honestly to come out of the gate with a product that is ready to replace your entire stack from day one, rather than come up with just one product and build over time,” Shafik said. “The reception from Canadian companies has been great, where they’re either using us as a primary account or at least trying us for a vertical.”
Zach Bratun-Glennon, founder and general partner at Gradient Ventures, believes that Canada “is a market with unique financial service and technology needs.”
He wrote via email: “It has a high volume of cross-border transactions, a large number of multinational and distributed employee bases, and is a growing hub for innovation.”
Despite the opportunity, Bratun-Glennon also notes that Canadian financial services have been slow to adopt new technologies, compared to larger markets like the U.S. and the EU. 
“Most businesses rely on traditional banks or a few niche fintech solutions. Vault’s platform can replace a business’ entire financial stack,” he added. “One of Vault’s standout features is its multi-currency functionality. This allows businesses to make and receive payments in multiple currencies, without having to worry about high foreign exchange rates or excessive transfer fees.”

Olé Life wants to make buying life insurance for Latin Americans easier,Christine Hall,2023/06/01,"
Life insurance isn’t something that young, healthy people typically consider buying. It also isn’t always that accessible to those with lower income or easy to buy: It can mean a medical exam and lots of questions to determine the type of coverage and amount needed.
That’s a big part of why Latin America has one of the lowest insurance penetration rates at 1.3%. In addition, 15% of Latin American adults who can afford life insurance policies have one, compared to 52% of U.S. adults.
Miami-based Olé Life wants to change that. It joins others — for example, Equisoft, Turaco, and Acko — in bringing a digital-first approach to regions with low insurance penetration. Others like Mexico-based Minu are offering life insurance benefits via employers.
The full-stack insurance carrier is targeting Latin America’s growing middle class that may have previously been unable to obtain financial protection.
It provides life insurance through the web or a mobile app and has developed a digital underwriting methodology that doesn’t require a medical exam and can underwrite policies of up to $1 million, according to Olé Life co-founder and CEO Michael Carricarte, who has previously founded three other startups in the insurance space.
Here’s how: The platform taps into artificial intelligence to analyze decades’ worth of customer data in minutes to determine policy approval. Its technology also personalized the user experience and simplifies the buying process. In addition, business-to-business partners can embed quoting engines and APIs.
Carricarte formed Olé Life with his brothers, Andrew and Brian, and touts that they are second-generation insurance founders after their father, who was selling insurance in Latin America in the 1970s.

Olé Life currently has members in 30 countries and over 3,000 contracted advisors. In the past year, the company introduced “add-ons,” which are similar to “riders” that insurance agencies offer but that are more along the lines of lifestyle benefits, Carricarte said. One that he noted is unlike what competitors offer is “return on premium,” so, for example, if you pay $500 a year for 20 years and outlive your policy, you get all your money back, Carricarte said
In terms of growth, the company doubled its employees and has issued close to $1 billion in coverage in the past 16 months. Meanwhile, revenue in the first quarter of this year was 73% higher than the same quarter in 2022.
Now Olé Life wants to further advance its AI capabilities, grow its customer base through marketing and expand its number of agents to 5,000. It is doing that with a new $12 million Series A round of funding. Mundi Ventures and AV8 Ventures co-led the investment and was joined by Morro VC and other strategic investors. In total, the company has raised $17 million, including $7 million in previous rounds.
In addition, Carricarte plans to add more health-related and lifestyle add-ons and get into business-to-business opportunities, and the company will be licensed in Mexico and Brazil by the end of this year.
“We want to grow and go fast,” Carricarte said. “We want to work on product distribution and communication. Once we are licensed in these countries, we can really start scaling. Also, the B2B opportunity for us is going to be huge.”

Why per-seat pricing needs to die in the age of AI
How Solar Software Can Save The World



In 2019, I wrote a post on how companies should price their AI-enabled software. I focused on SaaS companies that were developing their own AI and highlighted pricing considerations as they work to improve their models.
Since then, there’s been a meteoric rise of third-party foundational model providers like OpenAI, MosaicML and more. These “AI as a service” vendors have enabled any SaaS player to integrate powerful AI into their application. This has created a mad dash to sprinkle AI pixie dust across the SaaS ecosystem. We’ve seen this among the countless newly minted startups and more established public companies.
The proliferation of this technology raises many questions, including how to deploy it safely, who will win (focused startups or incumbents with existing distribution?) and more. One important area that hasn’t yet been discussed much: how it should be priced.
Below, I lay out a working framework on how to think about pricing the AI in your SaaS application. The space is evolving rapidly, so I’ll update this thinking in future posts.
How much differentiated value do your AI features create?
By definition, these foundational models are accessible to every SaaS provider, so how should you think about pricing what is, in effect, a commodity you’ve integrated into your product? Start with first principles: How much differentiated value does this AI feature create?
By integrating AI features into the flow of your broader platform, you are saving the user time from having to leave their flow to go to the underlying model (ChatGPT, etc). Keeping the user in context can be a powerful unlock.
However, be honest with yourself as to how much value your AI is actually creating. Many AI features in SaaS today are getting a flood of initial tire kicks from curious users but aren’t seeing meaningful sustained adoption. Start by understanding retention and value creation.
 

			SaaS companies should be solving for simplicity and adoption in their AI feature pricing. This is a time for learning and iteration.					


 
Then ask yourself how differentiated your AI offerings are. If the majority of the value your AI feature creates can be garnered by going directly to ChatGPT, don’t try to make a significant margin on that feature. Reselling is not a sustainable value creation strategy (nor differentiation strategy, though that’s a topic for another post).
Even if you aren’t able to charge much for your AI features today, they can create meaningful value by making your current product more valuable and perhaps stickier. They can also be used to drive upsell to higher tiers, all of which can result in increased net dollar retention.
Over time, you can leverage initial features that may today just be a thin wrapper around a third party model to build more differentiated value (more on how below). When you get to that point, you can consider a more value extractive pricing approach.
AI SaaS pricing is in its early days

"Measurabl, an ESG platform for real estate, raises $93M",Kyle Wiggers,2023/05/31,"
Measurabl, a startup developing a platform for environmental, social and governance (ESG) data in the real estate space, today announced that it raised $93 million in a Series D funding tranche co-led by Energy Impact Partners and Sway Ventures.
The round, which Measurabl CEO Matt Ellis described as oversubscribed, brought the company’s total raised to more than $170 million. Moderne Ventures, WVV, Suffolk Construction, Broadscale, Camber Creek, Salesforce Ventures, Building Ventures, Constellation Technology Ventures, Concrete Ventures, RET Ventures, Colliers and Lincoln Property Company were among the others participating.
“This funding allows Measurabl to further enhance its market-leading ESG technologies, expand to new geographies and ensure the real estate industry has the investment grade data necessary to transition to a sustainable, profitable future for all,” Ellis told TechCrunch in an email interview.
Measurabl, founded in 2013 by Ellis, the former director of sustainability solutions at CBRE, the commercial real estate services and investment firm, is riding the wave of startups in the ESG sector attracting serious venture backing. Measurabl offers tools for managing, benchmarking, reporting and tracking the sustainability of a real estate business, from building-level operations to boardroom and capital markets activities.
Measurabl’s tech can automate the collection of electricity, water, fuel, district and waste data from utilities, for example. Or it can maintain social and governance documents alongside environmental data.
“Measurabl’s … solutions are critical for companies seeking to streamline their operations and gain a competitive edge in an increasingly data-driven world,” Brian Nugent, a general partner at Sway Ventures, said in an emailed statement. “As the real estate industry moves toward a more sustainable future, Measurabl’s innovative approach to data management will be essential in providing investment-grade reporting and analysis. This is not just a matter of meeting ESG standards; it is a financial imperative.”
According to a Dow Jones survey, ESG investments are projected to more than double in the next three years, accounting for 15% of all investments by 2025. But recent U.S. political headwinds, such as an attempt spearheaded by Senate and House Republicans to overturn a Labor Department rule allowing retirement plans to consider ESG factors when making investment decisions, threaten to depress the market’s growth.
Case in point: During the final months of 2022, investors pulled nearly $6.2 billion more out of sustainable funds than they put in, according to Morningstar.
Measurabl’s successful financing would suggest that there’s still an appetite for ESG, though. The company’s momentum most likely had something to do with it; Measurabl has over 1,000 customers and claims to be used by 40% of global real estate asset managers.
Another factor in Measurabl’s favor is the increasing pressure on the real estate market to change — often in the form of municipal-level carbon emissions laws. (According to one source, real estate drives roughly 39% of total worldwide emissions — much of it generated by manufacturing materials used in buildings and the rest from the buildings themselves and generating energy to power the buildings.) Estimates out of the U.N. climate conference COP26 suggest that $14 trillion of buildings will be uninsurable over the next 20 years if they don’t meet climate and efficiency standards.
“Measurabl is the world’s most widely adopted ESG data management platform for real estate,” Ellis said. “[Customers use it to] decarbonize buildings, mitigate physical climate risk, comply with regulation and underwrite sustainability risks in real estate transactions.”

Indian SaaS startup Capillary Technologies grabs $45M to expand globally,Jagmeet Singh,2023/05/31,"
Capillary Technologies, an Indian SaaS startup that offers solutions for loyalty management and customer engagement, has raised $45 million in a funding round, as it plans to expand into global markets and widen its reach through mergers and acquisitions. The funding arrives at a crucial time amidst the prevailing market slowdown, where startups, particularly those at the late stage, are facing a capital crunch.
Capillary’s Series D funding round was led by Avataar Ventures and its LPs Pantheon, 57Stars and Unigestion. It also saw participation from Filter Capital and InnoVen Capital. The round comprises $40 million in equity and about $5-$7 million in debt. With the latest capital injection, the startup has raised nearly $150 million in capital to date.
Founded in 2012, Capillary Technologies initially focused on the retail vertical in India and Southeast Asia. In recent years, it has broadened its offerings and launched in more markets, including the Middle East and South Africa, and since early 2021, the U.S.
Capillary is carving a distinctive niche in the market with its emphasis on gamification to bolster customer loyalty, a strategy it says it has been able to deploy across commerce, retail, aviation and hospitality sectors.
The Bengaluru-based startup’s suite of technology-driven, cloud-native solutions has helped it attract a number of clients. Already, it has collaborated with over 250 brands across 30 countries, powering more than 100 loyalty programs. High-profile clients include Domino’s, Tata Group, Puma, Shell, Petron and Marks & Spencer. Capillary’s tech reaches over a billion customers and clocks over 5 billion transactions annually.
“The way most of our competitors in the U.S. and elsewhere have built in as like a services business where customers ask you something, and you build it. On the other hand, we have taken a very product view to it,” Capillary Technologies founder and managing director Aneesh Reddy said in an interview.
Just over a couple of years after entering the U.S. and acquiring the customer experience startup Persuade, Capillary’s business has grown by 3.5x, the startup said, without disclosing specific numbers. It also says the U.S. now accounts for more than a third of its revenues.
The startup has made five acquisitions in the U.S., with the last one of Texas-based loyalty solutions provider Brierley from Nomura announced in April this year. These acquisitions have helped it to introduce solutions to clients operating in wider verticals.
Reddy told TechCrunch that Capillary is seeking to leverage the fresh funding to expand its presence in the U.S. and Europe through actively pursuing strategic acquisitions, as part of its growth strategy.
“The core business is profitable and growing by itself, so most of the funding is going to be used for acquisitions,” he said. “As you would guess, if you have the money, this is a great time to buy.”
In late 2021, Capillary Technologies filed its draft papers to go public in India. The startup has, though, delayed that plan due to the ongoing market slowdown. Reddy said the idea of filing an IPO in India is still being considered and he may execute that within the next three years.
“The good piece of Capillary is it’s profitable. With this fundraise, we have a lot of excess cash also on the balance sheet. So, it’s not like I have a gun to my head to list,” he said.
Capillary has a headcount of over 750 people, including 200 contractors, and has offices in Dubai, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, apart from India and the U.S. It counts Sequoia Capital and Warburg Pincus among its existing backers.
“It has been truly remarkable witnessing Capillary’s business transformation over the past four years,” said Mohan Kumar, managing partner at Avataar Ventures, in a statement.
“The strategic decision to diversify from Asia into the US and Europe, encompassing various consumer verticals beyond retail, has been nothing short of impressive. This move has catapulted Capillary into a leadership position in Loyalty software and this has been recognized by external mentions like the Forrester Wave. Given the expanded addressable market and the immense potential that lies ahead, Avataar is wholeheartedly committed to supporting Capillary in its pursuit to become a global market leader.”

Lightmatter’s photonic AI hardware is ready to shine with $154M in new funding,Devin Coldewey,2023/05/31,"
Photonic computing startup Lightmatter is taking its big shot at the rapidly growing AI computation market with a hardware-software combo it claims will help the industry level up — and save a lot of electricity to boot.
Lightmatter’s chips basically use optical flow to solve computational processes like matrix vector products. This math is at the heart of a lot of AI work and currently performed by GPUs and TPUs that specialize in it but use traditional silicon gates and transistors.
The issue with those is that we’re approaching the limits of density and therefore speed for a given wattage or size. Advances are still being made but at great cost and pushing the edges of classical physics. The supercomputers that make training models like GPT-4 possible are enormous, consume huge amounts of power and produce a lot of waste heat.
“The biggest companies in the world are hitting an energy power wall and experiencing massive challenges with AI scalability. Traditional chips push the boundaries of what’s possible to cool, and data centers produce increasingly large energy footprints. AI advances will slow significantly unless we deploy a new solution in data centers,” said Lightmatter CEO and founder Nick Harris.
“Some have projected that training a single large language model can take more energy than 100 U.S. homes consume in a year. Additionally, there are estimates that 10%-20% of the world’s total power will go to AI inference by the end of the decade unless new compute paradigms are created.”
Lightmatter, of course, intends to be one of those new paradigms. Its approach is, at least potentially, faster and more efficient, using arrays of microscopic optical waveguides to let the light essentially perform logic operations just by passing through them: a sort of analog-digital hybrid. Since the waveguides are passive, the main power draw is creating the light itself, then reading and handling the output.
One really interesting aspect of this form of optical computing is that you can increase the power of the chip just by using more than one color at once. Blue does one operation while red does another — though in practice it’s more like 800 nanometers wavelength does one, 820 does another. It’s not trivial to do so, of course, but these “virtual chips” can vastly increase the amount of computation done on the array. Twice the colors, twice the power.
Harris started the company based on optical computing work he and his team did at MIT (which is licensing the relevant patents to them) and managed to wrangle an $11 million seed round back in 2018. One investor said then that “this isn’t a science project,” but Harris admitted in 2021 that while they knew “in principle” the tech should work, there was a hell of a lot to do to make it operational. Fortunately, he was telling me that in the context of investors dropping a further $80 million on the company.
Now Lightmatter has raised a $154 million C round and is preparing for its actual debut. It has several pilots going with its full stack of Envise (computing hardware), Passage (interconnect, crucial for large computing operations) and Idiom, a software platform that Harris says should let machine learning developers adapt quickly.

“We’ve built a software stack that integrates seamlessly with PyTorch and TensorFlow. The workflow for machine learning developers is the same from there — we take the neural networks built in these industry standard applications and import our libraries, so all the code runs on Envise,” he explained.
The company declined to make any specific claims about speedups or efficiency improvements, and because it’s a different architecture and computing method it’s hard to make apples-to-apples comparisons. But we’re definitely talking along the lines of an order of magnitude, not a measly 10% or 15%. Interconnect is similarly upgraded, since it’s useless to have that level of processing isolated on one board.
Of course, this is not the kind of general-purpose chip that you could use in your laptop; it’s highly specific to this task. But it’s the lack of task specificity at this scale that seems to be holding back AI development — though “holding back” is the wrong term since it’s moving at great speed. But that development is hugely costly and unwieldy.
The pilots are in beta, and mass production is planned for 2024, at which point presumably they ought to have enough feedback and maturity to deploy in data centers.
The funding for this round came from SIP Global, Fidelity Management & Research Company, Viking Global Investors, GV, HPE Pathfinder and existing investors.

Six tips for getting the most out of your SIEM investment,Eric Thomas,2023/05/31,"




Eric Thomas

Eric Thomas is vice president of security GTM at Logz.io, an open source observability platform for DevOps teams.	

Security information and event management (SIEM) is one of the most well-established categories of security software, having first been introduced about 20 years ago. Nevertheless, very little has been written about SIEM vendor evaluation and management.
To fill that gap, here are six top-line tips on procuring and implementing a SIEM solution for maximum value.
Evaluating and purchasing a SIEM solution
Size your spend
SIEM software solutions are priced differently: either by the number of employees in the customer organization, by the rate of events per second or based on the log volume ingested. It’s important to figure this out early to get a rough idea of what you will pay over time. You’ll also identify the various data sources meaningful to your security operations center (SOC).
 

			Buying a SIEM is a massive commitment: You and your organization will need to live with your decision for years to come.					


If you already have a SIEM in place, give the vendor your current use cases and consumption, and they should be able to replicate it. If you don’t, you’ll need to do a little leg work. A good starting point is assessing the volume of logs you’ll send to the SIEM. Measure actual daily log volume from each source by checking out the locally stored logs for a “normal” day and tallying the results.
If the SIEM vendor charges by your number of employees, be wary. This is usually a way to charge more for the SIEM by counting employees who don’t generate any relevant data.
Evaluate your vendor’s practices
The next step is to conduct a proof-of-concept (POC); this should be a starting point for an eventual implementation, not a standalone, canned exercise. During this process, your vendor should demonstrate a service level that you’ll want to maintain post-sale. Here are some key questions to consider during this process:

Who will staff your account? Ideally, a vendor will commit skilled technical staff to both execute your initial evaluation and conduct an implementation.
Who from your team will take the technical lead on the evaluation, and who’ll ultimately implement it? Ideally this will be the same person or small group of people.
After you buy a SIEM, what’s next on your roadmap? SOAR? CSPM? Make sure your vendor can integrate with a broad range of technologies.
It’s critical to fully understand the vendor’s front- and back-end software architecture. Some vendors calling themselves “true SaaS” or “cloud-native” are not. Don’t lock yourself into a 12-month contract when you don’t know what’s going on under the hood.

Don’t be fooled: Know the total cost of implementation "
Realta Fusion lights up with $9M seed for industrial heat led by Khosla Ventures,Tim De Chant,2023/05/31,"
Fusion power is often said to harness the power of the sun, so why are we just trying to make electricity with it?
That’s essentially what the co-founders at Realta Fusion were thinking when they formed the company to transform an experimental reactor design into a power source that wouldn’t just provide electricity, but also heat. Industrial heat alone represents nearly 10% of carbon pollution in the U.S., according to the Department of Energy.
Fusion, unlike some other decarbonized power sources, works best when it’s run 24-7, a set that jibes with many users of industrial-strength heat like chemical refining or metal smelting. “They’re not going to be saying, ‘Yeah, sure, shut our plant down whenever we don’t have power,’” Realta co-founder and CEO Kieran Furlong told TechCrunch+.
While there aren’t many solutions yet, those same industries are under pressure from investors and customers to remove carbon from their operations. While commercial fusion power is probably a decade away at best, its timeline isn’t too different from other candidates like hydrogen that are looking to replace fossil fuels as sources of industrial heat.
Realta is looking to ignite the plasma in its industrial-scale demo plant in the early 2030s, but to get there, it first has to design a smaller prototype plant that builds on work done at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. To realize those plans, the startup has raised a $9 million seed round led by Khosla Ventures alongside a $3 million grant from the Department of Energy’s ARPA-E program, both of which were announced Wednesday. "
Cortex raises $35M Series B for its internal developer portal,Frederic Lardinois,2023/05/31,"
Cortex, a startup building an internal developer portal that helps engineering teams build better software at scale, today announced a $35 million Series B funding round led by IVP. Craft Ventures, along with existing investors Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global and Y Combinator, also participated in this round, which brings the company’s total funding to just under $53 million.
The service started as a tool for helping developers wrangle their microservices architectures. That remained Cortex’s main marketing message when it raised its Series A round, but since then, it has widened its focus to this new emphasis on its role as an internal developer portal. That’s clearly working for the company, which saw its revenue grow 400% year-over-year. Among Cortex’s new customers are the likes of TripAdvisor, Docker, Grammarly, Unity and SoFi.

What you should know about internal developer portals

“A lot of that stems from the observations and the conversations we’ve had with customers and prospects over the past year,” Cortex co-founder and CEO Anish Dhar said. “I think one of the core things that we’ve started to see is that once a company has around 80 to 100 engineers, things start living in people’s heads. That’s when the spreadsheets that track all of the services are being created. But then, once the company grows, it almost gets exponentially worse.” As these companies grow, not having better visibility into their engineering organization also increasingly becomes a liability. When you don’t know who owns a service — or a service doesn’t have an owner anymore after an employee left — critical vulnerabilities can go unpatched for a long time.
At its core, Cortex always had a catalog of all the services that a company ran and with that, it gathered a lot of valuable data. “Once we’re deployed inside of a company, you start seeing really strong engagement from not only the developers but then other practitioners like SRE and security teams who are constantly running these initiatives to remediate, improve and build that culture of service reliability and ownership.”

In its product, Cortex provides users with services and resources catalogs, as well as with scorecards to see how well they are performing against benchmarks for production readiness and development quality, hubs for every team to help them understand who owns what and improve collaboration, as well as, most recently, a new scaffolding service that allows teams to standardize their service architecture and set up repeatable processes for spinning up new ones.
Cortex co-founder and CTO Ganesh Datta also noted that, increasingly, engineering leaders are pushing their developers to care more about the quality of their code and following standards. “That’s where we took a step back and said: We have all this stuff in the catalog, but how do we take that and help you go on this journey to get to a place where now developers are thinking about this stuff on their own?”
That’s also what the team plans to focus on now. With all of this visibility into ownership and services, the team has already built out more tools to allow developers to take action right from the portal, starting with the scaffolding service. The focus now is to expand on this and help developers manage more of their ecosystem from within the developer portal.
“I think what you have [in Cortex] is a really opinionated perspective on how people should eventually arrive at a well-done Internal Developer Portal,” said Cack Wilhelm, general partner at IVP and now a Cortex board member. “I don’t think it’s enough to attack scorecards or scaffolding or incident management or engineering, metrics and productivity. I think what you’re really looking at here is a culture change within an organization and you can’t just piecemeal that. What we loved about Anish and Ganesh is their vision — having a really comprehensive, opinionated stance on how an organization might go about doing that and then the ability — through product — to get a company to that sort of Nirvana state.”

"Okay, which analyzes engineers’ productivity, sells to Stripe",Mary Ann Azevedo,2023/05/31,"
Fintech giant Stripe has acquired Okay, a startup that developed a low-code analytics software to help engineering leaders better understand how their teams are performing, the companies told TechCrunch exclusively.
Founded in 2019, Okay participated in Y Combinator’s Winter 2020 cohort before going on to raise a total of $6.6 million in capital from the likes of Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins. Angel investors include executives from Plaid, Brex and Instacart, along with Stripe CEO Patrick Collison.
Financial terms of the deal, which marks Stripe’s first acquisition since it bought card reader provider BBPOS in January of 2022, were not disclosed.
Co-founders Antoine Boulanger (CEO) and Tomas Barreto (CTO) met while working at Box — Boulanger as a senior director of engineering and Barreto as a VP of engineering. Prior to starting Okay, Boulanger was working as a senior engineering manager at Google and Barreto was a vice president of product and engineering at Checkr.
The pair told TechCrunch in 2020 that in the process of building out a suite of in-house tools designed to help managers at Box understand their teams better, they realized the opportunity for a subscription toolset that could help managers across companies. For the most part, Boulanger says that Okay was designed to largely replace tools built in-house as well.
Getting a picture of an engineering team’s productivity involves plugging into Okay’s toolsets and gathering data into a digestible feed. The dashboards can be built on top of developer tools’ data such as GitHub and Jira.
In a nutshell, Okay was aimed at giving companies a way to build engineering effectiveness dashboards on top of developer tools.
“We use metrics and data to make an engineering team more efficient and effective,” Boulanger told TechCrunch in an interview. “It looks very much like [analytics software] Mixpanel or Amplitude but applied to engineering work. The difference is that we are very focused on finding the bottlenecks that are affecting engineers on their day-to day-activities — more on their inputs…rather than outputs, like lines of codes.”
Of course now that it has been acquired by Stripe, Okay will transition out of serving its other customers — which in the past have included Brex, Plaid and Intercom — to exclusively serving Stripe. Okay had seven employees prior to the acquisition. The co-founders declined to share if all seven employees would be joining Stripe.
“Our approach…aligns with Stripe engineering values: by increasing engineering effectiveness, Stripe will be better positioned to attract and retain talented engineers,” Boulanger said.
While Okay would not share any recent revenue metrics, the company told TechCrunch in February of 2022 that it had seen both its revenue and customer base grow around 10 times, including adding on customers such as Sourcegraph and mParticle. 
It was while pitching Stripe in 2022 that the small startup “really hit it off with the engineering leaders, and “from there, it evolved into more of an acquisition discussion,” said Boulander.
As a SaaS company, Okay made money by selling subscriptions to its software.
“Stripe was the kind of customer we served,” Boulanger said. “They were usually companies in the pre-IPO phase with hundreds to thousands of engineers where the manager wanted to start tracking what others are doing, and looking for tools to help with decision-making.”
Today, Okay is being folded into Stripe’s engineering department.
Boulanger said that prior to this acquisition, Okay had regular conversations with other potential acquirers but concluded that “Stripe was really special.”
Stripe, which is one of the world’s highest-valued private companies, has had some struggles as the payments space in which it operates only continues to get more competitive and the IPO market has dried up. In the past year alone, companies such as Plaid and Finix have released competing products, for example. And Stripe, which has yet to go public via a long-awaited IPO, earlier this year raised $6.5 billion at a $50 billion valuation after being valued at $95 billion in March of 2021. Stripe’s latest raise took place months after the company laid off about 1,120 workers, or 14% of its workforce, in November of 2022 after saying it had “overhired for the world we’re in.”
Stripe declined to comment on its acquisition of Okay, outside of confirming that it had taken place and this tweet from CTO David Singleton.

"Hyro secures $20M for its AI-powered, healthcare-focused conversational platform",Kyle Wiggers,2023/05/31,"
Israel Krush and Rom Cohen first met in an AI course at Cornell Tech, where they bonded over a shared desire to apply AI voice technologies to the healthcare sector. Specifically, they sought to automate the routine messages and calls that often lead to administrative burnout, like calls about scheduling, prescription refills and searching through physician directories.
Several years after graduating, Krush and Cohen productized their ideas with Hyro, which uses AI to facilitate text and voice conversations across the web, call centers and apps between healthcare organizations and their clients. Hyro today announced that it raised $20 million in a Series B round led by Liberty Mutual, Macquarie Capital and Black Opal, bringing the startup’s total raised to $35 million.
Krush says that the new cash will be put toward expanding Hyro’s go-to-market teams and R&D.
“When we searched for a domain that would benefit from transforming these technologies most, we discovered and validated that healthcare, with staffing shortages and antiquated processes, had the greatest need and pain points, and have continued to focus on this particular vertical,” Krush told TechCrunch in an email interview.
To Krush’s point, the healthcare industry faces a major staffing shortfall, exacerbated by the logistical complications that arose during the pandemic. In a recent interview with Keona Health, Halee Fischer-Wright, CEO of Medical Group Management Association (MGMA), said that MGMA’s heard that 88% of medical practices have had difficulties recruiting front-of-office staff over the last year. By another estimates, the healthcare field has lost 20% of its workforce.
Hyro doesn’t attempt to replace staffers. But it does inject automation into the equation. The platform is essentially a drop-in replacement for traditional IVR systems, handling calls and texts automatically using conversational AI.
Hyro can answer common questions and handle tasks like booking or rescheduling an appointment, providing engagement and conversion metrics on the backend as it does so.
Plenty of platforms do — or at least claim to. See RedRoute, a voice-based conversational AI startup that delivers an “Alexa-like” customer service experience over the phone. Elsewhere, there’s Omilia, which provides a conversational solution that works on all platforms (e.g. phone, web chat, social networks, SMS and more) and integrates with existing customer support systems.
But Krush claims that Hyro is differentiated. For one, he says, it offers an AI-powered search feature that scrapes up-to-date information from a customer’s website — ostensibly preventing wrong answers to questions (a notorious problem with text-generating AI). Hyro also boasts “smart routing,” which enables it to “intelligently” decide whether to complete a task automatically, send a link to self-serve via SMS or route a request to the right department.

“Our AI assistants have been used by tens of millions of patients, automating conversations on various channels,” Krush said. “Hyro creates a feedback loop by identifying missing knowledge gaps, basically mimicking the operations of a call center agent. It also shows within a conversation exactly how the AI assistant deduced the correct response to a patient or customer query, meaning that if incorrect answers were given, an enterprise can understand exactly which piece of content or dataset is labeled incorrectly and fix accordingly.”
Of course, no technology’s perfect, and Hyro’s likely isn’t an exception to the rule. But the startup’s sales pitch was enough to win over dozens of healthcare networks, providers and hospitals as clients, including Weill Cornell Medicine. Annual recurring revenue has doubled since Hyro went to market in 2019, Krush claims.
Hyro’s future plans entail expanding to industries adjacent to healthcare, including real estate and the public sector, as well as rounding out the platform with more customization options, business optimization recommendations and “variety” in the AI skills that Hyro supports.
“The pandemic expedited digital transformation for healthcare and made the problems we’re solving very clear and obvious (e.g. the spike in calls surrounding information, access to testing, etc.),” Krush said. “We were one of the first to offer a COVID-19 virtual assistant that deployed in under 48 hours based on trusted information from the health system and trusted resources such as the CDC and World Health Organization …. Hyro is well funded, with good growth and momentum, and we’ve always managed a responsible budget, so we’re actually looking to expand and gather more market share while competitors are slowing down.”
