Deepwrk integrates coworking, gamification, and community to help people with ADHD focus, escape distractions and get more done when working from home.
The platform facilitates body doubling sessions which help members start, stay on track and complete tasks. Users join online deep work sprints and complete their individual tasks in the presence of others. These sprints serve as an anchor that helps those with ADHD avoid distractions, boost motivation and maintain focus. 
The deep work sprints are typically 1 or 2 hours long. During these sessions, members join a small group where they share goals, work on their individual tasks (in silence) and, in the end, check in to discuss progress.
Deepwrk also empowers users to track their progress and provides incentives to maintain focus and consistency. The platform combines gamification rooted in behavioural science with a sense of community to make even the most challenging and tedious tasks more enjoyable and easier to complete.
Deepwrk is a platform specifically designed for people with ADHD who work remotely or from home. It brings out the best parts of the office - a sense of community and gentle social accountability - without the dreaded commute and relentless distractions.

A distinctive, personality-matched pair of high-quality socks is then sent to the subscriber once a month. And because they don’t know exactly what’s coming until it arrives at their door, the lucky recipients get a nice surprise — every time.
Sock Geeks also provide a guarantee with every pair of socks they send out. If the recipient doesn’t like them, they can send them back and receive a free replacement.",None,['E-commerce'],Shipping,None,None,2017/05/1,None,5,None,1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0
