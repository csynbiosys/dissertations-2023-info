New Unicorn Creation Has Dwindled From 2 Per Day To 2 Per Month,Gené Teare,2023/08/16,"

Only two companies joined The Crunchbase Unicorn Board in July — the lowest monthly count since we started tracking new unicorn pacing by month at the beginning of 2020.
Both new companies are in the Web3 sector, and neither are from the U.S.
The pace of new unicorn creation marks a big shift from 2021, when the average was more than two unicorns per work day. Even in 2022, new unicorns still averaged more than one per work day.

So far this year, new unicorns have averaged one every three to four work days.


July’s new unicorns:

Months-old Zyber 365, an India-based blockchain operating system company that raised a $100 million Series A funding led by Sram & Mram. The company was valued at $1.2 billion.
Three-year-old Flashbots, a developer of software for more efficient maximal extractable value mining on the Ethereum blockchain. The Cayman-based company raised a $60 million Series B round led by crypto investor Paradigm at a $1 billion valuation.

Unicorn funding dwindles
July also marked the lowest month for funding to current unicorn companies, with $2.2 billion raised compared to $6.6 billion for July 2022.
That’s yet another indication of how much investors have slowed their pace in investing in private high-growth companies.

Methodology
The Crunchbase Unicorn Board is a curated list that includes private unicorn companies with post-money valuations of $1 billion or more and is based on Crunchbase data. New companies are added to the Unicorn Board as they reach the $1 billion valuation mark as part of a funding round.
The unicorn board does not reflect internal company valuations — such as those set via a 409a process for employee stock options — as these differ from, and are more likely to be lower than, a priced funding round. We also do not adjust valuations based on investor writedowns, which change quarterly, as different investors will not value the same company consistently within the same quarter.
Funding to unicorn companies includes all private financings to companies that are tagged as unicorns, as well as those that have since graduated to The Exited Unicorn Board.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.

Crypto Custody Startup BitGo Hits $1.75B Valuation After $100M Series C,Chris Metinko,2023/08/16,"

Last August, digital asset investment firm Galaxy Digital called off its proposed $1.2 billion acquisition of crypto custody firm BitGo — severing what would have been one of the largest deals in crypto history.
A year later, Palo Alto, California-based BitGo was able to lock in an even higher valuation from investors, raising a $100 million Series C at a $1.75 billion valuation.
The company did not disclose who participated in the round, outside of saying it was “new, outside strategic investors.” Previous investors include Valor Equity Partners, GS Growth and Redpoint Ventures.

The cash infusion will be used for  strategic acquisitions and to grow BitGo’s regulated custody, wallet and infrastructure solutions.
Since the start of the year, BitGo has seen a 60% increase in newly onboarded clients. The company also currently is the custody provider for FTX creditors.
“Not only are we seeing growing demand for regulated custody solutions in the US, but we’re also seeing the demand on a global scale,” said CEO Mike Belshe in a release.
State of crypto
Even with Bitcoin prices up 75% since the start of the year, it seems like most headlines about the crypto industry center on regulations.
So it does seem logical that one of the biggest rounds of the year would go to a licensed crypto wallet startup.
The round, however, is eye-catching considering how few nine-figure raises there have been this year in crypto. BitGo’s is only the sixth such round in a down year for crypto funding.
Thus far this year, crypto startups have raised less then $2.8 billion, per Crunchbase data. That is a small pittance next to the more than $15 billion such startups raised last year.

"
‘Winners Take None’ Is A Mantra For Many In The Unicorn Era,Joanna Glasner,2023/08/15,"

When heavily funded startups vie for dominance in a hot, emerging sector, we usually expect at least one will come out on top.
But in case after case lately, that hasn’t happened. Rather, in spaces from co-working to scooters to used car sales, multiple unicorns have simply petered out.
“Winners take none” is the phrase that Hunter Walk, partner at seed and early-stage investor Homebrew, used in a recent blog post to describe this phenomenon. He notes that investors committed vast sums to multiple markets where fast scaling and large capital expenditures failed to produce successful companies.

So in which sectors has this theme been playing out most conspicuously? Using Crunchbase data on unicorn rounds, we put together a list of areas where startups raised gobs of cash without yet producing an emergent winner or winners.
Top sectors in which winners have not emerged
Co-working: WeWork, which raised over $7 billion in venture funding before going public in 2021, warned this week that it may go bankrupt. Its downward trajectory illustrates that even the most well-known and heavily funded startup in the co-working space wasn’t able to build a sustainable business. Others that raised funding when the flexible workspace sector was hot — including Knotel and Ucommune — have also struggled.
Scooters: Between 2017 and 2021, venture capitalists poured billions into so-called micromobility startups, most of which relied wholly or partly on electric scooters. This bet hasn’t gone particularly well. Bird, the first unicorn in the space, is now a penny stock. Many of the most heavily funded players in the space, meanwhile, haven’t raised equity funding in years.
Fast grocery delivery: Ultrafast grocery delivery was also an area where billions were invested, and no clear leader has emerged. The instant grocery delivery services Gorillas and Jokr were quick to soar and then falter. The two raised more than $1.7 billion in 2021 and 2022, then later moved to cut staff and shutter regional operations. And Philadelphia-based Gopuff, which raised more than $3 billion in equity funding, has also reportedly made multiple rounds of layoffs.
Autonomous vehicles: From the mid-2010s through the IPO boom of 2021, autonomous vehicle-related startups were a popular sector for venture investors. But on public markets, they promptly drove themselves off a cliff. An October analysis of 14 companies that went public in the prior couple years shows an average post-debut decline of more than 80%. When we revisited just now, we found the majority have since declined further, and not all are still going concerns.
E-commerce aggregators: Copious sums also went to e-commerce aggregators, or startups that make a business of buying up smaller online retailers selling on Amazon and other platforms. Thrasio, Perch, Branded, Society Brands, Razor Group and others raised billions in equity funding and billions more in debt financings. In recent quarters, funding has largely dried up, followed by layoffs and some consolidation among once high-flying players. We’ll stay tuned to see if an emergent winner comes out on top.
Used cars: These are tough times for venture-backed used car startups, several of which are now public and faced with the combination of declining vehicle prices, rising interest rates and growing inventory. Shares of Cazoo and Vroom are down more than 95% from their peaks, and a merger between two other used car platforms, Shift and Carlotz, has also performed poorly. Meanwhile stock in Carvana, known for its iconic towers of cars, has staged a comeback in recent months, but is still far off its former highs.
Those are just a few examples
The above are just a few examples of spaces where major funding went in, and no obvious winners have come out. Other areas that come to mind include meal kits, ghost kitchens, virtual events, moving and storage, and vertical farming.
The existence of so many case studies indicates that the idea of competition always producing a winner should be left to the sports world. In the startup space, fierce rivalry does not always translate into success for the fiercest.

"
What Does ‘Dry Powder’ Actually Mean For Startups?,Guest Author,2023/08/15,"

By Dan Gray
As startup fundraising appears to be stabilizing after a few tumultuous years, there’s one topic which has reliably featured in that conversation: dry powder.
“Dry powder” refers to the amount of money that limited partners have committed to venture capital funds. Rather than being delivered upfront, that capital is requested in increments by VCs during the first few years of a fund in order to meet funding obligations to founders. That estimated number stood at around $580 billion at the end of 2022.

Depending on who you listen to, this mountain of capital is either a bullish signal — as VCs take advantage of the post-bubble environment to snatch up equity at bargain prices — or it’s meaningless, as poor fund performance, slower exits and higher interest rates incentivise LPs to direct their money elsewhere.
The truth, as always, is complicated.
Dan Gray of Equidam
Similar to VC term sheets (funding agreements with startups), we’ve learned that LP capital commitments aren’t as binding as the industry would have liked to believe two years ago. However, that theoretical pile-up of available capital is still a positive signal.
Not all of it will materialize, and VCs will have to be more disciplined with their deployment, but it is certainly better than starting with less, or zero.
Not everyone is affected equally
How this plays out will differ significantly between early- and growth-stage funding, emphasizing the distinct nature of the two disciplines, capital requirements and their recent behavior.
Generally speaking, pre-seed- and seed-focused firms aren’t suffering too much from the excesses of 2021 and 2022. Mainly, there’s greater recognition that they can no longer just pass hot deals up the chain for a bumped-up valuation, that era is over.
Growth-stage funds are in a real predicament. Remember that scene in “The Hangover” where the protagonists woke up in the hotel suite? Well, growth VCs are staring, bleary-eyed, at funky cap tables, down rounds and zombie companies. Lots of aspirin required.
In addition to the bifurcation of early- and growth-stage VC, we must also consider performance. Generally, the smaller, specialist firms are more likely to have maintained discipline, and the faith of their LPs, over the last few years, while the bigger generalists are more likely to have fallen victim to momentum.
What LPs are looking for
The model which emerged in venture capital over the last decade is dead. There is no appetite for the consensus-driven megadeals, nor the promise of exits that can support them. The asset class must return to its roots: identifying outlier opportunities in large markets. Finding winners, rather than trying to manufacture them with cheap capital.
If I was an LP in an early-stage firm I’d be comfortable seeing the pace of deployment on par with the past two years. I’d be looking for managers whose theses are rooted in that pursuit of outliers, who are guided by a degree of sectoral expertise rather than the ‘flavor of the month’ technology.
If I was an LP in a growth-stage firm I’d be hoping they were looking at ways to clear the minefield. Bridge rounds to reach profitability, zeroing out the zombies, doubling down to support the strongest performers, and continuing to look for good bets. Not sitting on the sidelines, waiting to see how things shake out.
The capital is out there for high-performing firms that have a compelling vision to share with prospective LPs (similar to the fundraising advice given to founders earlier this year). Transparency, discipline and standardization should be priorities if this industry wants to accelerate on this road to recovery, and a better model for the future.

AI Startup Anthropic Raises More Cash — $100M From South Korea’s SK Telecom,Chris Metinko,2023/08/14,"

While summer may be starting to wane, investors’ appetite for all things AI is not.
Anthropic — a ChatGPT rival with its AI assistant Claude — raised a $100 million round from SK Telecom, as South Korea’s largest telco looks to grow its AI-related telecommunications business.
As part of the deal, the San Francisco-based AI startup will build a large language model customized for telcos.
In the last 16 months, Anthropic has raised more than $1.4 billion. In April 2022, the startup raised a $580 million Series B led by disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.
Then in February, it was reported that Google had invested $300 million in the startup.

Finally in May, the company raised a $450 million Series C led by Spark Capital with participation from Google, Salesforce Ventures1, Sound Ventures, Zoom Ventures and others. Anthropic did not release a valuation, but the round came after reports it was raising a round at a pre-investment valuation of $4.1 billion.
Big rounds
The big round comes after other reports late last week that Modular, an AI software developer that allows users to train machine-learning models on a variety of chips, is in talks with General Catalyst and others to raise a Series A at a $600 million valuation.
The new rounds — both announced and reported — add to an impressive collection of huge raises by AI startups already this year as investors fear being left behind on the game-changing AI trend.
Startups such as AlphaSense, Character.ai and Adept AI have raised massive nine-figure rounds this calendar year at astronomical valuations.
Of course the craze started in January with news of Microsoft’s massive $10 billion investment into OpenAI — creator of ChatGPT.

"The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Neuralink Connects With $270M, Biotech Goes Big Again",Chris Metinko,2023/08/11,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out The Crunchbase Megadeals Tracker.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.
Although much of the talk this week was about a big raise for a big brain-implant startup, biotech actually ruled. Three of the top five rounds went to biotech firms, with the rare big cyber insurance raise also in the mix. However, after only a handful of really big rounds, dollar size for raises dropped off quickly.
1. Neuralink, $280M, neuroscience: The week started off with a bang, as Elon Musk’s brain-implant company Neuralink announced (on Musk-owned X, of course) it had raised $280 million in new funding from investors to develop its technology. The round was led by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund. No valuation was released, but in June, Reuters reported that the company was valued at about $5 billion after secondary stock trades. Neuralink, which is attempting to have people communicate with computers through brain function, received approval for its first in-human clinical trial earlier this year. The company has not been without controversy. Last year, it was reported the company was rushing surgeries on animals to try and get government approvals. Founded in 2016, the company has raised $643 million, per Crunchbase.

2. ADARx Pharmaceuticals, $200M, biotech: Biotech had a slow week — by biotech standards — last week as far as huge rounds go. However, it made a nice comeback this week. First up is San Diego-based ADARx Pharmaceuticals, a clinical-stage startup developing next-generation RNA therapeutics, which locked up a $200 million Series C led jointly by Bain Capital Life Sciences and TCG Crossover. The 4-year-old firm has developed RNA platforms and tech for editing target mRNA and is developing therapeutics for treating genetic, cardiovascular, central nervous system and other types of disease. Founded in 2019, the company has raised $332 million, per Crunchbase.
3. Alltrna, $109M, biotech: That was not all from biotech this week. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Alltrna, a startup looking to develop genetic medicines based on transfer RNA molecules, locked up a $109 million Series B. The company did not announce a lead investor, but said investors included Flagship Pioneering — which founded the startup — and “a number of top-tier investors.” Alltrna is one of the few biotech companies trying to use tRNA biology to correct diseases using its own platform. Founded in 2018, the company has now raised $159 million, according to Crunchbase.
4. Resilience, $100M, cybersecurity: Not that long ago, cyber insurance didn’t really exist as firms struggled with exactly how to measure cyber risk at a company. That time is long gone. Cyber insurance is definitely a thing, and San Francisco-based Resilience raised $100 million to help prove that. The startup helps companies analyze their systems to see what risks and attacks could affect them, and partners with underwriters to write policies. The round was led by Intact Ventures, the venture arm of Intact Insurance. Founded in 2017, the company has raised $217 million, per Crunchbase.
5. Georgiamune, $75M, biotech: We go back to biotech. Gaithersburg, Maryland-based Georgiamune, another clinical-stage biotechnology company, raised a $75 million Series A co-led by General Catalyst and the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy. However, perhaps the bigger news for the company is that it achieved U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance for its investigational new drug application for its dual-functioning monoclonal antibody to overcome immunotherapy resistance. Founded in 2014, this is the firm’s first outside round, per Crunchbase.
6. Verdagy, $73M, renewable energy: Moss Landing, California-based Verdagy, which is scaling electrolyzer technologies for the production of green hydrogen, closed a $73 million Series B co-led by Temasek and Shell Ventures. Founded in 2021, the company has raised $117 million, per Crunchbase.
7. Simon Data, $54M, data: New York-based Simon Data, a customer data platform developer, locked up a $54 million Series D led by Macquarie Capital. Founded in 2015, the company has raised nearly $116 million, per Crunchbase.
8 (tied). Weights & Biases, $50M, artificial intelligence: San Francisco-based Weights & Biases, which helps build artificial intelligence models, raised $50 million led by Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross at a $1.25 billion valuation. Founded in 2017, the company has raised $250 million, per Crunchbase.
8 (tied). Persefoni, $50M, climate management: Persefoni, a climate management and accounting SaaS product for companies to track their emissions and carbon capture, raised a $50 million Series C funding led by TPG Rise Climate Fund. Founded in 2020, the Tempe, Arizona-based company has raised a total of $164 million, per Crunchbase. 
10. Tractian, $45M, IoT: Atlanta-based Tractian, a developer of industrial monitoring systems, closed a $45 million growth capital round led by General Catalyst. Founded in 2019, the company has raised nearly $64 million, per Crunchbase.
Big global deals
While Neuralink’s round was big, it was not the biggest of the week globally. It finished second to an engineering firm across the Pacific:

Singapore-based Quest Global, a developer of engineering solutions, raised a $500 million private equity round.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of Aug. 5 to Aug. 11. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

"Comfy Footwear Is Cool —  And Fundable, Too",Joanna Glasner,2023/08/11,"

Modern history is replete with efforts at forcing feet to submit to the cruel whims of fashion, from spiked heels to pointed toes.
But comfy footwear fans will not be overcome. For decades now, we’ve stuck steadfastly to our mission to normalize flip flops, slip-on sandals and sneakers. And finally, it looks like victory is at hand.
That, at least, is what the wisdom of the market is telling us. Crocs is a $6.5 billion company. Birkenstock, the hippie staple-turned-Barbie-meme, is reportedly eyeing an IPO at a valuation over $8 billion. And across startupland, the route to footwear venture funding starts and ends with comfortable feet.

Over the past year, venture investors have stepped up funding to an array of foot-focused upstarts pitching everything from 3D-printed, custom shoes to chic sneaker marketplaces to vegan high-tops. A sample set of recently funded companies curated from the Crunchbase dataset highlights 14 emerging brands that have raised financing this year.


If feet could give a thumbs-up, they would
It’s not only VCs who like the above-listed companies. Feet do too. There’s plenty of stretchy material and arch support in the mix, and nary a high heel to be seen.
If feet had credit cards, they’d likely be marching in droves to one of the bigger recent funding recipients, Zellerfeld Shoe. The Brooklyn-based upstart, which picked up $15 million in a February round led by Founders Fund, prints shoes based on foot scans from customers’ phones. It counts celebrities Justin Bieber and Chris Brown among its fan base.
Oofos, one of those odd-yet-memorable brand names, is also targeting the cushiony footwear crowd. The Braintree, Massachusetts-based company raised around $7.7 million in a March financing led by pro football quarterbacks Derek Carr and Alex Smith. It makes slip-ons and sneakers featuring an impact-absorbing foam technology designed to accelerate recovery after intense exercise.
Sneakers are also a perennially popular investment theme. Kream Corp., a South Korean sneaker resale marketplace, raised the biggest footwear venture fund of the year so far, lacing up $167 million in a Series C led by Altos Ventures. Two other sneaker-selling platforms, Paris-based Wethenew and London-based Laced, raised rounds of $22 million and $12 million, respectively.
Welcome to the real world
Investors’ embrace of feel-good footwear is by no means new. The first time we looked at this space five years ago, comfort was already the defining trend.
It also reflects reality. Shows and movies may be filled with female characters who think nothing of popping on a pair of stilettos to run errands. But in the real world, a scan of any crowd reveals this fashion choice is exceedingly rare among women who actually have to walk anywhere.
Additionally, footwear upstarts clearly aren’t neglecting one of the highest-spending segments of their customer base: men. Per Statista, American men spend more on footwear than any other type of clothing. Their annual expenditures were estimated a few years ago to top $26 billion. And that’s just a small part of a much larger and fast-growing global market.
All this doesn’t necessarily translate into more startup activity. With overall venture funding down in recent quarters, footwear is also seeing less love.
Today’s landscape looks nothing like 2021, when supergiant financings were de rigueur. That year, sneaker marketplace Goat Group landed a $195 million Series F. Rothy’s, which makes shoes from old water bottles, announced a $475 million investment from Brazilian textile brand Alpargatas. And Allbirds, known for footwear sourced from merino wool and sustainable materials, went public at a market cap over $2 billion (though its shares have since receded over 90% from early highs).
But while funding is lower, footwear investors aren’t running scared either. They’re still banking on new brands, with a particular focus on those that find original ways to fuse comfort, sustainability and style.
Among those of us who spend a lot of time on our feet, here’s hoping that some of these foot-coddling styles remain in vogue. Fashions may come and go, but the satisfaction that comes from a comfortable shoe endures.

Chinese Startup Investors Are Stepping Up With Capital As American VCs Retreat,Marlize van Romburgh,2023/08/10,"

U.S. venture investors had already pulled back from China before President Joe Biden on Wednesday signed an executive order aimed at curbing American investment in sensitive technologies developed by its biggest global rival. 
At the same time, China-based investors have kept their investment pace in the country steady since 2021.
That’s according to Crunchbase data, which shows U.S. startup investors are on pace to make only about half as many investments into Chinese companies as they did in 2022, which was already down significantly from 2021.


The most active U.S. startup investor in China since 2021 is GGV Capital, according to Crunchbase. The Menlo Park, California-based firm has participated in 75 investment deals since 2021, leading 28 of them. But only four of those deals have been this year. 
The firm has invested in Chinese ride-hailing unicorn Didi, electric-vehicle maker Xpeng Motors, and data analysis company Sensors Data, among its hundreds of investments in Chinese companies. 
The second-most active U.S.-based startup investor in China since 2021 is GSR Ventures, an early-stage investor focused on AI-related companies. The Palo Alto-based firm has participated in 36 funding deals since 2021, leading 10 of them. This year so far, it’s been involved in only three deals, none of which it’s led.


Numerous large Chinese startups have benefited from American capital in recent years. Most prominent among them are TikTok owner ByteDance. U.S. firms including General Atlantic, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Sequoia Capital have led investments in the company in recent years, Crunchbase data shows.
‘Fundamentally rethinking’ China strategy
Biden’s order prohibits or restricts U.S. firms from investing in Chinese entities working on three sectors that carry potential national security risks: quantum computing, semiconductors and microelectronics, as well as some AI systems.
In a letter to Congress, the president said he is taking emergency action to protect American interests “in sensitive technologies and products critical to the military, intelligence, surveillance or cyber-enabled capabilities.”

Experts who watch U.S.-China relations closely say the order, which applies to venture investors and other private equity, will add to the growing unease American firms have with putting capital into the world’s second-largest economy.
Andrew Polk, a partner with the boutique research firm Trivium TAE, told The Wall Street Journal that the American companies he works with are becoming more reluctant to do business with the Red Dragon. 
“What we always say—and this resonates with our clients—is that the risk-adjusted return in China has changed dramatically,” Polk told the Journal. “So what we see is a lot of companies fundamentally rethinking their China strategies. It doesn’t mean they’ll necessarily change them, but they’re stress testing them now, because we’re clearly in a new environment.”
Chinese investment stabilizes 
Venture funding to startups in Asia fell 50% in the first half of the year, Crunchbase data shows. 
However, the decline was led by significant drops in funding to India and Israel, while China actually stabilized. In fact, quarterly funding to Chinese startups in the second quarter of 2023 was $11.2 billion — higher than both Q1 2023 and Q2 2022. 


American venture activity in China already ranks a distant second compared to domestic investment, Crunchbase data shows. Since 2018, China-based investors have done more than 25,000 startup deals in the country. That doesn’t include Hong Kong-based investors, who did another 1,228. 
U.S.-based investors, for comparison, participated in fewer than 2,000 deals in that time. U.S. investors did 293 startup deals in China last year — the lowest annual count since at least 2018, Crunchbase data shows. 
This year is on pace to mark the slowest pace of U.S. venture investment in China in at least five years, with only 94 deals recorded as of early August.
China-based investors, meanwhile, may be on pace to exceed their deal totals from last year. Those investors have already made more than 2,800 investments into their domestic startups so far this year.

HR Tech Funding Falls To 3-Year Low After Flurry Of VC Interest,Chris Metinko,2023/08/10,"

Just as the way people work has continued to evolve, the way investors look at tech to manage that workforce has changed in the past year.
Venture funding to the plethora of startups providing tools and platforms in the human resources space exploded in 2021 — as it did in most sectors — with innovative startups locking up more than $10.5 billion in over 800 deals globally, per Crunchbase data. 

Last year, such startups had similar luck, raising more than $8 billion in nearly 700 deals even as the venture market cooled.
However, venture funding in HR has been called into the office (so to speak) through the last four quarters, taking in less than $3.3 billion as deal flow also slowed.


In fact, the recent second quarter was the slowest in the sector for venture dollars in three years and put HR tech startups on pace to raise about $3.3 billion for the current year.
No big money
In addition, large growth rounds in the space have virtually disappeared, with only two rounds of more than $100 million raised.
Even the numbers this year are slightly inflated, thanks to San Francisco-based HR management company Rippling’s massive round back in March as the Parker Conrad-founded company was caught up in the collapse of SVB, its primary banking partner. The company quickly raised a $500 million Series E funding — that valued the company at $11.25 billion — from existing investor Neil Mehta at Greenoaks.
Other big rounds this year include Belgium-based Odoo, which offers an integrated suite of business apps built through an open-source development model, raising approximately $164 million in a round from General Atlantic in June. Columbus, Ohio-based MentorcliQ, an employee mentoring software platform that helps upskill and retain employees, raised an $80 million venture round led by PSG in March.
“It really doesn’t surprise me,” said Anna Barber, a partner at venture firm M13 who invests in “future of work” startups. “Rounds are smaller and it’s taking longer to raise money in all the industries. However, I do think there is something specific to HR tech right now.”
Innovation and AI
Barber said some of those specific issues related to HR tech include the massive amount of innovation the sector undertook as remote-work tools took center stage after the pandemic struck. 
“I think there was such innovation then, there is less investment now,” she said.
That is borne out in the Crunchbase data, as venture funding in 2021 more than tripled when compared to 2020.
Another reason for the funding dip also could be due to the main headline-grabber of the moment in tech — artificial intelligence.
Much of AI involving business and work tools has shied away from HR and more toward productivity tools that help with writing and creating, Barber said. 
With investors being more shrewd with their dollars and limiting their B2B dealmaking these days, they are likely to focus more on the tech juiced up with AI technology.
AI’s role in HR
That is not to say there are not AI applications in the human resource sector. AI could help with recruiting pipelines or using large language models to interpret new policies and laws in the field, as well as craft responses.
Barber also points to a portfolio company, Santa Monica, California-based AllVoices, which uses AI in HR departments with case management to effectively resolve workplace issues.
Another example is one of the largest rounds in the space this year. Redwood City, California-based Simpplr raised a $70 million round in May. The startup uses an AI-enhanced platform that tries to provide personalized experiences to engage employees.
While AI may seemingly not have had a huge impact on the HR space yet, its time may still be coming.
What’s next?
Aside from all things AI, there have been other bright spots in adjacent areas such as employee benefits, Barber said. Childcare platforms — M13 has invested in Los Angeles-based WeeCare — have seen some interest, especially as more companies underwrite them and government funding becomes available.
Nevertheless, funding and other dealmaking like M&A remains slow.
“I think right now there is a disconnect on price with buying and selling,” Barber said. “Multiples eventually will come down. … And I think you will see the secondary market pick up. That sets the price.”

In the ever-changing landscape of the tech industry, even the most promising startups can find themselves in a precarious financial situation. For many early-stage tech entrepreneurs who raised capital in the golden era of 2021, the winds have shifted, and the market is now down.
The revenue multipliers that once buoyed their ventures are now significantly lower, and investment criteria is more stringent. Those who did not reach profitability will struggle to secure additional external funding.

However, this doesn’t mean you should give up. As entrepreneurs, we always find a way out. If you’re willing to have some hard conversations with yourself and with your board, you might be able to navigate this challenging situation.
Let’s explore three potential paths for getting your company through a capital crunch in this market.
Bootstrap your company
Itay Sagie, founder of Sagie Consulting
The first option, while easier said than done, calls for bootstrapping until market conditions improve.
This approach necessitates some tough decisions, such as securing bridge financing from current investors that keep your dilution and incentives in mind, and implementing cost-cutting measures.
While challenging, this period can be an opportunity for the entrepreneur to focus on sales execution and strengthen the company’s unit economics.
By honing in on revenue generation and operational efficiency, the startup can weather the storm and emerge stronger when the market rebounds.
Consider a sale
The second option — which I personally believe can bring the most value to the entrepreneur and their investors — is considering a merger or acquisition deal.
The transaction outcome will naturally depend on the company’s financial health. Although it may seem like a tough decision to let go of one’s vision, it can be a pragmatic move to allow the company to continue growing and succeeding with a new home.
If the M&A deal is structured properly, the founder can even take a second bite of the apple and benefit from future success of the company.
Recapitalize and restructure
The third option is probably the toughest one to pull off: recapitalization. That means restructuring the ownership of the company to reflect the current market dynamics. It is highly likely that most existing investors will quash this idea, but new investors will find it appealing. I did witness such a request by a VC as a prerequisite for future due diligence.
But if done well — with open negotiation between existing stakeholders and new ones — this approach demonstrates the entrepreneur’s and the board’s willingness to adapt to changing circumstances and positions the company for future growth.
Regardless of the chosen strategy, communication with existing investors is paramount. Transparently discussing the challenges faced and the proposed solutions fosters trust and collaboration. Aligning interests among stakeholders is essential and strategic to navigate through these turbulent times.

"
Are ‘Platform’ Teams The Key To VC Success In Down Markets?,Guest Author,2023/08/9,"

By Dale Chang
If you look around, it’s clear that waves of layoffs have been hitting the tech industry at companies large and small. And the impact hasn’t been isolated to the companies themselves. Venture capital firms have also been cutting back and raising smaller funds in an attempt to refocus their strategies, and in some cases failing to raise.
This pullback follows the longer-than-a decade run-up in venture capital as startup valuations ballooned and venture funds grew (both in size and in total number), and firms ramped-up hiring to deploy and manage the capital.
During this time of growth, the fastest-growing function within VCs was “platform,” defined as the collection of roles focused on specific non-investment functions, like community building, fund operations, marketing and business development.

Platform teams are designed to improve fund returns by getting access to better deals, winning those deals, and providing post-investment support to portfolio companies to increase their odds of success.
Dale Chang of Scale Venture Partners
But the rapid cooling of what was a red hot venture market begs the question: Will venture firms follow the path of private equity firms — which have built well-established internal value creation capabilities that continue to be accretive despite market volatility — or will platform roles in venture firms not survive this downturn?
While the wheels may already be in motion for many of these funding allocations and downstream headcount decisions, a well-constructed platform team as part of a venture capital firm has a positive impact in both up and down markets.
Let’s start with some facts from the recently released study I co-led with Cory Bolotsky from the VC Platform Global Community, analyzing returns data from 850 venture capital firms over the past 20 years.
Platform roles appeared decades ago, but the concept didn’t gain significant traction until 2009 as the world was emerging from the Great Recession. At that time, Andreessen Horowitz sought to build out a new archetype of venture firm, one modeled after an agency blueprint with in-house specialists staffed to provide services to their portfolio of companies.
Since then, platform roles have become increasingly common in venture firms. In 2009, only 24% of venture firms had any platform headcount. Today, that number has more than doubled to 52% of firms with platform roles. In that same timeframe, employee composition of a firm shifted from less than 5% of total headcount represented by platform to more than 13%.

But what impact has firms doubling down on platform roles had on fund returns? Results of the study indicate a strong correlation between increased investment in platform teams and superior fund returns.
The correlation neither suggests that the relationship is causal nor does it imply that a fund must have a platform function to generate successful returns. But, it is interesting to note that funds that had significant platform teams outperformed those funds without platform teams by 1,100 basis points in Net IRR and 0.5x in TVPI over the most recent decade.

Investment in a platform function isn’t a checkbox. It should also be noted that not all platforms functions are created equally. The focus of the platform team must align with the investment strategy of the firm if it is to maximize value. The study took a look at where venture firms were placing their platform bets:

The best performing small funds (less than $250 million in assets under management) that primarily focused on pre-investment related activities — marketing, community, investment operations — outperformed the pooled average by 450 bps in Net IRR and 0.5x in TVPI. Smaller funds that focused primarily on post-investment activities underperformed the pooled average.
The best performing large funds ($500 million-plus in AUM) primarily focused on  post-investment related activities — talent, business development/go-to-market, ESG — similar to their private equity counterparts. These funds outperformed the pooled average by 950 bps in Net IRR and 0.7x in TVPI. Larger funds that focused primarily on pre-investment activities tended to underperform the pooled average.


As my fellow platform leader, Dan Kozikowski of FirstMark, put it: “The question isn’t whether Platform works. It’s whether your Platform is working toward the right things.”
While there are certainly differences between this period of venture pullback and the dot-com crash, history can provide valuable lessons as to how to think about structuring teams for success.
If we look at venture returns from 2000 to 2009, the study indicates that while fund returns were depressed and below the long-term average for venture capital, firms that had a significant investment in their platform functions tended to outperform funds without platform teams by 430 bps in Net IRR and 0.1x in Net TVPI.
While this might not seem like much, the relative overperformance of these funds points to the fact that something they are doing — even in down cycles — is creating incremental value in their portfolio of companies.
There’s a chance that we’ll see continued cuts in the venture industry in the coming years and no doubt some of those impacted will be in platform roles. Firms that aren’t committed to a platform strategy will likely be the first to cut people in those roles when things get tough.
However, firms with thoughtfully designed platform functions will likely use this opportunity to further differentiate as they — and their investors — realize it can create real value for portfolio companies and investors in both up and down markets.

"OpenAI Shoots To No. 1 Spot On Private Cloud Startup Ranking, Underscoring AI’s Sudden Ascendency",Gené Teare,2023/08/9,"

OpenAI debuted at the No. 1 spot on the Cloud 100 Benchmarks Report 2023, a ranking of the top 100 private cloud companies conducted every year by Bessemer Venture Partners. OpenAI’s rise to the top of the ranking underscores artificial intelligence’s shockingly fast ascendency in the tech world. Besides the ChatGPT owner, four other native AI companies joined the index this year: Anthropic (No. 73), Midjourney ( No. 85), Hugging Face (No. 98) and DeepL (No. 100).
Mary D’Onofrio, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners
Bessemer, one of the most active venture investors in the cloud sector, taps a panel of judges each year to evaluate companies on four criteria for inclusion on the Cloud 100: market leadership, financial metrics, valuation and team.
“It was the hardest year ever to make the cloud 100 list,” Mary D’Onofrio, a partner and co-founder of the growth practice at Bessemer, told Crunchbase News. “The minimum valuation required to make the list was close to $1.5 billion.”
And in contrast to prior years, only one company — Figma — exited from last year’s leading 100 cloud company list, even though Adobe‘s $20 billion acquisition of the design collaboration startup has not yet closed. (Figma is one of the highest acquisition multiples of all time at 50x revenue.)

AI is clearly a leading theme for this year’s index. Of the 100 companies on this year’s index, 55 have launched a generative AI product or feature in the last eight months, and 70 use AI or machine learning in their product.


However, design, collaboration and productivity — a sector impacted by AI —  led with the highest collective value, at $110 billion. That displaced last year’s most-valuable sector, fintech, after some companies saw their valuations decline. That includes Stripe, which raised a down round, and Checkout.com, which reportedly cut its internal valuation by 70%.
Cloud security company Wiz moved up the most on the index — 67 spots to No. 15. Wiz took 18 months to scale from $1 million to the $100 million in revenue announced earlier this year.
IPO predictions
The report predicts the IPO market will also open up soon —  D’Onofrio predicts it will do so in the first half of next year — with the top 10 companies on the index most likely to go public first.
The cloud 100 companies were valued collectively at $654 billion, down 11% from last year’s list. That marks the first annual decline on the index since 2016.
The average value of the companies on this year’s list also fell, from $7.4 billion in 2022 to $6.6 billion this year.
Average growth has slowed from 100% to 55% on average year over year. The top quartile also slowed from 120% to 70%. Revenue multiples were calculated from companies that raised in the past year, which include 17 companies valued at 26x revenue. That’s still high compared to public cloud companies, at around 8x revenue. The public cloud index is growing at a slower rate, on average 22%.
“On a growth adjusted basis, it’s actually a lot more rational and more in line with the public markets than one would think,” said D’Onofrio. “You’re paying for the outsize revenue growth in this environment, combined with your view of what a company can become.”

Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that Checkout.com had raised a down round. It’s been corrected to reflect that the company reportedly cut its internal valuation.

SoftBank Vision Funds Post Gain For First Time in Six Quarters,Chris Metinko,2023/08/8,"

SoftBank’s Vision Fund unit — known for its investment in startups including Uber, WeWork and DoorDash — posted its first gain in six quarters as the tech investing giant started to look for deals again.
The investment arm — which includes SoftBank’s Vision Fund 1, Vision Fund 2 and its LatAm Funds — recorded a gain of about $1.1 billion, after reporting losses of $32 billion for its recent fiscal year ended in March. 

Softbank’s Vision Fund II also made investments of about $1.6 billion in the recent quarter ended June 30. For the quarter ended in March, total investments were less than $500 million.
The slight uptick was not enough to help Softbank’s overall earnings, as the Japanese firm reported a net loss of about $3.3 billion for the quarter.
Investing again
In June, SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son told investors that the firm would shift from “defense mode” and aims to be the leader in the AI revolution. “Now, the time has come to shift to offense mode,” Son said.
Son, who spoke emotionally during the shareholders meeting, said the recent advances in artificial intelligence has rekindled his desire for investing in technology — and in particular referenced conversing with generative AI language processing platform ChatGPT to discuss his ideas and thoughts.
Softbank did seem to make good on that promise of looking more into AI last quarter. Its Vision Fund led a $65 million Series E for London-based Tractable, a software company that develops artificial intelligence for accident and disaster recovery. 
It also took part in a $790 million Series B for London-based Infogrid, an AI technology company that automates building management.

Daybreak Lands $13M Series B For Youth Mental Health,Joanna Glasner,2023/08/8,"

When we first interviewed Daybreak Health CEO Alex Alvarado for our Something Ventured founder profile series two years ago, the San Francisco startup had only recently raised its seed round.
At the time, the company, which works with school districts to offer online mental health counseling, was already growing rapidly, driven by high demand for its largely teen-focused services. Over subsequent months, as we regularly checked in with Alvarado, the pace never seemed to slacken. The Something Ventured project culminated just weeks after another big milestone, as Daybreak closed on a $10 million Series A round.

Alex Alvarado, CEO and founder of Daybreak Health.
Now, roughly 17 months later, Daybreak has moved on to Series B. The startup today announced a $13 million financing led by Union Square Ventures. New investor Lux Capital joined the round, along with existing backers Lightspeed Venture Partners, Maven Ventures and Y Combinator.
Daybreak initially launched in California, but since has expanded to other states. It currently works with more than 50 school districts, matching clinicians to students based on criteria including needs, language and personal preferences. The company also offers services such as mental health classes for school staff and families, and tools for early identification of students who could benefit from mental health support.
Feedback indicates that counseling offerings are having a positive effect. Alvarado said program data shows that four out of five school counselors report noticeable improvements in student symptoms and 92% of families report behavioral improvements at home.
For now, the plan is more expansion ahead. Daybreak says it will use the Series B funds to roll out its services to more school districts nationwide.

"
Global Venture Funding In July Was Second-Lowest This Year As Seed Startups Are Hit Hard,Gené Teare,2023/08/8,"

Global venture funding in July 2023 was the second-lowest monthly total since the reset began more than a year ago, Crunchbase data shows. With the slowdown now in its fourth or fifth quarter, it increasingly looks like the startup ecosystem is undergoing a top-to-bottom reset, from seed through late-stage startups and all the way to the investors that back them.
Global venture funding in July 2023 totaled $18.6 billion — down about 20% month over month, and 38% compared to the $29.8 billion invested in July 2022.
While that’s not the lowest monthly total we’ve seen this year, it’s close: Total funding per month so far in 2023 has ranged from a low of $18 billion in February to a peak of $33 billion in January, per Crunchbase data.

All funding stages — seed, early and late — in July 2023 were down close to a third compared to a year ago.
Notably, seed and early-stage funding hit its lowest amount in a single month since we began tracking the downturn in July 2022. That’s a scary sign for the startup ecosystem as a whole, since earlier funding stages had remained relatively insulated at the start of the downturn.
Now, even those fledgling companies are struggling to raise their early rounds of funding — and we’re also seeing those companies that do raise seed and early-stage rounds struggle to graduate to the later stages.
The seed funding ecosystem is also the most exposed due to the large number of new players and the inherently risky nature of seed-stage investing. After all, it’s widely believed that even in a normal market, 50% to 90% of startups fail.


Startup valuations reset
When the public markets started their downward slide in December 2021, it took the private funding markets a full quarter before registering the need to scale back on valuations.
By the second quarter of 2022, the amount of late-stage funding to startups had come down significantly. Investors signaled they would pivot away from investing in highly valued companies and focus on companies at the earliest funding stages who were years away from exiting.
But, as many startups have seen sales slow in this post-pandemic world, and raising later-stage funding became more difficult, even the previously robust early-stage funding environment started to tighten as well.
By the third quarter of 2022, early-stage funding fell. In the fourth quarter, it became obvious seed funding wasn’t safe either.
The protracted slowdown has continued into 2023. That has given way to concerns that the handoff between investors at each stage is broken as startups find it much more difficult to raise follow-on funding.
Seed- and early-stage startups face a reckoning if they are not able to raise funding on a two-year cycle. As investors cut back, startups funded during the market peak face closure at greater rates.
Arguably, for years the whole seed-stage funding ecosystem grew massively because there was a strong exit market at the end of the pipeline.
Seed investor Sam Lessin predicts that the seed ecosystem will go into “time out” for at least 18 months — if not longer — “until the inventory of dramatically over-marked late-stage private deals got worked through / washed out / expired on the line.”
That could cause the entire seed funding ecosystem to die off temporarily, before being reconstituted, he predicts. That’s because “run-of-the-mill public tech companies just aren’t worth that much it turns out — and if the bulk of so-called unicorns can’t get public / or do and are disappointing, the whole model of seed investing starts to look way way less attractive as an asset class.”
The blush came off unicorn valuations some time ago. And last month, new unicorns hit the lowest count since we started tracking new unicorn counts at the beginning of 2020.
Largest sectors
Perhaps surprisingly, funding to AI companies did not stand out as a sector this past month.
Funding to AI companies was around $2 billion — about 11% of all venture funding — in July. Health care and biotech companies raised around $3.8 billion, renewable energy around $3.1 billion, and financial services companies raised $2.9 billion this past month.
Methodology
Funding rounds included in this report are seed, angel, venture, corporate-venture and private-equity rounds in venture-backed companies. This reflects data in Crunchbase as of Aug. 4, 2023.
Note that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarter.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.
Glossary of funding terms
As of January 2023, we have made a change to how we include corporate funding rounds in our reporting. Corporate rounds are only included if a company has raised an equity funding at seed through a venture series funding round.
Seed and angel consists of seed, pre-seed and angel rounds. Crunchbase also includes venture rounds of unknown series, equity crowdfunding and convertible notes at $3 million (USD or as-converted USD equivalent) or less.
Early-stage consists of Series A and Series B rounds, as well as other round types. Crunchbase includes venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $3 million, and those less than or equal to $15 million.
Late-stage consists of Series C, Series D, Series E and later-lettered venture rounds following the “Series [Letter]” naming convention. Also included are venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $15 million.
Technology growth is a private-equity round raised by a company that has previously raised a “venture” round. (So basically, any round from the previously defined stages.)

"
A Strategic Or PE Firm Wants To Buy Your Company. Now What?,Guest Author,2023/08/7,"

By Gaurav Bhasin
As a founder or CEO at a technology company, at some point you may get an unsolicited approach from a strategic buyer or a private equity fund to buy your company.

Let’s discuss questions to consider when this happens.
Do you want to do a deal?
Do you need capital for growth and liquidity for yourself and your shareholders?
If the buyer is a strategic party, is this a company that can accelerate your sales significantly by selling your products via their established sales distribution channel that can be value enhancing for both parties?
Is this strategic buyer one that your company would fit well into post-acquisition?
Will your products fill out the solutions portfolio and accelerate the product roadmap of the strategic party, improving go-to-market?
Will your team be happy working there?
What do you want to do?
Next, consider what you’d want to do if you sold your company.
Would you want to stay at a strategic for two to three years post-exit?
Gaurav Bhasin, managing director at Allied Advisers
If the approach is from a PE firm, could the deal allow for immediate liquidity and the ability to rollover some equity for a second bite of the apple on the next exit? Could it allow you to either continue to run the company as CEO, or have the buyers bring a seasoned operator to manage growth for the next stage?
These are questions unique to each company and should be thoroughly thought through with your co-founder or senior team member, trusted adviser or investor.
Based on your responses, if there is a desire to consummate a transaction, there are some additional questions to research.
Researching your buyer
Now you have to determine if the buyer is serious and if it really has the ability to close a deal.
What is its past transaction history and record of successfully closing transactions and integrating acquired companies? How much does it pay and how does it generally value companies?
If the buyer is a PE firm, does it have a history of acquiring companies and growing them organically, or via acquisitions, and at what multiples did they exit upon selling after their hold period?
How did management fare in prior transactions with the PE firm?
If you determine the buyer is credible, you should probe into reasons why it approached your company and what it intends to accomplish via the transaction. Is the buyer serious about acquiring your business or is it simply “kicking the tires?”
Getting a competitive offer
What if this buyer falls through — have you created other options?
Based upon discussions with your trusted group, if you determine the timing is right for your company for a strategic transaction and the inbound may be worth considering, you should run a proactive process to enhance a successful outcome.
While there is a saying that “companies are bought, not sold” this ends up producing a suboptimal exit outcome if the company only engages with the inbound party.
Competition for your company among buyers helps enhance exit value or valuation at which you would raise capital.
The company can benefit by running a proactive process to select a targeted list of the likely prospects, which could be strategic and/or PE firms depending on your company sector, size and focus on getting the buyer groups into M&A meetings.
The goal would be to get additional parties to the table as a greater number of buyers drives up valuation and improves deal terms. At the same time, you should keep the inbound party engaged.
Buyers have differences in their ability to pay based on their size and perceived synergies with your company, and running a process surfaces the party that can provide the best valuation and fit.
Competition for your company provides negotiating leverage and will help provide a “market check” to ensure you are getting paid maximum value and appropriate deal terms.
In a bilateral process, the buyer knows that it’s the only horse in the race, so will take advantage of the situation to squeeze the seller in many ways. Similar to selling real estate, you showcase your home to multiple buyers to get the best value versus showing it to only one buyer.
Many strategic buyers use former bankers in their corporate development function, and PE firms are masters in dealmaking. Consider engaging a banker to level the playing field as sell-side bankers know what the market is in terms of valuation, structure and deal terms, and who the potential buyers are for your business to reach out to. The banker will manage process timelines by running structured processes, which can be beneficial to the company.
This also allows the management team to focus on running the business by providing a supporting team and strategic guidance, and levels the playing field by adding skillful team members on your side during an exhausting M&A process.

"5 Interesting Startup Deals You May Have Missed In July: Voice Cloning, Green Ammonia, And Using AI To Fight Wildfires",Chris Metinko,2023/08/7,"

This is a monthly column that runs down five interesting deals every month that may have flown under the radar. Check out last month’s entry here.
The summer can be slow for funding to startups — but not necessarily to unique ones.

A handful of deals caught our eye in July, including a couple of startups applying AI in interesting ways; one looking to preserve your privacy, and even one in spacetech. Let’s dive in.
AI battles wildfires
It’s officially wildfire season out here in the West, and while it’s started off quiet, we all know that can change in an instant.
Pano AI locked up a $17 million growth capital round led by Valor Equity Partners to apply AI to fighting those wildfires. The San Francisco-based startup’s solution uses mountaintop cameras, satellite feeds, 5G connectivity, cloud software and — of course — AI to detect and pinpoint new ignitions and alert fire personnel in minutes.
The company says its intel also helps first responders get to fires faster and with the latest information — like what equipment may be needed — to stop new ignitions.
The new cash infusion will help Pano expand across additional high fire-risk areas within North America and Australia.
This summer, everyone got to see the devastation caused by the horrendous Canadian wildfires. With wildfires top of mind, it’s good to see tech playing a bigger role in trying to stop the destruction.
Say what?
AI can be used to write research papers, help with customer service, and even create art. But it may soon take your voice — or at least clone it.
Last month, Resemble AI raised an $8 million round led by Javelin Ventures. The Santa Clara, California-based startup has created a voice platform that uses generative AI to allow users to clone their voice for uses in gaming, acting, music production and more.
The company says it already has 1 million users and more than 200 business customers. It also announced that with the new cash it has developed a product that can tell whether  audio is AI-generated or not.
Voice cloning sounds a little creepy, but if it can also help prevent AI-generated fraud and scams, maybe that lessens the uneasiness factor.
‘Green ammonia’
When thinking about industries that need to cut carbon emissions, ammonia production doesn’t necessarily come to mind. However, its production actually creates about 500 million tons of carbon a year.
Israel-based NitroFix thinks it has a solution for this, and the startup raised a $3.1 million round led by Clean Energy Ventures to advance it.
The company has created a one-step electrochemical reaction way of creating ammonia with water and air at low voltage. It claims the process is low-power consuming and significantly reduces carbon emissions while producing “green ammonia.”
The majority of ammonia is used in the agriculture industry as fertilizer, but it also is used in the manufacturing of plastics, fabrics, pesticides and other materials and supplies. Considering all those uses, it’s not surprising firms see reducing its carbon footprint as a good investment.
Protecting privacy
Everyone wants to protect their data and privacy, but the question is always, how? It’s not like you can just go on an app, see what data companies have on you, and delete it.
Well, maybe you can.
PrivacyHawk, which locked up a $2.7 million round led by ff Venture Capital, is a privacy app that lets users control who uses and shares their personal data. The app identifies which companies have a user’s personal data and helps them choose which ones to opt out of.
It can also help users delete personal data or opt out of having it shared with third parties and unsubscribe from marketing emails (who doesn’t love that?). The app even provides security alerts about breaches that may affect a user’s personal data.
Our personal data is becoming a critical part of our identity — protecting it at all costs is becoming just as important.
We love space
If it seems like there always is a spacetech startup on this list every month, that’s probably because there often is one.
But who doesn’t like space?
Last month, Impulse Space, a developer of in-space transportation services, secured a $45 million Series A led by RTX Ventures, aerospace and defense giant Raytheon’s venture arm.
While more companies are launching things into space, it can still be difficult to get payloads into higher orbits. Redondo Beach, California-based Impulse is creating a platform to deliver multiple payloads into different orbits. The startup expects to offer rapid deployment of satellites beginning in October.
That’s not all. Impulse also is scheduled to be part of the first commercial mission to Mars in 2026, in partnership with spacetech company Relativity.
Planning to go to the red planet will often get you on a list of interesting rounds.

"The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: John Chambers’ Nile, Newlight Technologies Light The Way",Chris Metinko,2023/08/4,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out The Crunchbase Megadeals Tracker.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.
There were lots of big rounds this week as August roared in after a kind of sleepy July. The big rounds went to all different types of companies — from networking to biotech to sustainability. However, while there were five nine-figure rounds, none topped $200 million. Still, not a bad start to the final full month of summer.
1. Nile, $175M, networking: Enterprise networking can be a hard sector for a startup to break into, as it has long been dominated by tech giants. Nevertheless, San Jose, California-based networking startup Nile was able to catch investors’ eyes with a $175 million Series C less than a year after emerging from stealth. The company was co-founded by former Cisco Systems executives John Chambers and Pankaj Patel. Chambers served as CEO of the networking giant for two decades. The round was co-led by March Capital and Saudi Arabia sovereign wealth fund Sanabil Investments. Nile is attempting to disrupt the networking industry by offering network-as-a-service with more secure wired and wireless services enhanced with monitoring, analytics and automation. The idea is to help companies simplify their modern networking needs and offer optimum security while going head-to-head with goliaths such as Cisco and Juniper Networks. The startup did not offer a valuation. The round brings Nile’s total amount of capital raised to $300 million since being founded in 2018, per the company.

2. Newlight Technologies, $125M, sustainability: Converting greenhouse gasses into something usable is big business right now. Newlight Technologies locked up $125 million led by GenZero to do just that. The Huntington Beach, California-based startup uses natural microorganisms to convert greenhouse gas into a material the company calls “AirCarbon,” which can substitute for a variety of other materials to build products in sectors such as fashion, foodservice and others. Newlight plans to use the new cash to expand the production of AirCarbon at both its existing California facility as well as a new production facility being built in Ohio. Founded in 2003, the company has raised nearly $232 million, per Crunchbase.
3. Jerry, $110M, auto insurance: While we all like to drive, no one enjoys car insurance. The Jerry app tries to make the whole insurance thing a little easier by finding better rates, and it can even find loans for a new ride. This week it raised $110 million in equity and debt for new features — GarageGuard, like WebMD for cars, and DriveShield, a safe-driving feature. The financing was led by existing investor Park West Asset Management. Hopefully, the new GarageGuard feature doesn’t turn everyone into an at-home mechanic. Founded in 2017, the company has raised $242 million, per Crunchbase.
4. CG Oncology, $105M, biotech: With recent weeks being so biotech heavy, it almost seems like this is low on the list for our first biotech company of the week. CG Oncology locked up a $105 million round co-led by new investors Foresite Capital and TCGX. The Irvine, California-based firm will use the new cash to advance late-stage clinical programs for its bladder cancer treatment. Founded in 2010, the company has raised nearly $318 million.
5. Healthmap Solutions, $100M, health care: Tampa, Florida-based Healthmap Solutions, a health management company focused on kidney disease, raised a $100 million round led by funds managed by WindRose Health Investors. The company has seen significant growth, as it’s contracted to manage more than $3 billion in health care spend and currently serves more than 160,000 individuals living with kidney disease. Founded in 2016, the company has raised nearly $226 million, per Crunchbase.
6. Tisento Therapeutics, $81M, biotech: Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Tisento Therapeutics, a biotech firm looking to treat mitochondrial diseases, raised an $81 million Series A that included investment from Invus, Peter Hecht, Polaris and others. The round is the company’s first outside funding, per Crunchbase.
7. LightForce Orthodontics, $80M, dental: Burlington, Massachusetts-based LightForce Orthodontics, a maker of personalized 3D-printed braces, closed an $80 million Series D led by Ally Bridge Group. Founded in 2015, the company has raised $150 million, per Crunchbase.
8. (tied) Endor Labs, $70M, security: Palo Alto, California-based Endor Labs, an open-source security startup, raised a $70 million Series A that included investment from Lightspeed Venture Partners and Coatue. Founded in 2021, the company has raised $95 million, per Crunchbase.
8. (tied) Tradeshift, $70M, fintech: San Francisco-based Tradeshift, a cloud-based business network connecting buyers and suppliers, agreed to a $70 million investment from HSBC as part of a joint venture. Founded in 2009, the company has raised $1.1 billion, per Crunchbase.
10. Kyverna Therapeutics, $60M, biotech: Emeryville, California-based Kyverna Therapeutics, a clinical-stage cell therapy startup focusing on therapies for autoimmune diseases, closed a $60 million Series B extension. The new cash brings the Series B total to $145 million. Investors in the round include Bain Capital Life Sciences and GordonMD Global Investments. Founded in 2018, the company has now raised $170 million, per Crunchbase.
Big global deals
Despite all the large raises in the U.S., the biggest occurred across the Pacific.

Hong Kong-based Micro Connect, a financial market platform, raised a $458 million Series C.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of July 29 to August 4. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

Investors Have Stopped Showing Up For Virtual Events Startups,Joanna Glasner,2023/08/4,"

At the peak of the pandemic, event-goers didn’t have a choice about whether to join in-person or online. Virtual was the only game in town.
Investors, who did have a choice, opted to put a lot of money into startups aiming to make the virtual and hybrid event experience more productive and enjoyable. In 2020 and 2021 alone, more than $1.5 billion went to upstarts in the space, per Crunchbase data.
But among these startups, no one was beloved like Hopin. The London-based virtual events platform pulled in over $1 billion in 2020 and 2021 from lead backers including Andreessen Horowitz and General Catalyst. By late 2021, its valuation had skyrocketed to $7.75 billion.

Less than two years later, a much different narrative is playing out. Live events have bounced back, and Hopin’s valuation has cratered. This week, the company said it agreed to sell its core events product, along with other assets, to RingCentral, a cloud communications platform for businesses that is looking to expand its events offerings.
A pandemic-era investor favorite
Hopin’s trajectory doesn’t bode well for other funded companies in the virtual and hybrid event space that raised big rounds during the pandemic.
It’s a large group. To get a sense of the major players, we used Crunchbase data to put together a list of 31 companies with an online events focus that raised a few million dollars or more. The vast majority have not raised funding since 2021.


The top funding recipients also have been cutting staff. Hopin reportedly cut 29% of its staff last summer, just months after an earlier round of layoffs.
Bizzabo, a B2B-focused events platform with hybrid and virtual offerings, reportedly laid off 40% of its staff late last year. The Israel-based startup was the second most heavily funded company on our list after Hopin, with $194 million in known venture funding.
Another startup, Hubilo, a virtual events platform that raised nearly $150 million in 2021, reportedly laid off 35% of its staff early this year.
Hybrid events are sticking around
Still, even though hybrid and virtual events businesses haven’t taken off like their venture backers hoped, offerings aren’t going away either.
These days, with Covid lockdowns behind us, we’re getting a better sense of where people want to gather and where they don’t. Restaurants and concerts are back, big time. The office, not so much.
Conferences and business events, meanwhile, fall into an in-between zone. Yes, people would prefer to network face-to-face, and there’s a lot of value to meeting others in the same field in person.
However, travel and lodging costs add up. Attending in-person may also not be ideal for someone who’s just interested in a couple of sessions. So there’s still a place for hybrid and virtual gatherings.
The value of platforms that enable such gatherings, however, seems quite a bit lower than what was presumed a couple years ago. While the Hopin purchase price wasn’t disclosed, the deal almost certainly valued assets at a tiny fraction of the full company’s peak valuation.
RingCentral’s total market capitalization is around $3.8 billion — less than half what Hopin was worth at its peak. Also, as a public company, RingCentral is obligated to disclose a purchase price if the deal was deemed large enough to have a material impact for investors. Apparently, it was not.
Although RingCentral isn’t buying the entirety of Hopin, it’s buying the parts that it was best known for — events. What remains of Hopin will be carrying on, including streaming assets and a community project called Superwave. Chief Technology and Product Officer Badri Rajasekar will be taking over as CEO, and founder and CEO Johnny Boufarhat will be stepping down from operations.

Most Active US Investors: Alumni Ventures Leads Cool Month,Chris Metinko,2023/08/4,"

This is a monthly feature that runs down some of the most active investors in U.S.-based companies, looks at some of their most interesting investments, and includes some odds and ends of who spent what.
A year ago, well-known venture firms such as Andreessen Horowitz and FJ Labs were near the top of the most active U.S. investors list — each making at least 10 bets on innovative startups.
Times have changed, though. The venture market continues to creep along even more slowly than it did a year ago, and firms have cooled their pace.
While Andreessen Hororwitz placed 13 bets in July of last year, the firm made only three announced investments in U.S.-based startups last month. Similarly, FJ Labs went from 10 deals to only two.

With the exception of accelerators, no firm hit double-digit deals in the U.S. last month. Nevertheless, let’s look at some of the top firms by the numbers.
Alumni Ventures, 9 deals
While those firms that have significantly slowed investing are often pointed out, it is also important to call out those that have not.
Alumni Ventures is one of those. The firm led the way in July in the number of U.S. deals, and also has been remarkably consistent this year in general.
Alumni made 37 deals involving U.S.-based startups between January and June — an average of a little more than six a month.
On the other hand, last year the firm averaged 16 such deals per month — topping out with 26 deals in February 2022.
While its numbers are down from last year, Alumni’s diversity does not seem to be. Last month it invested in everything from Ossium Health — a San Francisco startup  building a bone marrow bank to treat blood cancers — to Boston-based school-bus tracking app BusRight.
Triangle Tweener Fund, 8 deals
Durham, North Carolina-based Triangle Tweener Fund is a newcomer to this list.
The firm made eight deals last month — which, surprisingly, is actually one fewer than it completed in July 2022.
The Triangle Tweener Fund is a rolling fund that invests in about 10 to 20 early-stage deals per quarter, all focused on North Carolina’s noted Research Triangle area. The fund usually invests about $50,000 on average.
While the fund makes deals in a variety of spaces, last month it made a couple of investments in apps focused on homes and homeownership. Those deals include an investment in Bristles, a DIY planning app that uses AI to help with home design, and HomeCloud, which can ingest home data and can give insights such as a timeline for when something may need replaced or specific details of a fixture.
Khosla Ventures, 6 deals
Khosla Ventures, on the other hand, is no stranger to this list. The firm made a half-dozen deals in U.S.-based companies last month — three times as many as it did in July 2022.
Last month actually matches the firm’s highest month this year for deals involving U.S. startups — tying with February’s number.
As usual, Khosla invested in a variety of sectors, from robotics with Collaborative Robotics, to language app Speak.
It also was announced the firm led a $10 million seed round and took part in a $17 million Series A for Burlington, Massachusetts-based SiPhox. The startup offers an at-home test kit that measures 17 blood biomarkers for inflammation, hormonal health, metabolic fitness and cardiovascular health. At-home health care is big and clearly getting bigger.
Valor Equity Partners, 6 deals
Similar to Khosla, Valor Equity Partners finished last month with six deals and actually quickened its investment cadence compared to July 2022, which saw the firm only announce three deals with U.S.-based startups.
In fact, before last month, Valor only completed eight deals in the entire first half of 2023 involving such companies.
Last month saw the firm do deals involving anything from banking platform K Health to Pano AI, which is applying AI to fighting wildfires. The firm also took part in a $25.5 million Series A for Brooklyn, New York-based Bedrock Ocean Exploration, which has created a data platform to collect and manage seafloor geophysical data for those that need to go to greater depths. The seafloor sector does not often see investment, so it is eye-catching when it does.
Also notable:

New York-based Point72 Ventures and Intel Capital topped all firms in rounds led or co-led with only three apiece.
Wellington Management topped the list for rounds led or co-led with the highest dollar amounts for the month. The firm only led or co-led one round last month, but it was a $270 million round for Kim Kardashian’s apparel brand Skims.
Several incubators and accelerators made a number of investments in July, led by Y Combinator’s 19 deals and Fulcrum Venture Accelerator’s 14 deals.

Methodology
This is a list of investors which took part in the most rounds involving U.S.-based startups. It does not include incubators or accelerators due to the fluctuations their investment numbers can have.

Jim Keller’s AI Chip Unicorn Locks Up $100M From Strategic Investors,Chris Metinko,2023/08/3,"

AI chip startup Tenstorrent closed a $100 million strategic financing from the likes of Hyundai and Samsung in what the company is calling an “up-round.”
The Toronto-based company previously reached unicorn status after its $200 million-plus raise in 2021. 
Hyundai Motor Group and Samsung Catalyst Fund led the new round. Other investors include Fidelity Ventures, Eclipse Ventures, Epiq Capital, Maverick Capital and more.

Tenstorrent, which is developing a wide range of AI chips, will use the new cash infusion for product development, including design and development of AI chiplets and its ML software roadmap.
Founded in 2016, the company has now raised nearly $335 million, per Crunchbase.
Tenstorrent is led by top chip designer Jim Keller, who has worked at Apple, AMD, Tesla and Intel.
AI trends
The round does not just illustrate investors’ appetite for AI, but also two specific trends inside of the AI craze itself.
First, strategics are playing a huge role in growing out the AI ecosystem. Nvidia, Microsoft, Google and Salesforce’s venture arm, Salesforce Ventures 1are putting millions, if not billions, of dollars into startups trying to get the innovation edge in generative AI.
Secondly, while the large generative AI platforms like OpenAI and Anthropic garner much of the attention when it comes to the space, investors and strategics are seeing big opportunities in the infrastructure layer that supports those platforms.
In recent months, investors have eyed anything from chips and enhanced compute to unique data sets to help with modeling. Startups including CoreWeave, which provides GPU-accelerated compute solutions, and Pinecone, which creates vector databases, have raised big money contributing to the foundation layer of AI.

This Under-The-Radar Firm From Berlin Is The Most Active Investor In New Unicorns So Far In 2023,Gené Teare,2023/08/3,"

Editor’s note: Data is from The Crunchbase Unicorn Board, a curated list that includes private unicorn companies with post-money valuations of $1 billion or more, based on disclosed fundings in Crunchbase. 
When you consider the investors putting money into new unicorn startups, maybe you think of storied Silicon Valley names like Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins, or large New York firms like Tiger Global and Insight Partners that in recent years have dominated startup investment.
But in another sign of how much the market tides have shifted, the top investor leading rounds for new unicorn startups so far this year is none of those. Instead, it’s a relatively small, under-the-radar investor based in Berlin.
Early-stage investment firm b2venture was the most active investor in new unicorn startups in the first half of 2023, Crunchbase data shows. The firm participated in nine funding rounds across three new unicorn startups — a significant portion of the only 44 total new unicorns minted in H1 2023.
B2venture is followed by multistage venture firms Index Ventures, Google Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz — all tied for the rank of second-most active, with eight investments each in the new unicorns that joined The Crunchbase Unicorn Board in the first half of 2023.
This lineup looks very different from the firms that amassed a huge portfolio of unicorn companies in the last few years — namely Tiger Global, Accel, Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia.
Of these four firms, Andreessen Horowitz still made the leading H1 2023 list, with three portfolio companies and eight investments in this batch.


B2venture also stands out on this list for investing in all three of the newly anointed unicorns from Germany so far this year. It has also been a consistent investor in these new unicorn companies. The firm started investing as early as 2009 and continued into 2023 in translation company DeepL, fintech Raisin and sustainable energy company 1Komma5°, with initial investment at seed or Series A and participation in follow-on funding rounds.
Down 80%
New unicorn counts fell 80% year over year in the first half of 2023, with just 44 companies earning that title — a far cry from the 251 companies that joined the Unicorn Board in H1 2022 and the 295 in H1 2021. The decline in new unicorns underscores the precipitous decline in late-stage financings in the past 12 months.
The U.S. remains the largest market for new unicorns. Of this year’s new unicorn companies, half are headquartered in the U.S., a quarter are in China, and six are based in Europe.


The AI moment
For the new batch of unicorns the leading sector was — no surprise — AI. Companies in the sector make up 25% of new unicorns this year.
Corporate investors have been actively investing in AI. Nvidia and its venture arm NVentures combined have participated in five investments in newly minted AI unicorn companies this year. Another corporate investor, Salesforce Ventures 1, participated in funding three of these AI unicorn companies in 2023.
Consistent investors
Other consistent investors include Index Ventures in Cohere and Raisin; Google Ventures in Kindbody and Typeface; Andreessen in KoBold Metal and Replit; A.CapitalVentures in Character.ai; Coatue in Our Next Energy; MMC Ventures in Synthesia, Frees Fund in Bluepha; Aqua Spark in eFishery; AlbionVC and HSBC in Quantexa; and Valor Equity Partners and S3 Ventures in Atmosphere.
These investors stand to gain the most from potential future exits as they continue to invest to maintain their equity stakes in some of their most highly valued companies.
Large stakes
Despite their more recent pullback in unicorn investing, lead investors who have built a large portfolio of highly valued private companies won’t lose their perch as the most active investors anytime soon. Consider that Tiger Global still has the highest count of current unicorn portfolio companies with more than 220 (though it’s reportedly working to offload some of its stakes.)
While Tiger Global has a much larger unicorn count in highly valued private companies when compared to other leading investors, those firms still have massive unicorn portfolios of their own. Andreessen Horowitz, for example, has 108 unicorn portfolio companies, per Crunchbase. Insight Partners has 107. And Sequoia Capital and Accel each have around 100 current unicorn portfolio companies.
These companies’ rankings likely will not shift anytime soon, as a smaller number of new unicorns join the herd in the current market. But each of these firms still has a lot of value tied up in private markets — and each is no doubt eagerly waiting for the IPO market to open once again.

Methodology
The Crunchbase Unicorn Board is a curated list that includes private unicorn companies with post-money valuations of $1 billion or more and is based on Crunchbase data. New companies are added to the Unicorn Board as they reach the $1 billion valuation mark as part of a funding round.
The unicorn board does not reflect internal company valuations — such as those set via a 409a process for employee stock options — as these differ from, and are more likely to be lower than, a priced funding round. We also do not adjust valuations based on investor writedowns, which change quarterly, as different investors will not value the same company consistently within the same quarter.
Funding to unicorn companies includes all private financings to companies that are tagged as unicorns, as well as those that have since graduated to The Exited Unicorn Board.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.

AI + Carbon = Funded Startups,Joanna Glasner,2023/08/3,"

Artificial intelligence and carbon removal are two of the hotter themes for startup funding in recent months. So what if you combined the two?
We explored this question in an effort to see how much investment is going to companies touting expertise in both AI and in technologies tied to reducing carbon footprints. Turns out, quite a few funded startups tout credentials in these two areas.

The past two years have been particularly active, with more than $400 million going to dozens of seed- through late-stage rounds straddling these two focus areas. Using Crunchbase data, we curated a list of 15 companies at the intersection of AI and carbon, each of which has raised $10 million or more:


Carbon-tracking software
Carbon-tracking software is an especially popular focus area, and one of the larger funding rounds was pretty recent. Sylvera, a London-based climate software startup, landed $57 million in a July Series B led by Balderton Capital. The 3-year-old company applies machine learning and geospatial data analytics to assess carbon projects that capture, remove or avoid emissions.
Pachama, a startup that uses satellite data and AI software to help companies vet and invest in carbon credits, has also been moving up the fundraising charts.The San Francisco-based company is known for its focus on reforestation and forest protection projects. It pulled in $55 million in a Series B last year, drawing a mix of climate VCs and celebrity backers.
Others are developing software for enterprises to track their carbon emissions and find ways to reduce their footprints. This includes Emitwise, a U.K. upstart that describes itself as a carbon accounting platform for businesses with complex supply chains. It also includes Plan A, a Berlin startup with offerings that include a carbon screener to estimate a company’s carbon footprint.
Drones, buildings and the grid
The company on our list with the most funding, meanwhile, is Alameda, California-based Saildrone, operator of a fleet of unmanned boats that collect ocean data. The 11-year-old company, which has raised $189 million to date, cites oceanic ecosystem monitoring as one of its core use cases, including efforts to measure how much carbon the ocean absorbs.
Back on solid ground, London-based Arloid Automation is deploying AI to move buildings closer to net zero. Its tools continually analyze site-specific data to determine the most efficient energy approach for each part of a building.
BluWave-ai, out of Ottawa, is all about optimizing the grid for clean energy. Its platform balances the cost, availability, and carbon footprint of different energy sources and energy storage, along with demand, in real-time.
Not just buzzwords
Looking at startup funding announcements, it’s easy to get the impression that AI is becoming the tech equivalent of salt: an ingredient that’s in just about everything.
Looking at our funded companies list, however, it’s clear artificial intelligence is doing heavy lifting in some very complex analyses. This includes continuous tracking and interpretation of sensor data and helping automate decision-making around optimal energy use and investments in reducing carbon footprints.
In sci-fi films, we’re usually rooting against AI systems that manage to do what humans cannot. In the case of carbon reduction, however, it might be nice to see the computers take a more leading role.

Character-Creating Startup Inworld AI Raises More Cash At $500M Valuation,Chris Metinko,2023/08/2,"

Inworld AI, which uses generative AI to help developers create smart characters that can learn and perform their own actions, closed a fresh round of funding at a $500 million valuation.
While the round has not completely closed — that is expected later this month — the company said it will total $50 million-plus. The rounds includes some big investor names — Lightspeed Venture Partners, Stanford University, First Spark Ventures, Samsung Next, LG Technology Ventures and other existing investors.

Inworld has now raised more than $100 million since being founded in 2021, per the company. 
The Mountain View, California-based startup sits at the intersection of AI and gaming. It has developed a “Character Engine” to create non-playable characters for gaming and other interactive experiences using multiple machine-learning models.
Developers can use the platform to create characters that can learn and adapt, have memories and motivations, and even navigate relationships.
“The financial runway means we can take a long-term view when it comes to supporting the developer community today, and stay ahead of the curve in the ever-evolving landscape of generative AI for tomorrow,” said co-founder and CEO Ilya Gelfenbeyn in a blog.
Gaming funding slows
While Inworld’s platform can be applied to different use cases, there is no denying how it can be used in gaming — which has seen limited VC interest this year, according to Crunchbase data.
Funding to U.S.-based gaming startups hit a high in 2021 — like many other industries — topping more than $5 billion.
Last year, such startups saw about $3.8 billion invested, although $2 billion of that went to Epic Games in a massive round.
However, with more than half of 2023 gone, U.S.-based gaming startups have received just more than $400 million to date.
It’s likely AI’s applications to gaming will spur on more investment, but the industry has a long way to go to even come close to last year’s funding numbers.

LightForce Picks Up $80M As More Funds Flow To Straighter Teeth,Joanna Glasner,2023/08/2,"

Orthodontics may be the most effective route to a better smile. But few people grin at the idea of visiting the orthodontist.
The most common treatment, braces, are famously uncomfortable. The associated consultations and follow-up visits require copious amounts of time and money. And desired outcomes aren’t guaranteed.
Thus, it’s not entirely surprising to see startups focused on improving the orthodontics experience raising sizable sums of venture capital. The most recent recipient, LightForce Orthodontics, a maker of personalized 3D-printed braces, announced an $80 million Series D round today led by Ally Bridge Group.

The round brings total funding to date for Burlington, Massachusetts-based LightForce to more than $150 million. Founded in 2015, the company is on a mission “to change the world of stock braces,” per its CEO and founder Alfred Griffin III.
Where the money is going in orthodontics
LightForce is one of several orthodontics-focused companies funded in the past few quarters. Using Crunchbase data, we put together a sample list of 12 venture- and private equity-backed companies that have collectively raised over $1.4 billion:


With the exception of Smile Doctors, a national network of orthodontist practices that picked up $550 million in private equity funding in July, most companies have a digital technology focus. Broadly, they’re working on software-enabled technologies that can help reduce in-person visits and provide more customized treatments.
Certainty LightForce fits into that category. In tandem with its latest funding, the company is building out a 36,000-square-foot manufacturing facility to 3D-print custom braces for its largely adolescent customer base. Griffin said that its custom braces allow both reduced overall treatment time and fewer orthodontist visits.
Another heavily funded company in the space, Paris-based Dental Monitoring, has raised more than $230 million to date for its software-focused approach. The company employs AI to help practices analyze dental images, including those taken by smartphones.
Impress, based in Barcelona, has also raised significant funding. The company, which closed on a $125 million Series B last year, offers clear aligners and orthodontic services, with a mix of check-ins via app and in-person clinic visits.
Back in the U.S., meanwhile, Memphis-based uLab Systems is another dental upstart on the AI bandwagon. The company offers software that automatically segments the teeth and uses artificial intelligence to create a baseline treatment plan.
Giving orthodontics patients more to smile about
Orthodontics, lest anyone forget, represents a rather large addressable market. Each year, more than 20 million patients globally begin orthodontic treatments, per LightForce. Of those, roughly two-thirds are teenagers, and most will need braces costing several thousand dollars.
There are prospects for sharp growth too, given that there is a larger multiple of people worldwide who would benefit from braces but don’t have access or means to get them. Still others might opt to pursue straighter teeth if orthodontic treatment were faster, more comfortable and had higher success rates.
Also notably, while investor interest in orthodontic technology looks robust, they’re backing startups looking to augment orthodontists, not replace them. While AI might help design your braces, they’re not looking to put them on you.

"India, Israel Lead The Way In Asian Venture Market Drop",Chris Metinko,2023/08/2,"

With growing tensions starting to affect U.S. investment in China, it seems logical to conclude the 44% drop in Q2 venture funding in Asia is mainly due to a pullback by investors in Chinese startups.
But that doesn’t appear to be the case, at least according to Crunchbase numbers. In fact, China’s venture market seems to have steadied from last year, while uncertainty continues to roil the funding markets in the region’s other large venture hubs.

Meanwhile, India, South Korea, Singapore and Israel all saw significant drops in venture funding when comparing Q2 of this year to the same time last year.


The Red Dragon stabilizes
There is no denying the strained relationship between China and the U.S. and its effect on investments in the world’s second-most populated country.
Venture capital giant Sequoia Capital announced in June it would break up from its China and India arms, likely a result of more promised regulations involving U.S.-based investment in China.
It also was reported last week President Joe Biden plans to sign an executive order to limit U.S. tech investments in China by mid-August.
Despite the increasing tensions, the venture market in China actually saw some gains both quarter over quarter and year over year — although numbers for the first half of the year were still down.


In Q2, China-based startups raised $11.2 billion, a slight 4% bump from the same quarter last year and up 22% from the first quarter, which saw only $9.2 billion in funding, per Crunchbase data.
For the first half of the year, $20.4 billion was invested — down from $24.3 billion in H1 last year and $23.8 billion in the latter half of 2022.
Some notable big rounds in the regions in Q2 included:

Sunwoda Electric Vehicle Battery raised a huge $2.4 billion venture round in May.
Fast-fashion startup Shein reportedly raised $2 billion at two-thirds of its previous valuation, according to The Wall Street Journal in May.
Anhui YOFC Advanced Semiconductor, a manufacturer of silicon carbide power semiconductor products, raised nearly $524 million in a Series A in June.
In April, SJ Semi, a foundry that implements front-end wafer manufacturing, closed a $340 million Series C.
That same month, pharmaceutical company Hasten Biomedical completed a $315 million venture round.

Venture plummets in India
While China’s venture numbers being down 16% in the first half of the year paints a dark picture for the region — especially since it is by far the largest venture market in Asia — it is nothing compared to the drop India witnessed.


India — Asia’s second-largest venture market — plummeted 72% quarter to quarter, falling from $8.5 billion in funding in Q2 last year to only $2.4 billion this year, per Crunchbase data. That’s even including a massive $1.3 billion round for renewable energy company Avaada Energy.
The drop in H1 is similar, with venture falling 73%, from $18.4 billion to only $4.9 billion in H1 of this year.
India’s not alone
The region’s other three largest venture markets also saw significant drops year to year.
Funding to startups in South Korea took a substantial hit, falling from $3.1 billion in Q2 last year to only $1.4 billion this year — a drop of 55%. That’s despite Seoul-based autonomous mobility firm 42dot’s $787 million raise in April.
South Korea’s first half numbers are even bleaker, dropping 60% — from $8.5 billion last year to only $3.4 billion in H1 this year.
Singapore’s venture story was nearly identical. Startups in that country saw funding dip 59% quarter to quarter — from $2.9 billion last year to only $1.2 billion this year.
First-half venture number in Singapore also dropped 62%, falling from $6.1 billion to $2.3 billion in H1 this year — again despite a big round for online shopping site Lazada Group, which raked in $353 million from its parent firm Alibaba, according to reports.
Even Israel — which prides itself on its tech startup scene — saw a substantial drop in venture funding, as the country faces significant political upheaval in Israel which seems to have made investors wary.
Israeli startups saw a 63% year-to-year drop in funding, falling from $2.7 billion in Q2 last year to only about $1 billion in Q2 this year — which also matched total venture funding in the first quarter of the year.
Overall, venture funding in Israel dropped 64% in the first half of the year compared to last, falling from $5.6 billion last year to only $2 billion in the first half this year.
What it means
The data indicates that despite attention-grabbing headlines about the decline of U.S. investment in China, the region overall has watched venture dip more dramatically in some of its other countries.
While China’s venture market dwarfs others in the region — making even a drop of a few percentage points significant — it will be extremely interesting to see if areas like India and Israel continue to see such substantial declines.
If those areas continue to see a drop, any rebound in the region in venture may rely solely on the Red Dragon.

NATO Is Ready To Start Writing Checks To Security And Defense Startups From Its New $1.1B Fund,Marlize van Romburgh,2023/08/1,"

NATO said Tuesday it has closed on a 1 billion euro ($1.1 billion) fund to back startups working on defense and security technology that would benefit the military alliance. The fund is the first of its kind — a multicountry venture fund that will invest in defense-related startups to support its member nations — and comes as Russia’s war in Ukraine continues to rage, with NATO countries providing intense support to Kyiv.
Twenty-three NATO member countries are limited partners in the fund. That includes Sweden, which is pursuing membership in the alliance. The NATO Innovation Fund will make direct investments into startups, as well as provide capital to venture funds that invest in such startups.
Notably, the U.S. is not one of the member nations backing the NATO fund, which appears to be somewhat modeled after In-Q-Tel, a venture firm that works with the CIA to back startups.

“With a 15-year timeframe, the NATO Innovation Fund will help bring to life those nascent technologies that have the power to transform our security in the decades to come, strengthening the Alliance’s innovation ecosystem and bolstering the security of our one billion citizens,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said when announcing the fund last year.
Defense tech overall still receives relatively paltry sums of venture funding. Less than $1.9 billion was raised by national security-related startups last year, Crunchbase data shows, and the vast majority of that was in a single round: $1.48 billion to Anduril Industries, a defense tech startup founded by Oculus founder Palmer Luckey.
In 2021, a record year for venture funding, venture investors globally spent just $870 million on national security startups, Crunchbase data shows.

John Chambers’ Networking Startup Nile Nails Down $175M,Chris Metinko,2023/08/1,"

Enterprise networking can be a hard sector for a startup to break into, as it has long been dominated by tech giants.
That has not deterred San Jose, California-based networking startup Nile, which announced a large $175 million Series C less than a year after emerging from stealth. The company was co-founded by former Cisco Systems executives John Chambers and Pankaj Patel. Chambers served as CEO of the networking giant for two decades.

The round was co-led by March Capital and Saudi Arabia sovereign wealth fund Sanabil Investments. It also included strategic participation from Prosperity7 — the venture capital fund of Saudi Arabia-based Aramco Ventures — and Liberty Global Ventures. 8VC 1, Geodesic Capital, U First Capital and Valor Equity Partners also contributed.
Simplifying and securing the network
Nile is attempting to disrupt the networking industry by offering network-as-a-service with more secure wired and wireless services enhanced with monitoring, analytics and automation.
The idea is to help companies simplify their modern networking needs and offer optimum security while going head-to-head with goliaths such as Cisco and Juniper Networks.
“Nile is in a strong position to take advantage of several paradigm shifts occurring across the technology ecosystem,” said Patel, mentioning cloud-born edge infrastructure, AI and cloud migration strategies in particular.
“These trends present unique challenges in the way enterprise infrastructure is consumed, and Nile is committed to addressing them head-on, making our service as agile and innovative as the technology solutions it enables,” he added.
Nile already has expanded into Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia, and collaborates with more than 100 channel- and service-provider partners.
The startup did not offer a valuation. The round brings Nile’s total amount of capital raised to $300 million since being founded in 2018, per the company.

These Are The Most Active And Spendiest Cleantech Investors,Joanna Glasner,2023/08/1,"

Venture investing can be a cliquish business. Sure, there are plenty of generalist firms. But when you look at the most active investors in a single industry, specialist funds often lead.
This is certainly the case for sustainability investment. A handful of climate-focused investors dominate the ranks for deal count and investment size in recent quarters, per Crunchbase data.
Many of the busiest cleantech investors have also gotten more active in 2023. That’s significant, given that overall venture funding has fallen, indicating these industry-focused firms see both increased urgency and opportunity around their investment thesis.

To start, we took a look at the most active cross-stage sustainability investors by deal count:


Topping the chart is Lowercarbon Capital, the sustainability-focused fund co-founded by early Twitter and Uber investor Chris Sacca.
Lowercarbon had the most active quarter in its history in Q2 of this year, backing 15 newly reported rounds, according to Crunchbase data. Its largest co-led round for 2023 was a $70 million Series B for Loam Bio, an Australian startup using microbial technology to capture carbon in agricultural soils.
Three investors are tied for second place: Temasek, a Singapore-based cross-industry investor with a sustainability mantra; Fifth Wall, a real estate specialist with a focus on energy efficiency; and Khosla Ventures, one of the earliest Silicon Valley firms to carve out cleantech as a core focus area.
Most active high-spending lead investors
Turning to the most active and high-spending lead investors, the list of names is a little different.
Here, Fifth Wall led the ranks, leading or co-leading five venture rounds. The largest was a $300 million Series B for battery technology developer Our Next Energy.
Below, we rank the active sustainability investors who led or co-led the largest sum total of investments in the first half of the year:


TPG Rise Climate Fund, which closed on a $7.3 billion investment vehicle last year, has also been putting capital to work. This year it led a $250 million Series C for green hydrogen company Ohmium and a $150 million financing for clean energy marketplace Palmetto Clean Technology.
Looking at the lineup over 10 years
Taking a longer-term view, the list of most active investors also contains some different names.
Among cross-stage investors, Breakthrough Energy Ventures ranks as the most active venture backer for years 2013 to 2023, with 107 reported rounds. Temasek ranks a distant second with 64 reported financings.
Among seed-focused investors, meanwhile, it’s generalists rather than cleantech-focused funds that are most active in sustainability dealmaking. The top three in our ranking are the perennially active Techstars, SOSV and Y Combinator.
Looking ahead, it’ll be interesting to see if the current state of affairs persists in which cleantech-focused investors take the lead over generalist firms in larger financings.
There are quirks to the sustainability space that make it not the right fit for every firm. This includes the outsized impact of government policy, commonly high capital requirements, and the tendency to gauge returns by both environmental and financial metrics. For those who are dedicated to the space, however, it looks like their commitments are strong as ever.

"The 10 Biggest Rounds Of July: Lvrch, Kim Kardashian And Biotech",Chris Metinko,2023/08/1,"

This is a monthly feature that runs down the month’s top 10 funding rounds in the U.S. See last month’s top rounds here.
Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out The Crunchbase Megadeals Tracker.

Summer can be slow, especially for those raising venture funding. However, last month saw some pretty strong rounds — thanks in large part to biotech, which dominated the list. The rest of the largest rounds were spread around to several industries, including financial services, compliance and, of course, an apparel company by Kim Kardashian.
1. Lvrch Capital Advisory, $400M, financial services: Last month’s top entry likely stayed under the radar for most people. Nevertheless, Woodland Hills, California-based investment firm Lvrch Capital Advisory locked up the top spot with a massive $400 million Series D. Investors in the round were not disclosed. The firm plans to use the cash infusion to introduce a new compounding system for investors to maximize their earnings through the power of compound interest. Founded in 2013, the firm has raised $600 million, per Crunchbase.
2. Skims, $270M, clothing: Skims hit a $4 billion valuation last month after Kim Kardashian’s apparel brand raised $270 million in a funding round led by Wellington Management. It was just early last year that the underwear and shapewear brand raised $240 million in a round led by Lone Pine Capital that valued the company at $3.2 billion. The startup, which offers everything from underwear to loungewear, expects sales to grow from $500 million last year to $750 million this year. It’s also expanding into brick-and-mortar sites. Founded four years ago, the company has now raised $669 million, per Crunchbase.
3. (tied) Septerna, $150M, biotech: South San Francisco, California-based Septerna closed a $150 million Series B led by new investor RA Capital Management. Septerna focuses on small molecule drugs that target proteins called G protein-coupled receptors, which control signals across cellular membranes and are often targeted by drug developers. Septerna is one of them, and is developing a treatment for hypoparathyroidism, a condition characterized by the deficiency of parathyroid hormone — which controls blood calcium and phosphate levels. Founded just last year, the company has now raised $250 million, per Crunchbase.
3. (tied) OneTrust, $150M, compliance: Down rounds have become a reality for many startups as the venture market has slowed, especially those that have been minted unicorns. Atlanta-based OneTrust became one of the latest startups to raise a down round, as it locked up a $150 million round led by new investor Generation Investment Management — a firm co-founded by former Vice President Al Gore — with participation from existing investor Sands Capital at a $4.5 billion valuation. The valuation represents about a 12% drop from the $5.1 billion valuation the privacy and security startup garnered after it raised a Series C in late 2020 and an extension in 2021. OneTrust helps companies manage privacy, security and governance requirements in the ever-changing regulatory environment. Other large private companies such as Klarna and Stripe also have raised down rounds as the venture market has continued to slow since its highs of 2021. Founded in 2016, OneTrust says it has now raised more than $1 billion.
3. (tied) Kriya Therapeutics, $150M, biotech: Again, a biotech startup raises big (and it won’t be the last one on the list). Palo Alto, California-based Kriya Therapeutics announced the addition of more than $150 million in capital committed as part of its Series C. That brings the total for the round to more than $430 million. Patient Square Capital led the Series C. The startup is developing gene therapies for a range of conditions including those involving ophthalmology and metabolic disease. Founded in 2019, the company says it has now raised more than $600 million.
6. o9 Solutions, $116M, enterprise software: Like Skims, o9 Solutions locked up a nice chunk of cash in January 2022 and got another shot of growth capital this week. The Dallas-based startup, which offers cloud-based solutions that help companies with planning and operations, raised a $116 million round led by General Atlantic’s Beyond Net Zero fund. The new investment values o9 at $3.7 billion, up from $2.7 billion since its $295 million round a year-and-a-half ago. Founded in 2009, the company has raised $533 million, per Crunchbase.
7. AppHub, $95M, e-commerce: E-commerce is only growing as more people buy things digitally. New York-based AppHub helps merchants make those sales happen with its e-commerce enablement platform, and last month it raised $95 million from PSG to help even more. AppHub’s platform helps merchants across a variety of e-commerce sites, including Shopify and BigCommerce. The company also announced it acquired Boost, an AI-powered search tool. Founded in 2021, the company has raised $155 million, per Crunchbase.
8. SpyGlass Pharma, $90M, biotech: More biotech, as Aliso Viejo, California-based SpyGlass Pharma locked up a $90 million Series C led by RA Capital Management. The ophthalmic therapeutics company has developed a system that helps deliver medical therapy to address glaucoma management as well as other chronic ophthalmic diseases when implanted at the time of cataract surgery. Founded in 2019, the firm has raised nearly $110 million, according to Crunchbase data.
9. (tied) Avnos, $80M, environmental engineering: Carbon storage and removal is big business and popular in venture right now. Los Angeles-based Avnos became one of the latest in the space to raise big cash, signing “multi-year strategic and investment partnerships” worth more than $80 million with ConocoPhillips, JetBlue Ventures and Shell Ventures. The company has developed a “hybrid direct air capture” unit for carbon dioxide removal. Avnos expects to deliver commercial-ready HDAC units by the end of 2025. This is the first disclosed round, per Crunchbase, for the company founded in 2021.
9. (tied) Crossbow Therapeutics, $80M, biotech: Are you getting the idea it was a big month for biotech? Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Crossbow Therapeutics joined the hit parade after raising an $80 million Series A funding round led by MPM Capital and Pfizer Venture Investments. The company is developing antibody therapies to treat a broad range of cancers. Founded in 2021, this is the company’s first announced funding, per Crunchbase.
Big global deals
While U.S.-based startups saw some big cash, the biggest round went to a broadband company across the pond.

London-based Nexfibre, a fiber-to-the-home broadband company, raised a $1.8 billion equity round.

Methodology
We tracked the largest rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies in July. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late.

"Walmart Buys Out Tiger Global’s Flipkart Stake, Valuing Startup at $35B",Chris Metinko,2023/07/31,"

Retail giant Walmart bought out Tiger Global Management’s remaining stake in India-based startup Flipkart in a deal that values the e-commerce decacorn at $35 billion.
That valuation is down from the $38 billion valuation Flipkart received after its massive $3.6 billion round in 2021, per The Wall Street Journal, which broke news of the transaction.

Tiger had invested nearly $1.2 billion in Flipkart between 2010 and 2015 and has generated $3.5 billion in gains, the report stated.
Founded in 2007, Flipkart is one of India’s biggest startups, with a portfolio of e-commerce sites and brick-and-mortar stores.
Tiger changes strategy
Tiger was one of the most active late-stage growth investors when the venture capital market was booming in 2021.
However, as the market has significantly slowed, Tiger has dramatically cut back on its startup investment pace, and in May it was reported the New York-based crossover investment giant had hired an adviser to help it sell off some stakes in startups.
Performing secondary sales of stakes in companies it previously bought is seen as a way for Tiger to return capital to its investors as both avenues for exits — IPOs and M&A — have cooled substantially.
Tiger has significantly cut down on its investments throughout the past year, according to Crunchbase data. The firm made 249 deals in the first half of last year, but so far this year has made only 20.
In April, it was reported Tiger Global’s $12.7 billion fund — which was launched near the end of 2021 — had a paper loss of 20%, net of management fees, as of December.
In March, The Wall Street Journal reported Tiger Global had marked down the value of its investments across its venture capital funds by about 33%.

"The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Lvrch Capital Advisory, OneTrust And Kriya Raise Big",Chris Metinko,2023/07/28,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out The Crunchbase Megadeals Tracker.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.

A trio of big rounds led the way this week, including a huge $400 million raise. The week didn’t provide any specific trends, but did see a unicorn raise a down round and investors writing big checks to two companies using AI in health care.
1. Lvrch Capital Advisory, $400M, financial services: This week’s top entry likely stayed under the radar for most people — after all it does not involve AI. Nevertheless, Woodland Hills, California-based investment firm Lvrch Capital Advisory locked up the top spot with a massive $400 million Series D. Investors in the round were not disclosed.

The San Mateo, California-based startup, whose platform uses AI to help diagnose neurovascular, cardiac and vascular diseases, closed a $75 million Series C led by Vista Credit Partners, a subsidiary of Vista Equity Partners. RapidAI’s Rapid NCCT Stroke platform gives hospitals imaging and decision support to address possible strokes — the second leading cause of death globally. The company also has developed modules for cerebral aneurysm management and the identification and notification of a suspected central pulmonary embolism. It hopes to eventually also address other diseases. Founded in 2011, the company has now raised $100 million, per Crunchbase data.
6. Nexo Therapeutics, $60M, biotech: Littleton, Colorado-based Nexo Therapeutics, a small molecule oncology company, came out of stealth this week and raised a $60 million Series A led by Versant Ventures.
7. Ossium Health, $52M, biotech: San Francisco-based Ossium Health, a bioengineering company developinga bank of on-demand bone marrow, closed a $52 million Series C led by CPMG. Founded in 2016, the company has raised nearly $129 million, per Crunchbase.

"
The Most Valuable US Tech Companies Still Aren’t Buying Startups,Joanna Glasner,2023/07/28,"

Selling your startup to one of the most valuable U.S. technology companies used to be both a popular and mildly realistic path to exit.
Not anymore. These days, the most deep-pocketed acquirers seldom snap up venture-backed companies. Their aversion to such deals has intensified in recent quarters, amid a broader slowdown in startup M&A.
So far this year, the “Big Five” most valuable U.S. tech companies — Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia — have made just five known startup acquisitions, per Crunchbase data (see list). Four of the acquirees were seed-stage companies, and none of the purchase prices were disclosed.
Currently, 2023 is on pace to have the smallest number of acquisitions by the Big Five in years. To illustrate, we charted out deal counts and disclosed purchase prices for the cohort below:


Less money going to startup M&A too
In addition to doing fewer deals, the tech giants also appear to be spending far less money. This isn’t a hard stat, as most transaction announcements don’t include the price. However, given that the five startups bought this year previously raised just $57 million in equity funding altogether, these probably weren’t big-ticket deals.
That paucity of big purchases makes the odds of selling your startup for billions to, say, Google or Microsoft, look weak. Zeroing in on the largest tech companies’ acquisitions of startups over the past three calendar years, there’s not a single known deal above $1 billion:


Acquisitions of established companies still happening
Of course, tech giants are willing to spend handsomely on established companies. Last year, Microsoft agreed to pay $68.7 billion for gaming heavyweight Activision Blizzard (the deal has not yet closed). A year earlier, the software giant agreed to shell out $19.7 billion for publicly traded conversational AI SaaS provider Nuance Communications.
Amazon picked up MGM Studios for $8.5 billion in a deal that closed last year, and spent $3.9 billion to buy primary care clinic operator One Medical.  And Google bought cybersecurity provider Mandiant last year for $5.4 billion.
Nvidia, for its part, attempted to spend big, with a 2020 agreement to buy chipmaker Arm for $40 billion in 2020. It terminated the deal last year, however, citing regulatory challenges.
Notably, so far this year the Big Five have not announced any multibillion-dollar acquisitions. All are flush with cash and have market caps in excess of $1 trillion, so they certainly have the means to buy what they want. As such, it’s likely the prospect of stepped-up antitrust scrutiny and regulatory challenges is a factor keeping deals down.
It wasn’t like this before
In prior years, the most valuable tech companies have been behind some of the largest and best-known startup exits. The list includes:

Microsoft’s $7.5 billion purchase of GitHub  in 2018.
Google’s $3.2 billion purchase of thermostat maker Nest Labs in 2014, and its $2.1 billion acquisition of fitness tracker Fitbit in 2019.
Amazon’s $1 billion purchase of smart doorbell maker Ring in 2018.

Today, it’s far more likely one of the tech heavyweights will invest in your company, rather than buy it.
While M&A may be down, Crunchbase data shows corporate venture investors have been taking a bigger role in startup funding. Like everyone else, they’ve been particularly keen on the AI space, by far the most prominent bright spot in a slowed-down investment environment.

RapidAI Raises $75M To Help Diagnose Strokes,Chris Metinko,2023/07/27,"

Every industry will be impacted by the rise of artificial intelligence, and that certainly will include health care in a big way.
RapidAI became the latest startup to raise a significant amount of money to help with how we care for ourselves using AI.
The San Mateo, California-based company, whose platform uses AI to help diagnose neurovascular, cardiac and vascular diseases, closed a $75 million Series C funding led by Vista Credit Partners, a subsidiary of Vista Equity Partners.

RapidAI’s Rapid NCCT Stroke platform gives hospitals imaging and decision support to address possible strokes — the second leading cause of death globally. The company also has developed modules for cerebral aneurysm management and the identification and notification of a suspected central pulmonary embolism. It hopes to eventually also address other diseases.
“Hospitals are increasingly looking for RapidAI solutions to solve their critical needs, including helping care teams work more efficiently and support clinical decision making for better patient outcomes,” CEO Karim Karti said in a release.
Founded in 2011, the company has now raised $100 million, per Crunchbase data.
AI in health care
RapidAI is not the only AI-enhanced, health-related startup to see fresh funding from investors hoping to eventually cash in on the intersection of two big sectors: AI and health care.
Seattle-based Proprio announced a $43 million Series B, also on Thursday. The startup has developed an AI-driven surgical navigation platform that generates a real-time 3D visualization of the surgery.
Earlier this month, London-based Causaly closed a $60 million Series B. The company has created an AI-enhanced platform to help accelerate drug discovery.
With artificial intelligence investment hitting a fever pitch, expect more deals in the health care space when it involves AI-enriched platforms and insights.

AI Leads For New Unicorns In June,Gené Teare,2023/07/27,"

Six companies joined The Crunchbase Unicorn Board in June 2023, half of them from the AI sector.
June’s new unicorn count is down from the 32 new unicorns minted in June 2022 and the 53 new unicorns born in June 2021. Since July 2022, new unicorn counts have fallen drastically and, starting in November, have settled primarily in the single digits.

A total of 44 new unicorns joined the board in the first half of 2023. They collectively added $56 billion in value to the board. Over the life of these companies, they’ve raised $11 billion.
Compare these new entrants to the first half of 2022, when 151 companies joined, and to H1 2021, when counts soared with 295 companies joining.


Leading sectors in 2023
A quarter of new unicorns this year, 11 companies, are native AI companies. Other trending unicorn sectors include energy companies (totaling seven), health care and biotech (six companies in each), and semiconductor companies (four).
June’s new unicorns
Let’s look at the companies that joined in June.
AI

The newest to unicorn is months old Light Years Beyond, a Beijing-based generative AI tool founded by Meituan co-founder Wang Huiwen. It was funded at a unicorn valuation, then acquired by Meituan for $234 million at the end of June. It raised a Series A extension  in June which valued the company at $1.2 billion. This followed an initial Series A raised months earlier.
Typeface, a 1-year-old AI content creation platform for enterprises, raised a $100 million Series B led by Salesforce Ventures 1at a $1 billion valuation. The funding announcement was partly generated by Typeface’s own AI tool. Participants in the current round include Lightspeed Venture Partners, Madrona, GV, Menlo Ventures and M12. Salesforce and Google Cloud will offer Typeface services to its customers. The San Francisco-based company raised its $65 million Series A four months earlier, led by Lightspeed.
Six-year-old Synthesia, a generative AI video company based out of London, was valued at $1 billion. It raised a $90 million Series C funding led by Accel. NVentures, Nvidia’s venture capital arm, participated, as did existing investors Kleiner Perkins, GV and FirstMark. In 2019, the company’s technology was used in a David Beckham malaria campaign that “faked” him speaking in multiple languages.

E-commerce

Two-year-old Cart.com is an Austin-based e-commerce and logistics delivery platform for brands and e-commerce sites selling direct to consumers. The company raised a $60 million Series C at a valuation of $1.3 billion. Cart.com generated revenue of $180 million in 2022 and is expected to grow revenue more than 39% in 2023, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Mining

KoBold Metals, a 5-year-old company that uses AI for mining minerals used in electric vehicle batteries, raised a $195 million led by T. Rowe Price valuing the company at  $1.2  billion. Existing investors in the Berkeley, California-based company include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and Bond.

Energy

Solar and power box company 1Komma5º, based in Hamburg, has raised $200 million with an option for investors to invest another $200 million to help households manage their energy. The 2-year-old company was valued at $1 billion in this funding led by G2 Venture Partners.

Methodology
The Crunchbase Unicorn Board is a curated list that includes private unicorn companies with post-money valuations of $1 billion or more and is based on Crunchbase data. New companies are added to the Unicorn Board as they reach the $1 billion valuation mark as part of a funding round.
The unicorn board does not reflect internal company valuations — such as those set via a 409a process for employee stock options — as these differ from, and are more likely to be lower than, a priced funding round. We also do not adjust valuations based on investor writedowns, which change quarterly, as different investors will not value the same company consistently within the same quarter.
Funding to unicorn companies includes all private financings to companies that are tagged as unicorns, as well as those that have since graduated to The Exited Unicorn Board.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.

Beyond OpenAI: Sam Altman The Investor Takes Center Stage,Chris Metinko,2023/07/26,"

It’s already been a big week for Sam Altman — and it has little to do with ChatGPT.
This week saw the launch of the somewhat controversial crypto project Worldcoin — which is backed by Altman’s Tools For Humanity startup. The project’s World ID platform is attempting to create unique digital identities — based on blockchain technology — for people by scanning their eyes with a small orb. The idea has led to many questions surrounding AI, data and privacy.
Altman was also revealed this week as one of several investors behind Vital Biosciences’ $48 million funding round. The startup — which has brought back some memories of Theranos — aims to make blood diagnostic testing easier and quicker.

If it seems like Altman is more in the news for things non-OpenAI related, that’s likely because it is becoming more and more true as he has become one of the Valley’s most active investors in everything from renewable energy to health care to — of course — AI.
According to Crunchbase data, Altman has made nearly 100 deals just as an individual or angel investor, many more through other firms he co-founded, and even through accelerator giant Y Combinator, where he served as president for five years. It is widely assumed his actual investments number well into the hundreds.
The portfolio
While a complete, comprehensive list of all of Altman’s bets is difficult to gather, a quick glance at what is known reveals some impressive names and numbers.
As an individual investor, Altman has invested in at least nine unicorns — and likely more.
The list includes the likes of San Francisco-based HR tech startup Gusto; Fremont, California-based brain machine interface Neuralink — founded by another guy who’s been in the news this week (as always) — and San Francisco-based cyber insurance company Coalition.
Altman also has a significant number of investments through a variety of firms including Altman Capital, Apollo Projects and Hydrazine Capital, as well as through his more than decadelong association with Y Combinator.
Through the accelerator — where he spent five years as president — Altman helped lead investments for Y Combinator in significant companies including Cruise, Instacart and Reddit.
Apollo Projects — which Altman founded with his brothers Jack Altman and Max Altman — also has made noteworthy deals. The early-stage firm, which provides “funding for moonshots,” took part in the $195 million round for Berkeley, California-based KoBold Metals just last month.
KoBold uses artificial intelligence to mine for valuable metals such as cobalt, copper, nickel and lithium used in the production of batteries for a variety of sectors, including electric vehicles. The startup has built a database about the Earth’s layers and uses algorithms to make predictions about where mineral deposits are around the world.
The round, which valued the company at $1.15 billion, also included investments from Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos-backed Breakthrough Energy Ventures.
A deeper look
However, anyone assuming as an individual investor Altman’s focus is solely on applications for AI would be proven incorrect.
There is no denying there is an AI angle to many of his deals. In the investments Crunchbase data lists to Altman as a solo investor, many lean very heavy into AI.
Those include being an early investor in San Francisco-based Rain, which is designing chips that can imitate the way the human brain works — allowing processing and memory to happen in the same place, which could allow AI algorithms to run much faster and at reduced energy costs.
Altman also has looked at how AI can be used in biotech and health. He is a backer of Boston-based 1910 Genetics, a biotechnology company integrating AI, computation and biological automation to improve drug development, and Palo Alto, California-based Spring Discovery, which equips scientists with software that allows them to teach AI to identify cell behavior to get further insights.
However, some investments Altman has made do not scream AI at first glance.
He is a backer of Alt, which allows people to buy, sell and store sports cards. The company  raised cash in 2021, taking advantage of the boom in people looking to diversify into alternative assets.
Los Angeles-based Queer Spaces is another company Altman has supported. The startup is a chat platform for building queer communities, serving the entirety of the LGBTQ+ spectrum.
Altman even recently co-led a $29 million round in New York-based edtech startup Campus.edu, and also was an early backer of a San Francisco-based house cleaning service — Exec — more than a decade ago.
On the energy and environment front, Altman led a $500 million Series E for Everett, Washington-based Helion Energy, a fusion power startup developing the world’s first fusion generators. He also has backed New York-based Nautilus Labs (we’ve talked about this deal before), which uses machine learning to try to help ocean shippers lower emissions and fuel waste while also maximizing commercial returns.
Fintech and e-commerce also have been of particular interest, including several in crypto and bitcoin. That includes New York-based startup Arkam Intelligence, which uses AI to provide real-time data on cryptocurrency networks and the entities behind them.
While there is no denying several startups harnessing AI have received a check from Altman — such as AI time management platform Motion and pilot assistant technology developer Beacon AI — the diversity of his portfolio suggests not even ChatGPT could predict his next deal.

"
Funding For Drone Delivery Startups Still Flying High Amid VC Downturn,Joanna Glasner,2023/07/26,"

Those who follow the startup world are accustomed to pitches about how our future lives will look. Sometimes it never pans out. Other times, shifts happen surprisingly fast.
For consumer drone delivery, the journey from vision to reality hasn’t been the quickest. It was nearly a decade ago that Jeff Bezos first unveiled Amazon’s R&D initiative around drone package delivery. And while drone startups have a long history delivering vital supplies to remote locales, they’re not yet a presence in your typical American suburb.
If recent startup funding is any indication, however, we could see the pace of rollouts picking up.

So far this year, more than $1.5 billion has gone to companies in the drone space, with a particular focus on delivery, Crunchbase data shows. The largest funding recipient, San Francisco-based Zipline, is making the case that consumer delivery is a concept whose time has come.
Zipline CEO Keller Rinaudo Cliffton markets the technology as a greener alternative. In a keynote this year, he posited that businesses are “still using the same 3,000-pound gas combustion vehicles driven by humans to make billions of deliveries that usually weigh less than five pounds. This is slow, it’s expensive, and it’s terrible for the planet.”
In Cliffton’s vision, drones are poised to do much of this work. To that end, this spring the company announced partnerships for regional drone delivery with supplements seller GNC and Seattle pizza chain Pagliacci Pizza starting next year. Pagliacci tells customers it will be able to use the drones “to deliver two 13-inch pizzas, a salad and a couple sodas.”
The planned rollout comes amid a broad rise in funding to drone-focused companies. Less than seven months into 2023, seed and venture funding to companies in the drone and drone management sectors has already hit $1.51 billion, per Crunchbase data. That’s almost as much as the entire 2022 fundraising haul for the space.
For a sense of how investment is trending, we charted out annual funding to drone and drone management companies for the past six calendar years below:


Seeing such strong tallies in 2023 is particularly significant given that overall startup funding has fallen sharply. Global investment in the first half of this year was down 51% compared to the second quarter of 2022
The drone space, by contrast, is seeing a flurry of big rounds. To illustrate, we used Crunchbase data to put together a list of 11 venture-backed companies in the drone delivery space that raised funding this year:


After Zipline, the next-highest funding recipient on our list is Silicon Valley-based dronemaker Skydio, which picked up $230 million in Series E financing in February. At the time, the company disclosed that it has logged 30x growth over the past three years.
Skydio says it is currently the largest drone manufacturer in the U.S. Major customers include the U.S. Department of Defense, along with public safety agencies, energy utilities and hobbyists.
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, Germany’s Wingcopter picked up $44 million from the European Investment Bank in May to scale its electric unmanned aircraft. The company has deployed them to deliver medicines and supplies to rural communities in Malawi. It’s also launching a pilot project in Germany for groceries and consumer goods.
For now, in the evolution of drone delivery business models, we seem to be at the inflection point of going from need to have to nice to have. Upstarts have already demonstrated they can deliver urgently needed supplies to out-of-the-way places. It’s time to see if they can also fill a niche serving end users who are already close to stores and on delivery routes.
Startups aren’t the only players with big plans for drone delivery. Amazon, Walmart and Google, for instance, have also piloted drone delivery programs. If pilot projects by both startups and large enterprises scale as hoped, unmanned delivery craft could soon become a much more common sight in residential areas.
If they pull it off, soon there may be nothing pie in the sky about getting a drone-delivered pizza.

The Big Slowdown: M&A Involving US-based Startups Weakest Since 2013,Chris Metinko,2023/07/26,"

If you think your startup will soon get a too good to be true offer to sell, you may be in for a reality check.
It’s no secret venture has cooled considerably since late 2021, but so have possible exit opportunities for startups. While the IPO pipeline is still frozen, M&A involving U.S.-based, VC-backed companies is on pace for its slowest year since 2013, per Crunchbase data.
And it only appears to be getting worse.

Through the first two quarters of the year, only 429 U.S.-based, VC-backed startups have been scooped up in M&A deals. That puts the M&A market on its slowest pace since 2013, when only 698 deals involving startups occurred — as the world’s economy was coming out of the global financial crisis of 2008-09.


Those numbers are a far cry from the more than 1,700 deals we saw just two years ago, and even the robust 1,134 witnessed last year as the venture market slowed.
All of that isn’t to say there haven’t been any big M&A deals. In fact, so far this year we have seen five deals of more than $1 billion:

Brookfield Infrastructure Partners agreed to buy Dallas-based Compass Datacenters, a wholesale provider of dedicated data centers for businesses, for $5.5 billion last month. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year.
Savvy Gaming Group agreed to acquire Culver City, California-based gaming company Scopely for $4.9 billion in April.
Altria agreed to buy Scottsdale, Arizona-based Njoy, an e-cigarette and vaping startup, for $2.8 billion in March.
T-Mobile agreed to buy Costa Mesa, California-based Mint Mobile, a prepaid wireless brand, for $1.4 billion in March.
Databricks bought San Francisco-based language models training startup MosaicML for $1.3 billion last month (although that deal likely is worth less depending on the current valuation of Databricks).

Numbers going down
The Databricks deal sparked talk that M&A could be making a rebound, especially with AI leading the charge. While that certainly still could happen, the numbers appear to be trending in the wrong direction, according to Crunchbase numbers.
The just-completed second quarter saw only 196 deals consummated — the lowest total in years and the continuation of what appears to be a steady decline in M&A activity quarter to quarter, per Crunchbase data.


Looking for signs
However, just because that seems to be the trend doesn’t mean M&A will continue along those lines.
It made sense that dealmaking would pause or reset as interest rates kept increasing and money became more expensive. Just as consumers stop making big purchases — like homes or cars — as interest rates increase, so do corporations.
Dealmaking also started to decline last year just as many tech stocks were getting hammered in the public market and many startups held firm to ridiculously high valuations.
A drop in share prices is usually an ill-advised time for M&A, since public companies do not want to do stock deals — essentially doing a deal at a discount. Add to that the fact that cash deals are also sometimes not warmly embraced by public investors, and it’s not surprising a slowdown occurred.
However, some of that has changed.
Interest rates have held — although it does seem like a sure thing they will rise again. Also, many public tech companies’ shares have rebounded this year — making stock deals more likely.
On top of all of that is the fact a new reality does seem to be sinking in with founders. The valuations many received at the market’s high in 2021 are just not realistic anymore, and holding out for such a price is likely nothing more than a pipe dream.
As companies who raised during the heyday of the market watch their war chests start to dwindle, many startups already have raised flat rounds and even downrounds — accepting their valuations were out of whack with the real world.
That same understanding likely is or will be applied to M&A dealmaking when large tech companies or other strategics come calling. The price may not be at the elevated 2021 numbers, but may be a good alternative to a very competitive funding market and a fair price for what reality is today.

Clean-Concrete Startups Cement Their Status,Joanna Glasner,2023/07/25,"

Historically, startup founders and investors haven’t focused much on concrete.
After all, this is literally the industry that brings us the mortar in “brick and mortar.” It’s the quintessential infrastructure-heavy, capital-intensive industrial sector that startup investors like to avoid.
Nonetheless, inconvenient as it may be, we all still live in the physical world. And given the climactic upheaval humans have helped unleash on our assigned planet, we’re increasingly under pressure to do more to keep it livable.

Enter clean concrete. Over the past two years, investors have poured hundreds of millions into startups working on reducing the carbon footprint of this most ubiquitous building material. For a sense of where the money is going, we used Crunchbase data to assemble a list of 20 such companies funded in the past couple years:


A recent funding trend
The bulk of funding is comparatively recent. To date, the companies on our list have collectively raised around $436 million in equity funding — of which around 70% has come in the past two years.
The biggest round of the year, meanwhile, was just this month. CarbonCure Technologies, a Nova Scotia-based company that has developed technology for concrete producers to inject captured CO2 into fresh concrete, picked up $80 million in a growth round led by Swiss impact investor Blue Earth Capital.
CarbonCure’s marketing pitch plays up some oft-cited stats around the building industry’s carbon footprint. Currently, industry sources estimate that existing and under-construction buildings generate roughly 40% of annual global CO2 emissions. Of that, roughly a third comes from construction and building materials.
Concrete, of course, is a huge component. It’s not uncommon to see concrete referred to as the second most used substance on the planet, after water.1 More than 10 billion tons of the stuff get produced annually in what’s estimated to be a $440 billion-plus global industry.
But while concrete’s dominance in the building industry has been solid for a long time, its popularity with startup investors seems tied to the more recent rise of climate-focused investors.
The list of funding rounds this year includes some of the more prominent greentech-focused investors as lead backers, including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund and Lowercarbon Capital. It seems their portfolios can’t be complete without some clean concrete in there.

"Hey, VCs: Here Are 3 Mistakes You’re Making In Pitch Meetings With Immigrant Founders",Guest Author,2023/07/25,"

By Semyon Dukach
In the United States, roughly 80% of graduate students studying computer science and electrical engineering are international students. The skills they acquire here, however, are increasingly being taken to countries like Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom, where immigration policies aimed at recruiting talent are more appealing.
This should come as no surprise. The chances of winning the H1-B visa lottery are now just 1 in 7. Consequently, less than 25% of international students stay after earning their master’s degree.

By overlooking these would-be immigrants, the U.S. is undermining its own potential and jeopardizing its future as a global leader in innovation. I believe fellow venture capitalists are doing the same.
Based on my experience investing in immigrant founders, I’ve noticed three mistakes VCs make in pitch meetings that lead to promising founders slipping under their radar:
Not digging into founder background stories
Most founders, native- and foreign-born alike, are innovators who would focus solely on their tech if they could. While they have also learned the importance of go-to-market strategies and business models, most prefer to leave their personal stories out of it.
Semyon Dukach
When it comes to immigrant founders, however, personal stories tend to reveal the exact qualities needed to survive in times of economic uncertainty. Many have overcome economic or governmental instability, learning a new culture and language, and starting from ground zero.
With most SaaS companies taking roughly nine years to successfully exit, you need to ensure you’re investing in someone with the ability to persevere in the face of adversity, has the resilience and flexibility to pivot when necessary, and has the determination to succeed against all odds.
Learning more about a founder’s background is going to help you determine if they have what it takes to make it when times get tough.
Getting caught up in showmanship
I find that immigrant founders are often not as good at “selling themselves” as natives.
Sometimes this is cultural — there are societies in which bragging is unacceptable. Or it may be self-protection: better to under-promise and over-deliver. Whatever the cause, as a VC you may need to prompt these founders in order to hear the full scope and scale of their vision. If you’re feeling underwhelmed, ask them about their best case scenario in 10 years, or the total size of the potential market.
From my experience, immigrant founders are less likely to build marginally life-improving products like luxury brands. Instead, they build businesses that have a reason to exist in people’s lives even when budgets are tight all around.
Products that match the market climate should far outweigh idealistic promises from a showman.
Putting too much weight in Silicon Valley networks
No one has ever argued against knowing the right people, especially when fundraising. However, what immigrant founders may lack in local networks, they make up for in their ability to navigate unfamiliar systems and their communities abroad.
To succeed in a new country with a completely different society, culture and language requires a wide breadth of “soft skills” that can’t be underestimated. This kind of cultural fluency is highly advantageous when it comes to exploring different demographics for product market fit.
Now that founders need to stretch their runway further than ever, immigrant founders can easily bring down overhead costs by hiring staff in their home countries without sacrificing team cohesiveness. Shared language, culture and mission makes remote work more engaging.
More than half of the most successful startups in the U.S. were founded by immigrants, don’t let cultural differences keep you from a smart investment.

OneTrust Raises $150M As It Cuts Its Valuation,Chris Metinko,2023/07/24,"

Raising a down round in the slowing venture market became a reality for another startup Monday.
Atlanta-based OneTrust raised a $150 million round led by new investor Generation Investment Management — co-founded by former Vice President Al Gore — with participation from existing investor Sands Capital at a $4.5 billion valuation.
The valuation represents about a 12% drop from the $5.1 billion valuation the privacy and security startup garnered after it raised a Series C in late 2020 and an extension in 2021.
Founded in 2016, OneTrust says it has now raised more than $1 billion. 

New normal
OneTrust, which helps companies manage privacy, security and governance requirements in the ever-changing regulatory environment, is far from the only unicorn that has raised a down round.
Big names such as Klarna and Stripe have done similar rounds as the venture market has continued to slow since its highs of 2021.
The fact that startups have had to settle for a down round may say more about how companies were overvalued in 2021 than any declining performance by the companies themselves.
OneTrust CEO Kabir Barday told Bloomberg the company has doubled annual recurring revenue to $400 million from 2021.
The company plans to use the new funding to meet growing customer demand. OneTrust has more than 14,000 customers globally.
“We are focused on delivering strong customer experiences and will continue to evolve our platform as our customers’ needs grow,” Barday said. “This funding is a testament to our sustained growth, market leadership, and customer-centric innovation.”
OneTrust was part of a growing world of compliance regulation startups — which included TrustArc and BigID — when it was founded. At the time, hundreds of new laws and regulations — such as Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act — were being enacted and startups flocked to the sector.

Other investors in OneTrust include TCV, Insight Partners and Coatue.

"
Alarming Decline In Startup Creation Presents Challenges And Opportunities For Entrepreneurs,Guest Author,2023/07/24,"

Editor’s note: A clarification has been added to this article.

By Itay Sagie
In recent years, a concerning trend has emerged in the entrepreneurial landscape: a steep decline in the formation of new startups.

Let’s take a closer look at this phenomenon, including potential reasons for the decline and opportunities for future entrepreneurs to leverage this unique situation.
Steep decline in new startup formation
Analyzing data from Crunchbase on 27,000 software companies founded between 2020 and July 2023 in the United States, Israel and the European Union, a consistent and concerning decline in new startup formations becomes apparent.
From 2020 to 2023 (estimated), the number of new startups formed in the U.S. is on pace to decrease by approximately 86%, dropping from 6,424 to 1,046. Similarly, Israel is on track to witness a decline of around 89%, from 333 to 34 startups. In the EU, the number, as of mid-year, is on pace to decrease from 5,147 to 640 startups, reflecting a decline of about 87%.


Possible reasons for decline in startup formation
Economic downturn, political unrest and lack of early-stage capital:
The COVID outbreak in 2020 is likely to have been a cause for the decline in new startups during 2020 and 2021. The economic downturn — particularly in 2022 and 2023 — coupled with the geopolitical unrest within Ukraine involving global superpowers, together with the internal political unrest in Israel, has not helped numbers to rise.
Investors, too, have a difficult time raising new funds, and are slowing their investments.
The number of funding rounds in the U.S. decreased from 8,147 in 2022 to an estimated 6,050 in 2023, representing a decline of approximately 26%. Similarly, Israel saw a decline from 415 funding rounds in 2022 to an estimated 284 in 2023, reflecting a decline of approximately 32%. These chains of events have led to a reduced availability of capital for new startups, hindering their formation and growth.


Investors becoming more risk averse:
Itay Sagie, founder of Sagie Consulting
Looking at data between 2020 and 2021, the economy was doing better, and yet there was still a decline in new startup formation. A possible contributing factor to the decline in new startup formations is the COVID outbreak, which caused alarm and likely prompted many people to take less financial risk.
This was coupled by the shifting focus of investors, who also looked to take less risk.
While the number of funding rounds may have increased in certain years, there is evidence to suggest that investors have increasingly directed their investments toward more mature companies and growth-stage startups rather than early-stage ventures. This shift in investor focus can limit the availability of funding for new startups and make it more challenging for early-stage entrepreneurs to secure the necessary capital to launch their businesses.
Opportunities for future entrepreneurs
More market needs left unmet:
The decline in new startups presents a silver lining for aspiring entrepreneurs. By identifying and addressing unmet market needs, entrepreneurs can seize the opportunity to create innovative solutions. With fewer startups entering the market, there are untapped niches and emerging demands waiting to be met. Through thorough market research and understanding shifting preferences, entrepreneurs can establish new startups that cater to these unaddressed needs.
Bootstrapping and independence:
Entrepreneurs who are able and willing to bootstrap their ventures — relying on their own resources and revenue generation — can leverage the current downturn to their advantage. With limited access to external funding, bootstrapping allows entrepreneurs to maintain control over their businesses and build a solid foundation. By focusing on profitability and sustainable growth, these startups can position themselves for success when the market conditions improve.
Market consolidation and M&A:
There is less capital available for funding, and public markets have gone cold (with IPOs down from 1,035 in the U.S. in 2021 to around 80 so far in 2023) entrepreneurs can explore growth and liquidity opportunities through mergers and acquisitions. Market consolidation and strategic partnerships can facilitate growth even in challenging times.
Clarification: Due to lag times with new companies being added to Crunchbase, the estimated number of new startups for 2022 and 2023 is likely low and will increase over time as companies are retroactively added to the database.

The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Smile Doctors Likely Happy With $550M Raise,Chris Metinko,2023/07/21,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out The Crunchbase Megadeals Tracker.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.

Startups in a smattering of pretty diverse sectors raised good chunks of money this week. A dental startup, a reality TV personality-founded shapewear company, and an enterprise software firm led the way. Hard to find any connections there. After those really big nine-figure raises, there was a significant drop off on the list as venture continued a slow summer.
1. Smile Doctors, $550M, dental: Dental startups seem to be catching inventors’ eyes recently. Last month, Birmingham, Alabama-based HighFive Healthcare, which enables a network of dental offices to centralize their operations, closed a $100 million growth investment led by Norwest. This week, Dallas-based Smile Doctors, which has more than 400 dental locations in 28 states, announced it has raised more than $550 million. The dental group did not disclose investors, just saying the round was “funded by doctors along with several large domestic and international healthcare investors.” Founded in 2015, this is the firm’s first announced outside round, per Crunchbase.
2. Skims, $270M, clothing: Kim Kardashian’s apparel brand hit a $4 billion valuation this week after Skims raised $270 million in a funding round led by Wellington Management. It was just early last year that the underwear and shapewear brand raised $240 million in a round led by Lone Pine Capital that valued the company at $3.2 billion. The startup, which offers everything from underwear to loungewear, expects sales to grow from $500 million last year to $750 million this year. It’s also expanding into brick-and-mortar sites. Founded four years ago, the company has now raised $669 million, per Crunchbase.
3. o9 Solutions, $116M, enterprise software: Another company that locked up a nice chunk of cash in January 2022 got another shot of growth capital this week. Dallas-based o9 Solutions, which offers cloud-based solutions that help companies with planning and operations, raised a $116 million round led by General Atlantic’s BeyondNetZero fund. The new investment values o9 at $3.7 billion, up from $2.7 billion since that previous $295 million round a year-and-a-half ago. Founded in 2009, the company has raised $533 million, per Crunchbase.
4. K Health, $59M, artificial intelligence: AI often tops this list, but this week it comes in just a little bit off. New York-based K Health, whose mobile app uses AI to deliver personalized primary care, raised $59 million from the likes of Valor Equity Partners, Primary Ventures and others. The company hit unicorn status back in 2021 when it raised a $132 million Series E at a $1.4 billion valuation — however it was reported its value may have plummeted since. Founded in 2016, the company has raised more than $330 million, per Crunchbase.
5. Hammerspace, $57M, data: Data orchestration platform Hammerspace locked up a $56.7 million round this week led by Prosperity7 Ventures — its first round of institutional investment. The San Mateo, California-based startup, which launched in 2018, helps company’s make use of their unstructured data — which makes up 90% of enterprise data — which could become more important as users look for additional data to train artificial intelligence and machine-learning technologies.
6. Renibus Therapeutics, $47M, biotech: Southlake, Texas-based Renibus Therapeutics, a biopharmaceutical company focusing on the prevention and treatment of cardio-renal diseases, raised $47 million from the initial closing of a Series B. Investors were not disclosed. Founded in 2016, the company has raised nearly $190 million, per Crunchbase.
7. Preply, $42M, edtech: Brookline, Massachusetts-based language learning platform Preply closed its $120 million Series C with an additional $70 million in debt and equity led by Horizon Capital. It was reported $42 million of that capital was equity. Founded in 2012, the company has raised nearly $193 million, per Crunchbase.
8. (tied) Karat Financial, $40M, finance: Los Angeles-based Karat Financial, a financial services platform for creators, closed a $70 million round of debt and equity. The company said $40 million of the round was equity led by SignalFire. Founded in 2019, the company has raised nearly $116 million, per Crunchbase.
8. (tied) Risc Zero, $40M, blockchain: Seattle-based Risc Zero, a zero-knowledge tech developer to make blockchains more accessible, raised a $40 million Series A led by Blockchain Capital. Founded last year, the company has raised $54 million, per Crunchbase.
10. Hightouch, $38M, data: San Francisco-based customer data startup Hightouch locked up a $38 million round led by Bain Capital Ventures. Founded in 2018, the company has raised more than $92 million, per Crunchbase.
Big global deals
The big U.S. deals topped even the global deals list, however there was a noteworthy raise abroad.

South Korea-based Musinsa, a fashion e-commerce business, raised a $190 million Series C.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of July 15 to July 21. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

Unstructured Data Is A Rare Hot Area For Startup Funding,Joanna Glasner,2023/07/21,"

One tends to think of digital data as something that’s easy to contain in neat silos and access on demand.
In reality, however, the zettabytes of data that enterprises collect and store can more resemble a disorganized home. The stuff you need may be in there somewhere, but it’s often hard to find.
And the piles of clutter are only getting bigger. Data collection and storage are expected to grow at double-digit rates for the foreseeable future. In tandem, tools to help organize, navigate and access all that digital information are generating more interest as well.

Money is flowing too. Even as overall startup funding is down, we’re seeing rising investment to startups touting expertise in data automation and orchestration as well as tools to manage unstructured data.
“Something needed to be done to give you a singular global access view and control of data,” said David Flynn, CEO and founder of Hammerspace, a developer of unstructured data orchestration tools. The 5-year-old, San Mateo, California-based company picked up $56.7 million this week in its first round of institutional funding, led by Prosperity7 Ventures.
Hammerspace’s round is one of several recent, sizable financings for startups offering tools to manage our mountains of data. That was the finding from a Crunchbase analysis of funding to software companies that described their core business with the terms “unstructured data,” “data automation” and “data orchestration.”
Startups meeting this criteria that were funded in the past year have collectively raised over a billion dollars to date. For a sense of where investment is going, we put together a sample list of 15 companies funded in the past year that raised $10 million or more in their latest round:


Demand driven by rise of distributed teams and AI
Flynn sees two major shifts in workplace expectations and technology that are driving demand for stepped-up tools.
The first is the shift toward remote work and distributed teams. Today, it’s often not realistic for employers to expect their core staff to show up every day at a single physical location to collaborate on complex projects. Yet team members still need access to all the data.
“To do that, data needs to be agile,” Flynn said.
The second, and most-talked-about, shift is the rise in AI-enabled tools that can draw unprecedented insights from mounds of data. Orchestration tools come into play here because AI requires massive amounts of data, much of it of the unstructured variety.
“The fact that most data is not organized in a pre-defined manner makes it difficult for enterprises to really understand what they have, but more importantly, to find and extract the value held within their digital assets,” Flynn said. “Data orchestration gives the ability to move the data to where you’re going to need it.”
Exits ahead?
Acquirers and public markets also seem favorably disposed toward makers of tools for managing our information stores.
Most recently, Databricks, the data storage and management startup last valued at $38 billion, signed a definitive agreement three weeks ago to acquire OpenAI competitor MosaicML for $1.3 billion. MosaicML allows customers to build generative AI tools using their own proprietary data.
At Hammerspace, Flynn also has his eyes on a public offering down the road. That’s one reason he chose crossover investors for the company’s latest round, including tech investor Catherine Wood’s Ark Investment Management, as they would likely be long-term holders following an IPO.

"
Have Tech Layoffs Peaked?,Marlize van Romburgh,2023/07/21,"

When will the layoffs end? The question is top of mind for anyone who works in the tech sector, whether they’ve watched friends and co-workers lose their jobs or been handed a pink slip of their own.
The tech industry has undergone a major reset since the glory days of 2021. By our count, at least 250,000 tech workers in the U.S. alone have lost their jobs since the start of 2022 — likely many more, as we often don’t have reliable layoffs figures for smaller startups.
This year has been particularly brutal, with more than 150,000 U.S. tech workers laid off by mid-2023, per The Crunchbase Tech Layoffs Tracker. That puts us on track to more than triple the roughly 93,000 job cuts we recorded in all of 2022.
In recent weeks, we’ve also seen numerous startups shut down completely, laying off their entire staff. Other companies have become repeat offenders on our layoffs tracker.
But is the wave of layoffs slowly subsiding?
We track total reported tech job cuts, as well as the number of companies reporting layoffs, by month below.
As you can see, November and January were particularly bleak, with both total job cuts and number of rounds surging as many companies rushed to cut costs and cull their ranks around the start of the new year.


The vast majority of the November and January layoffs, however, were conducted by public companies, not startups. This year, just five public companies — Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Ericsson — have collectively sacked more than 56,000 workers. (It’s worth noting, though, that those companies ramped up hiring like crazy in 2020 and 2021. An earlier analysis we did found that Big Tech layoffs this year had clawed back only 8% of their pandemic-era growth.)
Starting in April, both recorded job cut totals and number of rounds on the Layoffs Tracker have subsided, averaging around 6,800 workers cut in 41 rounds per month since then. Compare that with the monthly averages we saw in January 2022 and March 2023: around 15,000 and 53, respectively.
Startup layoffs
Let’s focus specifically on private companies.
The layoffs peak hit later for startups than tech overall, with a high of 5,723 recorded private company job cuts in February 2023. March was bad, too, with 5,128 job cuts — just a smidge below November 2022, which was the second-worst month for U.S. startup layoffs.


The number of startups making job cuts has dropped, too. While on average, 50 private companies cut tech jobs in the U.S. each month in the first three months of the year, since April we’ve seen that half to an average of 25 rounds per month.
Does all this mean tech layoffs are now over? Probably not.
Many fledgling startups are just now truly grappling with a venture-funding downturn that has moved into the angel, seed and early stages as well. More young startups are also stuck between seed and Series A, Crunchbase data shows, and then taking longer to raise a Series B.
Companies that aren’t able to get fresh funding to sustain themselves have two options to keep going: Increase revenue — which is tough to do in a downturn — or cut costs. For almost every software company, the biggest expense, by far, is payroll.
Last week alone, we added 16 companies to our Tech Layoffs Tracker — much higher than the nine or so rounds per week we’ve been averaging this year. (But that could be at least in part because the previous week was a holiday week, when many companies likely delayed layoffs announcements.)
We could see startup layoffs rise again as more companies run out of options. Just as likely, while the brutal layoffs totals we saw in late 2022 and early 2023 might be a thing of the past, tech companies could continue to steadily shed workers in dribs and drabs for a while longer.

"
Why The Time Is Now For Ambitious Tech Founders To Break Through,Guest Author,2023/07/20,"

By Neil Patel
The current economic environment is difficult, or even insurmountable, for startups — at least that’s the prevailing narrative. While it’s true that tech founders face a tighter market and heightened scrutiny, I can’t help but see this time as an incredible opportunity for determined founders to stand out from the pack.
I’m bullish on entrepreneurs looking to drive innovation in technology and have a front seat to the creation of health care startups in my role at Redesign Health. History shows us a precedent, too: Companies like Microsoft, Airbnb and Slack all emerged victorious from the crucible of adverse market conditions.

We’re poised to see a groundswell of innovation in this downturn, but that requires a willingness to act differently than in the past.
Here are a few opportunities we’ve shared with our founders that may be helpful for others looking to seize this moment and lead the way in uncertain times.
Building strategically with a broader base of industry experts
Strategic partnerships with established players can surface early signals on product-market fit, particularly through pilot programs. This type of collaboration can complement venture capital relationships, while unlocking pools of capital that aren’t as well known as traditional VC funding.
Neil Patel of Redesign Health
These partnerships also provide proof points and references tech founders can use to help mitigate other prospective customers’ apprehensions about working with an early-stage startup.
Health care, for example, is ripe with opportunities to partner with market leaders such as regional health systems or integrated delivery networks. Experts from these organizations acutely understand systemic gaps to help focus your minimal viable product roadmap and can provide clinical guidance during product development.
They also offer a real-world testing environment for your solutions, enabling you to iterate and refine your product based on real user feedback, ultimately increasing your odds of gaining market traction.
For example, Redesign Health operates a unique model focused on 0-1 company creation in health care. When we built a women’s health startup, we joined forces with March of Dimes, an industry leader with particularly deep experience in serving women around pregnancy-related issues. March of Dimes has been an invaluable partner, providing market insights and advising on product development, as well as selecting the women’s health startup to receive the first investment from its Innovation Fund.
RIP blitz scaling. Long live accountability
Today’s market demands increased capital efficiency and traction, making execution matter more than ever. To win in this era, tech founders need a laser focus on their customer, extreme operational rigor, and burn that matches their traction.

Blitz scaling is no longer viable. Founders must slow their burn — a good thing — and align spend to performance, adopting a Main Street mentality of living within their means.
 Prioritize focused experimentation. Founders can’t afford to try dozens of things at once. This approach leads to high fragmentation, fast burn and a lack of meaningful results. Stay lean until you see what resonates.
 Lead with economic arguments. Assume your customers are reining in their spend and betting on proven solutions. Demonstrate how your work generates revenue or saves money for your partner.
Be accountable. Measure everything you can and communicate results or delays proactively, even on the smallest pilots, to your customers, investors and team. Fostering a culture of transparency and shared responsibility is always important, but especially critical in adverse market conditions.

Finally, tech founders need to clearly articulate value chains and validate product-market fit. That starts with a solid understanding of fundamentals: the problem, the solution and who pays for that solution.
This is an insight all industries should take away from the health care sector, where understanding these core fundamentals is the only way to build sustainable businesses that meet the needs of patients and partners.
Output must now be valued more than credentials
Disposition matters more than pedigree, especially for nontechnical hires. This has proven true in our experience hiring more than 40 CEOs and 100-plus founding team members for startups we’ve helped to build.
The best founding team members aren’t typically specialists, but instead “general athletes.” They share traits and soft skills that far outweigh domain expertise, seniority or tenure at a prestigious company, including:

 Resilience: We look for the ability to persevere, maintain composure, learn from failure and bounce back from adversity.  For instance, a CEO we backed when I was managing a venture fund provides a remarkable example. While still in business school, he and his friends persevered through challenges of scalability, concentrated geographic traction and limited revenue opportunity with their initial product. Eventually, however, they transformed their company from a single product into a massive company serving every national health plan and thousands of providers across the health care continuum.
 Adaptability: Strong hires are highly adaptable — able to operate in uncertainty, pivot their approaches, and tackle emerging challenges and opportunities.
Decisiveness: Effective leaders make quick, confident decisions, remaining open to feedback and changing course when needed. As an example, Redesign funded a tech-enabled service organization to address customer pain points within a large but competitive market. Research in the space showed that 80% of customer interviews indicated dissatisfaction and a desire to switch vendors, which suggested a new competitor was needed. Given the organization’s deep experience as an operator, upon joining, the CEO built a case to focus the business model away from directly competing with existing players — opting to develop a true SaaS product with limited competition, higher margins and greater ability to scale.
 Emotional intelligence: These skills are crucial for building strong relationships and managing conflict with diverse stakeholders such as employees, investors, partners and customers.

Final thoughts
With startup funding down 51% in the first half of 2023 from the previous year, market conditions are drawing a bright line between two types of startup founders: Those who dig deep to build strong partnerships, execute impeccably and embrace ambiguity are poised to win where others falter. This is a defining moment for this generation of business leaders, and how we meet it will matter for years to come.

Neil Patel is the head of new ventures at Redesign Health. He has been an operator, consultant and early-stage investor in the health care industry for nearly 20 years. He was previously the head of partner strategy and solutions for the Amazon Web Services health care business. Before that, he led a successful turnaround and sale of Healthbox, an innovation services firm.

Space Tech Funding Comes Back Down To Earth,Chris Metinko,2023/07/20,"

SpaceX recently made headlines as it became the second most valuable private company — worth a reported $150 billion — behind only TikTok parent ByteDance. But not all space tech companies have seen the valuation and fundraising success of Elon Musk‘s aviation and aerospace darling.
Funding to VC-backed space tech startups — defined here as space travel, satellite communication and aerospace — has dramatically decreased in the last year-plus, and this year is on pace for the lowest total dollars since 2020, according to Crunchbase data.

Like most sectors, space tech funding rocketed to the stars in 2021, hitting an all-time high of $12.1 billion in more than 450 deals. The sector only saw about a 25% decline last year, when space tech startups raised $9 billion in just under 400 deals.


However, this year has been a different story. With the year more than half over, the sector has witnessed only $2.4 billion of funding in just 172 deals.
Big round slowdown
One of the main reasons funding has declined is the disappearance of the huge rounds the sector has become so associated with thanks to the likes of SpaceX and Relativity Space.
In 2021, space tech startups received 14 rounds of a quarter-billion dollars or more, including Louisville, Colorado-based Sierra Space raising a $1.4 billion round and SpaceX locking up an $850 million round.
Last year, the number of those types of rounds dropped to only five, but did include a $1.7 billion raise by SpaceX and Costa Mesa, California-based defense firm Anduril closing a $1.5 billion Series E that valued the company at $8.5 billion.
This year, however, no space startup has come that close to such a round. Some of the biggest rounds this year include:

In March, Germany-based Isar Aerospace, which helps launch small and medium satellites, raised a Series C of just more than $174 million.
In early April, San Francisco-based satellite developer Astranis locked up a $200 million round at a $1.6 billion valuation, per a Bloomberg report. The new deal was led by Andreessen Horowitz and came just before the company launched its first satellite aboard the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.
In late April, Berthoud, Colorado-based Ursa Major closed on a $100 million investment. BlackRock and Space Capital took part in the funding. The company is developing the next generation of rocket engines with substantially more power. According to a report, Ursa Major was looking to secure the funding at a $400 million pre-money valuation.

Falling star?
Of course, big rounds are down in mostly all sectors as VCs and growth firms have pulled back significantly in funding such rounds at big valuations.
The numbers do not mean the “Space 2.0” era — the current wave of investment that came after the initial excitement of firms like SpaceX and Rocket Lab being founded — is over.
Space tech — like other deep sectors — typically sees the most dramatic pullback from investors in a slowing market as they look for more “sure” bets with a much shorter time horizon to liquidity.
The near collapse of the SPAC market also likely has caused investor anxiety, as one avenue for potential exits has been severely limited. It was just a couple of years ago when startups including Google-backed Planet Labs and Spire Global were able to access the public market through such vehicles, but the poor performance of SPACs in general has made that a less than likely option for many companies.
However, there is no denying the interest in new launch and propulsion technologies, as well as other opportunities space may hold — think manufacturing or mining. Such markets and the possible return on investment from such space opportunities are likely too much for VCs to resist.
While the days of spending like in 2021 may be gone, it is unlikely investors are going to stop looking to go where no man (or woman) has gone before.

"Media Startups Draw Less Backing, But AI Is A Bright Spot",Joanna Glasner,2023/07/19,"

Hollywood actors and screenwriters are on strike. Ad revenues are down. Movie ticket sales lag pre-pandemic levels. Fewer households are paying for cable TV.
All told, the media industry is in a very public state of turmoil lately. An unusually broad collection of players in the space — from artists to studios to distributors — are all seeing income slide.
Media-focused startup investors, meanwhile, are largely sitting out the tumult. 
Per Crunchbase data, venture investment in U.S. media-related startups is on track to hit the lowest level in years. Fewer rounds are getting done too, as illustrated in the chart below:


AI is a hot spot
To the extent they are making bets in media, startup investors are often wagering that artificial intelligence will play a growing role in producing content. Case in point: The largest U.S. media round so far this year was a $141 million June Series C for Runway, a developer of AI-enabled tools for video creation. 
Runway’s motto is: “No lights. No camera. All action.” It helped develop the AI image generator Stable Diffusion, and launched its video-to-video generative AI app in April. The app lets users transform videos into different styles, such as claymation or watercolors. 

On the early-stage front, New York-based Captions, a 2-year-old startup that bills itself as an “AI-powered creative studio,” picked up $25 million in a June Series B round led by Kleiner Perkins. And Brooklyn-based ElevenLabs, a 1-year-old developer of an AI voice generator for content creators, landed $19 million in a Series A financing.
The ability of AI to further disrupt media business models is not exactly news to Hollywood. The potential for generative AI in scriptwriting and image creation are well documented. Both striking actors and writers, meanwhile, are demanding contracts that contain specific AI regulations to protect writers and the works they create.
Tough sector
While industry business models are in flux, media isn’t facing a demand problem. Consumers continue to consume vast quantities of digital content.
Increasingly, however, that consumption has shifted online and to social media. Today, there are an estimated 5.16 billion internet users globally. They average over six and half hours a day online, per research firm Meltwater, and spend more time on social media than they do watching broadcast and cable TV.
As media consumption splinters into more channels, the big-budget studio production model faces more challenges. Everyone wants to attract eyeballs without spending a fortune to produce content.
That might explain why beyond AI, one of the largest media-focused startup rounds went to Atmosphere, a streaming TV platform for businesses that serve the public. The company, which offers streams around cute animals, sports clips and funny home videos, among other themes, picked up $65 million in Series D funding early this year and recently crossed the $1 billion valuation mark. 
The financing drives home the reality that, despite all the difficulties producers and distributors of screen-based content are facing, there is one area of apparent insuppressable growth: the number of available screens blasting videos.

Latin America’s Startup Funding Continued To Fall Sharply In First Half Of 2023,Joanna Glasner,2023/07/19,"

Funding to Latin America startups continued to slow this year, as a peak-era investment surge looks increasingly short-lived.
In the first half of 2023, investors put $1.1 billion to work in reported seed- through late-stage financings in Central and South America, according to Crunchbase data. That’s down a staggering 83% from the same period last year.


Investors also participated in fewer rounds. Per Crunchbase data, investors backed 333 reported financings in the first half of this year, down 56% from a year ago. For perspective, we chart out round count totals for the past 10 quarters below:


Late stage falters, early stage holds up better
A massive drop in late-stage financing explains most of the decline in investment totals.
While mega-sized rounds proliferated in 2021 and into 2022, those deals aren’t happening now. Per Crunchbase data, the largest later-stage financing in the first half of 2023 was a $25 million Series C for The Green Coffee Company, a coffee farming company with operations based in Colombia.
Early- and seed-stage dealmaking has held up a bit better, with several good-sized rounds getting done this year. Top funding recipients include Brazil-based digital integration platform Digibee ($62 million Series B), business credit and expense-tracking provider Clara ($60 million Series B), and Chilean mining technology startup Ceibo ($30 million Series B).
The most active peak-era investors in the region, meanwhile, are considerably less visible. Back in 2021, the five most active investors in Latin America collectively backed 149 rounds. In the first half of this year, those same firms have invested in just 11 financings.
Down from a high peak
The latest tallies represent a particularly sharp contraction, considering that Latin America ranked as the fastest-growing region in the world for venture funding in 2021. During that year, investors poured more than $19 billion into the region, scaling a new generation of Latin American unicorns.
The flush funding environment included mega-sized rounds that dwarfed prior fundraisings. In 2021 alone, three top fundraisers — online business tools provider Nuvemshop, fast-delivery service Rappi, and real estate marketplace Loft — collectively pulled in more than $1.6 billion in later-stage financing.
The exit environment was also looking good. Nubank, the Brazil-based online challenger bank, carried out its public offering in December 2021, with a valuation over $40 billion. (It was recently valued around $38 billion.)
Will that kind of enthusiasm return again? Probably not for a while. Nonetheless, there’s certainly room for growth from recent investment levels, especially as the exit environment starts to thaw. We’ll get a better sense of whether that comes to pass in our next quarterly data crunch.
Methodology
The data contained in this report comes directly from Crunchbase, and is based on reported data. Data reported is as of July 3, 2023.
Note that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarter/year.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.
Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.
Glossary of funding terms
We have made a change to how we include corporate funding rounds in our reporting as of January 2023. Corporate rounds are only included if a company has raised an equity funding at seed through a venture series funding round.
Seed and angel consists of seed, pre-seed and angel rounds. Crunchbase also includes venture rounds of unknown series, equity crowdfunding and convertible notes at $3 million (USD or as-converted USD equivalent) or less.
Early stage consists of Series A and Series B rounds, as well as other round types. Crunchbase includes venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $3 million, and those less than or equal to $15 million.
Late stage consists of Series C, Series D, Series E and later-lettered venture rounds following the “Series [Letter]” naming convention. Also included are venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $15 million.
Technology growth is a private-equity round raised by a company that has previously raised a “venture” round. (So basically, any round from the previously defined stages.)

Web3 Funding Plummets As AI Steals The Show,Chris Metinko,2023/07/18,"

Editor’s note: For more Web3 coverage, visit Crunchbase’s Web3 Tracker, where we track startups, investors and funding news in the Web3, cryptocurrency and blockchain space, powered by Crunchbase’s live, comprehensive data.
Venture funding to Web3 startups in the second quarter plummeted 76% from last year, as big funding deals slowed to a crawl, Crunchbase data shows.
While seemingly all sectors are seeing a slowdown in venture capital, Web3 — defined here as cryptocurrency and blockchain startups — has been hit hardest as investors retreat to both AI and more traditional sectors.

In the second quarter this year, Web3 startups raised just over $1.8 billion in 322 deals, according to Crunchbase data.


Those numbers reflect a more than three-quarter decline in funding from Q2 last year, which saw startups in the sector raise more than $7.5 billion. They also represent a 51% drop in deal flow.
Web3 dollars dip
The numbers look a little worse when just examining the first halves of the year. In H1 last year, Web3 startups raised nearly $16 billion. In H1 this year, it was just $3.6 billion — a massive 78% drop.
In fact, deal flow hit its slowest pace since the final quarter of 2020, when only 291 deals were announced for a total of $1.1 billion.
Large rounds definitely played a role in the dramatic year-to-year drop Web3 funding witnessed.
In Q2 last year, startups raised 15 rounds of more than $100 million. The just-completed quarter saw only three rounds:

Last month, Switzerland-based Islamic Coin, a Shariah-compliant crypto asset, raised  $200 million from ABO Digital.
In April, Vancouver-based messaging protocol LayerZero Labs closed a $120 million Series B funding round from 33 investors, including a16z crypto and Sequoia Capital, valuing the company at $3 billion.
In May, Worldcoin developer Tools For Humanity — co-founded by OpenAI’s Sam Altman — raised a $115 million Series C led by Blockchain Capital. The funding also included a16z crypto, Bain Capital Crypto and Distributed Global.

Bottoming out?
If VCs and startups are looking for any silver linings, it may be that after several quarters of significant decline, funding to Web3 startups actually remained relatively steady quarter to quarter, with Q1 of this year seeing startups raise slightly less than $1.8 billion.
Perhaps we’ve found the bottom of the market for investor interest in Web3?
However, the number of deals fell 23% from the first quarter when more than 400 deals were announced.
It is also interesting to note that while VC investing has crashed in the market, crypto prices have spiked. Bitcoin, the largest crypto currency, is up more than 80% this calendar year. The second largest, Ether, is up more than 50%.
Each saw nice spikes last month after both Fidelity Investments and BlackRock filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to offer the first U.S. exchange-traded fund investing directly in Bitcoin.
It was reminiscent of late 2020 and early 2021 when other large, traditional financial institutions started showing interest in the space and Coinbase went public — events that seemed to validate the space and helped spark the first rush of funding into the sector.
What’s next for Web3?
Will that happen again?
That’s anyone’s guess, but this market is very different from 2021, when seemingly everyone in the startup world was flush with cash.
Now investors seem very wary of putting money into anything — except, of course, AI — and have retreated to more mature sectors — again, except for AI.
Investors are still putting small amounts of money into more of the picks-and-shovels startups to build out Web3 — like Santa Clara, California-based Auradine and New York-based Axoni — which could be a harbinger to better funding days for the space if it is built out properly.
However, there is no denying the massive collapses of large crypto exchanges — we all know the names — and recent regulatory actions in the U.S. likely have shaken some investors from looking into the digital asset space.
Will those investors come back, or will current investors invite more?
The numbers certainly aren’t trending that way.
Methodology
For Web3 funding numbers we analyze investments made into VC-backed startups in both cryptocurrency and blockchain.

Herself Health Lands $26M As Femtech Startup Funding Holds Steady,Marlize van Romburgh,2023/07/17,"

Herself Health, a startup that offers primary care for women aged 65 and older, said Monday that it has raised a $26 million Series A funding round. Its funding comes as venture funding to startups focused on women’s health issues has held up relatively well despite a broad venture funding pullback.
The company operates only one physical clinic — in St. Paul, Minnesota — but said with the new funding it plans to grow its footprint significantly over the next 18 months, including opening another two locations in the Twin Cities area this year. It will also expand its virtual care offerings, it said. 

Herself says its approach differs from generic primary care because it focuses on holistic aspects of an older woman’s health and well-being, including mental health, mobility, and social and behavioral health. It also focuses on specific health issues that are more prevalent in older women, including Alzheimer’s, osteoporosis and arthritis.
“Women 65+ face unique health and social challenges as they age, and for far too long, their concerns, needs, and desires have been ignored,” Herself Health CEO Kristen Helton said in a statement. “That’s why we are designing Herself Health to be the value-based solution to improve outcomes and help women find joy, purpose and better quality of life.”
Michael Cline of Accretive served as the lead investor for the Series A, which comes six months after Herself raised its $7 million seed round. Juxtapose also participated in the Series A.
Herself’s raise comes as funding to femtech startups — broadly defined as companies focused specifically on women’s health issues — has remained relatively robust amid a general venture funding downturn. Femtech-related startups last year raised more than $1.2 billion, Crunchbase data shows. That follows record-setting funding of more than $1.8 billion in 2020 and $1.7 billion in 2021.

Character.AI Looking For Fresh Capital — Report,Chris Metinko,2023/07/17,"

Just four months after closing a $150 million Series A at a $1 billion valuation led by Andreessen Horowitz, Character.AI may be looking for even more cash.
The Palo Alto, California-based AI startup, which allows people to create their own personalized AI chatbots, is in talks with investors about raising an additional round of funding, per a report in The Information. The new capital would be used to support demand for its chatbots, said the report. No amount was cited.

Investor appetite in AI has been off the charts since late last year, as the list of generative AI companies continues to grow. Character.AI is one of several companies including OpenAI, Anthropic and Adept AI that have raised huge rounds this year.

Makeup Unicorn Oddity’s IPO Comes As Beauty Funding Falters,Joanna Glasner,2023/07/17,"

Beauty is a pretty unattractive area for startup investors lately. So far this year, just over $300 million in venture funding went to the category, down more than 50% from the same period last year. That puts 2023 on track to deliver the lowest annual tally for beauty-related funding in years.
But over in IPO-land, a different story is playing out. Later this month, Oddity Tech, an Israel-based direct-to-consumer cosmetics and self-care products provider, is set to go public in a Nasdaq offering that sets a target valuation around $1.9 billion.
To reach that goal, it helps that Oddity’s financials, unlike most startups, are easy on the eye. The company is actually profitable, projecting net income of more than $40 million in the first half of this year. Revenue is also growing fast, surging 46% in 2022 to top $320 million.

Most sales come from Oddity’s flagship makeup brand, IL MAKIAGE. Products are sold direct-to-consumer through an online store featuring a mix of influencer videos and quizzes to match users with items such as foundation and mascara that suit their tastes and complexions. Last year, the company also launched a wellness brand, SpoiledChild, offering skincare, haircare and probiotics.
Beauty tech
Oddity likes to brag about its tech-driven approach to the beauty business. In its IPO prospectus, the company repeatedly points out that its tech team is the largest group and comprises over 40% of its headcount. It cites data science, machine learning and computer vision as areas of heavy investment.
Truth be told, I wasn’t personally enthralled by the results of its quiz-driven makeup selection process. (It recommended eyebrow mascara, a product I neither need nor want.) That said, it does seem to have struck a chord with a broad swathe of the cosmetics-buying public. And although people still buy the majority of cosmetics and care products at brick-and-mortar stores, Oddity makes a compelling case that we’ll see more consumption shift online.
The company also has raised significant venture backing, closing a $130 million financing in January 2022. Its prospectus lists consumer-focused investor L Catterton as its largest venture shareholder, with 42% of Class A shares.
So far, Oddity’s success hasn’t driven investors to seek out online makeup and self-care startups in a big way. But some deals are happening. This year, the largest makeup-related round by far was a $40 million Series B for Makeup By Mario, an online beauty store founded by celebrity makeup artist Mario Dedivanovic. Debut, a San Diego startup that applies biotech to beauty product development, also raised a good-sized round of $34 million in its June Series B.
Overall, however, beauty-related investment has been trending lower. To illustrate, we used Crunchbase data below to tally global seed- through late-stage financing in the beauty category from 2018 to today:


If Oddity has a blowout public offering, perhaps that will convince investors to direct more attention and funding to the beauty space. For now, however, startup founders may have an easier time persuading potential customers of the potential rewards of putting money into looking their best.

The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Biotech Dominates As Septerna Raises $150M,Chris Metinko,2023/07/14,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out The Crunchbase Megadeals Tracker.
Investors turned their attention to biotech and health, as more than half the big rounds this week fell into that bucket. Biotech was the big winner, getting three rounds in the top five and four all told on the list. In general, it was a pretty slow week, but that is not out of the ordinary for this time of year.
1) Septerna, $150M, biotech: Biotech leads off this week, as South San Francisco, California-based Septerna closed a $150 million Series B led by new investor RA Capital Management. Septerna focuses on small molecule drugs that target proteins called G protein-coupled receptors, which control signals across cellular membranes and are often targeted by drug developers. Septerna is one of them, and is developing a treatment for hypoparathyroidism, a condition characterized by the deficiency of parathyroid hormone — which controls blood calcium and phosphate levels. Founded just last year, the company has now raised $250 million, per Crunchbase.

2) Hyperice, $100M-plus, health: Back in 2020, wellness brand Hyperice raised a $48 million Series A from noted athletes such as NBA stars Chris Paul and Anthony Davis, which puts the firm at a $700 million valuation. Since then, the Irvine, California-based company — which sells a variety of devices to help people move and recover better — has been a little quiet on the fundraising front. However, this week it locked up a $100 million-plus investment from private equity firm Atlas Credit Partners. No new valuation was given. Hyperice said it will use the cash to grow after introducing five new products in the last year. The firm has raised nearly $148 million, per Crunchbase.
3) SpyGlass Pharma, $90M, biotech: More biotech, as Aliso Viejo, California-based SpyGlass Pharma locked up a $90 million Series C led by RA Capital Management. The ophthalmic therapeutics company has developed a system that helps deliver medical therapy to address glaucoma management as well as other chronic ophthalmic diseases when implanted at the time of cataract surgery. Founded in 2019, the firm has raised nearly $110 million, according to Crunchbase data.
4) Avnos, $80M, environmental engineering: Carbon storage and removal is big business and popular in venture right now. Los Angeles-based Avnos became one of the latest in the space to raise big cash, signing “multi-year strategic and investment partnerships” worth more than $80 million with ConocoPhillips, JetBlue Ventures and Shell Ventures. The company has developed a “hybrid direct air capture” unit for carbon dioxide removal. Avnos expects to deliver commercial-ready HDAC units by the end of 2025. This is the first disclosed round, per Crunchbase, for the company founded in 2021.
4) Crossbow Therapeutics, $80M, biotech: Are you getting the idea it was a big week for biotech and health? Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Crossbow Therapeutics joined the hit parade after raising an $80 million Series A funding round led by MPM BioImpact and Pfizer Ventures. The company is developing antibody therapies to treat a broad range of cancers. Founded in 2021, this is the company’s first announced funding, per Crunchbase.
5) Arthrosi Therapeutics, $75M, biotech: San Diego-based Arthrosi Therapeutics, a clinical-stage biotechnology company, closed a $75 million Series D led by Guangrun Health Industry. Founded in 2020, the company has raised more than $117 million, per Crunchbase.
6) Bobbie, $70M, food: San Francisco-based Bobbie, an organic infant formula company, raised a $70 million Series C led by PowerPlant Partners to acquire Nature’s One, a pediatric nutrition company. Founded in 2018, the company has raised nearly $92 million, according to Crunchbase.
7) HawkEye 360, $58M, aerospace: Herndon, Virginia-based HawkEye 360, a defense company for space-based radio frequency data and analytics, closed a $58 million Series D-1 led by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock. Founded in 2015, the company has raised more than $362 million, per Crunchbase.
8) Collective, $50M, fintech: San Francisco-based Collective, which offers an online back-office platform for self-employed business owners, locked up a $50 million round  from a syndicate of investors including General Catalyst, QED and others. Founded in 2020, the company has raised nearly $79 million, per Crunchbase.
9) CurvaFix, $39M, medical devices: Bellevue, Washington-based CurvaFix, a developer of medical devices to repair fractures, closed a $39 million financing led by MVM Partners. Founded in 2013, the company has raised $60 million, per Crunchbase.
Big global deals
Septerna’s round was big, but it was basically matched — depending on the exchange rate — by an Australian startup.

Sydney-based Wollemi, a global climate specialist investment firm, raised a Series A worth approximately $150 million.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of July 8 to July 14. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

Big Bucks For Obesity Treatments As Eli Lilly Buys Versanis Bio For Up To $1.9B,Joanna Glasner,2023/07/14,"

Pharma giant Eli Lilly announced today that it is buying Versanis Bio, a startup developing drugs with applications in obesity treatment, in a transaction valued at up to $1.93 billion.
Lilly did not specify how much of the purchase will be upfront and how much will be contingent on Versanis meeting future milestones tied to clinical progress and sales. Given that Versanis is still an early-stage company, it’s likely most of the payment will be tied to meeting milestones.

Still, it’s a big number, especially considering that Oakland-based Versanis was only founded in 2021. That year, the company raised its only known venture round, a $70 million Series A led  by Atlas Venture and Medicxi.
Notably, Versanis is one of a number of recently funded startups working on treatments for obesity and to promote weight loss. Using Crunchbase data, we curated a list of nine companies that last raised capital in the past year:

"
Exploring The Signs Of Recovery: A Closer Look at Tech M&A And Revenue Multipliers,Guest Author,2023/07/14,"

By Itay Sagie
Reflecting on an article I penned in December 2021, titled “Tech Revenue Multipliers Are Soaring. Should We Be Worried?” it’s interesting to observe the evolution of the tech funding landscape since then.

Itay Sagie, founder of Sagie Consulting
At that time, we witnessed an alarming surge in revenue multipliers, with a median of 34 and an average of 72. However, the tides have turned, and a different narrative is emerging. The global economic downturn — combined with high interest rates, growing inflation and geopolitical unrest — has caused a drastic decline in revenue multipliers within the software sector.
In an effort to shed light on this shift, I conducted an analysis of 5,413 software-related M&A deals, published on Crunchbase, that transpired between Q3 2021 and Q2 2023 in the U.S., EU and Israel.
Tech revenue multipliers trend down
I calculated the revenue multipliers over the past eight quarters, leveraging Crunchbase data and examining disclosed M&A prices and revenue, which is available only for a portion of the deals.
The results reveal a decline, with revenue multipliers eventually stabilizing around 5x. It is noticeable that revenue multipliers in Israel tend to be higher than other regions, as it is an attractive destination for global investors seeking innovative deep tech companies.


Moreover, the data showcases a noteworthy decrease in the number of M&A deals. When comparing Q2 2023 to Q3 2021, we observe a significant 41% reduction in M&A activity during this period.
However, it is important to note that the median M&A deal size, particularly the reported deal sizes, remained relatively unchanged, hovering around $70 million.
Nonetheless, it’s worth mentioning that the percentage of deals with disclosed prices dropped from 16% to 8% over the same period. Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that the valuations of deals with undisclosed prices fell below the average.


US and Israeli M&A deals outpace European deal sizes
When breaking down deal sizes by region, a noticeable disparity emerges. The median deal size in the U.S. stands at $175 million, in Israel it’s $93 million, and in Europe it hovers around $38 million.


Europe gains ground in sell-side M&A
The decline in M&A deals is particularly felt in the U.S., as its share dropped from 63% to 54% of all deals. In contrast, Europe experienced an increase in its share, rising from 36% to 45% of all M&A deals.
Meanwhile, Israel’s share remained steady at approximately 2% of total deals.


Prospects for the future
Despite the challenging times faced by the tech industry, there are signs of economic growth in the U.S., exemplified by the 16% growth of the S&P 500 over the past six months.
Companies that prioritize execution, and strike a balance between growth and profitability — with an emphasis on the latter — are poised to weather this storm successfully.
Consolidation via M&A is also inevitable in an environment where private capital is tight and public market access is limited, hence we can expect a rise in tech M&A deals.

Affect Raises $16M As Addiction-Related Financings Hold Strong,Joanna Glasner,2023/07/13,"

Affect Therapeutics, a provider of all-digital addiction treatment programs, raised $16 million in a Series A round led by Artis Ventures. Founded in 2020, the McLean, Virginia-based company offers treatments for substance use disorders, including alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine and prescription stimulants.
The investment is one of several recent financings of startups focused on addiction treatment. Using Crunchbase data, we curated a list of eight companies funded in the past year with an eye toward treating addiction or alleviating withdrawal symptoms for substance abuse recovery:

Asia Startup Funding In First Half Of 2023 Falls 50% As Late Stage Continues Decline,Chris Metinko,2023/07/13,"

Funding to startups in Asia in the first half of 2023 dropped 50% from the previous year — spurred on by fewer large, late rounds, and mirroring the global venture market.
Funding in the region dropped from more than $73 billion in the first half of 2022 to only $36.3 billion for H1 this year, Crunchbase data shows. Deal volume also slowed, dropping 40% from 5,402 deals in H1 2022 to only 3,237 for this year’s first half.

For the second quarter, funding in the region dropped 44% from the same quarter last year — from $32.8 billion to $18.5 billion.


Deal flow dropped a similar amount year to year, falling from 2,508 to 1,564 — a 38% decline, according to Crunchbase data.


However, the second quarter actually realized a slight uptick from Q1 in terms of dollars. The second-quarter dollar figure was actually a 4% increase from Q1.
Dealmaking, however, dropped 7% from the 1,673 deals announced in Q1.
Late stage and growth continue to decline
Not surprisingly, late- and growth-stage funding were the main culprits for the overall decline in venture dollars.
Late stage and growth funding dropped from $18.4 billion in 246 deals in Q2 last year to only $10.2 billion in 144 deals for Q2 this year — a 45% decline in dollars and a 41% drop in volume.


The decline is even worse when looking at the entire first half of the year. The first six months this year saw late and growth rounds totaling $19 billion, an astounding 53% drop from the $40.8 billion raised in the same half last year.
The decline in the late stage is significant — especially in terms of dollars — since such growth rounds are the most valuable.
The second quarter’s dollar figures were actually an increase from the previous quarter, which saw only $8.8 billion in such late rounds.
Despite the drop-off year to year, the region did see some impressive rounds in the quarter, including:

In May, China-based Shein, the popular fast-fashion startup, reportedly raised $2 billion. (Still, the $66 billion reported valuation was only two-thirds of its previous valuation.)
Last month, India-based renewable energy firm Avaada Energy locked up a $1.3 billion funding round.
In April, Seoul-based autonomous mobility firm 42dot raised a corporate round worth approximately $787 million.

Nevertheless, not even those large raises could raise the funding tide.
Early-stage struggles
For the sixth straight quarter, early-stage funding also dropped.
Startups in Asia raised only $6.8 billion in 529 early-stage deals in Q2, per Crunchbase. That was a decline of 8% from last quarter’s $7.3 billion, and a whopping 42% from Q2 2022 which saw $11.7 billion raised in similar rounds.


However, deal volume only dropped 4% from last quarter, but 35% from 2Q 2022, which saw more than 800 early-stage rounds announced.
Seeds fail to sprout
Angel and seed deal dollars also hit their lowest point since early 2021.
In the second quarter, such rounds totaled only $1.5 billion, down from $1.6 billion in the first quarter, and down $2.7 billion from Q2 2022 — a fall of 42%.


While seed rounds don’t really change the total dollar numbers for overall funding, they do affect volume. In this case, deal counts barely dropped quarter to quarter, with 891 angel/seed rounds announced in Q2 compared to 964 in Q1.
However, deal volume was down 38% from the same quarter last year, which saw 1,445 such deals announced.
What it means
The good news is startup funding in Asia was up in Q2 compared to the first quarter of the year, and the percentage drop in funding is starting to decrease in the region. But that is mainly because the free-spending times of 2021 are sliding further back in the rearview mirror.
However, the continuous drop is still concerning, as numbers are off even 2020’s pace.
Of course, the ever-increasing tensions between the U.S. and China likely are not helping funding activity. Those tensions seem to have led to VC giant Sequoia Capital to break into three distinct businesses — Sequoia Capital, China-based HongShan, and India and Southeast Asia firm Peak XV Partners — as U.S. investment in tech in China is getting trickier as pressure between the two superpowers rises.
It will be interesting to see if that breakup further disrupts venture investing in the region, or if the new, separate entities can attract the same wealthy limited partners the Sequoia name has made a habit of doing.
One thing to continue to pay attention to is China’s IPO market. With Alibaba’s plan to split up and likely public float its units, there has been a renewed hope that Ant Group could see its indefinitely suspended IPO restarted.
Three years ago, the fintech giant’s $34 billion-plus IPO was scuttled by increased regulatory overview of tech companies by the Chinese government.
Such a move could be a boon for the tech sector, and that type of exit could get investors salivating.
However, there are certainly strong headwinds right now in the Asia funding market and navigating through them may only get more difficult.
Methodology
The data contained in this report comes directly from Crunchbase, and is based on reported data. Data reported is as of July 3, 2023.
Note that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarter/year.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.
Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.
Glossary of funding terms
We have made a change to how we include corporate funding rounds in our reporting as of January 2023. Corporate rounds are only included if a company has raised an equity funding at seed through a venture series funding round.
Seed and angel consists of seed, pre-seed and angel rounds. Crunchbase also includes venture rounds of unknown series, equity crowdfunding and convertible notes at $3 million (USD or as-converted USD equivalent) or less.
Early stage consists of Series A and Series B rounds, as well as other round types. Crunchbase includes venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $3 million, and those less than or equal to $15 million.
Late stage consists of Series C, Series D, Series E and later-lettered venture rounds following the “Series [Letter]” naming convention. Also included are venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $15 million.
Technology growth is a private-equity round raised by a company that has previously raised a “venture” round. (So basically, any round from the previously defined stages.)

"
Carbon Capture And Storage Is A Bustling Sector For Startup Funding,Joanna Glasner,2023/07/13,"

While most startup sectors have seen diminished funding in recent quarters, carbon capture- and storage-focused companies look like a notable exception.
This past year, over half a billion dollars has gone to dozens of upstarts working on technologies to reduce industrial carbon emissions, store captured CO2, and navigate the complex landscape of carbon credits. It’s a global cohort, with financings in six continents spanning from São Paulo to Stockholm.
The past few weeks have been particularly busy. On Tuesday, CarbonCure Technologies, a Nova Scotia-based carbon removal startup focused on the concrete industry, announced it raised $80 million.
A few weeks before that, Charm Industrial, a San Francisco startup that uses plant matter and bio-oil to sequester carbon, picked up $100 million in Series B funding. On the software side, meanwhile, Supercritical, a London-based operator of a carbon removal offsets marketplace, landed $13 million in a June Series A.

For a broader picture of where investment is going, we used Crunchbase data to curate a list of 43 companies with business models tied to carbon removal, capture and storage that last secured funding in the past year:


Evidently, there’s plentiful capital to go around for companies innovating around infrastructure, software and materials with an eye to capturing and storing more atmospheric carbon and industrial waste. To date, companies on this list alone have raised over $1.25 billion in equity funding.
Unfortunately, there’s also more carbon dioxide floating around than ever.
This spring, measured CO2 levels climbed further into territory not seen for millions of years, according to a June report from scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Scripps Institution of Oceanography. CO2 levels are now more than 50% higher than they were before the onset of the industrial era.
Top themes: platforms, greener products and capture technology
Of course, no one’s expecting a handful of funded startups to take us back to pre-industrial carbon levels. In terms of making a contribution, however, they have some ambitious agendas.
Visions for doing so vary widely, but broadly we see companies on the list fall into a handful of categories:
First, there are those innovating on the software and platform side with marketplaces for carbon credits and measuring tools for enterprises. This includes San Francisco-based Patch Technologies, which has raised more than $80 million and is working on an API for carbon removal.
Others include New York-based Carbon Direct, which develops tools for carbon management, and London’s Supercritical, with the goal of helping businesses tackle the climate crisis and reach carbon net zero.
The production of industrial materials — and cement in particular — is a major contributor to CO2 emissions, and startups have taken notice. Svante, a Canadian company that makes filters and machines that capture and remove CO2 from industrial emissions, has raised over $470 million to date — more than any other company on the list.
CarbonCure, meanwhile, is initially focused on concrete, while Plantd, a North Carolina company that raised its Series A this year, is working on carbon-negative building materials made from grasses.
Others are working on technologies and business models aimed at reducing atmospheric carbon. Among the most ambitious of this group is Captura, which is developing a system for capturing carbon dioxide from ocean water at scale. Straddling both the carbon removal and offsets management is Sao Paulo-based Mombak, a carbon removal company that focuses on the reforestation of the Amazon.
Still a pretty early-stage crowd
Companies on our list are predominantly early and seed stage, which indicates there’s room for bigger rounds ahead should late-stage investors decide to pull out their checkbooks.
With a few well-funded exceptions, most of the companies on the list are also fairly new. More than two-thirds were founded in the past four years, per Crunchbase data. That means we’re also still in the very early stages of seeing how business plans play out at scale.

"5 Interesting Startup Deals You May Have Missed In June: Surgery With AR, And Owning (Part Of) A Racehorse",Chris Metinko,2023/07/12,"

This is a monthly column that runs down five interesting deals every month that may have flown under the radar. Check out last month’s entry here.
Summer is here and funding is slow.
However, between the slowing pace of funding and summer vacations, you may have missed some interesting rounds last month. Let’s recap a few that caught our eye.
AR-assisted surgery
If you’ve ever gone under the knife, you know you always want to make sure your surgeon has every advantage possible.
Augmedics, an AR (augmented reality) surgical navigation startup, agrees. The Chicago-based company locked up a $82.5 million Series D led by CPMG last month. The news came in the same week the company marked its 4,000th U.S. patient treated with its “xvision Spine System.”
The patented tech uses augmented reality to give surgeons a type of “x-ray vision” during surgery. The technology superimposes data onto the surgical field, allowing surgeons to visualize patient anatomy through skin and tissue and navigate instruments and implants during spine surgery.
Apparently there is more to AR than just playing Beat Saber.

Head to the winner’s circle
Ever want to own a racehorse?
Sure you have. Now startup Experiential Squared is making that a real possibility — kind of.
The startup is the parent company of the racehorse ownership platform, MyRacehorse, and closed a $7 million funding round led by 1/ST.
Using the MyRacehorse app, anyone can review and purchase a fractional share in a racehorse for a one-time payment of as low as $100. Through the app, the partial owner can follow updates from the trainer, jockey and analysts, while also receiving direct and instant payouts of prize money.
The platform currently has more than 50,000 active owners and 100 active horses — with earnings in excess of $20 million.
You may not win the Triple Crown with your horse, but it’s likely as close as many of us will get to being a player in The Sport of Kings.
Space retrieval
We cover space-related startups a lot in this column, especially as space becomes a part of more companies’ businesses.
Space has provided a new frontier in research in life sciences — including for monoclonal antibodies, stem cells and protein crystallization. While launching gets cheaper and easier by the day as more and more companies offer the service, returning the research to Earth remains tricky.
Germany-based Atmos Space Cargo closed a seed round of about $4.3 million from the likes of High-Tech Gründerfonds and the Amadeus Apex Technology Fund.
Atmos develops space capsules capable of safely returning any cargo from space. The company creates its own specially designed capsules viable for what the startup believes to be a wide-range of applications — including biomedical and material sciences research — and even one-day manufacturing of products in space.
The company is on track to embark on its first demonstration mission at the end of next year.
More bees
Bees are another thing we cover a lot here.
However, Los Angeles-based Beekeeper’s Naturals is a little different. The health and wellness startup locked up a $14 million round last month co-led by Devonshire Investors and Cavu Consumer Partners.
Beekeeper’s Naturals creates products based on propolis — a resin-like material made by bees from the buds of cone-bearing trees.
From that residue, the startup creates throat sprays, immunity boosters, and products for brain and digestive health — all very buzzy health concerns.
Mining for big money
We usually stay away from big rounds that garner headlines in this space.
However, if a round is interesting enough, it makes the list regardless, so just in case you missed it — KoBold Metals raised a big $195 million round from a number of big-name investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, and Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos-backed Breakthrough Energy Ventures. The new cash values the climate-tech startup at $1.15 billion.
What makes the Berkeley, California-based startup intriguing?
KoBold Metals ties two hot trends together for investors — artificial intelligence and alternative energy sources. The company uses AI to mine for valuable metals such as cobalt, copper, nickel and lithium — used in the production of batteries for a variety of sectors, including electric vehicles.
The startup has built a database about the Earth’s layers and uses algorithms to make predictions about where mineral deposits are located around the world.
Pretty cool and timely, even if you may have seen it already — considering all the escalating concern about finding such material.

"
Most Active Investors Pare Dealmaking In First Half Of 2023,Joanna Glasner,2023/07/12,"

The money and deal counts required to rank among the most active startup investors have come down dramatically in the past couple years.
For the first half of 2023, the seven busiest global venture investors collectively led 80 rounds, per Crunchbase data. That’s a decline of 78% from the year-ago period, when the seven most active firms led 364 rounds.

The names leading our rankings have seen some major shuffling as well. While Tiger Global Management and SoftBank used to reliably top the list of spendiest and most active startup backers, both firms have pulled back hard amid the market downturn. Meanwhile, Andreessen Horowitz, New Enterprise Associates and Lightspeed Venture Partners have risen in the ranks.
For perspective, we chart out the seven most active lead venture and growth investors for the the first half of 2023 below:


Notably, out of all the firms listed above, only one — Left Lane Capital — did more deals in the past six months than in the same period last year. It helps that the Brooklyn-based firm closed on a $1.4 billion second fund in April 2022, providing plentiful dry powder to put to work.
Two other firms on the list — NEA and Google Ventures — have picked up the pace since the second half of 2022, but are still down year over year. And General Catalyst has held steady, with 11 lead rounds in each of the past two half-year periods.
Spendiest investors
For the most part, lead investors are also spending less than they used to on traditional venture rounds. However, a couple of unusual, jumbo-sized rounds in the first quarter did serve to boost the 2023 totals.
For the first half of the year, the largest deal by a long shot was the $10 billion Microsoft-backed round for OpenAI, a self-described “capped profit company governed by a nonprofit.” That lone investment catapulted Microsoft to the top of the ranking of investors who led or co-led the most expensive collection of rounds in H1, listed below:


After Microsoft, we see a number of firms that co-led 2023’s other ginormous financing, the $6.5 billion March Series I for payments unicorn Stripe. This includes Thrive Capital, Founders Fund, MSD Partners, General Catalyst, Bailie Gifford and Andreessen Horowitz — or six of the 10 names on our list above.
Busiest seed backers
Of all startup investment stages, seed tends to be the least impacted by market cycles. Since companies at this stage are so far from any conceivable exit, the current state of stock indices, the IPO market or M&A makes little difference.
The most active investor rankings reflect some of this nonchalance. The top names on the list haven’t shifted much in the past couple years. And famed accelerator Y Combinator continues to hold on to its top ranking, as shown below:


Techstars, which has landed in the No. 2 slot for several prior quarters, is also holding its spot, and Antler, an accelerator platform that operates in 25 cities across six continents, came in at No. 3.
A slowdown, or a new normal?
With venture funding slowing for several quarters now, it’s not surprising to see the usual most active investors also cutting back some.
Will things rev up again? We’re seeing some signs of increasing liveliness in the M&A and IPO markets, which tends to be a bullish indicator for venture funding. The seed pipeline also looks pretty robust.
For now, however, the typical heavy spenders in the startup world are still by and large holding back.

Sapphire Ventures Commits $1B-Plus To AI-Powered Tech Startups,Chris Metinko,2023/07/11,"

No venture capital firm wants to be left behind when it comes to the exploding world of AI.
On the same day San Francisco-based Anthropic released its newest version of its AI bot Claude, Sapphire Ventures said it will commit more than $1 billion to investing in AI-powered enterprise technology startups — including those in the generative AI space.
Sapphire is not new to the AI world. The firm said it has deployed $2.4 billion across 60 AI-focused companies to date, including startups ThoughtSpot, DataRobot and Clari.

The new commitment will encompass all areas of the AI tech stack, including foundation models, middleware and AI applications.
“Sapphire has been backing AI startups for more than a decade, so we’ve seen many evolutions of the technology,” Jai Das, the firm’s president, partner and co-founder, said in a release. “Most recently, we’ve experienced a huge paradigm shift driven by GenAI and LLMs, which is transforming how we work and live. This next AI wave will replace task-specific models that have dominated the AI landscape to-date.”

Of course, Sapphire is far from the only firm looking to put more cash into the AI space, which has seen tens of billions invested since with OpenAI’s unveiling of artificial intelligence tools ChatGPT late last year.
Just last month, SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son told investors the firm will shift from “defense mode” to “offense mode” and is looking at being the leader in the AI revolution.
The AI space is not a cheap one, however. Generative AI companies have raised huge rounds, starting in January with OpenAI’s reportedly $10 billion deal with Microsoft.
Others have followed since, including San Francisco-based Adept AI, which raised a $350 million Series B at a reported post-money valuation of at least $1 billion in March. In May, Anthropic raised a $450 million Series C that reportedly valued the company at $5 billion.
In late June “personal AI” startup Inflection AI nabbed a huge $1.3 billion round led by Microsoft, Reid Hoffman, Bill Gates, Eric Schmidt and new investor Nvidia. The round valued Inflection AI at $4 billion, according to Forbes.
That is only a small sampling of the dozens of deals that have occurred — with more on the way.

Cyber Leak? Cybersecurity Funding Falls 63% In Q2,Chris Metinko,2023/07/11,"

In 2021, venture funding in the red-hot cybersecurity market topped $23 billion. Two years later, it seems like a security startup will be lucky to raise just one-third of that.
Venture funding for cybersecurity dropped to just slightly more than $1.6 billion in the just completed second quarter — a 63% drop from the same quarter last year when startups saw nearly $4.3 billion, per Crunchbase data.

The number marks its lowest point since the last quarter of 2019, when startups raised just under $1.6 billion.


The numbers for the first half of the year are also a stark contrast to just one year ago. For the first six months this year, cyber startups raised only $4.3 billion, a drop of 60% from the $10.8 billion raised in the first half last year. It also is more than $2 billion less than the $6.4 billion raised in the second half of 2022.
These numbers are just the latest reminder of how dramatically the venture capital environment has changed in just 24 months.
In 2021, companies of all shapes and sizes were able to raise — early, middle or late — large growth rounds seemingly at will. The market has now shifted as private investors copied their public counterparts and are looking for companies that can get to at least cash-flow break-even quickly and efficiently.
That has caused funding to significantly slow, as deal volumes and dollar amounts have plummeted in all sectors, although it is extremely stunning in the once high-flying cyber sector.
Cybersecurity deal flow declines
While most people focus on the money raised, the overall drop in deal volume is also drastic.
The second quarter saw only 148 cybersecurity funding deals announced — a 35% drop from the 228 completed in Q2 2022 and the lowest total in years.
In addition, only 312 deals were announced for the entire first half of the year, a 38% decline from the 507 deals announced in 1H 2022.
Perhaps the perfect illustration of both money and number of deals being down is looking at big rounds — those of $100 million or more.
Through the first six months of last year, 33 cybersecurity rounds of $100 million or more were raised. The first half of this year saw only 11, a 67% decline.
The second quarter of this year saw only five such rounds:

In June, Maryland-based Blackpoint Cyber, which offers a security suite of products to managed service providers, raised a $190 million growth investment led by Bain Capital Tech Opportunities.
In April, McLean, Virginia-based ID.me, a digital identity network, was able to rake in a $132 million Series D led by Viking Global Investors.
Data security startup Cyera, cybersecurity unicorn Cybereason and Eagle Eye Networks all raised rounds of $100 million also last quarter.

Looking ahead
While the numbers are not dissimilar to the venture capital world in general right now, it is somewhat stunning that a sector always thought to be “recession proof” or able to hold strong in a downturn has shifted so much.
Cybersecurity funding likely is feeling pain from both sides. First, startups in the space certainly followed the “grow fast, go big” mantra of many other startups in other industries. However, investors are backing away from that philosophy due to the current market favoring profitability.
Companies in the sector likely are also feeling the rollback in spending many of their customers are implementing as companies try to save money in an uncertain economy.
Not all is lost in the sector by any means. Companies still need security, as it is not a luxury item. Ransomware attacks and hacks continue to be in the news, and companies will have to spend money on security even as IT budgets get tighter.
Artificial intelligence also may play a role in the sector — as it has in many others. Security companies likely will look to AI to improve offerings, helping security operations run more efficiently. Cybersecurity also could play a role in making sure the data AI is using is not corrupted.
Finally, while funding is down, many of the largest public cyber companies such as Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet and CrowdStrike have seen big pops in their share prices since the beginning of the year. That could help spur on more M&A in the sector — as large companies may be more willing to do stock deals if their share prices continue to increase.
Seeing successful exits through M&A deals could cause VCs to again open the funding gates.
Considering all of that, the second half of the year could be an interesting ride.
Methodology
Cybersecurity is defined by the industries of network security, cloud security and cybersecurity, according to Crunchbase data. Most announced rounds are represented in the database; however, there could be a small time lag for rounds reported late in the quarter.

"Real Estate Startup Investment Falters, Even As Housing Demand Stays Hot",Joanna Glasner,2023/07/10,"

Real estate is one of those startup investment categories where it’s easy to come up with a great-sounding business plan.
Who wouldn’t want a cool, 3D-printed home, a fully appointed guest cottage that unfolds in an hour, or a rental apartment building that also manages to “enhance the lives of its residents?”
Trouble is, delivering on a concept tends to be exceedingly hard — a dilemma not lost on real estate startup investors.

“A lot of stuff in construction and real estate is very relatable,” said Raja Ghawi, partner at Era Ventures, a VC firm focused on the built environment. “And there’s infinite demand.”
But while crafting a compelling pitch may be straightforward, Ghawi said, the operational challenges are anything but. Investors also have a history of bold bets in real estate, he noted, sometimes giving entrepreneurs “incentive to go from zero to 100 very fast.”
This may explain why real estate and proptech are sectors with a history of famous hits and misses. On the miss side, well-known names include Katerra, a former unicorn out to disrupt the construction industry, and WeWork, the coworking pioneer that went from unicorn to penny stock. On the hit side, companies like Procore Technologies, Nest and Airbnb have generated big returns for early backers.
What’s happening now
These days, as the broad pullback in venture investment extends into its second year, real estate-focused startups have not been spared. Per Crunchbase data, funding to U.S. startups in categories tied to real estate is on track to hit its lowest level in at least five years.
To get a sense of how investment has trended over time, we charted out funding to real estate categories for 2023 to date as well as the past five calendar years:


While funding has fallen, we are still seeing large financings. Standouts include:

EquipmentShare, the Columbia, Missouri-based operator of a marketplace for construction contractors to rent and buy equipment, picked up $290 million in an April Series E round. To date, the 8-year-old company has raised $1.8 billion in debt financing and $600 million in equity funding.
R-Zero, a Utah-based developer of connected sensors and disinfection devices for indoor spaces, picked up $105 million in a February Series C financing. The company is particularly focused on shared spaces, such as health care facilities, schools and offices.
Avenue One, a New York-based tech platform for institutional investors in residential real estate, landed $100 million in a financing led by growth investor WestCap.

Many active investors are sitting things out this year
One element conspicuously absent from this year’s largest financings, however, is lead participation from firms that previously ranked as the most active startup investors. Tiger Global Management and SoftBank Vision Fund didn’t do any deals in Crunchbase’s U.S. real estate categories. Nor did Andreessen Horowitz, which drew attention last August for its $350 million investment in WeWork founder Adam Neumann’s new rental upstart, Flow.
Perhaps the most active investors are waiting to see how prior investments in the space scale, including those made around the market peak of 2021. In many cases, it isn’t looking good.
The real estate startup space has been impacted by swiftly changing market conditions. Rising office vacancies have gotten a lot of ink, though the most notable disruption for startups is likely the sharp rise in interest rates. Since late 2021, the typical rate on a U.S. home mortgage has soared from around 3% to 7%.
That’s hit some startups hard. Last week, PeerStreet, a crowdfunded tool for investing in real estate loans that had raised over $100 million from Andreessen and others, filed for bankruptcy protection. And Better.com, the mortgage financing platform that raised hundreds of millions in venture funding, has had multiple rounds of layoffs and recently shuttered a division.
Venture-backed real estate companies that went public also haven’t been big winners. This includes i-buying platforms Opendoor and Offerpad.
Yet startups still look intriguing
Still, market enthusiasm remains robust for business plans that strike a chord with the times.
Boxabl, maker of the aforementioned fold-out cottages that arrive on a flatbed, has raised over $140 million, mostly through a popular crowdfunding campaign. On the venture side, meanwhile, Honey Homes, a membership service for home upkeep and maintenance, raised $9 million in Series A funding just last week.
Seems if you can craft a pitch that works and get an early rendition off the ground, there’s investment to go around
Now, we’ll just have to see who can deliver at scale.

"
North American Startup Funding Fell Across All Stages In Q2,Joanna Glasner,2023/07/7,"

The good times are not back for North American venture funding. 
Sure, there may be upbeat signs, like the mounting AI buzz and some resurgence in the IPO and M&A markets. But when it comes to the actual funding tallies, the totals are unequivocally trending lower.
How far down? For the second quarter of 2023, investors put $31.8 billion into seed- through growth-stage rounds for U.S. and Canadian startups, according to preliminary Crunchbase data. That’s by far the lowest quarterly total in more than three years.
For perspective, we chart out quarterly investment totals, color-coded by stage, for the past 10 quarters below:


Funding was down at every stage both quarter over quarter and year over year, with the most pronounced decline at later stages (Series C and beyond). In addition to putting less money to work, investors completed the lowest number of deals in two years, as shown in the chart below: 


Still, there were some large financings in the second quarter, including a $450 million Series C for generative AI platform Anthropic, and a $401 million Series D for gene therapy startup ElevateBio. 
Also, seed- and early-stage dealmaking saw relatively modest quarter-over-quarter declines, so the pipeline of fundable companies remains pretty robust.
For a more detailed sense of how the quarter and first half of the year played out, we break things out by stage below. We also take a look at exits, both M&A and IPOs, and contemplate where things are likely to go from here.
Late stage and technology growth
We’ll start with late stage, which typically gets the largest share of investment.
For Q2, North American startups pulled in $15.3 billion in late- and technology growth-stage financings1, per Crunchbase data. That’s a drop of 48% quarter over quarter and 54% year over year. 
The declines look less steep when we consider that the Q1 total included a huge and unusual transaction: the $10 billion Microsoft-backed round for OpenAI, which calls itself a “capped profit company governed by a nonprofit.” Without that deal, Q1 and Q2 totals would be much closer together.
Round counts also ticked up slightly in Q2. This indicates investors are slightly more open to consummating deals, albeit at valuations often far below the 2021 peak. 
For the bigger picture, we lay out total investment and round counts over five quarters below:


Investors also didn’t shy away from big rounds. Besides the two aforementioned financings for Anthropic and ElevateBio, other large funding recipients included drone operator Zipline ($330 million Series F), construction equipment marketplace EquipmentShare ($290 million Series E, and AI software provider Cohere ($270 million Series C).
Early stage
As venture investment contracted over the past several quarters, declines have been more pronounced at the late stage than the early stage. This seems logical, given that late-stage valuations are more driven by public market comps and the state of the IPO market. Early-stage investors, by comparison, have longer time horizons and are less impacted by the immediate exit environment.
Given that, it wasn’t surprising to see that early-stage investment was relatively flat, with $13.5 billion invested in Q2, down just 2% from the prior quarter.
Year over year, however, the comps look less favorable. Second-quarter early-stage investment was down 47% from the same period in 2022. Round counts followed a similar pattern. 
For a look at the dynamics over the past five quarters, we chart out early-stage investment totals and round counts below:


As usual, a handful of outsized rounds boosted the quarterly totals. For Q2, there were at least 22 early-stage rounds of $100 million or more. 
The largest funding recipient was AI cloud infrastructure startup CoreWeave, which raised $441 million across two rounds. Next up were two RNA medicine companies: ReNAgade Therapeutics ($300 million Series A) and Orbital Therapeutics ($270 million Series A)
Seed
Turning to seed and angel stage, we see that investment fell in Q2, hitting the lowest quarterly level in years.
Overall, investors put $3 billion into North American investments at this stage, down 39% year over year and 13% quarter over quarter. Round counts also declined, although current Q2 tallies remain preliminary.
For a broader view, we charted out seed and angel investment totals and round counts for the past five quarters below:


Not all sectors are seeing a decline in seed funding. Per Crunchbase data, a number of areas remain hot for recently founded companies, including generative AI, esports, and tools for finding and filling jobs. 
We’re seeing some jumbo-sized seed rounds as well. In Q2, the standout was a $50 million seed financing for Hippocratic AI, a developer of AI technology for health care.
Exits
In terms of investment returns, the second quarter wasn’t a red-hot period for either startup acquisitions or public offerings. However, some good-sized exits did happen. Below, we look at the highlights.
IPOs
While the IPO market remained quiet in Q2, a few companies did manage to carry out market debuts.
The biggest offering came from Cava, a venture-backed Mediterranean-inspired eatery chain that saw shares spike after trading commenced in late June. The Washington, D.C.-based company recently had a market cap of more than $8 billion.
Net Power, a Durham, North Carolina-based provider of emissions-free power from natural gas, also carried out a sizable offering. The company completed a SPAC merger in June and had a recent market cap around $860 million.
To flesh things out, we put together a list of five funded companies that completed public listings in Q2:


M&A
The second quarter also was a reasonably busy period for venture-backed M&A, with multiple 10-figure acquisitions and several in the hundreds of millions.
Scopely, a Culver City, California-based game studio, inked the largest deal. In April, Savvy Gaming Group, a game developer owned by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, announced plans to acquire the 12-year-old company for $4.9 billion.
Next up, Databricks announced in late June that it is acquiring MosaicML, a provider of generative AI tools for developers, in a transaction valued at around $1.3 billion. The same week, Visa announced its purchase of Pismo, a digital banking technology platform, for $1 billion in cash.
For a quick rundown of big startup M&A deals for the quarter, we used Crunchbase data to assemble a list of the top nine:


Summing up and looking forward
Overall, with the exception of a few big exits and unicorn rounds, it wasn’t the most upbeat quarter for startup funding. Total startup investment is only about one-third what it was at the peak in Q4 of 2021. 
One consolation, however, is that when things go down, that sets a lower bar to clear for subsequent quarters. In Q3 of 2023, for instance, North American startup investors will have to do just $33 billion worth of deals to qualify as a sequential “up” quarter. 
Future uncertainties notwithstanding, this seems like an entirely realistic benchmark to hit. And remember: If the IPO market comes back, we should start seeing large pre-IPO rounds getting done too. Those have been largely absent since market debuts dried up over a year ago.
So, maybe this is the bottom. Coming from someone who was quite premature forecasting a peak a few years ago, I wouldn’t put great faith in such a prediction. Durations of market cycles are notoriously hard to pin down. 
But still, a hit public offering from a high-profile unicorn or two could do a lot to spark a startup funding rebound. 
Sometimes, it doesn’t take much to tip investors’ mindset from frugality to FOMO.

SoftBank Backs Japanese Robotics Startup Telexistence in $170M Round,Chris Metinko,2023/07/6,"

Japanese robotics firm Telexistence raised a $170 million Series B, which included a commitment from new investor SoftBank Group.
The deal comes just weeks after SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son told investors the firm will shift from “defense mode” back to “offense mode” and is looking at being the leader in the AI revolution.
“Now, the time has come to shift to offense mode,” Son said.

The new deal seems to fit into that AI thesis, as Telexistence creates AI-powered robotic arms for the retail and warehousing sectors. The company has deployed its robots in 300 FamilyMart convenience stores in Japan.
Aside from SoftBank, other investors in the round include previous investors Monoful Venture Partners, KDDI Open Innovation Fund and Airbus Ventures, and new investors HH-CTBC Partnership (Foxconn Co-GP Fund), and Globis Capital Partners.
The deal also includes a strategic business partnership agreement with SoftBank Robotic Group, a subsidiary of SoftBank, for commercialization in North America.
Founded in 2017, the company has now raised nearly $200 million, per Crunchbase.
Robotics funding
Funding in robotics has slumped after having a breakout in 2021, according to Crunchbase data.
In 2021, robotic startups globally raised about $17 billion total. However, that number fell to only $9.6 billion last year and thus far only $3.6 billion in 2023.
Whether this latest round will bring any heat to the sector is impossible to say, but it is clear Telexistence plans to quickly scale up.
“With this latest funding, we aim to amplify our search for top, diverse talent to enhance our global capabilities at scale,” said CEO Jin Tomioka in a release.

"‘Excited’ And ‘Scary’: After Sizzling First Half, Don’t Expect AI Investment To Cool Off",Chris Metinko,2023/07/6,"

This article is Part Four of our Mid-Year Report on an eventful 2023 in tech, startups and venture capital. In Part One we took a look at data and trends over the last six months. Part Two shared survey results from our readers about the rest of the year. And Part Three revealed our IPO predictions for 2023.
Artificial intelligence hasn’t just dominated the tech world through the first half of this year — its use and applications have dominated the buzz in nearly every aspect of our lives from employment to dating.
That certainly has been true in the venture capital and investing world as well, as one huge funding round has been followed by even bigger ones, and seemingly every startup has scrambled to call themselves “AI-enhanced” or “AI-powered.”

“It both excites me and scares me at the same time,” joked Mark Sherman, managing director at Telstra Ventures, about investing in the AI sector in the current environment.
“There are people definitely looking to grab certain segments (of AI) that could enjoy doing something similar to what OpenAI has done,” he  added. “Some segments will, and others will be shown to have false momentum.”
VCs and corporations have poured money into the space through the first half of the year, spending big on generative AI platforms, support infrastructure and specific AI applications in certain sectors like health care and biotech.
Before taking a look at what the second half of 2023 may hold, let’s quickly look at AI’s big first part of the year.
The first half
While it’s true AI started taking off late last year — when startups such as San Francisco-based AI video and audio editing tool Descript, and Austin, Texas-based AI content platform Jasper raised big rounds — the craze hit a new level with OpenAI.
In January, news swirled that OpenAI, the company behind the artificial intelligence tools ChatGPT and DALL-E, could be valued at $29 billion in a new tender offer. By the end of the month, Microsoft confirmed it had agreed to a “multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment” into OpenAI, believed to be about $10 billion.
That was only the start. San Francisco-based Adept AI raised a $350 million Series B at a reported post-money valuation of at least $1 billion in March. And Anthropic — a ChatGPT rival with its AI assistant Claude — raised a $450 million Series C that reportedly valued the company at $5 billion in May.
Finally, in late June “personal AI” startup Inflection AI nabbed a huge $1.3 billion round led by Microsoft, Reid Hoffman, Bill Gates, Eric Schmidt and new investor Nvidia. The round valued Inflection AI at $4 billion, according to Forbes
Those rounds were just a sampling of investors’ insatiable appetite for AI, as countless other startups raised cash in the sector even as funding continued to dip in almost every other industry.
VCs were not the only ones taken with the new technology, as the OpenAI round shows. Large corporations and their VC arms — including Google, Zoom Ventures, Nvidia, Oracle and Salesforce Ventures 1 — also flooded money into the space, illustrating the tech’s quick adoption.
Looking to invest
Despite the onslaught of investment dollars AI already has seen, expect a lot more.
From new generative AI platforms to infrastructure plays to applications using AI in specific verticals, there is a lot for investors to sink their teeth — and money — into.
“We are very interested in many of the nooks and crannies of AI,” Sherman said.
While the large generative AI platforms like OpenAI and Anthropic have been the investment domain of large firms and corporations, many see opportunity in the infrastructure layer that supports those platforms.


That layer can include anything from chips and enhanced compute to unique data sets to help with modeling.
Startups like CoreWeave, which provides GPU-accelerated compute solutions, and Pinecone, which creates vector databases, have raised big money contributing to the foundation layer of AI.
“We are definitely looking at the ‘picks-and-shovels’ approach,” said Mark Edwards, chief investment officer at early-stage investing firm Alumni Ventures, which has invested in semiconductor startup Analog Inference and AI-enabled middleware platform Anything World.


Edwards said there is substantial tech talent currently looking at different ways to increase processing speed and compute while reducing costs — something that will be a necessity for AI to achieve more general adoption.
There are also a substantial number of startups that are putting AI to real-world uses, be it in sales, content creation or designing.
Startups like Character.ai and Jasper raised large rounds within the last nine months, creating platforms to help companies work better with AI.
Many investors see a path for AI to open more doors in several fields like software development, financial services and — perhaps the most mentioned — health care and biotech.


Alumni Ventures is looking at possibilities in drug discovery, insurance and consumer credit, Edwards said. The company already is an investor in Bionic Health, which gives users AI-driven modules to improve their physical health and mental well-being.
Alumni is even looking at using AI itself to help manage its back office operations such as legal compliance, managing accounts and tax reporting.
“There’s a lot of repetitive tasks that require a lot of manual processes,” he said. “So we look at those.”
New market, same old question
Alex Mason, partner at growth equity firm FTV Capital, said while his firm continues to look at different layers of the AI stack, the one constant question is how companies will actually use this technology.
“I think you always need to be asking how companies incorporate AI into their business,” said Mason, whose firm has invested in startups including U.K.-based CloudFactory, which does data labeling for AI.
“I think you have to ask what AI means to the customer,” he added. “There are different stages of adoption.”
However, most agree there will be some level of adoption of AI by nearly every company in almost any sector at some point in the future.
In fact, many investors compare the growth of AI to the mobile revolution that disrupted nearly every sector of our lives just about a decade and a half ago. Just as that transformation excited investors and increased funding, many investors see the same going on in AI right now.
While investors are taking a much more rational approach to investing compared to what went on in 2021, AI is certainly exerting upward pressure on the market, Edwards said.
“I think you have to approach this with patience and humility,” he said. “You have to balance risk and reward.”
Sherman said valuations for AI-related startups are receiving multiples 2x to 6x higher than other software counterparts.
What’s next?
It’s impossible to say for certain what the second half of the year will hold for AI. While there is still much excitement around the technology, there are concerns about risks it can pose if used improperly and its likely effects on the elimination of jobs.
The European Union became the first body to enact regulations on the technology, and many countries — including the U.S. — are expected to follow.
Nevertheless, it has undeniably brought renewed excitement to a slowing VC world.
SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son recently told investors the firm will shift from “defense mode” to “offense mode” — despite recent massive losses — because it wants to be a leader in the AI revolution.
“Now, the time has come to shift to offense mode,” Son said.
Many of the recent AI fundings have come from a mix of corporations or their VC arms. These big-name investors include General Catalyst, Tiger Global and Sequoia Capital, as well as other large players such as Spark Capital and Greylock Partners.
However, with the SoftBank move, it will be interesting to see if the AI buzz will force some well-financed growth investors — that played big roles in the market in 2021 but have been quiet since — back into the venture market.
It has even helped spur on a sleeping M&A market, with Databricks just announcing a huge $1.3 billion deal to acquire OpenAI competitor MosaicML for $1.3 billion.
How that flood of dollars will affect second-half investment in AI isn’t entirely clear. Once hot trends like the metaverse and Web3 had their moments but soon dropped off. AI seems to be a different animal — but time will tell.
“There is an arms race going on,” Mason said. “How does that ripple through the next six, nine, 12 months? We’ll see.”

CADDi Lands $89M In Sagging Supply Chain Management Sector,Chris Metinko,2023/07/5,"

Global procurement startup CADDi locked up an $89 million Series C even as the supply chain management sector has seen a significant decline in funding.

The new round was co-led by existing investors including Globis Capital Partners, DCM, Global Brain, World Innovation Lab, JAFCO Group and Minerva Growth Partners with new investors also participating. Founded in 2017, CADDi has now raised $164 million, per the company.
The Tokyo-based firm operates a business-to-business marketplace for the manufacturing industry that allows companies to manage quality, cost and delivery within its supply chain infrastructure.
The global supply chain company has ambitious goals. In a release, CADDi said the new cash will help it generate $10 billion in revenue by 2030. It also expects its U.S. office to expand to 100 employees within a year.
CADDi already has 590 employees globally, and has recently established a U.S. division and Mexico supplier operations.
Slumping supply chain
Supply chain management startups were the talk of the VC world after the pandemic rankled many industries’ ability to move materials and goods. 
While the supply chain issues remain even as the pandemic has lessened — especially as labor shortages have persisted and geopolitical tensions have affected importing — venture dollars to the industry have slowed.
In 2021, startups in the supply chain management space raised a record $13.5 billion, per Crunchbase data. Last year, that number fell, but only slightly to $11.4 billion.
Through more than half of this year, however, venture dollars have plummeted.
Supply chain startups have received only $1.4 billion in funding so far this calendar year. That pace would mean a drop of more than 75% in funding to the space.
While a drop in VC dollars this year is common in nearly all industries — AI excluded of course — such a substantial fall seems to indicate the supply chain is not a top VC concern.

Mid-Year Report: Who Could Still Go Public In 2023?,Crunchbase News,2023/07/5,"

This article is Part Three of our Mid-Year Report on an eventful 2023 in tech, startups and venture capital. Part One took a look at data and trends over the last six months. Part Two shared survey results from our readers about the rest of the year. Coming up, we’ll dive deep into trends and data in AI venture funding and their impact.
What does the IPO market look like in the second half of 2023?
While IPOs came to a screeching halt last year, we’ve seen a few promising public offerings in the first half of 2023. Johnson & Johnson spinoff Kenvue, for instance, was valued at $50 billion after it went public on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this year.
Tons of startups are eager to make their public debuts. Mature startups including Stripe and Shein have reportedly mulled over their IPO strategies. Other startups are starting to run out of cash as venture investors pull back — a phenomenon exacerbated by the collapse of preeminent startup bank Silicon Valley Bank earlier this year.

But IPOs are still few and far between, and those that choose to brave the public markets will have to accept that the sky-high public debuts of 2021 likely won’t happen this year. An unprecedented 414 U.S. startups went public in 2021, per Crunchbase data, but that number decreased to 93 in 2022. As of now, only 29 startups have made their public debut this year.
With all that in mind, we make a few bold predictions about the companies that could make their way to the public markets this year, or when the IPO window reopens.
— Keerthi Vedantam
Enterprise software

Databricks: The San Francisco-based data and AI company always makes everyone’s IPO list — and there’s a good reason for that. It is one of the most valuable private companies, with a $38 billion valuation after raising a $1.6 billion Series H led by Morgan Stanley’s Counterpoint Global in 2021. The company recently talked about surpassing a milestone of $1 billion in annual revenue and has hinted coyly at a potential IPO in the past. It also just made a huge acquisition, buying OpenAI competitor MosaicML for $1.3 billion. The deal for MosaicML could be another step toward the public market, as Databricks looks to expand its portfolio of offerings and cash in on an exploding AI market. Databricks has significant investors to eventually appease — the company has raised more than $3.5 billion, per Crunchbase — so an exit makes sense. Databricks also has deep technology — it creates tools and products to help companies view both structured and unstructured data in a single location without moving between different systems — and a growing market. It even already has its own venture arm, Databricks Ventures. It seems like its evolution to a public company is nearly complete.
Icertis: This one may be a bit of a curveball, but just follow along. The Bellevue, Washington-based contract management software developer locked up $150 million in financing in late 2022. The funding was an even split of a revolving credit facility and convertible financing from Silicon Valley Bank (yes, that bank). At the time, Icertis CFO Rajat Bahri said the deal would help “build towards the next exciting chapter in our company’s journey.” Could that be an IPO? Eventually convertible notes need to be converted. An IPO allows that to happen. Also, Icertis’ contract platform helps companies structure their commercial, legal and operational data within contracts, and connect that data to its other internal systems such as human resources and CRM platforms. While not the sexiest of markets, allowing data to flow through different internal systems is a big market. The company also is already big. In March 2021, Icertis announced an $80 million Series F at a valuation of more than $2.8 billion and in early 2022 it was reported the company was worth $5 billion.
Talkdesk: All the way back in the salad days of 2021, the cloud-based contact center company locked up a $230 million Series D and became a decacorn. The San Francisco-based company also named industry veteran Sydney Carey as its first chief financial officer. Carey joined Talkdesk from Sumo Logic, where she helped lead the company’s initial public offering. While Sumo Logic recently became a private company again, perhaps it’s time Talkdesk goes public. Since it’s private, the company does not release financials, but it’s pretty big from some estimates. The company even has its own investment arm, Talkdesk Ventures. It’s also 12 years old, so maybe the time has come?

Consumer startups
I’m not expecting much of an IPO rebound this year for venture-backed companies that are long on futuristic vision and short on real earnings. Investors continue to shy away from companies that launched SPACs and IPOs a couple years ago, most of which are still way down.
However, there could be room for some growth companies with strong revenue and margins to contemplate, and compelling stories to go public. For the consumer and consumer-facing platform space, some names that come to mind include:

Navan (formerly TripActions): OK, I cheated here. Navan already submitted a confidential filing for a planned public offering, which is widely expected later this year. The Palo Alto, California-based company, which offers software for corporate travel and expense management, has raised over a billion dollars in equity financing to date. In December, the company secured $400 million in credit facilities from Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Silicon Valley Bank, less than two months after raising a $304 million Series G at a $9.2 billion valuation. Investors wouldn’t be putting all that capital to work if they didn’t see an exit on the horizon.
Shein: The Chinese fast-fashion giant is another much-talked-about IPO candidate. Shein’s path to a U.S. public listing, however, continues to face hurdles, including objections from lawmakers and a valuation that’s well below peak. Still, even with a cut, Shein was still reportedly valued around $64 billion — enough to generate one of the biggest offerings in a long time.
Upside Foods and Eat Just/GOOD Meat: By most measures, alternative protein upstarts Upside Foods and Eat Just would not be companies deemed likely to dip a toe in IPO waters. Public companies in the space haven’t done so well, most notably Beyond Meat, which is trading close to all-time lows. But last week we got some game-changing news: Upside, a maker of lab-grown meat, and Eat Just, which makes plant-based egg and owns cultivated meat company GOOD Meat, received approval from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to start producing their cell-based proteins. It’s the first such approval from U.S. regulators and could spark investor interest in seeing a public listing for these two early innovators. Plus, to deliver on their vision, they’ll need money to scale, something public investors could potentially provide in abundance.

Fintech

Stripe: Stripe has been waiting in the wings for an IPO for a while and, as one of the most valuable private companies in the world, is also one of the most obvious predictions on this list. The company filed to go public in 2021, but missed the IPO window when it slammed shut in 2022. The 13-year-old payments provider then pivoted to raise a massive $6.5 billion in a single funding round in March 2023 to cover an upcoming employee tax bill on registered stock units due starting in 2024. It also took a deep step down in valuation to $50 billion — a 47% discount from its most recent funding round two years ago, a deal that valued the company at the time at $95 billion. Prior to its latest funding, Stripe had raised $2.2 billion. The company announced more recently that it has processed $817 billion in transactions in 2022 — up 26% from the previous year. The company reportedly generated $14.3 billion in revenue in 2022. Stripe also laid off 14% of its staff in November 2022, saying “we were much too optimistic about the internet economy’s near-term growth in 2022 and 2023.” Stripe is a well-branded industry leader whose stated mission is to increase the GDP of the internet. If the company steps out, it would be a strong signal that the IPO markets are not frozen.
Klarna: Swedish buy now, pay later provider Klarna has been around for 18 years, so it’s not exactly been in a rush to go public. But the company aims to be profitable in 2023, which would make it a good IPO candidate. And like every other venture-backed startup, it has investors waiting to get their returns. Klarna raised $800 million at a much reduced valuation of $6.7 billion in 2022. Just a year earlier, it had been valued at $44.5 billion in a funding led by SoftBank Vision Fund. Klarna’s revenue in 2022 was reported to be $1.8 billion. Some rivals have already beat it to the public markets — Affirm, a U.S. competitor founded years later in 2012, went public in January 2021 and is currently valued at $4.4 billion. Klarna took steps to cut its losses in half in the first quarter of 2023 compared to a year ago while still growing revenue. And it has said it’s targeting profitability in 2023, another strong hint that an IPO is likely a consideration.

Health tech and biotech

Included Health: Included Health was ramping up for an IPO back in 2022, when we could be optimistic about those things. The company, which has raised $344 million, per Crunchbase data, previously hired bankers to help with the process. But, it met the same fate as other companies who thought their 2021 luck would head into the new year, and halted its plans. Included works with companies paying for their own health care services and was part of the growing employee benefits category. While it may have held off on going public, it is more than ready to enter the market.
Lyra Health: I’m still confident a teletherapy or telehealth company will go public sometime this year, if only because adoption of virtual care is still on the rise and some of these companies have already raised their Series F. Lyra was one of the first of its kind — established in 2016, it operates on a direct-to-employer model and has worked with companies like Palantir, Zoom and Amgen to provide teletherapy services. The company has raised $910 million, per Crunchbase data, including a $235 million Series G round back in 2022, upping its valuation to $5.58 billion.
ElevateBio: Why isn’t ElevateBio just a full-fledged big pharma company? The company raised $401 million in Series D funding back in May, and is currently creating the Microsoft 365 of drug development. By that I mean ElevateBio’s enclosed ecosystem of drug discovery, development and manufacturing technologies is all-encompassing. That same ecosystem makes it a favorite among biotech investors and companies vying to partner with Elevate. Biotech IPOs are expected to make a far faster recovery than other tech industries, thanks to strong clinical data exhibited by startups.

"The 10 Biggest Rounds Of June: Inflection AI’s Huge Raise, CleanCapital Cleans Up",Chris Metinko,2023/07/5,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a monthly feature that runs down the month’s top 10 funding rounds in the U.S. See last month’s top rounds here.
While June certainly had its fundraising ups and downs, it ended with a flourish thanks once again to AI and a big $1 billion-plus round.
Aside from the two AI rounds that bookend this list, it was a huge month for biotech and health care, which had four entries on the list. Even a mining and adtech startup made it into the top 10 for the month.

It’ll be interesting to see what the rest of the summer holds.
1. Inflection AI, $1.3B, artificial intelligence: The big news of the month was undoubtedly this Palo Alto, California-based startup. Inflection AI is building what it says will be the “largest AI cluster in the world” and has created large language models to allow people to interact with its AI-powered assistant called Pi, or Personal AI. Pi lets people quickly receive relevant information and advice on their interests. To build the platform, the startup locked up a huge $1.3 billion round led by Microsoft, Reid Hoffman, Bill Gates, Eric Schmidt and new investor Nvidia, which values Inflection AI at $4 billion, according to Forbes, which first reported the news. The new funding brings the total raised by Inflection to more than $1.5 billion, per the company. Founded last year, the generative AI platform is a competitor to other AI firms such as OpenAI and Google. It was co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman, who previously co-founded the Google-owned AI lab DeepMind and serves as CEO at Inflection.
2. CleanCapital, $500M, clean energy: New York-based CleanCapital, a solar and storage developer that invests in early-stage projects, locked up a $500 million commitment from Canadian insurer Manulife Investment Management. CleanCapital will use the money to fund early-stage solar and storage development and acquire other renewable energy assets in the U.S. The company also announced it has deployed more than $1 billion to fund operating, new construction, and early-stage solar and storage development. Founded in 2015, the company has received about $1.1 billion, per Crunchbase.
3. Madhive, $300M, adtech: Advertising software companies have had it tough recently, but not Madhive. The New York-based firm raised $300 million from Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which valued the company at $1 billion, per Axios. The deal gives Goldman a minority stake in the company. Launched in 2015 as Otter TV, Madhive sells its CTV (connected TV) advertising software platform to local TV companies that sell CTV ads. The company already has $100 million, per the Axios report.
4. Aledade, $260M, health care: The Bethesda, Maryland-based company raised a $260 million Series F led by new investor Lightspeed Venture Partners. The round comes just about a year after it locked up a $123 million Series E. The startup provides doctors’ offices with data analytics software so they can better manage their patients and identify those most at risk. The company plans to use the new cash to beef up its services and technology, possibly with acquisitions. The new funding deal values the company at $3.5 billion, Bloomberg reported. Founded in 2014, the company has raised nearly $678 million, per Crunchbase.
5. Upstream Bio, $200M, biotech: It was almost exactly a year ago when Waltham, Massachusetts-based Upstream Bio locked up a $200 million Series A. Last month it was back for another $200 million — a Series B led jointly by Enavate Sciences and Venrock Healthcare Capital Partners. Upstream Bio is developing an antibody that targets thymic stromal lymphopoietin and its receptors that can inflame when things like smoke or allergens are introduced into the environment. The treatment could be useful to those with asthma. Founded in 2004, the company has now raised $400 million, per Crunchbase.
6. KoBold Metals, $195M, mining: What happens when you combine AI with the material needed for lithium-ion batteries? You get big money. Berkeley, California-based KoBold Metals raised a $195 million round led by T. Rowe Price and included a number of big-name investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, and Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos-backed Breakthrough Energy Ventures. The new cash values the climate tech startup at $1.15 billion. KoBold Metals uses artificial intelligence to mine for valuable metals such as cobalt, copper, nickel and lithium used in the production of batteries for a variety of sectors, including electric vehicles. The startup has built a database about the Earth’s layers and uses algorithms to make predictions about where mineral deposits are located around the world. KoBold Metals isn’t new to big rounds. In February 2022, the startup closed a $192.5 million Series B, which included investment from Apollo Projects, Bond Capital, BHP Group and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Founded in 2018, the company has now raised more than $400 million, per Crunchbase.
7. Blackpoint Cyber, $190M, cybersecurity: Cybersecurity, like most sectors, has experienced a slowdown when it comes to venture funding. However, that did not stop Maryland-based Blackpoint Cyber from cashing in. The startup, which offers a security suite of products to managed service providers, raised a $190 million growth investment led by Bain Capital Tech Opportunities. Founded in 2014, the company has now raised more than $200 million, per Crunchbase.
8. Alkeus Pharmaceuticals, $150M, biotech: Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Alkeus Pharmaceuticals closed a $150 million Series B led by Bain Capital Life Sciences. The company specializes in pharmaceuticals to fight Stargardt disease, a leading cause of blindness in children and young adults. In addition to the new funding, Alkeus has also named Dr. Joshua Boger, the founder of Vertex Pharmaceuticals, its executive chairman.
9. Bitterroot Bio, $145M, biotech: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for men, women and many ethnic groups and races in the U.S. and worldwide. Ideally, Bitterroot Bio would like to change that. The Palo Alto, California-based company is focused on novel immunotherapies in cardiovascular disease, and launched from stealth last month with a $145 million Series A led by Arch Venture Partners and Deerfield Management. The company, founded in 2021, hopes to use immunology — including the identification of novel targets and the development of innovative protein therapies — to fight the deadly disease.
10. Runway, $141M, artificial intelligence: New York-based Runway made this list not that long ago after Business Insider reported on this unannounced round. It finally was announced, with Runway raising  a $141 million extension to its December $50 million Series C from Google, Nvidia, Salesforce Ventures 1 and existing investors, among others. At the time of the original report, the new cash valued the company at $1.5 billion. Runway helped develop the AI image generator Stable Diffusion, and launched its video-to-video generative AI app in April. The app lets users transform videos into different styles, such as claymation or watercolors. Founded in 2018, the company has raised nearly $240 million, per Crunchbase.
Big global deals
Despite all the big deals in the U.S., the two biggest occurred abroad last month.

Anhui YOFC Advanced Semiconductor, a manufacturer of silicon carbide power semiconductor products, raised nearly $524 million in a Series A.
Germany-based 1Komma5°, a climate tech startup offering smart-home energy management systems, batteries and more, closed a $467 million Series B.

Methodology
We tracked the largest rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies in June. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late.

AI Was Q2’s Big Hope To Reverse The Global Venture Funding Slowdown. It Wasn’t Enough,Gené Teare,2023/07/5,"

Startup investors globally continued to scale back their pace in the second quarter of 2023 despite large funding and M&A deals in the artificial intelligence space.
Global venture funding in Q2 2023 fell 18% quarter over quarter to $65 billion, Crunchbase data shows. That’s down 49% compared to the second quarter of 2022, when startup investors spent $127 billion.
The first half of 2023 is down by similar proportions. In H1 2023, global funding reached $144 billion, marking a 51% decline from the $293 billion invested in H1 2022 and a 10% decline from the second half of 2022.
The slowdown happened despite three notable events in H1: Large rounds to AI-driven companies led by corporate investors Microsoft, Nvidia and Google alongside venture firms; the billion-dollar acquisition of language model training platform MosaicML by data warehouse company Databricks; and the precipitous stock market climb of Nvidia, whose chips power much of the computing to train large language models.
Nearly a fifth of total global venture funding so far this year has come from the AI sector alone, per Crunchbase. It’s safe to say that without the AI fervor kicked off by the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November, venture funding so far in 2023 would have been even lower.
Dollars and deals decline
Crunchbase data shows that we are now four to five quarters into the current funding decline. Since Q3 2022, each quarter’s global funding total has dropped by more than 45% year over year.


Deal volume is down significantly year over year as well, but not by quite as much as funding amounts. Still, deal volumes are down 37% year over year, with each stage posting a decline of more than a third.
More than 6,000 startups raised funding this past quarter, compared to more than 9,500 for the same time period a year ago.


Late-stage funding
Late-stage funding, the most impacted stage during the downturn, totaled $31 billion in Q2 2023 — the lowest quarter on record since 2018. That includes corporate rounds and private equity to venture-backed companies.
Q2 funding amounted to less than half of the $68 billion from a year ago. The number of late-stage companies funded was down 40% from a year earlier.
During the peak market of 2021, late-stage funding neared or surpassed $100 billion each quarter.


Early-stage
Early-stage funding reached $27 billion in the second quarter — down 45% from the $48 billion invested in Q2 2022. Deal counts were down 35%.
This is the lowest funding quarter to early-stage companies since 2021. In total, only around 1,200 companies raised a Series A or B funding last quarter. That compares to more than 2,100 for the same period a year ago.


Seed funding
Seed-funded startups raised $6.8 billion in Q2 2023, down 39% from the $11.2 billion invested a year earlier for the same time period.
This is the lowest quarter of seed funding to startups since 2021. All told, more than 1,500 companies raised a seed round of $1 million or more in the second quarter compared to around 2,500 for the same time period last year.


AI
Companies categorized as AI in Crunchbase raised $25 billion in the first half of 2023, representing 18% of global funding. That includes the $10 billion funding to OpenAI led by Microsoft in January. While that’s down from the $29 billion invested in H1 2022, by comparison it is higher as a proportion of total funding.
Machine-learning startup Inflection AI alone raised $1.3 billion last quarter. Other AI companies that raised large fundings in the second quarter included Anthropic, CoreWeave, OpenAI, Cohere, Builder.ai, and Runway.
Companies in sectors outside of AI also raised large rounds, including China-based fast fashion retailer Shein, Germany-based solar and smart electricity company 1Komma5°, and Sweden-based battery manufacturer Northvolt.
Company closures
The new scaled-back venture funding environment adversely impacts companies that have raised funding since 2021’s very hot market.
Companies that raised in recent years have slashed costs since 2022 — notably by cutting jobs — to increase runway.
In this slower funding environment, many more companies are also struggling to progress from a sizable ($1 million or more) seed round to their Series A funding, Crunchbase data shows. It’s also taking longer to raise a Series B funding round after securing a Series A.
The predicament for many startups only compounds as their customers continue to scale back, further impacting those companies’ growth. That, in turn, makes it even more difficult to raise much-needed new funding.
As startups run out of options, expect more companies to outright shut down in the second half of 2023 and into 2024.
Methodology
The data contained in this report comes directly from Crunchbase, and is based on reported data. Data reported is as of July 3, 2023.
Note that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarter/year.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.
Glossary of funding terms
We have made a change to how we include corporate funding rounds in our reporting as of January 2023. Corporate rounds are only included if a company has raised an equity funding at seed through a venture series funding round.
Seed and angel consists of seed, pre-seed and angel rounds. Crunchbase also includes venture rounds of unknown series, equity crowdfunding and convertible notes at $3 million (USD or as-converted USD equivalent) or less.
Early-stage consists of Series A and Series B rounds, as well as other round types. Crunchbase includes venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $3 million, and those less than or equal to $15 million.
Late-stage consists of Series C, Series D, Series E and later-lettered venture rounds following the “Series [Letter]” naming convention. Also included are venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $15 million.
Technology growth is a private-equity round raised by a company that has previously raised a “venture” round. (So basically, any round from the previously defined stages.)

"Survey Says: Recession Fears Lurk, Readers Tinker With AI, Many Startups’ Runways Running Out",Marlize van Romburgh,2023/07/3,"

This article is Part Two of our Mid-Year Report on an eventful 2023 in tech, startups and venture capital. Part One took a look at data and trends over the last six months. Coming up, we’ll dive deep into trends and data in AI venture funding and their impact.
Most of you still think a recession this year is more likely than not. You’re tinkering with AI tools, but not yet convinced they’re world-changing. Your companies are still slashing costs. And almost a third of you say your companies only have six months of runway left in the bank. (Yikes!)
Those are some of the takeaways from our latest quarterly Crunchbase News reader survey, where we gauged your sentiments about the state of the economy, company financials, and yes, AI.

Most readers surveyed still say a recession is more likely than not this year. Nearly 59% of readers rated the chances of a global economic downturn in 2023 at 6 or above, with 10 being “most likely.” That is down from previous surveys — last quarter, 65% said so, and at the end of 2022, it was a whopping 82% — but it’s not exactly unbound optimism, either.


More than a third — 37.5% — of respondents say they’re feeling more pessimistic now about the state of the global economy than they were at the start of 2023. A similar number feel more upbeat, and about 27% say their outlook is more or less the same compared to the end of 2022.


“Consumers are running out of savings accumulated during the pandemic. This will cause a weakening of demand for goods which will further stress businesses. Many businesses took advantage of the pandemic shortages and interest rate increases to raise prices on consumer goods. As consumer demand weakens, business will feel the pinch, prices will lower and the U.S. economy will go into recession,” said one reader, who works in management consulting.
Another reader, who works in marketing in the retail or restaurant sectors, was more sanguine: “I don’t think we’ll have a recession, and I’m cautiously optimistic that things will start to level out in 2024 as lingering pandemic effects shake out and central banks begin to stabilize interest rates. Of course, that only happens if foreign policy doesn’t completely fall apart.”
With all the mixed signals in the economy, it’s not surprising that the most common word readers use to describe their outlook for the rest of the year is “confused.”


“This is a strange time to say the least,” noted a reader who identified as a tech executive, founder or owner. “On one hand, some areas are booming, such as real estate where homes are disappearing from the market very fast. On the other hand, there are layoffs and caution among business leaders to move forward on new endeavors.”
Others are having flashbacks to the dot-com bust. “The economy seems slightly better than the end of Q4 2022/Q1 2023 although it feels it could go either way at any moment,” said another reader who is a tech executive or owner. “Worst business climate I’ve seen in startup tech since 2000.”
Cost-cutting continues
Almost 40% of respondents in the recent survey said their companies or employers are cutting costs this year. That compares with 45% a quarter ago.


Still, the majority said their companies had not conducted layoffs either this year or last. Given that the largest area for cost-cutting, per the survey, is headcount, presumably many companies are reducing staffing through attrition rather than outright job cuts.




“I think 2023 is a good year for companies to review costs, review employee evaluations, and continue to refine their hybrid work environments,” said a reader who works in real estate operations.
Fewer than half of survey respondents said their company is actively hiring for open roles.




“It feels more likely that the tech hiring rebound will start (moderately) either Q4 2023 or Q1 2024,” predicted a reader who works in professional services.
As with previous surveys, readers are more bullish on their own companies’ financial prospects than they are about the economy at large. The majority rated their optimism about their company at a 6 out of 10 or higher.


Interestingly, two distinct groups of companies seem to be emerging from the current environment: Those with plenty of cash, and those with very little.
Of the readers who answered the question, almost a third said their companies still have more than 24 months of runway in the bank.
But a pretty high percentage — more than 27% of those who answered the question — said their coffers are running dry, with less than six months of runway left in the bank. That lends credence to the idea that there could be a “mass extinction event” on the horizon for many startups.




AI sparks intrigue, skepticism
Artificial intelligence tools have gone mainstream in the past six months and sparked talk of a new technological revolution on the scale of the internet itself.
“Massive changes,” said one reader when asked how AI tools will change the way they work in 2023. “Unlike the crypto hype bubble, there is real value being generated from AI. I am using it every day and so are lots of people. This is going to be a real massive paradigm shift for how humans use technology going forward.”
Other reviews are mixed.
“Lots of solutions looking for a problem with some genuinely innovative use cases mixed in,” said one reader, who works in marketing in the professional services industry. “The key will be separating those useful insights, tools, and processes from the noise.”
Some of the ways readers say they’re already using AI in the office include: Drafting contracts, reviewing marketing materials, doing sales research, outlining presentations, offering internal IT help, writing basic emails, and editing images.
Another reader said the reality of AI doesn’t quite meet the hype: “The tech is still pretty basic and not solving the more complex tasks I was hoping it would accomplish,” said the person, who also works in professional services.
Among the tools listed in the survey, the vast majority of readers — more than 81% — said they’d used OpenAI’s ChatGPT or GPT4 generative AI tools in a professional context. Just over 42% have used Grammarly, an AI-assisted writing and proofing tool.
A much smaller portion of readers cited using other tools, including Google’s Bard, Canva’s Magic Write, Hemmingway, Jasper and Midjourney.
Many readers feel it’s still early innings for AI, but that more profound changes are to come. Said one reader: “It will have a minimal impact in 2023, but I suspect it will greatly alter how we do our work 5-10 years into the future.”
Methodology
Results are from a survey of Crunchbase News readers conducted between June 1 and June 28 in which 121 readers responded. Readers self-identified their industries and roles and were not required to answer all questions to complete the survey.

The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Another Inflection Point For AI? Investors Pour More Money Into The Space,Chris Metinko,2023/06/30,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.
Once again, the week can be summed up in two words we’ve heard all year — artificial intelligence. Investors went crazy again — led mainly by large corporations or their VC arms — dumping big sums of cash into everything AI. That included a huge round of more than $1 billion.

With all the big money thrown around the space, the only real question left is: When will AI start to write this weekly column?
1. Inflection AI, $1.3B, artificial intelligence: The big news of the week was undoubtedly this Palo Alto, California-based startup. Inflection AI is building what it says will be the “largest AI cluster in the world” and has created large language models to allow people to interact with its AI-powered assistant called Pi, or Personal AI. Pi lets people quickly receive relevant information and advice on their interests. To build the platform, the startup locked up a huge $1.3 billion round led by Microsoft, Reid Hoffman, Bill Gates, Eric Schmidt and new investor Nvidia, which values Inflection AI at $4 billion, according to Forbes, which first reported the news. The new funding brings the total raised by Inflection to more than $1.5 billion, per the company. Founded last year, the generative AI platform is a competitor to other AI firms such as OpenAI and Google. It was co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman, who previously co-founded the Google-owned AI lab DeepMind and serves as CEO at Inflection.
2. Runway, $141M, artificial intelligence: New York-based Runway made this list not that long ago after Business Insider reported on this unannounced round. It finally was announced, with Runway raising  a $141 million extension to its December $50 million Series C from Google, Nvidia, Salesforce Ventures 1 and existing investors, among others. At the time of the original report, the new cash valued the company at $1.5 billion. Runway helped develop the AI image generator Stable Diffusion, and launched its video-to-video generative AI app in April. The app lets users transform videos into different styles, such as claymation or watercolors. Founded in 2018, the company has raised nearly $240 million, per Crunchbase.
3. Author Health, $115M, health care: Health care has been big in recent weeks, and this week a big round went to a newly launched mental health startup. Author Health locked up a $115 million round from General Atlantic and Flare Capital Partners. The Boston-based health care platform creates a team of doctors, nurses, therapists and community health workers for Medicare Advantage recipients with serious mental health disorders. Data from The Commonwealth Fund shows 1 in 4 people with Medicare have a mental illness, but only as much as 50% receive treatment. Author Health is the latest startup to look at government health programs as a revenue stream. EasyHealth, Cityblock Health, CareBridge and Spark Advisors are other startups that have done similar.
4. (tied) Celestial AI, $100M, semiconductors: It seems like photonic chips — which use light to send signals as opposed to the electricity used by conventional processors — is becoming a thing with investors. In late May, Boston-based Lightmatter raised $154 million in the space and this week Celestial AI joined it in cashing in. The Santa Clara, California-based startup raised a $100 million Series B funding led by IAG Capital Partners, Koch Disruptive Technologies and Temasek’s Xora Innovation fund. Such tech is needed now more than ever with AI requiring both faster and more energy-efficient computing. Founded in 2020, the company has raised nearly $164 million, per Crunchbase.
4. (tied) Cyera, $100M, cybersecurity: Data may be king, keeping track of it and securing it can be a pain. Enter data security startup Cyera — which locked up a $100 million Series B led by Accel. Cyera offers a platform that helps security teams at companies understand what data they have and how it’s used, as well as how to secure it. Such platforms can be useful as security teams struggle with growing amounts of data while also often facing staffing issues. Since closing its Series A last March, the company says it has realized 800% revenue growth. Founded in 2020, Cyera has now raised $164.5 million across three rounds, per Crunchbase. The round comes amidst a funding slowdown in cyber — which  has seen a significant dip since the fourth quarter of 2021, per Crunchbase data. The sector saw four consecutive quarters of decline before hitting $2.7 billion in the first quarter of this year — a slight uptick from the $2.4 billion in the final quarter of 2022. However, that first-quarter number represented a 58% drop from the $6.5 billion such startups saw in the same quarter of 2022.
4. (tied) Redpanda Data, $100M, data: Streaming data startup Redpanda Data raised a $100 million Series C led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, Google Ventures and Haystack. The San Francisco-based startup provides real-time streaming data services, helped by — you guessed it — artificial intelligence and machine learning. Companies are able to analyze data as soon as it’s collected. The platform works by being both a data storage system and a data streaming system in which companies can integrate their own data into the machine-learning system to bolster responses. The company says it multiplied its revenue growth 5x over and doubled its workforce through its last fiscal year. Founded in 2019, the company has raised nearly $166 million, per Crunchbase data.
4. (tied) Typeface, $100M, artificial intelligence: Yet another AI startup makes the list. San Francisco-based generative AI startup Typeface — which launched in February with a $65 million raise — raised a $100 million Series B led by Salesforce Ventures with participation from Lightspeed Venture Partners, Madrona, GV, Menlo Ventures and M12 (Microsoft’s venture fund). The company’s AI platform helps with enterprise content creation such as product shots, blog posts, social media ads and job posts that meet brand specifications.
8. Augmedics, $83M, health care: Chicago-based Augmedics, a developer of  augmented reality surgical navigation, closed a $82.5 million Series D led by CPMG. Founded in 2014, the company has raised nearly $144 million, per Crunchbase.
9. Presidio Medical, $72M, medical devices: South San Francisco, California-based Presidio Medical, which develops a transformational neuromodulation platform, closed a $72 million Series C led by Deerfield Management. Founded in 2017, the company has raised $102 million, per Crunchbase.
10. (tied) Fly.io, $70M, apps: Chicago-based Fly.io, a remote app delivery network developer, raised a $70 million Series C led by EQT Ventures. Founded in 2017, the company has now raised more than $110 million, per Crunchbase.
10. (tied) K36 Therapeutics, $70M, biotech: Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech startup K36 Therapeutics closed a $70 million Series B led by Nextech Invest. Founded in 2021, this is the first announced round by the company, per Crunchbase.
Big global deals
Inflection’s big round led the way in all deals raised this week, but was followed by two deals from China.

Anhui YOFC Advanced Semiconductor, a manufacturer of silicon carbide power semiconductor products, raised nearly $524 million in a Series A.
Sunwoda Electric Vehicle Battery, a developer of electric vehicle battery packs, closed a $228 million venture round.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of June 24 to June 30. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

"
Why Do VCs Love Electric Car Batteries As Much As Joe Biden Does?,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/06/30,"

It seems like the U.S. tech industry, which has made leaps in smartphone technology, cloud computing and artificial intelligence, now wants to conquer something new: batteries.
Specifically, batteries for electric vehicles. Amid all the hullabaloo around generative AI, the fall of crypto, and the head-scratching discourse around Web3, somehow, electric vehicle batteries are seeing steady — and favorable — funding in the past few years, per Crunchbase data.


Despite a 43% decrease in funding between 2021 and 2022, electric vehicle battery manufacturing still saw more funding in 2022 than it did in 2020. Last year was the sector’s second-best funding year since 2014.
What’s even more interesting is how much of this funding is flowing to the U.S., despite the fact that China dominates the global battery manufacturing sector.
In 2020, only around 20% of all funding to the sector went toward U.S.-based companies. But in 2021, 64% of all funding to the sector was funneled into U.S.-based companies, per Crunchbase data. In 2022, that number rose to 70%.
VCs chase EV subsidies
So, what’s driving battery funding?
It’s the federal government. Seriously. Following the Inflation Reduction Act, which promises subsidies for EV companies, funding has been pouring into the U.S. from local and international investors to ramp up green energy production.
The Inflation Reduction Act is part of a slew of laws to make it easier for electric vehicle manufacturers to produce parts in the U.S. as it attempts to make its manufacturing sector more competitive at a global level.
Last week, the U.S. Department of Energy conditionally approved a $9.2 billion loan to Ford for the construction of electric vehicle battery factories. It’s the largest automaker loan doled out by the DOE since the 2008 financial crisis.
Ford isn’t the only company to bask in the federal government’s new obsession for electric vehicles — General Motors, LG Energy Solution and Rhyolite Ridge are among the U.S.-grown battery companies that received loans. Even Redwood Materials, which was founded by Tesla co-founder JB Straubel, received a $2 billion loan.
The U.S., despite being home to Tesla and some of the biggest electric vehicle companies in the world, trails behind China in terms of battery manufacturing. Because the U.S. is ramping up its own green energy efforts, the country is working to tighten its supply chains amid geopolitical concerns. That makes sense; the war between Russia and Ukraine saw natural gas prices skyrocket. The U.S., which dreams of running on batteries and semiconductors, currently relies heavily on other countries to source the raw materials to make those products.
What’s most interesting here is the relationship between the bureaucratic federal government and the nimble, fast-moving startup world. It just goes to show how influential the public sector is on our private markets.

"From IBM to Databricks, It’s Been A Big Week For Tech M&A",Joanna Glasner,2023/06/29,"

Sometimes, no one is buying. Other times, everyone is spending big.
This week clearly belongs in the latter category for tech and life sciences M&A. Acquirers shelled out nearly $8 billion in disclosed-price acquisitions in industries from generative AI to payments to legaltech.
Several deals exceeded the billion-dollar mark. This includes the biggest buyer, IBM, which is paying $4.6 billion to purchase Apptio, a provider of  financial and operational IT management software, from private equity owner Vista Equity Partners.

Next up is Databricks, which is acquiring MosaicML, a provider of generative AI tools for developers, in a transaction valued at around $1.3 billion. It’s a particularly big number considering San Francisco-based MosaicML emerged from stealth less than two years ago.
The other 10-figure deal was Visa’s purchase of Pismo, a digital banking technology platform, for $1 billion in cash. Pismo, which has operations in Latin America, Southeast Asia and Europe, previously raised at least $118 million from backers including SoftBank, Amazon and Accel.
Altogether, per Crunchbase data, there have been at least 23 acquisitions this week of companies that previously raised known venture or seed funding.1 We list them below:


Possible catalysts for a deal spree
There’s no obvious reason why this week was so busy for tech M&A. However, some possibilities come to mind.
First off, it is the last week of the quarter. Acquirers, many of which are public companies, might have determined it necessary or preferable for financial disclosure reasons to announce consummated deals before July 1. 
Second, surging interest in artificial intelligence is driving some of the dealmaking. The sector accounts for at least two of this week’s larger deals: MosaicML and Thomson Reuters’ $650 million purchase of AI-enabled legal research provider Casetext. 
Third, the largest public acquirers are in a good place with their shareholders. IBM’s share price has been less volatile than most other tech players over the past few quarters, with a recent market cap over $120 billion. Visa and Thomson Reuters, meanwhile, are not too far off their all-time highs. 
Pickup follows slow times for M&A
While this was an action-packed week for M&A deals, 2023 overall has not been shaping up as a busy year for acquisitions.
In the first quarter of the year, the number of disclosed M&A deals for venture-backed startups globally slipped 31% year over year to 491, per Crunchbase data. Overall, the number of startup acquisitions has been trending down for several quarters.


For Q2 2023, preliminary data suggests M&A activity was also somewhat muted, even with this week’s dealmaking uptick. Still, there were some big transactions, such as mobile game developer Scopely’s $4.9 billion April acquisition by Savvy Gaming Group.
Perhaps this week is an indication that predictions of a rise in M&A deals for venture-backed startups this year were premature rather than flat-out wrong. With large-cap tech acquirers largely flush with cash and trading at historically robust valuations, there’s clearly a strong pool of acquirers out there. And with venture funding down and the IPO market still sluggish, there are also plenty of startups that would be quite open to making a deal.

"
Is Shein Finally Going Public? A Look Into The Company’s IPO History,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/06/29,"

Fast-fashion retailer Shein may finally be on the brink of going public.
The company filed confidentially in the U.S. for its initial public offering, Reuters reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. (In a statement to Axios after the report, Shein denied what it called “rumors.”)
A Shein IPO would be years in the making
Nonetheless, the company has been making moves toward an IPO since at least 2020. The startup, based in China at the time, shelved those plans after rising geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and its headquarters country. In 2022, Shein’s IPO plans were once again put on the back burner due to strict and complex regulatory barriers imposed by the China Securities Regulatory Commission on companies that want to go public offshore.

China has since promised to change its regulatory standards. While keeping its supply chain and warehouse facilities in China, Shein last year moved its headquarters to Singapore, which has laxer regulatory and expansion laws.
In March, rumors swirled that the company was in talks to go public in the U.S. again. In May, the company raised $2 billion at a $66 billion valuation — making it, at the time, the fourth-highest-valued unicorn on The Crunchbase Unicorn Board.
Problems ahead
And now, here we are. If Shein goes public this year, it will be in a much different world than 2020. E-commerce, fueled by the pandemic, made the international fashion brand wildly popular. But post-pandemic the demand for online shopping isn’t what it used to be.
Shein has long been scrutinized by the U.S. for unethical labor practices and the potential damage its clothing production may have on the environment. The company is now navigating stricter environmental regulations that the U.S. and European Union are imposing on imports.
When Shein will go public still remains to be seen. Several highly valued startups, including social networking platform Reddit, car-sharing platform Turo, and grocery delivery service Instacart, have all filed paperwork to go public, but none have their ticker symbols yet.

"AI Funding Explosion: Inflection AI Nabs $1.3B, Runway and Typeface Also Raise Big",Chris Metinko,2023/06/29,"

Who says the venture capital market has slowed?
Certainly not any AI startup at this point. On Thursday, three such startups announced more than $1.5 billion in investments — led by “personal AI” startup Inflection AI’s huge $1.3 billion round.
That funding, led by Microsoft, Reid Hoffman, Bill Gates, Eric Schmidt and new investor Nvidia, values Inflection AI at $4 billion, according to Forbes, which first reported the news. The new funding brings the total raised by Inflection to more than $1.5 billion, per the company.
Inflection AI, with its partners CoreWeave and Nvidia, is building what it says will be the “largest AI cluster in the world” and has created large language models to allow people to interact with its AI-powered assistant called Pi, or Personal AI. Pi lets people quickly receive relevant information and advice on their interests.
Founded last year, the generative AI platform is a competitor to other AI firms such as OpenAI and Google. It was co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman, who previously co-founded the Google-owned AI lab DeepMind and serves as CEO at Inflection.
But that’s not all
Of course, one big round is not newsworthy in AI — even though Inflection’s raise is the second-largest in AI this year, behind only Microsoft’s massive $10 billion investment in OpenAI.
New York-based Runway also raised a $141 million extension to its December $50 million Series C from Google, Nvidia, Salesforce Ventures 1 and existing investors, among others.
The round was first reported about two months ago by Business Insider. At that time, it was reported the money was from a cloud service provider and would value the company at $1.5 billion.
Runway helped develop the AI image generator Stable Diffusion, and launched its video-to-video generative AI app in April. The app lets users transform videos into different styles, such as claymation or watercolors.
Founded in 2018, the company has raised nearly $240 million, per Crunchbase.
Finally, San Francisco-based generative AI startup Typeface — which launched in February with a $65 million raise — also announced on Thursday it has raised a $100 million Series B.
The round was led by Salesforce Ventures with participation from Lightspeed Venture Partners, Madrona, GV, Menlo Ventures and M12 (Microsoft’s venture fund).
The company’s AI platform helps with enterprise content creation such as product shots, blog posts, social media ads and job posts that meet brand specifications.
Big money, big names
While the dollar numbers are eye-catching, so are the names of the investors.
Inflection’s round includes some of the biggest names of individuals in tech, and also includes Microsoft. Microsoft’s VC arm also invested in the Typeface round.
Nvidia, whose stock price has shot up thanks to the importance of its chips in the AI process, took part in both the Inflection and Runway raises.
Google — or GV — and Salesforce Ventures both participated in the rounds for Runway and Typeface.
It seems like no tech giant wants to be left behind in AI — no matter the price.

Startups Get Hip To Hypnotherapy,Joanna Glasner,2023/06/29,"

It’s long seemed like our connected devices are conspiring to hypnotize us.
They goad us into wasting untold time scrolling through mindless content, keep us hooked on shows that always deviously end on a cliffhanger, and ply us with listings of stately homes we can’t afford but keep looking at anyway.
This raises the question: If they’re so effective, why can’t our devices hypnotize us in a good way? You know, get us to quit smoking and drinking, exercise, eat well and embrace positive thinking. And while we’re at it, maybe they should get us off our screens.

Turns out, a number of hypnotherapy-focused startups think there’s merit to at least some of this idea. Investors do too. Over the past couple years, they’ve backed seed- and early-stage rounds for multiple startups offering tech-enabled hypnosis and hypnotherapy platforms.
Who’s getting funded
Two of the larger funding rounds came this year. Mindset Health, a Melbourne, Australia-based provider of digital hypnotherapy programs, picked up $12 million in Series A financing in March. And Oneleaf, a French startup offering an assortment of self-hypnosis tools, landed a $5.1 million seed round in January.
Using Crunchbase data, we put together a list of six companies formed or funded in the past few years, that list hypnotherapy or hypnosis as a focus area:


Hypnosis business models
Companies are pitching online hypnosis tools to heal ailments of both mind and body. Mindset Health, for instance, currently has hypnotherapy apps addressing irritable bowel syndrome, menopause and smoking cessation. Oneleaf’s programs aim to help us lose weight, reduce stress, build confidence and alleviate pain, among other goals.
It looks like early days when it comes to determining the optimal business model. Oneleaf is taking the all-you-want subscription approach, charging U.S. customers $68 a year for access to its offerings. Mindset, meanwhile, offers subscription plans for each of its programs, and also works with clinicians to incorporate its offerings into treatments.
Another player, Los Angeles-based WellSet, is going the employer-covered route. Earlier this year, the company launched a self-care benefit package that includes self-hypnosis among its offerings. It’s pitching the package as a tool to help employers “address the burnout epidemic.”
VR and visualization
Several other startups, including some heavily funded names, are marketing offerings that share some similarities with hypnotherapy apps but go by different names.
Meditation app and venture-backed unicorn Headspace, for instance, offers guided imagery, a healing practice it says is often interchanged with self-hypnosis and guided meditation, but with its own set of techniques.
Nashville, Tennessee- and Oxford, England-based BehaVR, a provider of virtual reality mental and behavioral health therapeutics, is another one to watch. The company pulled in $13 million in Series B funding in December, in conjunction with a merger with another startup in the space, Oxford VR. Its focus areas include anxiety regulation, pain management and addiction recovery.
More broadly, startups are scaling a number of digital therapeutics offerings with an eye to wellness and mental health. While questions remain about whether health insurers will cover treatments — as evidenced by this year’s bankruptcy by startup pioneer Pear Therapeutics — it’s still clearly a space that’s not going away.
You are your best medicine
Should self-hypnosis and self-guided hypnotherapy apps gain real traction, it’ll give a big boost to proponents of the idea that one’s own mind can sometimes provide more effective therapy than drugs or other, more invasive, treatments.
What’s also interesting about the assortment of early entrants is the degree to which they’re mixing both physical and mental ailments in their hypnosis-focused treatment plans. This may seem a bit surprising to some of us, who could envision hypnotizing our way to lower anxiety, but not, say, less irritated bowels.
If these startups are right, however, our minds could be capable of more powerful acts of healing than we’d previously imagined. Of course, getting our brains fully engaged will first require us to cut out the mindless scrolling.

Author Health Nabbed $115M To Serve Medicare Patients. It’s Not The Only One,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/06/28,"

Health care has always been considered a recession-resistant industry. But when there’s a market downturn and employers cut staff, consumers tighten their belts everywhere — including their employer-funded telehealth perks, meditation app subscriptions or, if they’re unemployed, even seeing a doctor.
Many are also joining federal and state health insurance programs like Medicare, Medi-Cal and Medicaid. And venture firms and startups are taking notice: New health care startups that once vied for the eyes of employers and insurance companies are now targeting these patients.
Enter Author Health, a health care platform for Medicare Advantage recipients. The company launched on Wednesday armed with $115 million in financing from General Atlantic and Flare Capital Partners.

The Boston-based startup creates a team of doctors, nurses, therapists and community health workers for Medicare Advantage recipients with serious mental health disorders. Data from The Commonwealth Fund shows 1 in 4 people with Medicare — those in the U.S. who are age 65 and older, or those with a disability — have a mental illness, but only 40% to 50% receive treatment.
“They end up in inpatient units and emergency departments,” said Dr. Katherine Hobbs, CEO of Author Health. “A lot of that utilization and bad outcomes could be avoided by better care in the community in the outpatient setting.”
Bullish on federal health plans
Given medical advancements, there are more older people in the U.S. today than ever. As of 2022, there are more than 58.6 million people enrolled in Medicare.
So much health care spending has been funneled into government programs that startups are beginning to tap into it. EasyHealth, which raised $135 million in 2021 (per Crunchbase data), acts almost as an insurance brokerage that connects patients with different Medicare plans. Cityblock Health, provider of medical and behavioral care to Medicaid are patients, raised $400 million, also in 2021. Nashville, Tennessee-based CareBridge raised $140 million in 2022 to offer at-home care for state Medicaid beneficiaries. And retirement benefits startup Spark Advisors has raised $13.6 million over the past few years to branch into Medicare.
“Investors recognize the substantial need and also the opportunity that really will only continue to grow as the Medicare population grows,” Hobbs said.
Even Maven Clinic, the fertility platform that launched a direct-to-employer model, raised $90 million in 2022 to tap into Medicaid patient rolls.
“Medicaid is a priority for us. Nearly half of all the babies born in America are born into a Medicaid plan,” Will Porteous, Maven’s chief growth officer, told me last year. “There’s the opportunity to address over half of the babies born in the country, but then, too, oftentimes these are the most underserved communities in the country.”
There’s a catch — companies interested in tapping into Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries have to prove their plans work. Employers are more likely to offer health care-related perks based on how they affect productivity, retention and happiness.
But startups looking to work with insurance providers have a higher bar to meet to prove their work lowers health care spend over time.
“There’s been a lot of investment over the last five years in behavioral health. Most of that investment has gone to mild to moderate conditions,” Hobbs said. “There’s really been very little investment around serious mental illness and substance use disorders.”
Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Cityblock Health worked with Medicare patients, not Medicaid patients. The post has been updated.

Nothing Raises Something — $96M,Chris Metinko,2023/06/28,"

Consumer tech developer Nothing locked up a $96 million funding round just about two weeks ahead of its new smartphone launch.
The new round was led by Highland Europe, with participation from existing investors GV, EQT Ventures and C Capital. Music group Swedish House Mafia also participated.
Nothing, founded in 2020, launched its Phone (1) product last year. Even amid declining cell phone sales, the product sold out and never made the U.S. Its new Phone (2) — set for a July 11 launch — will make the U.S. market and is highly anticipated.

“In just over two years, we’ve assembled one of the strongest teams in the industry and sold over 1.5 million devices worldwide,” co-founder and CEO Carl Pei said in a release. “It’s clear that there’s real demand for an innovative challenger in the consumer tech industry, and with this new round of financing, we’ve never been better positioned to realize our vision to make tech fun again.”
Growing fast
The London-based startup is not small by any means, with more than 450 people across seven offices worldwide. The company made $200 million in revenues in 2022 and is on pace to exceed that this year, TechCrunch reports.
Aside from its phones, the company also has released earbuds and a sound stick. The company has sold more than 1.5 million devices, per the report.
Part of the company’s fast success is undoubtedly due to its engagements with its customers. It has raised nearly $14 million in crowdfunding and attracted more than 8,000 investors in those rounds.
Nothing also has ongoing sustainability initiatives and promises its new phone will have a lower carbon footprint than the first iteration.
Founded in 2020, the company has raised more than $250 million to date, per the company.

Sustainability Funding Sees Only Modest Decline As Urgency Trumps Frugality,Joanna Glasner,2023/06/28,"

Catastrophic climate change projections are only getting more pronounced. And across the globe, overall startup investment is on the decline.
These two trajectories don’t fundamentally have anything to do with each other. The planet doesn’t check startup funding data before deciding how many record heat waves and hurricanes to unleash. And the venture pullback, a comedown from a cyclical bubble, has nothing to do with climate dynamics.
Nonetheless, the chronological overlap of these otherwise unrelated phenomena may help explain why sustainability-focused startup investment has declined this year, but less sharply than in most other sectors. Urgency is higher, but investors’ willingness to spend remains constrained.

The end result? So far in 2023, investors have put just over $17 billion into global seed- through growth-stage financings for sustainability-focused companies, per an analysis of Crunchbase data. That’s on track to come in pretty close to 2021 totals but likely below the record-setting investment tallies of 2022.
For a sense of how investment has unfolded over time, below we chart out annual funding from 2018 till today:


We also tallied U.S. sustainability-focused investment, which follows a similar pattern. Funding for 2023, so far, is on track to come in below the prior peak years:


Active investors
Funding data shows that while the largest global venture investors have pulled back considerably this year, many climate-focused investors remained pretty active. In the U.S. tallies, a handful of investors stood out as particularly busy.
One standout is Lowercarbon Capital. The climate-focused venture firm invested in 12 sustainability-related rounds so far this year, mostly at seed and early stage. The companies it backed collectively raised over $367 million so far in 2023, Crunchbase data shows.
Another major player is Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the greentech fund backed by Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, which joined 11 U.S. rounds this year. This includes last week’s $195 million financing for KoBold Metals, a developer of technology for finding deposits of metals, including rare substances used in EV batteries.
Among up-and-comers, there’s Fifth Wall, a venture firm known for real estate investment that has increasingly taken a role in sustainability-related investments. Per Crunchbase data, five of its 2023 U.S. investments have a sustainability focus, including a $300 million Series B for Our Next Energy, a developer of energy storage for electric vehicles and the grid.
Popular sectors
Across sectors, meanwhile, a few areas stood out as especially attractive among investors. We look at three: solar, waste and wastewater management, and battery tech.
Solar
We’ll start with solar, an area where we see a lot of growth-stage activity. Per Crunchbase data, about $6 billion went into solar-related financings 1 this year, across 79 rounds.
Much of the money went toward private equity investments in building out solar power infrastructure. Notable deals include:

Silicon Ranch, a 12-year-old, Nashville, Tennessee-based company that develops and operates utility scale solar facilities pulled in $375 million in a January financing.


PowerField Netherlands picked up $550 million in February to develop solar parks, solar-powered charging stations and energy storage systems.


Amarenco, of Ireland and France, develops large solar installations and landed $330 million in March.

Recycling, waste management and water treatment
We also saw a fair bit of investment around recycling, waste management and water treatment. Collectively, companies in these categories attracted around $1.1 billion globally in 2023, across 99 rounds.
Some of the larger, standout rounds in this subset include:

Gradiant, a Massachusetts-based developer of advanced water and wastewater treatment technology, closed a $225 million Series D round in May at a $1 billion valuation.


APK, a German startup developing recycling technology for plastic waste, snapped up $140 million in a financing backed by Kirkbi A/S, the family-owned holding and investment company of the LEGO brand.
Mill, a San Bruno, California, startup selling a “food-shrinking, de-stinking” kitchen bin and food waste pick-up service, reportedly raised more than $100 million from backers including Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Energy Impact Partners.

Batteries and energy storage
Battery technology 2 startups also continue to attract significant capital. Per Crunchbase data, over $3.4 billion in venture and growth-stage investment went to battery-related companies globally in 2023. Of these, most had a sustainability angle, such as developing battery tech for EVs or improved storage for energy generated from renewable sources.

Northvolt, a startup whose self-described mission is to deliver batteries with an 80% lower carbon footprint compared to those made using coal energy, picked up $400 million in June, bringing total equity funding to over $5 billion.
Elevate Renewable Energy, a Boston startup looking to build out battery energy storage at large generation facilities, landed $150 million in a January financing.

Neither heartening nor dismal
No sane person expects startups and their backers to single-handedly mitigate the catastrophic effects of climate change and environmental degradation. But it is reasonable to hope for some major contributions from venture-backed entrepreneurs.
Are they as committed as ever to delivering? Looking at the aggregate numbers for sustainability-focused funding, it looks like climate-focused investors remain on track with their mission. And while most generalist funds have pulled back on overall investment, they’re at least still doing sustainability-focused deals. If the market rebounds, we can hope they’ll further up their game.
Methodology
Funding totals are based on the Crunchbase sustainability industry category, with the following Crunchbase Pro query used to generate funding numbers:

Sustainability Industry Funding In 2023

We included both venture and private equity financings in the totals, as many private equity firm investments in the sustainability space can be characterized as growth financings. However, we limited the query to companies founded in the past 20 years to narrow the results to startups and growth companies.

Redpanda’s $100M Raise Reminds Us Of 2021,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/06/27,"

As data streaming becomes more in demand, startups in the sector are getting a boost.
Redpanda Data, a streaming data startup, announced on Tuesday it raised $100 million in Series C funding. The round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, Google Ventures and Haystack.
The San Francisco-based startup provides real-time streaming data services bolstered by the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Using the platform, companies are able to analyze data as soon as it’s collected. Redpanda has amassed a large customer base that spans different sectors, including Cisco, Midjourney, Texas Instruments and Vodafone.
The company says it has enjoyed a healthy fiscal year, which included multiplying its revenue growth 5x over and doubling its workforce. That’s pretty huge — especially at a time when startups are experiencing revenue stress and laying off employees in mass workforce reductions, and very few companies are thriving.

That may be the reason for Redpanda’s oversubscribed raise. The 4-year-old company previously raised a $50 million Series B round just 16 months ago. We haven’t seen many follow-up rounds happen this quickly since the funding boom of 2021 — and look what happened there.
How it works
The platform can be plugged into an open-source streaming API known as Kafka and also can be integrated into companies’ existing cloud networks.
“The hero of the Redpanda story has always been the engineer, hands on keyboard, behind a terminal, materializing her ideas into a working system,” said Alex Gallego, the CEO of Redpanda, in a statement. “That’s who we built Redpanda for, and why we made it easy to use, scalable to double-digit ​​gigabytes per second, and compatible with all the existing applications,”
The platform works by acting as both a data storage system and a data streaming system — using AI and machine learning, companies can integrate their own data into the machine-learning system to bolster responses, or changes. That sort of platform has been increasingly useful for user-facing applications like Midjourney’s AI-generated images, or video game platforms.
“As a new game studio, we needed to build a flexible data platform that empowers our developers to get real-time insights from game events, without having to worry about the backend infrastructure,” Colin Riddell, an executive at Fortis Games, said in a statement. The company is one of Redpanda’s clients.
While Redpanda has managed to keep up the momentum many startups lost in 2021, we’re not likely to see other startups in the same place.

Cyera Nabs $100M To Protect Data,Chris Metinko,2023/06/27,"

Data security startup Cyera raised a $100 million Series B as the cyber industry tries to shake off a funding slowdown through the past few quarters.
The round was led by Accel, with existing investors Sequoia Capital and Cyberstarts, and new investor Redpoint Ventures all taking part.
While data may be king, keeping track of it and securing it can be a pain. That is where Cyera comes in, as the startup offers a platform that helps security teams at companies understand what data they have and how it’s used, as well as how to secure it.

Such platforms can be useful as security teams struggle with growing amounts of data while also often facing staffing issues.
“Cyera’s vision is to enable every business to realize the full potential of their data using AI — collaboration, connection with customers, insights that fuel innovation — to power a new era of development, growth and productivity,” said co-founder and CEO Yotam Segev in a release.
Since closing its Series A last March, the company has realized 800% revenue growth, the company said in the release. Founded in 2020, the company has now raised $164.5 million across three rounds, per Crunchbase.
Funding slowdown
Cyber — normally thought to be pretty resistant to funding slowdowns — has seen a significant dip since the fourth quarter of 2021, per Crunchbase data.
That quarter saw nearly $8.5 billion invested into cyber startups. However, the sector then saw four consecutive quarters of decline before hitting $2.7 billion in the first quarter of this year — a slight uptick from the $2.4 billion in the final quarter of 2022.
However, that first-quarter number represented a 58% drop from the $6.5 billion such startups saw in the same quarter of 2022.
Second-quarter numbers for cyber look even worse with less than a week left.

From AI To SVB And Everything In Between — A Quick Look Back At The First Half Of 2023,Chris Metinko,2023/06/27,"

This article is Part One of our Mid-Year Report, which reviews the first half of 2023 and looks ahead to the rest of the year. In our next installments, we’ll share our IPO predictions and reader survey results, and we’ll also dive deep into trends and data in AI venture funding and their impact.
After a bumpy 2022, there was little reason to believe 2023 would be any smoother in the realm of tech, startups and venture capital.
Through the first six months, the new year has done anything but disappoint on that front.

From crypto contagion to mass layoffs to a banking crisis to — yes — the neverending AI craze, the first half of the year has been a winding ride for venture and startups.
Let’s take a look back.
Crypto in crisis and slowdown
The year started with many folks still trying to wrap their heads around one of the greatest startup implosions of all time: That of crypto exchange FTX. Company founder Sam Bankman-Fried was already facing criminal charges — including fraud — in the collapse of the highly valued company.
FTX and FTX US, its U.S.-based exchange, were valued at $32 billion and $8 billion, respectively, and backed by some of of the biggest names in venture — including Sequoia Capital, NEA, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Insight Partners, Temasek, SoftBank Vision Fund, Thoma Bravo, SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Coinbase Ventures.
Despite the crypto contagion that gripped the industry — with several startups declaring bankruptcy and/or announcing layoffs — the year started with crypto prices actually rising significantly: Ether and Bitcoin were both up more than 50%.
The unexpected price spike seemed to buoy the industry somewhat, and many people saw it as a sign of resilience in crypto, blockchain and all things Web3.
But VC optimism was not running as high. Crypto and nearly any other heavily venture-backed sector continued to show signs that the slowdown of 2022 was lasting into the new year.
Crunchbase numbers at the start of the year showed overall global venture funding in 2022 declined 35% from 2021 to about $445 billion. While still a significant amount of money, it paled next to the $681 billion invested in 2021 — an all-time high — and numbers have not shown any signs of rebounding to those levels.
AI saves the day?
But if there is anything that will help those numbers, it became clear early in the year it would be artificial intelligence.
The seeds of this year’s AI craze were firmly planted in late 2022, when London-based AI-driven visual art startup Stability AI, San Francisco-based AI video and audio editing tool Descript, and Austin, Texas-based AI content platform Jasper all raised big rounds.
However, the even bigger news came just a few days into the new year, when it was reported that OpenAI, the company behind the artificial intelligence tools ChatGPT and DALL-E, could be valued at $29 billion in a new tender offer.
By the end of January, Microsoft confirmed it had agreed to a “multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment” into OpenAI. While the exact dollar amount was not confirmed, Semafor reported earlier that month that Microsoft was in talks to invest as much as $10 billion.
There was no looking back after that for AI, as dozens of startups in the sector — or at the very least claiming to be using AI — raised billions of dollars. Some of the biggest deals included:

A $450 million Series C for Anthropic — a ChatGPT rival with its AI assistant Claude — which reportedly valued the company at $5 billion in May.
A $270 million Series C for Toronto-based Cohere in June that valued the company at $2.2 billion. The startup builds large language models that allow AI to learn from new data, and can be customized and put into applications for features like interactive chat.
In March, San Francisco-based Adept AI raised $350 million in a Series B at a reported post-money valuation of at least $1 billion.

Those rounds were just a sampling of investors’ insatiable appetite for all things AI, as countless other startups raised cash in the sector even as funding continued to dip in almost every other sector.
The AI craze among investors included large corporations and their VC arms. Aside from Microsoft, others including Google, Zoom Ventures, Nvidia, Oracle and Salesforce Ventures 1 all found it hard to say no to big rounds in the AI space.
While it seems a near certainty that the second half of 2023 will be filled with more large fundings at sky-high valuations, talk about the disruptive technology already has turned to regulation due to the possible impact AI could have on everything from jobs and the economy to data and privacy, and even mental health.
Yet another crisis
Not even AI could stop what would come next, as the industry would suffer a most unexpected blow.
On March 9, Silicon Valley Bank — which had relationships with more than half of all venture-backed companies in the U.S. and countless VC firms — saw its stock price plunge after announcing it would sell $2.25 billion worth of stock to shore up its balance sheet.
Even as the bank sought to assure customers all was well, the announcement rocked the venture world and led to concerns about the bank’s liquidity and balance sheet strength.
Customers — including many startups — sought to get their deposits out of the failing bank, with many needing the money just to make upcoming payrolls. The bank’s collapse forced Parker Conrad’s workforce management startup Rippling to raise $500 million in hours so its clients could pay employees as concerns about access to SVB-held funds swirled.
That soon led to a run on withdrawals and an end of what had become the dominant bank for VC-backed startups for the past 40 years, providing banking services for such “up-and-coming” tech companies such as Cisco Systems and Bay Networks back in the day.
SVB’s collapse was in part due to the decline venture had witnessed through the past year-plus. During the 2021 venture capital boom, the bank was flush with cash as private companies raised huge sums of fresh capital at sky-high valuations. But the market slowed with rising interest rates and that cash dried up as deposits by startups dipped. SVB simultaneously made the disastrous decision to invest in long-term, higher-yield bonds, which further hindered its liquidity.
On March 26, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. announced First Citizens BancShares had agreed to buy the loans and deposits of the failed Silicon Valley Bank.
Just like that, a vital pillar in the venture capital ecosystem — known for its vast venture lending practice for startups — was gone after four decades.
A report by the Federal Reserve Board said the collapse was a “textbook case of mismanagement by the bank” and that when the bank’s board and management realized its risk, it did not take the appropriate steps to fix those problems quickly.
Days after regulators issued a report on the historic collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic Bank — with its expanding technology division and serving as the bank of a growing number of startups — also fell into receivership and was quickly sold to JPMorgan Chase.
The two banks’ collapses — the second- (First Republic) and third- (SVB) largest in U.S. history — have changed and likely will continue to change the way startups bank, with many now looking to diversify where they put assets and how they are held.
The failures also will continue to affect how companies can secure venture debt — something more needed now in a slow venture market.
Layoffs and money
As cash has become tighter in tech, one recurring theme from last year through the entire first half of this year has been layoffs.
Since the start of the year, around 150,000 workers at U.S.-based tech companies — or tech companies with a large U.S. workforce — have been laid off in mass job cuts, according to  Crunchbase News’ Tech Layoffs Tracker.
Those layoffs have happened everywhere from big-name public companies including Alphabet, Oracle and Coinbase, to startups like Pendo and Reddit.
Those job cuts probably shouldn’t come as a surprise and likely will continue as the year presses on. VC and growth equity giants including Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global, Khosla Ventures, Insight Partners and many others have substantially slowed their investment pace since the highs of 2021.
That has shown little sign of abating as we move into the second half — although SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son told investors just recently that the Vision Fund unit would shift back to “offense mode” and is looking at being the leader in the AI revolution.
Perhaps AI alone can boost VC numbers and get investors back to putting big cash in startups. But more likely the focus the public market has seen shift back to profitability and cash flow will continue to make VCs look less at rapid growth and the big money valuations that come with those numbers.
Nevertheless, the venture and startups sectors have shown amazing resilience amid layoffs, less money and multiple crises.
It’s likely VC and private tech companies will have to continue to show that resilience in the second half of 2023.

Databricks Buys Generative AI Startup MosaicML For $1.3B,Chris Metinko,2023/06/26,"

Databricks, the data storage and management startup last valued at $38 billion, signed a definitive agreement to acquire OpenAI competitor MosaicML for $1.3 billion.
MosaicML, a San Francisco-based generative AI platform, had raised $64 million to date since launching in 2021, per reports. Its investors included DCVC, Lux Capital and Playground Global.
MosaicML allows customers to build generative AI tools using its own proprietary data — eliminating the need for users to incorporate their own data with OpenAI’s proprietary models that use public data.

“Every organization should be able to benefit from the AI revolution with more control over how their data is used. Databricks and MosaicML have an incredible opportunity to democratize AI,” said Ali Ghodsi, Databricks’ co-founder and CEO, in a release.
Getting bigger
San Francisco-based Databricks last raised in 2021, locking up a $1.6 billion Series H led by Morgan Stanley’s Counterpoint Global at a $38 billion valuation — making it one of the most valuable private companies in the world.
The deal for MosaicML could be another step toward the public market for the decacorn, as it looks to expand its portfolio of offerings and cash in on an exploding AI market.
While the Databricks deal is one of the first big M&A transactions in the AI space this year, the sector has seen a flood of funding dollars invested in it. 
In January, Microsoft invested $10 billion in OpenAI. In March, San Francisco-based Adept AI raised $350 million in a Series B at a reported post-money valuation of at least $1 billion. In May, Anthropic — a ChatGPT rival with its AI assistant Claude — raised a $450 million Series C that reportedly valued the company at $5 billion.
And that is only a handful of the funding deals the AI has seen since the beginning of the year.
Databricks just recently talked about surpassing a milestone of $1 billion in annual revenue and has talked about a potential IPO in the past. 
Founded in 2013, Databricks has raised more than $3.5 billion, per Crunchbase. Its investors include Andreessen Horowitz, NEA, T. Rowe Price, BlackRock and many others.

How Early Zoom Investor TSVC Finds ‘Defensible’ Seed Startups To Back,Gené Teare,2023/06/26,"

The rapid deployment of AI across industries in recent months suits the longtime talents of TSVC, a seed investor in deep tech companies where AI coupled with domain expertise has led to breakthroughs. 
The firm invests very early in companies with technology that can be challenging to understand. Its investment focus is in deep tech in semiconductor materials and robotics companies, in healthtech companies and also in the data economy, which includes AI. 
Founded by Eugene Zhang and Chun Xia in 2010, the firm has built an impressive portfolio of more than 200 companies in its 13 years of operation. 

TSVC’s four general partners have operating experience as well as engineering backgrounds. Alongside the general partners, the firm evaluates companies with the technical knowledge of its 14 venture partners, many of them founders and tech executives with Ph.D.s. 
It led the seed round in Zoom in 2011. It also invested early in now public companies Ginkgo Bioworks, Carta, Quanergy and in Zum transportation, a growing private company that rethinks student transportation. 
We spoke with TSVC partner Spencer Greene on the firm’s deep tech successes, its approach to investing at seed, and the AI investment boom. Greene joined TSVC in 2020 and leads the firm’s health practice. 
Spencer Greene, a partner at TSVC
For Greene, it’s not enough for a startup’s technology to be innovative today. He wants to know: How will that tech hold up years from now? Can it fight off competitors and copycats?
 The majority of the firm’s portfolio companies have an AI component — but that’s not enough.
“I spend more time and energy looking for defensibility than what we used to,” Greene said. “AI needs to be coupled with something else to make it hard enough, because it’s going to be transformative for so many industries.”  
Betting on AI
TSVC invests in a startup’s team, product or technology, and then market size.
“I think AI is, for most businesses, table stakes,” said Greene. “AI and some other technologies together have made barriers to entry lower in many situations. That can be a good thing if you’re an early-stage startup — you can attack incumbents who are much larger than you, and you can get to market very quickly. But it can also make it harder to build a sustainable business because you can be vulnerable just as easily to someone else who comes after you.”
In the health care sector, for example, Greene said investors understand that AI will be able to read X-rays and pathology slides better than a doctor. However, once this technology is FDA-approved, it might not be defensible as a technology unless the startup has a unique and large dataset that creates some differentiation. 
TSVC applies the same principles to its other sectors, such as the AI and robotic space, where the firm has been active lately. There is a ton of innovation happening in computer vision, Greene said. 
The firm’s portfolio companies include:

Computer vision companies and robotics company Beagle Technology, which prunes grapevines without destroying crops.
eBots, a precision manufacturing company that uses 3-D vision useful for building smartphones that require many manual assembly steps — a technology that was not possible only a few years ago.
Automat Solutions, which uses AI to discover alternate materials for the lithium battery market. Automat’s AI engine predicts suitable materials, which are then tested in a lab for the ability to store more energy or charge faster or maintain cooler temperatures. This learning then gets fed back into new predictive models.
Reema Health, which aims to keep Medicaid patients healthy and out of the hospital — something that would have an enormous impact, according to Greene.
Preveta, which provides specialty health care coordination, saving on costs — and highlighting TSVC’s interest in startups that tackle inefficiencies in the health care space.

Early Zoom
When TSVC first invested in Zoom, it was not at all clear that the company could succeed in a competitive market for web-conferencing. 
TSVC’s Zhang met Zoom founder Eric Yuan through an organization for Chinese tech professionals in the Bay Area. At the time, Zoom was focused on the consumer market, creating a “poor man’s telepresence” via a Facebook plugin. 
TSVC wasn’t sure if the consumer approach would work, but Yuan had experience in the sector. He had left online conferencing company Webex — then owned by Cisco — frustrated by what he saw as lack of innovation. Yuan hired a team of engineers who invented a new codec that improved the audio and video quality in conference calls with better compression technology. 
The underlying technology was important to its success alongside the intuitive interface that Zoom is known for. 
Zhang led TSVC’s investment in Zoom, a seed round of $3 million in 2011 that valued the company at $15 million. Afterward, he noticed that on a flight using Wi-Fi that while his Skype call didn’t hold up, the Zoom call did. 
The pre-A stage
The seed market has changed, Greene said. “I hadn’t heard the term pre-A hardly at all until lately, and now I seem to hear it all the time.” 
Companies that manage to raise Series A funding are spending a longer time to get there, according to a recent analysis of Crunchbase data. 
This has given rise to seed extension rounds, a signal the valuation is flat from a prior funding typically two years ago. And when a company is raising pre-A it reads as there is a little step up in valuation. But overall they are both saying they are not yet ready for a Series A funding. 
Still, TSVC has not seen a decline in the number of companies pitching for funding. “We are seeing much more reasonableness on valuations. There was a point in time where it kind of went crazy,” he said.  
Initial check size for the firms these days is $500,000 to $1 million with reserves for follow-on funding, according to Greene.
TSVC co-invests in seed rounds that are typically $3 million to $6 million but can be around $2 million as well.  The firm’s valuations for seed deals are typically around $10 million, $15 million or, on the higher end, $20 million.
Greene predicts that amid turmoil in the tech world, there are opportunities for very early-stage investors like TSVC. “Some of the layoffs in Big Tech have been pulling back their moonshot projects, and essentially ceding territory back to venture,” he said.

"The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Aledade Rolls Up Huge Round, KoBold Metal Mines Big Money",Chris Metinko,2023/06/23,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.

After a slow week last week, there was a slight pickup in top-dollar rounds, with three hitting nine figures. Health care — or health care-adjacent — companies saw big money, taking three of the four top spots this week, with the second place round minting a new mining unicorn. That’s out of the ordinary, but the venture market has a way of being unpredictable.
1. Aledade, $260M, health care: Health care companies hit it big this week and none bigger than Aledade. The Bethesda, Maryland-based company raised a $260 million Series F led by new investor Lightspeed Venture Partners. The round comes just about a year after it locked up a $123 million Series E. The startup provides doctors’ offices with data analytics software so they can better manage their patients and identify those most at risk. The company plans to use the new cash to beef up its services and technology, possibly with acquisitions. The new funding deal values the company at $3.5 billion, Bloomberg reported. Founded in 2014, the company has raised nearly $678 million, per Crunchbase.
2. KoBold Metals, $195M, mining: What happens when you combine AI with the material needed for lithium-ion batteries and AI? You get big money. Berkeley, California-based KoBold Metals raised a $195 million round this week led by T. Rowe Price, and included a number of big-name investors such as Andreessen Horowitz, and Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos-backed Breakthrough Energy Ventures. The new cash values the climate-tech startup at $1.15 billion. KoBold Metals uses artificial intelligence to mine for valuable metals such as cobalt, copper, nickel and lithium used in the production of batteries for a variety of sectors, including electric vehicles. The startup has built a database about the Earth’s layers and uses algorithms to make predictions about where mineral deposits are around the world. KoBold Metals isn’t new to big rounds. In February 2022, the startup closed a $192.5 million Series B, which included investment from Apollo Projects, Bond Capital, BHP Group and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Founded in 2018, the company has now raised more than $400 million, per Crunchbase.
3. HighFive Healthcare, $100M, dental: Dental health startups don’t usually make this list, but then again they don’t usually raise $100 million. However, HighFive did just that, closing a $100 million growth investment led by Norwest. The Birmingham, Alabama-based company enables a network of dental offices to centralize their operations — saving money and letting doctors focus on patients and not office operations. The company saw tremendous growth last year, doubling its practice size through acquisitions and organic growth. Founded in 2018, the company has now raised more than $102 million, per Crunchbase.
4. DexCare, $75M, health care: Yes, another health care startup high on the list. Seattle-based DexCare closed a $75 million Series C led by Iconiq Growth. The company’s software helps health systems manage their capacity and appointment booking while getting patients to the care they need. Its platform allows health providers to serve patients faster, and to manage the supply and demand of digital-care access. Founded in 2021, DexCare has raised $146 million, per the company.
5. Attovia Therapeutics, $60M, biotech: Only one biotech in the top five this week — which has become rare, as the space has witnessed some large raises of late. Fremont, California-based Attovia Therapeutics, which is developing biotherapeutics for immune-mediated disease and cancer, raised a $60 million Series A led by Frazier Life Sciences. The company plans to use the new cash to further advance its drug and platform development focusing on immunology and oncology. This is the company’s first outside raise, per Crunchbase.
6. Limble CMMS, $58M, information technology: Lehi, Utah-based Limble, which develops computerized maintenance management software, raised a $58 million Series B led by the growth equity business within Goldman Sachs. Founded in 2015, the company has now raised nearly $77 million, per Crunchbase data.
7. AltPep, $53M, biotech: Seattle-based AltPep, which is developing early disease-modifying treatments and detection tools for amyloid diseases, closed a $52.9 million Series B led by Senator Investment Group. Founded in 2018, the company has raised $76 million, per Crunchbase data.
8. (tied) Empress Therapeutics, $50M, biotech: Cambridge, Massachusetts-based oral medicine developer Empress Therapeutics closed a $50 million round from Flagship Pioneering. This is the company’s first outside funding, per Crunchbase.
8. (tied) PM Pediatric Care, $50M, health care: Long Island, New York-based PM Pediatric Care, a pediatric urgent care network, locked up a $50 million Series E led by Scopia Capital. Founded in 2005, the company has raised $64 million, per Crunchbase.
8. (tied) Render, $50M, cloud infrastructure: San Francisco-based Render, a cloud provider for application developers, closed a $50 million Series B led by Bessemer Venture Partners. Founded in 2018, the company has now raised nearly $77 million, per Crunchbase.
Big global deals
Despite the big rounds in the U.S. this week, Asia and Europe both had bigger.

China-based Langlai Technology, a clinical-stage innovative drug research and development company, raised a $500 million round.
Sweden-based Northvolt, a battery manufacturer for electric vehicles, industrial systems and energy storage systems, raised a $400 million private equity round.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of June 17 to June 23. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

Boom-Era Excesses Haunt The Ghost Kitchen Space,Joanna Glasner,2023/06/23,"

It’s no surprise that the pandemic coincided with the rise in enthusiasm and financing for virtual kitchen startups.
With restaurant dining largely closed, takeout was the only option for a while. Even when dining-in was back, one typically had to submit to masking protocols and/or worry about COVID 19 risk.
It was a perfect time to experiment with ordering delivery from a new place. And since no one cared about decor or customer seating, delivery-only kitchens — often called ghost kitchens, cloud kitchens or virtual kitchens — sounded like a good idea.

Startup investors certainly thought so. Top-funded companies in the ghost kitchen space raised more than $3 billion in venture financing between 2020 and 2022, per Crunchbase data. 
The two top recipients alone — Miami upstart Reef Technology and Uber founder Travis Kalanick’s CloudKitchens — pulled in over $2.75 billion. 1
Fast-forward to 2023, and for those of us luxuriating with a paper menu for a sit-down meal, this seems like a bygone era. Yeah, ghost kitchens are still a thing. But the market isn’t growing like it used to. 
Turns out that while people don’t want to return to the office, they do want to get back to the restaurant. Moreover, eateries that survived the pandemic largely did so by upping their takeout game, delivery and drive-through options. Ghost kitchens, meanwhile, have fallen out of investors’ favor, most notably in the U.S..
Cloud kitchen startups down from sky-high heights
To illustrate, we used Crunchbase data to put together a sample set of 14 of the more prominent funded companies in the cloud kitchen space:


The list includes six U.S.-based companies, none of which has raised a round since 2021. It’s unclear when they’re likely to do so again.
Reef Technology, which raised $1.5 billion in two rounds led or co-led by SoftBank in late 2018 and 2020, looks especially underwater. 
After starting out as a parking facility operator, Reef pivoted hard into filling those spaces with mobile kitchens that could cook up food for delivery. The shift hit some hurdles post-pandemic, however, with Reef reportedly laying off hundreds of staff in 2022, following a massive growth spurt. It is now reportedly working with restructuring advisers. 
A further blow came last month, when Wendy’s reportedly axed the entire U.S. ghost kitchen business it launched with the company. Nearly two years earlier, the two announced a partnership to open up to 700 locations by 2025.
Kalanick’s CloudKitchens, meanwhile, is holding up, albeit with challenges. The company reportedly carried out layoffs in 2022. However, it is expanding in some areas, as evidenced by a partnership with Starbucks reported earlier this month.
Other ghost kitchen operators are quiet lately. C3, a platform pairing chefs with takeout businesses, hasn’t made a new announcement on its website since January 2022.
The takeaway: Be wary of overconfident futurists
The cloud kitchen trajectory shares much in common with other areas, like e-scooters and connected fitness, where projections for consumer adoption did not pan out in the real world.
It cautions us that rosy-sounding forecasts ought not to be mistaken with actual reality.
For ghost kitchen operators, challenges include space constraints, quality control and difficulty building a brand that resonates without a storefront presence. Consumers have also grown increasingly weary of additional fees associated with delivery that make the price of say, a simple burger and fries, more than the budget allows.
That said, ghost kitchens do still fill a niche. For instance, they offer a lower-cost option for launching a new food business or expanding kitchen space of a growing business to handle delivery demand. And while a sit-down dinner at a trendy restaurant has its appeal, there are still those times when we pine for the convenience of delivery.

Robinhood Eyes Banking Market With $95M Credit Card Acquisition,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/06/22,"

Robinhood, the stocks trading platform that was once geared for novices, is slowly making its way into banking.
The company announced on Thursday it acquired X1, a credit card startup, for $95 million in cash. The deal is expected to close by the third quarter of 2023.

X1 is a no-fee credit card company that deals its credit based on the person’s income. And it fits in well with Robinhood’s brand of providing easy-to-understand financial products for someone new to building their personal wealth.
Last year the company introduced a no-fee debit card that integrated with its stock investment app. Users could round up their purchases to the nearest dollar and invest that extra change into the public markets.
“This acquisition will bring us closer towards our goal of serving the entirety of our customers’ critical financial needs,” Vlad Tenev, CEO and co-founder of Robinhood, said in a statement.
X1 co-founders Deepak Rao and Siddharth Batra will stay on at the company and oversee the credit card arm of Robinhood’s expanding business.
The acquisition of X1 is a step forward for Robinhood, which was marred by controversy in the last two years. Robinhood was at the center of the meme stocks controversy in 2021 when users banded together to inflate the stock price of gaming retailer GameStop for, you know, fun. The move cost Robinhood $1.4 billion.
Earlier this year, the company announced it would also cancel its plan to buy the UK-based crypto startup Ziglu. The plan was in the works for more than a year, but following the crypto crash of 2022, Robinhood backed out and owed around $12 million in impairment charges.
This also may be a harbinger of good times for the fintech industry, which saw a massive rise in popularity in 2021 thanks to cryptocurrency platforms, buy-now-pay-later startups and new banking systems.
Only two companies, including Robinhood, successfully went public. Most of them, notably Stripe, are still flailing around in the private markets as venture funding continues to move sparingly. Global funding in the fintech space dipped 40% year over year, per Crunchbase data.

These Are The Sectors Where Hot Seed-Stage Startups Are Clustering In 2023,Joanna Glasner,2023/06/22,"

Seed-stage companies are a lot like grapes. They tend to form in bunches.

The clustering effect is clear in this year’s vintage of seed-funded startups. A handful of categories accounted for an outsized number of investments.
What were some of the standout areas? Using Crunchbase data, we scoured through hundreds of the largest seed and pre-seed rounds in 2023 1 to identify trends. The following is an assortment of a few that stood out, from AI assistants to clean power to esports.
No. 1: Generative AI
Of course, we couldn’t make a list of trendy seed-stage categories without including Generative AI.
So here it is. Below, we put together a sample set of 16 companies in the space that raised seed funding this year, in categories from coding to insurance underwriting to identifying AI-generated text.
 


 
The biggest funding recipient, Seattle-based XetHub, pitches itself as a platform for developing Generative AI apps and pulled in $7.5 million from VC firm Madrona in January.
Several other list members, meanwhile, are developing AI assistants. NinjaTech AI is working on a “personal assistant” focused on automating admin tasks like meeting scheduling and inbox management. Portrait Analytics is targeting investment research. And Altius is working on AI tech support.
Another interesting startup that made the list is GPTZero, a ChatGPT detection tool that a Princeton University student built out of his dorm room. A few months later, after amassing 1.2 million users, GPTZero also picked up $3.5 million in seed funding.
No. 2: Power Generation
Modern life consumes copious amounts of power. To wit, considerable sums of venture capital have gone over the years toward developing energy sources that are greener, cheaper, and more easily deployable.
At the seed stage, it’s clear appetites for next-gen energy technology remain robust. We identified a list of several companies that have raised some of the year’s larger seed rounds:


Renaissance Fusion, a French magnetic confinement fusion startup, was the top fundraiser, pulling in $16 million in a January financing led by LowerCarbon Capital. Next was Burbank, California-based Terraform Industries, which has raised $11 million toward its goal of scaling technology to produce cheap natural gas with sunlight and air.
Fusion-focused startups accounted for about half of the seed investment on our list, marking the continuation of an ongoing trend. While fusion energy — created when two atoms are merged — has been talked about for a century, many feel that recent advancements have made commercialization something that could be years away and no longer decades.
No. 3: Esports
Esports and online sports forums are a growth industry, and that’s driving investment at the seed stage.
Using Crunchbase data, we identified at least eight companies funded this year that raised $3 million or more in seed funding for online sports-related endeavors:


San Francisco-based Matchday stands out as the most heavily funded name on the list, with $21 million in backing from investors including Soccer legend Lionel Messi’s Play Time investment vehicle. The company plans to combine Web3 and mobile gaming for an online soccer platform.
Blacktop Hoops, a VR basketball game, also picked up a good-sized $5.1 million in seed funding from investors including Twitch co-founder Kevin Lin.
Meanwhile, the global esports market size is projected to multiply. While the industry was valued around $1.4 billion last year, its forecast to grow to $4.5 billion by 2030, per a recent report published by Cognitive Market Research.
No. 4: The Future Of (Finding) Work
Quite a bit of seed financing is also going toward tools and platforms aimed at filling jobs.
In our sample set, we feature 11 companies that raised seed rounds this year in categories ranging from construction work planning to cannabis industry recruitment to recruiter productivity tools.
 


 
The most heavily funded of the bunch is Rivet, a Detroit-based startup developing software for construction contractors to manage and schedule crews. Most recently, it pulled in a $5.3 million February financing led by Defy.vc.
Not surprisingly, several startups also touted their artificial intelligence focus. Sinecure.ai describes itself as an AI-powered industry specific talent acquisition tool. Moonhub boasts of the “cutting-edge AI and automation solutions” it pairs with recruiting expertise to help you help companies with hiring. And Engin Sciences, prominent in cannabis industry hiring, calls itself an “AI-powered recruitment software startup.”
Notably, one area that did not look popular for seed funding was tech industry recruiting. With the industry hit hard by layoffs and falling valuations, it appears this isn’t a favored theme currently for first-time funding.
What’s not hot
As we look at hot seed funding sectors for 2023, it’s hard not to also observe the opposite: What’s not getting funded.
While it’s rare to see a broad sector that’s completely fallen out of favor, certainly some of the hotter areas in 2020-22 no longer seem so appealing. This includes alternative proteins, consumer products, fast delivery, e-commerce aggregators, and cannabis companies.
Luckily, seed-stage founders are a resilient group. Those who get funded know how to craft a pitch that resonates with the times.
*Survey was limited to companies founded no earlier than 2019 that raised $100,000 or more in seed or pre-seed funding.

"
SoftBank Shifting Back To ‘Offense’ When It Comes to Investing — Thanks To AI,Chris Metinko,2023/06/21,"

That didn’t take too long.

Just more than a year ago, SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son told investors there will be stricter investing criteria moving forward and a more defensive posture after SoftBank’s Vision Fund unit suffered massive losses.
His tune was very different at this week’s shareholders’ annual general meeting, where he said the firm would shift from “defense mode” to “offense mode” and is looking at being the leader in the AI revolution.
“Now, the time has come to shift to offense mode,” Son said.
Son hedged his bets just a month ago, when he said the Japan-based investment giant would play both offense and defense as it sees significant opportunities in the rise of generative AI.
A good cry
Son spoke very emotionally during the shareholders meeting about dealing with an internal struggle covering what he wanted to do in his remaining year. He said he realized he wanted to be an “architect to build the future of humankind.” 
He said he has cried for years when thinking about his future and what he wanted to do with the time he has left. However, the recent advances in artificial intelligence has rekindled his desire for investing in technology — and he particularly referenced conversing with generative AI language processing platform ChatGPT to discuss his ideas and thoughts.
He said he was heartened by those conversations and when the platform told him those ideas were feasible.
Investing
Now the question is can ChatGPT or any AI help SoftBank with its losses.
In May, SoftBank’s Vision Fund unit — known for its investment in startups including Uber, WeWork and DoorDash — reported losses of $32 billion for its fiscal year ended March 31 as startups continue to see their valuations slashed.
The loss is a significant increase from the more than $19 billion loss the unit suffered last year.
In response to those losses and a shifting market, SoftBank substantially cut back the cash it has deployed. In Q1 of fiscal year 2021, the segment made $15.6 billion in investments, but in the most recent quarter it only deployed $400 million in capital. In the last three quarters it has only invested $1 billion total.

Corporates Are Getting Aggressive In AI Deals — Who Could Be Next?,Chris Metinko,2023/06/21,"

Late last month, we took a look at the plethora of artificial intelligence funding deals some of the world’s biggest tech companies and their venture arms have been taking part in for the last several years.
That has seemed only to accelerate this month, as Salesforce Ventures 1 — Salesforce’s venture arm — announced it will double the size of its Generative AI Fund to $500 million just three months after establishing it. That was followed by AI startup Synthesia raising a $90 million Series C at a $1 billion valuation that included an investment from NVentures — Nvidia’s venture capital arm.

However, while everyone already knows Nvidia and Microsoft are making strong bids to be dominant players in the AI ecosystem with their startup investments, there are several other tech giants that also quietly have placed some bets in AI and others who have made surprisingly few.
Let’s take a look at some companies and their VC arms not covered last month and what they’ve done:
Qualcomm Ventures
Nvidia isn‘t the only U.S.-based semiconductor giant that has been looking at AI startups for the last handful of years.
Qualcomm Ventures, Qualcomm’s investment arm, has taken part in 34 funding deals since the start of 2019 involving startups using AI, per Crunchbase data.
The firm’s most active year was — not shockingly — 2021 when it invested in nine startups using AI. That included taking part in a $235 million Series C investment in Israel-based AnyVision — now called Oosto – a vision AI and facial recognition company. Those nine deals totaled $714 million in total (although Qualcomm Ventures’ stake is not known).
This year, the venture arm has made four deals in the AI space, including investing in Union City, California-based DeepHow, which develops an AI-powered learning platform for manufacturing and repair, and Brazil-based Aravita, which uses AI to try to solve waste issues.
Those deals this year, however, have been relatively small, totalling only $37 million.
Cisco Investments
Few corporate VC arms are as old as Cisco Investments — founded 30 years ago — and few have the breadth of their investment portfolio.
For some reason it is sometimes easy to pass over the networking giant and its VC arm, but they don’t overlook much — including AI. Just this week, Cisco Systems launched its own networking chips for AI supercomputers that would compete with offerings from the likes of Broadcom and others.
While not nearly as active as some other VC arms, Cisco Investments has made eight different deals that would fall into the AI sector, per Crunchbase data.
Its most recent deals include participating in a $4.7 million round for Israel-based Voiceitt, an automatic speech recognition technology platform last December, as well as a huge $140 million Series D for Palo Alto, California-based Uniphore, a startup specializing in conversational automation, in March 2021.
The deals the investment arm participated in last year totaled $78 million — actually down from 2021 when it took part in two rounds that totaled $160 million.
Amazon Alexa Fund
Another company one would logically think has its eye on AI would be retail and web giant Amazon. However, for the most part Amazon and its AWS division have only made a select few investments in AI-related startups. 
However, its Alexa Fund has been quite active in making AI deals — participating in 20 different rounds since the start of 2019, per Crunchbase data.
The fund has not made any deals this calendar year, but made a handful even last year, including participating in a $55 million Series D for Irvine, California-based Syntiant, a deep learning tech company that develops AI voice and sensor solutions, in March 2022.
That same month, the fund also participated in a $24 million Series A in London-based Logically. The startup uses artificial intelligence and expert analysts to detect and assess disinformation that can harm companies and governments.
The deals the fund participated in last year totaled $85 million.
The others
Some other big tech goliaths also have made a select few deals in the AI space — although logic would dictate they will make more.
Social media and advertising giant Meta made a handful of deals between 2021-22, but none this year, per Crunchbase data.
However, its deals were rather intriguing. Meta took part in a $19 million Series A for Paris-based PhotoRoom, an AI-enabled image capturing app which creates studio-quality product pictures.
Meta also was included in Mountain View, California-based Inworld AI’s $7.2 million seed round. The metaverse startup is a developer platform for AI-driven virtual characters and immersive realities.
Oracle is another company that has not made too much noise investing in AI startups through the years, but the company did make a couple this year — its only, per Crunchbase data.
Most notably, Oracle took part in Toronto-based Cohere’s $270 million round in May. The startup’s AI platform competes with OpenAI.
It also took part in a pre-seed round for New Haven, Connecticut-based ChestAi, which provides AI-based image analysis for chest diseases. ChestAi:
Just like the other companies and VC arms mentioned above, expect the number — and value — of the AI deals the likes of Meta and Oracle will participate in to significantly increase in the coming months.

Cleareye.AI Secures Funding From JPMorgan,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/06/20,"

Cleareye.AI, a digital trading fintech platform, announced on Tuesday it received a strategic investment from JP Morgan, though the financial terms were not made public by either party.

Cleareye.AI, which automates the trade compliance and operations systems for companies, entered into a commercial partnership with JPMorgan back in September in which the banking institution would use Cleareye’s software to manage compliance risks.
Cleareye’s software uses algorithms to quickly analyze documents and data transactions and remove many of the manual checks that need to be done by banking institutions to authorize certain transactions.
By automatically validating the data, banking institutions can expedite the flow of trade while keeping an eye out for signs of money laundering or signs that a company is circumventing sanctions. Trade financing right now is often slowed significantly by analog processes that involve multiple people to look at and assess documents.
James Fraser, Global Head of Trade & Working Capital for JP Morgan, called the trade financing world “a manually intensive industry loaded with paper and lacking standardization, burdened by an increasing cost base” that “needs real innovation in order to transform.”
Accessing credit often takes companies weeks to access because of this process, which bottlenecks the business pipeline.
Some companies have aimed to solve this problem in a different way. Buy Now Pay Later companies, which have often been consumer focused (think Klarna) or focused on small businesses, are looking to provide similar services for large, multinational corporations. Santander Bank, for instance, announced a BNPL product for companies back in January, which would allow them to access a line of credit quickly.
Banks are quickly adopting similar strategies to JP Morgan in an attempt to keep up with the fast-paced nature of digital banking. Because banks require more security and have to follow stricter compliance guidelines than other industries, financial institutions are looking for niche products that automate processes quickly without risking security.

Mining Startup KoBold Metals Hits Unicorn Status After $195M Raise,Chris Metinko,2023/06/20,"

Startups hitting the magical $1 billion unicorn valuation is not rare — however, it’s not usually a mining company.

Nevertheless, Berkeley, California-based KoBold Metals pulled off the feat after a $195 million raise from a number of big-name investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, and Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos-backed Breakthrough Energy Ventures. 
The new cash values the climate-tech startup at $1.15 billion.
The round — first reported by The Wall Street Journal — was led by T. Rowe Price. The total funding amount was reported by Axios.
Hot trends
KoBold Metals has tied two hot trends together for investors — artificial intelligence and alternative energy sources.
The company uses artificial intelligence to mine for valuable metals such as cobalt, copper, nickel and lithium used in the production of batteries for a variety of sectors, including electric vehicles. The startup has built a database about the Earth’s layers and uses algorithms to make predictions about where mineral deposits are around the world.
The company plans on using the new funding to develop copper reserves in Zambia. Last December, KoBold agreed to invest $150 million to buy a controlling stake in the large, undeveloped copper reserves.
It has 60 continuing exploration projects in North America, Africa and Australia, per the WSJ.
“The success rates of finding new deposits have been declining,” co-founder and CEO Kurt House told the WSJ. “It’s hard to see how in the current setup we’ll get sufficient discoveries in time without breakthroughs in technology.” 
Big money
KoBold Metals isn’t new to big rounds. In February 2022, the startup closed a $192.5 million Series B, which included investment from Apollo Projects, Bond Capital, BHP Group and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.
Founded in 2018, the company has now raised more than $400 million.

This Generative AI Company Doesn’t Want To Be Called A Generative AI Company,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/06/20,"

Recently, a couple of venture capitalists knocked on Ben Pham’s door to hear a pitch on his new advertising startup named Obello.
Pham had decades of experience in advertising with Character, a branding agency he co-founded with Oliver Ralph that worked closely with the likes of Apple, Netflix and Facebook. After selling the company to marketing giant Dentsu, Pham and Ralph were working on a new generative AI product.
The first line of the pitch deck read, “Obello: An AI-powered graphic design platform.”
“I visually saw them recoil in their seats and roll their eyes, because they had been beaten over the head by so many companies saying ‘AI-powered’ [or] ‘powered by AI,’” Ralph said.

That’s not surprising. After ChatGPT took the world by storm in November, generative AI startups began popping up left and right. Venture firms were enamored with it — around 10% of global startup funding last year went to AI companies, according to Crunchbase data.
We’re on track to outpace that: So far in 2023, 15% of all startup funding has gone to AI-focused startups.
But the dust is beginning to settle, and some venture firms are getting skeptical of startups that claim to power their platforms using generative AI and large language models.
“The word is hurting us more than helping us pave the way, because the promise hasn’t been delivered,” Pham said.
Genesis of Obello
Pham’s previous startup Character built cohesive design packages for startups and legacy companies, which included tone, color, typography and logos. Character sent this package to its clients’ brand and marketing teams to turn those pieces into emails, landing pages, Instagram stories, Facebook posts and vertical ads.
“One of the challenges that we witnessed for companies of all sizes is that the designers and the marketers are struggling to keep up with the increased demands placed,” Pham said. “Modern brands have to be omnipresent and, as a result, they have to create a lot of marketing content.”
Their new venture Obello takes those brand ingredients, organizes them on its platform, and uses its in-house generative AI to create content based on what platform it will live on, what dimensions it needs to be, and even what tone the company wants to set — it can be “playful” or “understated.”
Traditional workflows, Pham said, “pull designers away from doing other more conceptual, creative work within their organization.”
How AI lost investors
While Obello may sound like a promising concept, it’s simply one of many new generative AI startups to investors.
A ton of generative AI startups build intuitive UI designs that sit on top of APIs from the likes of ChatGPT. These companies don’t have their own proprietary language models or data sets.
“You’re building basically something that is not super defensible and is easy to be replicated by another market entrant,” said Pasha Tinkov, co-founder of Audeo Ventures. He met with the Obello team. “It’s not a great business case to be investing into.”
For those companies, it’s hard to develop long-term business strategies that will net investors multiples on their investments. It also makes them — and those that use them — vulnerable to potential legal ramifications, compliance roadblocks and copyright issues in the future. (AI art tools like Midjourney are already being hit with copyright lawsuits for stealing from artists.)
“I can’t use a part of someone else’s IP because the harm, from a reputational point of view and a monetary point of view, for big brands is going to be huge if they’re discovered using or plagiarizing other people’s IP,” said Eric Hippeau, co-founder of VC firm Lerer Hippeau.
As a result, investors have been more skeptical about the long-term viability of generative AI.
Self-funding a new company
When Ralph and Pham began Obello in April 2022, the economic situation was bleak. Private-market funding was drying up, interest rates soared and private companies were grappling with sky-high valuations.
“What’s required from companies today is they have to be fiscally responsible,” Pham said.  “What’s important for us is to build a product first.”
Startups in most industries aren’t getting the same love as AI. Mistral AI, a startup founded in May, managed to raise $113 million despite not having any sort of product.
“Let’s say we went to a VC and they’re like, ‘Oh my goodness, this is generative AI. You’re training a model. Let me value your company at $25 million,’” Ralph said. “Then we have to actually deliver, to perform as a $25 million company. And that’s a huge burden to carry.”
While most startups are facing a valuation reckoning, and venture firms say they’re course-correcting, it seems like the AI hype is following in the footsteps of crypto and Web3.
“We’re happy that we’re in the right space at the right time,” Ralph said. “But also we don’t want to set ourselves up for failure in the future.”

The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Madhive Tops In Very Slow Week,Chris Metinko,2023/06/16,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.

This week in venture can be described in two simple words — slow and quiet. Only one company saw a nine-figure round — and that oddly was an advertising startup. Aside from that, rounds were on the smaller side, with it taking only $25 million to make this list. The “June Gloom” seemed to hit VC this week.
1. Madhive, $300M, adtech: Advertising software companies rarely make it this high on the list, but that fact didn’t stop Madhive. The New York-based firm raised $300 million from Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which valued the company at $1 billion, per Axios. The deal gives Goldman a minority stake in the company. Launched in 2015 at Otter TV, Madhive sells its CTV (connected TV) advertising software platform to local TV companies that sell CTV ads. The company already has $100 million, per the Axios report.
2. Tomorrow.io, $87M, environmental consulting: Climate changes and weather-related issues continue to dominate the news. Tomorrow.io is hoping to let people know of those problems earlier, and locked up an $87 million Series E led by Activate Capital to that end. The company has built a weather intelligence and climate adaptation platform — which includes a weather and climate generative AI tool nicknamed “Gale” — and just launched its R2 weather satellite. The Boston-based startup is hoping to help businesses and governments solve their weather- and climate-related challenges. Founded in 2016, the company has raised $271 million, per Crunchbase.
3. FZ Sports, $74M, sports: Miami-based FZ Sports locked up a $74 million round from a handful of investors this week, including 777 Partners and MEP Capital. The round is a mix of debt and equity capital; however, the exact makeup was not disclosed. The sports media and technology startup — which operates 1190 Sports, Fanatiz and Nunchee – manages the international broadcasting rights for leagues in Latin America, including the Brasileirão, Liga Argentina de Futbol and recently added Liga1 Peru. Soccer is the world’s most popular game, and there is no doubt a rabid following for many of the top leagues in Latin America.
4. Primer Technologies, $69M, defense: Late last year we all saw the potential interest in defense tech as Costa Mesa, California-based Anduril locked up a Series E worth nearly $1.5 billion that values the company at $8.5 billion. This week, Primer locked up a round that is smaller but still significant. The San Francisco-based company specializing in AI-powered data analysis announced a $69 million “first close” of its Series D. The new cash will be used to accelerate the development of AI solutions for the government and commercial customers. Primer’s government offerings focus on software for intelligence gathering and analysis through natural language processing. The funding was led by Addition — which also was in the news this week. Founded in 2015, Primer has raised $237 million, per Crunchbase.
5. Octave, $52M, health care: San Francisco-based behavioral health care startup Octave closed a $52 million Series C round led by Cigna Ventures, Novo Holdings and Avidity Partners as it looks to expand its in-network therapy services nationally. The company has both in-person and virtual clinics, and offers personalized care plans for individuals, couples and families that often is covered through insurance. Founded in 2018, the company has raised $86 million, per Crunchbase.
6. CubicPV, $33M, solar: Bedford, Massachusetts-based solar manufacturing startup CubicPV announced it has received $33 million in the first tranche of a $100 million investment led by SCG Cleanergy. Founded in 2021, the company has raised $58 million.
7. CloudZero, $32M, cloud: Boston-based cloud cost intelligence platform CloudZero closed a $32 million Series B led by Innovius Capital and Threshold Ventures. Founded in 2016, the company has now raised $48 million, per Crunchbase.
8. Theradaptive, $26M, biotech: Frederick, Maryland-based Theradaptive, a biopharmaceutical company focusing on targeted regenerative therapeutics, closed a $26 million Series A. The company did not release investors. Founded in 2016, this is the company’s first disclosed outside raise, per Crunchbase.
9. (tied) FIA Tech, $25M, financial services: New York-based FIA Tech, a provider of financial and legal agreements and brokerage services, closed a $25.4 million round led by six existing shareholders: Bank of America, Barclays, Citi, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Wells Fargo. Founded in 2008, FIA Tech has raised almost $70 million, per the company.
9. (tied) Paro, $25M, fintech: Chicago-based Paro, which provides on-demand bookkeeping, raised a $25 million Series C led by Top Tier Capital Partners. Founded in 2015, Paro has raised $67 million to date, per the company.
Big global deals
The biggest round of the week was Madhive’s, but another pretty large round occurred in Europe.

London-based Beacon Therapeutics, which is looking to treat blinding retinal illnesses and restore and enhance eyesight, raised a $123 million Series A.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of June 10 to June 16. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

Accel’s AI Investments Keep The Focus On Applications And Tooling,Gené Teare,2023/06/16,"

This article is part of our series of profiles that spotlight an investor firm’s AI strategy, including a list of its AI portfolio. In a previous interview, we talked to Sameer Dholakia from Bessemer Venture Partners, who predicted a fast adoption curve of AI through APIs. 
With 40 years of investing under its belt, global venture capital firm Accel has long seen the potential of artificial intelligence. Now the firm is making fresh bets in AI startups.
The power of AI unleashed by large language models like ChatGPT has led to significant investor interest in applying AI to everything from chips to data storage and AI infrastructure, as well as tooling and applications built on the technology.

We spoke with Accel partner Daniel Levine about the firm’s AI investment outlook.
The firm is making investments in AI across its team in India, London and the U.S., as well as its growth team. Levine likens it to investing in software, where the responsibility does not sit with one team or person but is distributed. While not every investment is necessarily in an AI company, AI is key to the firm’s strategy. Accel is unlikely to invest in chips or data centers, said Levine. But the tooling and applications side of the technology is in its wheelhouse.
Daniel Levine, a partner at Accel
“You’ll see new companies for which AI makes the difference between the product being so-so and potentially [being] a game changer in its category,” said Levine.
For many software companies, that poses a significant opportunity and threat. This technology can propel a company forward, but can also leave a company trailing as competitors take advantage of the possibilities it presents.
Ground-floor investment
Levine led Accel’s 2017 Series A funding in Scale AI, a company which trains data for AI capabilities. Scale has raised close to $600 million since then, from its Series B through Series E, which were led, respectively, by Index Ventures, Founders Fund, Tiger Global, Dragoneer and Greenoaks.
Co-founded by Alexandr Wang and Lucy Guo, Scale AI started out in this generation’s equivalent of a garage — the basement of investor Levine’s San Francisco home. The company hired thousands of contractors to annotate pictures for self-driving technology companies which today include Waymo, Lyft and Toyota. It has since expanded to natural language training as well as computer vision processing, supporting companies such as OpenAI, Pinterest and Airbnb.
Levine understood from his early days at Crunchbase — he was a colleague of ours who joined straight out of Yale — that having people looking at data under the hood is a necessary part of the process.
Application
“We’ll always play at the application level,” with the goal to make users more productive, said Levine.
Accel led the 2020 Series B funding in Toronto-based Ada, an application layer customer service chatbot that utilizes AI.
“We could assume that over time, AI can make support agents more efficient,” said Levine. These tools balance when a human or an algorithm is involved to provide a better service. “There’ll still be cases when you’re going to want to talk to a person either on chat or phone. But there are definitely a lot of cases where you want to talk to an algorithm because it’s faster, it’s more convenient and it’s consistent,” he said.
Levine referenced project management software Notion — not an Accel portfolio company — several times in our conversation. “Notion AI is a very important product for them,” he said. Notion hosts wikis, docs and projects for companies, and has launched AI tools to help with writing, summarizing and planning, to make users more effective.
Tooling
Tooling and infrastructure companies are a core AI investment focus for Accel. These are the companies that assist other companies with their tech products. One of its portfolio companies, AssemblyAI, for example, provides infrastructure around understanding audio.
Accel also announced this week it led a Series C funding in London-based generative video company Synthesia, which makes video production possible for companies without actors, cameras or studios.
Another area of interest for Levine and Accel are new database products for understanding bias or trust and safety around AI, what the model is doing, and how it drifts.
The companies that comprise Accel’s AI portfolio span more than a decade and are not only represented by the new wave of companies. The companies listed here were founded as early as 2011 and the most recent in 2021. Levine’s investments in companies that predate AI but have since integrated these capabilities include Sentry, an error-monitoring tool for software teams, and visual workplace collaboration platform Whimsical.
“You’ll see a lot of companies that in hindsight will look like they’ve replaced existing software players,” he said.
Levine has also led Accel’s investments in, and serves on the boards of EdgeDB, Gem, Mux, ReadMe, Scale, Sentry, Sprig, Vercel and Whimsical.

Behind The Curtain: Crunchbase News Talks To A Vertically Farmed Baby Kale Plant,Christine Kilpatrick,2023/06/16,"

In our Behind The Curtain Q&As, we explore the venture capital ecosystem with some unexpected guides. Last time, we talked to a laid-off chatbot. In this installment, a Crunchbase News editor chats with a baby kale plant in its indoor vertical grow tower.
Thank you for taking the time to talk to us. How are you today?
Kale: My nitrogen levels are a bit low this morning, so we’re monitoring them closely, but I feel well-lit and properly hydrated.
Great. So let’s get to it. Our data says VC investors plowed $4.5 billion into agtech startups last year, and 20% of that went to indoor farming startups. Plenty and Gotham Greens raised hundreds of millions of dollars. Are you excited about your field’s success?
Kale: Oh, yes, we’re the future of food. Indoor farmers use AI to make granular adjustments to water, electricity and heat so we always feel nice and cozy. 
You do look very comfortable up there.
Kale: Plus, indoor farming saves on water and other resources, and you can grow us anywhere, saving on shipping costs. I’ve got family growing in a grocery store in Seattle. Everyone seems to like it there — except for the cilantro, but those guys are total snobs.
Yes, you’re a real plant of the people. Ever think of growing outside?
Kale: What? What? (shudders with rustling leaves) Out there? With all that … weather?
Sure. Why not?
Kale: Excuse me, have you been outdoors? I’ve heard things: It’s too hot, it’s too cold, it’s too bright, it’s too cloudy … and don’t even get me started on the bugs. 
Kale’s a pretty hardy plant, right? You’d be fine.
Kale: Well, I won’t have it. I wasn’t optimally cultivated to be a mid-morning snack for rabbits. Here I’ve got my carbon-dioxide monitoring system, fan coil chiller and AI-enabled robots. That’s all I need. Plus my nutrient tubes, humidifiers and phyto-light system. 
Sounds like growing kale indoors can be challenging.
Kale: I’ll admit some of us can be a bit temperamental, but we’re worth every drop of enriched water. There’s more to life than butter lettuce. 
Clearly AI-assisted agtech as a whole has great potential, but I understand that indoor farming is mostly limited to herbs and leafy greens. Isn’t that a problem?
Kale: No. People should eat more salad. 
Maybe so, but indoor farming still seems expensive and hard to scale. Late last year, indoor farming only made up around 14% of total funding in agriculture. 
Kale: Oh, you make my leaves wilt with such talk. We’re finished. Quick, my nitrogen atomizer!

Federal Prosecutors Punt On Some Charges Against Bankman-Fried,Chris Metinko,2023/06/15,"

Federal prosecutors have moved to remove five charges against disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.
Prosecutors have asked a judge to remove the five additional charges they brought against the former billionaire this year after they filed their original eight-count indictment in December.
Those charges, which include bribery of a foreign government official, were thrown into doubt after questions arose whether the U.S. government had followed the correct procedure in adding the additional charges after Bankman-Fried’s extradition.

In December, federal prosecutors charged Bankman-Fried with a slew of criminal counts after his arrest in the Bahamas — including conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud, individual charges of securities fraud and wire fraud, money laundering, and conspiracy to avoid campaign finance regulations.
However, the move may just end up opening another case against Bankman-Fried. Federal prosecutors could refile those charges against the FTX founder at a later date separately.
The story so far
FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in November after it was not able to repay customers who had deposited funds on its exchange.
FTX was the fourth-largest crypto exchange by volume when it failed, and Bankman-Fried was one of crypto’s biggest evangelists and financial backers. Through FTX Ventures and his other trading firm Alameda Research, the crypto whiz kid made hundreds of bets on the industry and the future of digital finance.
Investors in FTX included big names such as Sequoia Capital, NEA, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Insight Partners, Temasek, SoftBank Vision Fund, Thoma Bravo, SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Coinbase Ventures.
At its peak, FTX and FTX US — its U.S.-based exchange — were valued at valuations of $32 billion and $8 billions, respectively.

Metaverse Investing Has Slowed. Can Apple Save It?,Chris Metinko,2023/06/15,"

The metaverse is dead. Long live the metaverse.
Well, it’s not quite dead, but it certainly is not where it was just less than two years ago after then-Facebook changed its name to Meta and it became the buzziest of buzz words.
However, last week’s unveiling of the new Apple Vision Pro — with a price tag of just $3,500! — put a spotlight back on the space, highlighting what it could be and what its future may hold.

The present isn’t great for the startups in the space, as venture dollars in the sector have plummeted since Mark Zuckerberg’s big name change announcement in late 2021.
The numbers
Funding to startups in the metaverse space — defined here as companies in virtual reality, augmented reality and the virtual world industries — has dropped 77% from the the final quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of this year, per Crunchbase data.
The current quarter doesn’t seem to promise anything better.


Now, it is important to remember that in late 2021 — a year in which all venture funding records were smashed — was a very different time in the funding world than the current environment. The venture market has seen a significant downturn since then and shows few signs of returning.
Nevertheless, not only have dollar amounts decreased — from $2.2 billion invested in Q4 2021 to only $526 million last quarter, per Crunchbase — but so has deal flow. More than 160 deals were announced in the final quarter of 2021, while last quarter saw fewer than 100.
The last quarter of 2021 saw some massive deals, such as a $500 million investment in augmented reality startup Magic Leap, as well as a $300 million Series D for fellow AR player Niantic.
However, this year has seen no such rounds. The largest deal is on the periphery of the space — New York-based AI-powered car buying platform Impel landed a $104 million round in January. The startup does use AR features to make the car-buying experience more personalized, but that does seem on the fringe of what most people define as the metaverse.
The next largest round was a $70 million Series B for Orlando, Florida-based Red 6 this month. The startup is an augmented reality company that works with the United States Air Force to train fighter pilots.
Despite that round, the current quarter — with only weeks left — has seen only $284 million invested in startups involved in the metaverse in a meager 46 deals.
Even the slight uptick in funding in the final quarter of last year is really an illusion. The $1.9 billion number is mainly because of the $1.5 billion Series E defense and security firm Anduril picked up. The Costa Mesa, California-based startup includes AR/VR technology in its software and hardware for the military and defense industry.
Bigger problems
Of course, the adoption of the metaverse hasn’t just taken hits from VC investors.
Earlier this year, Microsoft said it would shut down AltspaceVR, the social virtual reality platform it acquired in 2017. It was later reported the company also dismantled a team it formed four months ago to help customers use the metaverse in industrial settings.
In March, it was reported Disney that squashed its metaverse plan after laying off its team focused on interactive storytelling.
Even Meta itself has seemed more interested in tech’s latest shiny toy — artificial intelligence — than talking about the metaverse.
The Apple effect
However, Apple’s unveiling of its Vision Pro has renewed talk of the concept — and perhaps for good reason.
Unlike Meta, Apple has a long track record of unveiling some of the tech industry’s most successful and game-changing devices. The Cupertino, California-based giant has been able to take vague concepts and ideas and distill them into a device — or devices — that are easy to use and can even be status symbols.
Apple even doubled down on its AR/VR bets last week, buying Los Angeles-based Mira, an AR startup that makes lightweight headsets for industrial companies and the U.S. military, for an undisclosed amount.
While many have buried the metaverse, it’s important to remember that ideas like the metaverse (or Web3) can’t be built in a quarter. The infrastructure alone needed for such platforms takes years to create. In that amount of time, there will be plenty of ebbs and flows in the marketplace.
All of this isn’t to say the metaverse has been completely resuscitated. No one can be sure of Apple’s full plans for its latest device. The company also does not have the best record of working nicely with external developers — something that will be needed for the metaverse to happen.
However, there is a reason Apple has a nearly $2.9 trillion market cap — almost triple that of the tech market’s latest darling, Nvidia, which is riding high on the coattails of the AI frenzy. If there is a company that can bring the metaverse to (virtual) life, it could be the maker of the Mac.

Primer Technologies Proves The Worth Of Enterprise AI With $69M Raise,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/06/14,"

Primer Technologies, an artificial intelligence and predictive analytics startup, announced on Wednesday it has raised $69 million in Series D funding.
The round was led by Addition, with additional participation from the US Innovative Technology Fund. The company’s fresh fundraising brings its total funding to $237 million, per Crunchbase data.
Primer Technologies has long been a big player in the AI and machine-learning space. The company was founded in 2015 and quickly nabbed government clients such as the United States Special Operations Command, the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Army. Military officials use Primer’s technology to plan missions and predict logistics.

The new round of funding will go toward Primer’s new generative AI models. The company already has a large language model functionality built into its system — the same sort of technology that powers open-source generative AI tools like ChatGPT and OpenAI’s platform.
Primer Technologies recently launched Primer Delta, a platform that can analyze millions of documents. The company is creating an internal search function that mimics Google Search, in  which analysts can simply ask questions pertaining to the details of the company through the organization’s intranet.
Enterprise AI enamors the market
Enterprise-focused AI platforms like Primer Technologies are going to prove to be a far better money-making venture than consumer-facing companies that build on top of ChatGPT’s API. Already, the arms race has begun.
Last month, The Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence announced it will invest $30 million in enterprise AI applications.
Also in May, Microsoft invested a whopping $13 billion in AI giant OpenAI to build out its suite of enterprise-grade AI tools in a search function similar to Primer Delta.
ServiceNow, a cloud infrastructure company, announced in May it will put aside $1 billion in venture funding for enterprise-focused AI startups. The company acquired Element AI and the AI platform Hitch Works.

Addition Looks To Add New $1.5B Fund Amid Market Slowdown,Chris Metinko,2023/06/14,"

New York-based Addition is looking to raise a new $1.5 billion even as the venture capital market continues its slowdown, per a TechCrunch report.

The firm, which has invested in such startups as Stripe, Snyk and Chainalysis, was founded by former Tiger Global executive Lee Fixel in 2020 and has made more than 100 deals, per Crunchbase data.
Most recently, Addition took part in Adept AI’s $350 million Series B. It was reported the new money gives the San Francisco-based startup a post-money valuation of at least $1 billion.
Like most firms, Addition has significantly cut the pace of its dealmaking, per Crunchbase data. It made 54 deals in 2021, but that number fell to only 29 last year.
So far this year, it has taken part in only six funding deals.
Bucking a trend
Addition’s decision to raise a new fund comes even as some big-named firms have slashed their fundraising targets.
Earlier this week, it was reported New York-based Insight Partners has significantly cut the $20 billion target for its latest fund — while also saying it would slow down its pace of dealmaking — and has raised only about $2 billion for the fund.
In February, Fixel’s previous employer, Tiger Global, had reduced the target size for its latest venture fund to $5 billion — down from a $6 billion target it set last fall and down more than 50% of what the firm anticipated raising earlier last year, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal.
Those cuts come as the venture market has continued to tumble from its 2021 highs. Global venture funding in 2022 hit $445 billion — marking a 35% decline year over year from the $681 billion invested in 2021 — according to an analysis of Crunchbase data.
Those numbers have continued to decline into 2023.

TransUnion Dials Up Competitiveness With $24M Startup Investment,Jenna D'Illard,2023/06/14,"

Credit checks, income checks, employment checks, all the grown-up money-related checks can strike fear into the heart of a prospective homebuyer, renter, job seeker or loan seeker.
But they’ve got to be done, and consolidation of those services provides a competitive advantage for any credit reporting agency.

To that end, publicly held reporting giant TransUnion announced Wednesday it has invested $24 million in equity funding in San Francisco-based Truework to integrate the startup’s income and employment verification platform, according to the company.
What is Truework?
Founded in 2017, Truework is an income and employment verification platform. The company has now raised a total of $118.9 million in funding over six rounds, according to Crunchbase data. Truework is funded by 33 investors, including Sequoia Capital and Khosla Ventures.
In August, we reported that the company raised $50 million in a Series C. Chicago-based G Squared served as the round’s lead investor, according to Crunchbase data.
Whether this latest partnership could serve as a catalyst to a full-on acquisition of Truework by TransUnion remains to be seen. But it certainly puts the credit-reporting giant in a better position to compete with rival Equifax.
“TransUnion is a global leader in credit data and insights. Our partnership signals a new era for thousands of businesses and millions of consumers who will benefit from accurate and accessible income data paired with TransUnion’s deep product catalog,” said Ryan Sandler, CEO and co-founder of Truework, in a statement.
TransUnion also isn’t shy about acquisitions. The company has acquired 24 organizations, according to Crunchbase data. Its most recent was Verisk Financial for an undisclosed amount in February 2022.
And in the current market, an acquisition might be a startup’s best bet for success.

Is AI The Cause Of Job Cuts This Year?,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/06/14,"

When ChatGPT was launched on the last day of November, it punctuated what was, at the time, the largest layoff month of 2022. More people were laid off in November than in every other month of the year combined — more than 44,000 people, according to Crunchbase data.
Perhaps November’s numbers were a harbinger of trying times ahead. Since then, companies have continued layoffs at the same brutal pace. While funding dried up elsewhere, leading to layoffs, venture firms were pouring money into the generative AI movement, where language models were poised to be the next big cash cow.
Indeed, according to Crunchbase data, funding to AI startups made up about 10% of global startup funding. Venture’s dramatic shift in funding priorities has rocked every industry from the art world to health care. And whenever a new piece of technology promises to disrupt an industry, the first worry is that it will replace workers.

“[We’re] pitching the opposite,” said Healy Jones, an executive at the startup consulting firm Kruze Consulting. “AI startups are the only ones really raising big rounds. That’s not to say that AI layoffs aren’t happening, and that some development work isn’t changing. But I haven’t seen the impact.”
AI spurs layoffs in tech
While few — if any — tech startups are actively conducting layoffs to offload work onto AI, the tech industry is quickly embracing artificial intelligence. According to a report from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which looks at layoffs across every industry, around 5% of May’s job cuts were directly related to artificial intelligence.
“We do believe AI will cause more job loss, though we are surprised how quickly the technology was cited as a reason,” Andy Challenger told Fortune. “It is incredible the speed the technology is evolving and being adapted.”
IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said the company is planning to pause hiring for roles that AI can reasonably do. Positions in human resources, or jobs that aren’t customer-facing, would be on the chopping block. That means 26,000 jobs at IBM could be in part or in whole replaced by AI. The company and its subsidiary Red Hat have laid off around 4,660 people so far in 2023.
On Monday, the homework helper platform Chegg announced it will lay off 4% of the company, or 80 positions, in order to begin deploying its AI strategy. Students have quickly adopted OpenAI tools and ChatGPT to get their homework done, impacting Chegg’s revenue. In the span of three months, the company introduced its own education platform powered by generative AI called CheggMate to rival the open-source tools.
The dangers of AI
But the rapid adoption of AI is likely to require more jobs to babysit the technology.
As of March, U.S.-based jobs on LinkedIn that mentioned GPT increased nearly 80% year over year. And, according to Crunchbase data, startups focused on AI are quickly joining The Crunchbase Unicorn Board as funding to the category speeds up.
Yossi Sheffi, an engineering professor at MIT, said that if anything, AI may, in a way, be a job creator. Workers will need to manage the technology through different, industrywide regulatory frameworks.
“Even if the invention is good and can be adopted, there are a lot of things that inhibit fast adoption,” he said. “How will they be regulated to make sure they aren’t harmful?”
Already, we’re starting to see some changes in the way companies are making staff changes to experiment with AI. At the National Eating Disorders Association, executives fired a slew of support line staffers after they attempted to unionize. The company quietly launched a chatbot, Tessa, to take over those duties. It was quickly pulled after it gave those with eating disorders bad advice — an argument those in the health care industry have used to stave off adopting AI.
“This is scary and there’s no precedent, and no one really knows what’s going on,” said Jeremy Kaufmann, a partner at Scale Venture Partners focused on automation.

AI-Generated Video Platform Synthesia Receives Nvidia Backing At Unicorn Valuation,Chris Metinko,2023/06/13,"

Synthesia is the latest AI startup to raise a big round and hit a $1 billion valuation after a $90 million Series C.
The London-based startup allows companies to easily create instructional videos from text featuring stock or custom AI avatars without the need for actors, cameras or studios.
The new round was led by Accel with investments from NVentures — Nvidia’s venture capital arm — and existing investors Kleiner Perkins, GV, Firstmark Capital, Alex Wang, Olivier Pomel and Amjad Masad.

“While we weren’t actively looking for new investment, Accel and NVIDIA share our vision for transforming traditional video production into a digital workflow that will enable creators to bring their ideas, from training videos to Hollywood films, to life with only a Synthesia account,” said Synthesia co-founder and CEO Victor Riparbelli in a release. “I’m delighted to have them on board as we accelerate our AI research efforts.”
Synthesia says more than 12 million videos have been generated on its platform since its founding in 2017. The startup works with more than 50,000 companies worldwide.
The company has now raised more than $156 million, per Crunchbase.
Nvidia’s AI moves
No big tech company may be benefiting more from the AI explosion than Nvidia — which recently became the first trillion-dollar chip firm.
Nvidia is leading the charge for chips with better processing to train large language models for AI — a race that will only get more heated as more AI applications are built and better infrastructure is necessary to support them.
The chip giant also has been making investment moves in the ecosystem surrounding AI. The company has made 19 different investments in VC-backed startups since the start of 2021, per Crunchbase data. Those deals include participating in Adept AI’s $350 million Series B in March and Toronto-based Cohere’s $270 million round in May.

Accenture Commits $3B To AI,Jenna D'Illard,2023/06/13,"

Signaling yet another major player’s acceptance of AI, global consulting firm Accenture said Tuesday it will invest $3 billion over three years into its AI and data practice.
That will look like new hires, training existing employees and acquisitions, according to a statement from the firm.
The publicly traded company advises and provides services to clients on generative AI projects across 19 industries, and Accenture CEO Julie Sweet said a commitment to AI is critical in serving its clients.

“Our clients have complex environments, and at a time when the technology is changing rapidly, our deep understanding of ecosystem solutions allows us to help them navigate quickly and cost effectively to make smart decisions,” said Sweet.
The investment comes just months after Accenture announced it will lay off 19,000 workers.
This shift in strategy begs the question of whether AI will replace jobs (as we all suspect) or ironically fuel hiring humans who know how to navigate the AI world.
AI investment, can’t stop won’t stop
Public and private companies (and the consultants that serve them) alike are finding their way in the new AI paradigm.
Earlier this week Salesforce Ventures 1 — Salesforce’s venture arm —  announced it will double the size of its Generative AI Fund to $500 million, just three months after launching it.
Salesforce and Salesforce Ventures are among several big tech companies and corporate venture arms that have been placing AI bets for several years.

Clean Air Startups Are Scaling Up,Joanna Glasner,2023/06/13,"

Everyone is happier breathing fresh, clean air. Unfortunately, we often forget this until confronted with smoky, polluted air.
As Canadian wildfire smoke spread southward, North American population centers that historically haven’t suffered many dangerous air quality days got hit especially hard. Suddenly, millions are finding their thoughts turn to air purifiers and filtration systems.
It’s possible startups can play a helpful role here. While they haven’t figured out how to eliminate orange haze from our skylines, venture- and seed-backed companies are working on a number of devices and technologies that could make life a little more breathable.

From filters you wear in your nose to industrial carbon capture systems, startups focused on cleaner air have pulled in some big rounds over the past several years. Since air quality is on everyone’s mind lately, we decided to take a look at where the money is going.
Top startups tackling air quality
Using Crunchbase data, we compiled a sample set of companies funded in the past few years that have collectively raised over $1.2 billion to tackle air quality. Below are 22 that stood out:


Several of the most heavily funded companies above are working on carbon capture technologies which, while environmentally laudable, probably won’t have much impact on sporadic air pollution from wildfires. However, this category does include the top fundraiser, Zurich-based Climeworks, which has pulled in over $800 million for direct air capture.
Others are offering up products more targeted to people concerned with air quality in their immediate environs.
One example is San Francisco-based Aclima, which has raised $64 million to date for a hyperlocal air measurement and analytics platform that tracks pollution and greenhouse gasses. The company recently unveiled a partnership with Washington, D.C., to track air quality at the neighborhood block level.
Since most people spend the majority of time indoors, startups are also targeting these environments. Massachusetts-based enVerid, for instance, has pulled in over $38 million for ventilation products that improve indoor air quality.
Minnesota’s 75F, meanwhile, raised nearly $30 million for building automation tech that includes an air quality focus. And 10-year-old SafeTraces, of Pleasanton, California, has raised at least $18 million in known funding to date for technology that tracks whether filtration and ventilation systems are doing their job.
We’ve also previously looked at consumer-level technologies, including startups offering devices you wear on your nose to filter air. This includes London-based Be Nosy, a triangular air filter that seals around the nose, and Resprana, which offers in-nose air filters called Duo.
Big market, with exits too
Analysts project that global spending on air quality monitoring will trend upward for the next several years, and will likely surpass $7 billion by 2028. That’s a big enough number to support both startups and incumbents.
Investor enthusiasm over air quality-focused upstarts shares similarities with another uptrend we’ve seen in the venture space around weather. As we noted a few quarters ago, VCs have been pouring hundreds of millions into an assortment of companies focused on weather risk forecasting, analytics and related business models.
Overall, this is the opposite of a happy coincidence: Funding is happening because extreme weather events and air quality risks are on the rise.
In addition to venture capitalists, acquirers and public investors are also taking some interest in air quality-focused upstarts.
One of the more prominent exits in the past couple years was BreezeoMeter, an Israeli startup that provides street-level and real-time air quality information. It sold to Google last year in a deal reportedly valued around $250 million. Among other initiatives, the company offers a popular app that tracks air quality and pollens for one’s local area.
Then there’s Molekule, a seller of branded room air purification devices that previously raised nearly $120 million in venture funding. Molekule made it to the public market, but without a big return for investors. After closing a merger early this year with a publicly traded air hygiene provider, the combined company is valued at around $80 million.
No time to breathe easy about funding
It’s tough to say how the environment for air quality-focused startups will shape up over coming quarters. While startup investment is down sharply in 2023, climate has been one of the more resilient areas.
And, much as we’d prefer this not to be the case, air quality is a topic weighing on our minds a lot more than it used to.

Salesforce Ventures Doubles Down On AI Investments,Chris Metinko,2023/06/12,"

Three months after launching it, Salesforce Ventures — Salesforce’s venture arm —  announced it will double the size of its Generative AI Fund to $500 million.
In March, Salesforce Ventures 1 said it would launch a new $250 million generative AI fund that will look at promising generative AI startups. The firm announced at TrailblazerDX it will initially invest in four AI companies — Anthropic, Cohere, Hearth.AI and you.com.
Since then, the venture arm of the CRM giant also has made additional AI investments in Humane and Tribble — and obviously see there is much more potential in AI than only $250 million can cover.

“We are already seeing AI change the way the world works, and we’re excited to build on the momentum of our Generative AI Fund,” Paul Drews, managing partner at Salesforce Ventures, said in a release. “Expanding our Generative AI Fund enables us to work with even more entrepreneurs who are accelerating the development of transformative AI solutions for the enterprise, and we are excited to support the next generation of innovative founders.”
Corporate investments
Salesforce and Salesforce Ventures are among several big tech companies and corporate venture arms that have been placing AI bets for several years — although those deals have become more expensive.
Salesforce Ventures has taken part in more than 50 deals that involved AI-related startups since the start of 2019, per Crunchbase data.
This year, the venture arm has made four deals, including participating in Anthropic’s recent big raise. It also took part in Cohere’s huge $250 million round.
Salesforce Ventures’ deals also show the rising price to invest in AI-related startups. While the venture arm made 10 investments in deals that totaled $736 million last year, the four deals this year have totaled $705 million.

"Hello, What? Nasdaq Pays $10B For Adenza",Jenna D'Illard,2023/06/12,"

Yes, you read that headline correctly. While most of us were out soaking up some summer weekend vibes, this megadeal was going down.
In one of the biggest acquisitions of the year so far, Nasdaq will reportedly acquire privately held software company Adenza for $10 billion in a mix of cash and shares according to a release.
Adenza develops risk-management and related regulatory software for the financial services market, and is therefore a logical fit for Nasdaq. The company will be acquired by Nasdaq from Thoma Bravo, a software investment firm.

Formed in 2021 from the Thoma Bravo acquisitions of AxiomSL in 2020 and Calypso Technology in 2022, Adenza is expected to hit about $590 million in annual 2023 revenue, according to Nasdaq.
What’s Nasdaq up to?
The Adenza acquisition is the biggest for Nasdaq as it expands its fintech services. Nasdaq says with the acquisition it will be better positioned to provide “comprehensive support to financial institutions” over regulatory technology, compliance and risk management.
“This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a leading software company that enhances Nasdaq’s position at the heart of the global financial system,” said Adena Friedman, Nasdaq’s CEO.
Nasdaq,  which operates three stock exchanges in the U.S. and seven in Europe, has made eight investments in the past, according to Crunchbase data. Its most recent investment was on Aug. 2, 2021, to Boston-based Level ATS’ corporate round. Level ATS is an independently operated U.S. Equity Alternative Trading System located in Boston.
Holden Spaht, a managing partner at Thoma Bravo, is expected to be appointed to Nasdaq’s board of directors, which will be expanded to 12 members.
The deal falls a few billion short of Qualtrics’ $12.5 billion acquisition announced earlier this year and will reportedly be completed over the next nine months.

"Startups Are Knocking On The Door To Partner With Big Pharma, But Nobody’s Answering",Keerthi Vedantam,2023/06/12,"

Rancho Santa Fe Bio is undergoing something you don’t see a lot of these days for a startup of its size: a phase 3 clinical trial for a cardiovascular drug that could change the game for those with progressive aortic valve stenosis. 
The company is looking to raise its Series A to fund the trial, an expensive endeavor that will likely take years to prove to the Food and Drug Administration it’s superior to other drugs currently on the market. Only around 25% of drugs make it past phase 3. 
“I think the hardest part of this is being a small company,” said Randy Berholtz, CEO of RSF Bio, as the company is also known. “Doing a phase 3 really makes you a bigger company just with the amount of money you have to raise. It is what it is.”

Pharma companies usually partner with startups to drive them through clinical trials, but large pharmaceutical organizations have been laying low since the funding downturn. In 2022, merger and acquisition activity in the space was the lowest it had been since 2013, according to Clarivate Analytics. Partnerships, through which pharmaceutical companies fund the development of drugs and commercialize them themselves, was the lowest it had been since 2018. Per Crunchbase data, funding in 2022 was as low as it was in 2020.
“In the downturn, we have a situation where a lot of people would be happy to partner around whatever assets or platforms they have,” said Thomas Barnes, CEO of Orna Therapeutics. “Beggars can’t be choosers.”


The lack of activity has only strengthened Big Pharma’s place in the biotech ecosystem, and is creating waves across the delicate innovation pipeline. Without being able to scrounge up venture funding or develop strong partnerships, startups are stagnant.
“Without a shadow of a doubt, these are testing times for nurturing and fast-tracking innovation in the sector,” said Joe Young from consulting firm Vault Bioventures. 
Startups’ relationship with Big Pharma
It is, in a sense, somewhat surprising that partnership and acquisition activity has been so low. Without large research and development arms themselves, large pharma companies rely on smaller startups to discover and develop new drugs, which they later buy to commercialize, market and patent.
“The biotech companies are bringing innovative assets, which pharmaceutical companies need,” said Mike Ward, an analyst at Clarivate. “For pharmaceutical companies, it’s important that the biotech companies are robust and are going to be around.”
As drug patents expire to make way for generics, pharma companies are constantly on the hunt for new assets to make them money. But funding pharmaceuticals is an expensive and risky business. 
Pharma companies often partner with startups early to develop drugs created out of an already-tested platform, but that comes with regulatory and development risks. They might otherwise acquire those de-risked drugs late in the process at a higher cost.
Last year, Orna Therapeutics announced a partnership with Merck. Merck paid the company $150 million upfront and could pay up to an additional $3.5 billion if Orna successfully develops a handful of vaccines and therapeutics. Xanax, the EpiPen and Concerta have all been developed through a web of partnerships and Big Pharma acquisitions.
Berholtz has talked to large pharma companies before. But by entering phase 3, the company’s drug is more valuable than it has ever been, because it’s less risky and more likely to get the stamp of approval from the FDA. 
“We have had some Big Pharma saying, ‘Well, why don’t you de-risk it a little more? And then we know there’s going to be a New Drug Application, then come and talk to us,’” Berholtz said. “Because Big Pharma has the commercialization, sales and marketing teams.”
Who gets Big Pharma partnerships?
RSF Bio is in what Young calls “no man’s land” in biotech — that phase in a drug’s lifecycle where the startup often has to front the cost of developing the drug and pushing it through regulatory approval at little risk to the pharma company that acquires it. 
“[Pharma companies] have bifurcated, either very early or incredibly, incredibly late,” Young said. “And that’s kind of created this gulf in the middle. …This is where a lot of promising assets, with their associated risks, go to die.”
It’s not easy to scrounge up a partnership deal with Big Pharma. Many of these companies are struggling in the public markets, so they’re focused on very specific, bread-and-butter pipeline drugs that leave a lot of innovative companies out of their scope. 
“When the deals get done, it’s more of a window into what the pharma is thinking,” said Barnes. “It’s less of a marker for how persuasive the biotech has been in persuading them to do something.”
Midsize to small pharma companies are also suffering on the public markets, and their lower market capitalizations make it harder to fund biotech innovation through partnerships.
“The public markets are closed and the private markets are tough,” Berholtz said. “I would think that the dynamic in that collaborative process has shifted in favor of the pharma companies.”

The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: CleanCapital and Upstream Bio Lead Huge Week,Chris Metinko,2023/06/9,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.

It was a big, big week in funding, with eight rounds topping $100 million and the top two totaling $700 million. Biotech and health care again saw several huge rounds — taking six spots on this week’s list. However, cleantech, cyber and even the insurance sector saw some meaningful cash.
1. CleanCapital, $500M, clean energy: Cleantech led the way this week, thanks to this monster round. New York-based CleanCapital, a solar and storage developer that invests in early-stage projects, locked up a $500 million commitment from Canadian insurer Manulife Investment Management. CleanCapital will use the money to fund early-stage solar and storage development and acquire other renewable energy assets in the U.S. The company also announced it has now deployed more than $1 billion to fund operating, new construction, and early-stage solar and storage development. Founded in 2015, the company has received about $1.1 billion, per Crunchbase.
2. Upstream Bio, $200M, biotech: It was almost exactly a year ago when Waltham, Massachusetts-based Upstream Bio locked up a $200 million Series A. This week it’s back for another $200 million; a Series B led jointly by Enavate Sciences and Venrock Healthcare Capital Partners. Upstream Bio is developing an antibody that targets thymic stromal lymphopoietin and its receptors that can inflame when things like smoke or allergens are introduced into the environment. The treatment could be useful to those with asthma. Founded in 2004, the company has now raised $400 million, per Crunchbase.
3. Blackpoint Cyber, $190M, cybersecurity: Cybersecurity, like most sectors, has experienced a slowdown when it comes to venture funding. However, that did not stop Maryland-based Blackpoint Cyber from cashing in. The startup, which offers a security suite of products to managed service providers, raised a $190 million growth investment led by Bain Capital Tech Opportunities. Founded in 2014, the company has now raised more than $200 million, per Crunchbase.
4. Alkeus Pharmaceuticals, $150M, biotech: Every week, one needs not to go very far down this list to find a big biotech raise. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Alkeus Pharmaceuticals made the list with a $150 million Series B led by Bain Capital Life Sciences. The company specializes in pharmaceuticals to fight Stargardt disease, which is a leading cause of blindness in children and young adults. In addition to the new funding, Alkeus has also named Dr. Joshua Boger, the founder of Vertex Pharmaceuticals, its executive chairman.
5. Bitterroot Bio, $145M, biotech: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for men, women and many ethnic groups and races in the U.S. and worldwide. Ideally, Bitterroot Bio would like to change that. The Palo Alto, California-based company is focused on novel immunotherapies in cardiovascular disease, and launched from stealth this week with a $145 million Series A led by Arch Venture Partners and Deerfield Management. The company, founded in 2021, hopes to use immunology — including the identification of novel targets and the development of innovative protein therapies — to fight the deadly disease.
6. Incline P&C Group, $125M, insurance: Austin, Texas-based Incline P&C Group, an insurance program market services firm, locked up a $125 million investment from Braemont Capital. Founded in 2015, this is the firm’s first outside raise, per Crunchbase.
7. (tied) Acepodia, $100M, biotech: Alameda, California-based clinical-stage cancer biotech firm Acepedia announced a $100 million Series D financing led by Digital Mobile Venture. Founded in 2016, the company has now raised $256 million, per Crunchbase.
7. (tied) Charm Industrial, $100M, cleantech: San Francisco-based carbon removal technology company Charm Industrial raised a $100 million Series B led by General Catalyst. Founded in 2018, this is the company’s first outside funding, per Crunchbase.
9. Upperline Health, $58.4M, health care: Nashville, Tennessee-based Upperline Health, a provider network for specialty care, raised $58.4 million in new capital led by Crestline. Founded in 2016, the company has now raised $137 million, per Crunchbase.
10. Kate Therapeutics, $51M, biotech: San Diego-based Kate Therapeutics, a gene therapy company, emerged from stealth with a $51 million Series A financing co-led by founding investors Westlake Village BioPartners and Versant Ventures.
Big global deals
Once again, even though U.S.-based startups cleaned up this week with venture dollars, the largest round came from across the pond.

U.K.-based Gigaclear, a developer of ultra-fast broadband networks based on pure fiber technology, raised a venture round of more than $450 million.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of June 2 to June 9. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

"SoftBank’s Hits Are Iconic, But So Are Its Misses",Joanna Glasner,2023/06/9,"

In 2018 when SoftBank Vision Fund invested $375 million in Zume, a Silicon Valley startup with a robot-crafted pizza-making service, there were one of two gut responses. First: That’s not going to work out well. Second: Sounds out there, but maybe they’re onto something.
Nearly five years later, it looks like the first response was on target. Zume, which pivoted a few years ago from pizza to sustainable packaging, recently shut down due to insolvency, according to reports.

The closure was the latest in a long string of disappointing outcomes for the Vision Fund, which shook up startupland in 2017 with the first $100 billion investment vehicle — the largest in industry history. A couple years later came the similarly jumbo-sized SoftBank Vision Fund II.
These funds went on to back some notorious flops, like former construction industry unicorn Katerra. Others that are still around are worth a tiny fraction of their former valuations, including companies like WeWork.
To get a sense of the scope of SoftBank flops, we used Crunchbase data to analyze the most heavily-funded U.S. companies 1 that counted the Vision Fund as a lead investor. We then categorized the largest disappointments in three buckets: poor public market performers, defunct companies and low valuation acquisitions.
Public, but far below highs
In the first category, we look at SoftBank-backed publicly traded companies trading far below their initial offering prices or peak private valuations. Below is a list of six that fit that criteria:


WeWork, trading around 21 cents a share today, has to be the leading cautionary tale. SoftBank invested over $10 billion in the shared office space provider over the years, beginning with a late-stage financing in 2017. WeWork’s current market cap is around $170 million.
View, the smart glass maker that raised $1.1 billion from SoftBank in 2018, has also been an exceptionally poor performer, with a market cap of less than $50 million and shares hovering below 20 cents each.
Shuttered or bankrupt
Meanwhile, several heavily funded companies that counted SoftBank as a lead backer have closed their doors or filed bankruptcy. We list four of the most prominent below:


Like Zume, Boston-based Pear Therapeutics’ name got added to the list relatively recently. The digital therapeutics developer announced in April that it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company had previously struggled to get insurers to pay for its offerings.
Poor exits
Some Vision Fund big bets have also sold to acquirers at steep discounts to their prior valuations.
Fair, a vehicle leasing platform that raised $385 million in equity and $1.7 billion in debt financing in the late 2010s, is a case in point. The company sold last year to Shift, an online used car marketplace, in a deal valued at less than $20 million.
Berkshire Grey, a maker of robotic systems for warehouse automation, also sold at a steep discount, although in this case the buyer was SoftBank itself. After going public via SPAC in 2021 at a $2.7 billion valuation, shares had shed over 90% of their value by late 2022. SoftBank swooped in this March with a deal to take the company private at a $375 million valuation.
Yes, there are successes in there too
While we’re focusing on unsuccessful outcomes here, no one should walk away with the impression that Vision Fund is just a flop-producing machine. They’ve also led rounds for a number of startups that have had a transformative role in their industries, including Uber, Slack and DoorDash.
Prior to the Vision Fund, SoftBank was also known for its early stake in China’s Alibaba. Over the years, the firm reportedly made $72 billion on that investment, which ranks among the most lucrative of all time.
Struggling
While we talk of hits and misses, it’s also true that much of the SoftBank portfolio is in a more ambiguous category. This largely includes companies that raised big rounds in 2020 and 2021 but haven’t closed on funding since.
A sizable number of heavily funded companies have announced layoffs in the past few quarters. This includes mortgage provider Better, ghost kitchen operator Reef Technology, and fast delivery service Gopuff, among a long list of others.
However, while it doesn’t look like these companies are in a position to invite term sheet bidding wars, they are still in business. For those who laid off staff and carried out other cost-cutting measures, it will take a while to parse to what extent these steps have put companies in a better position for long-term viability.

AI Startup Cohere Locks Up $270M At $2.2B Valuation,Chris Metinko,2023/06/8,"

Toronto-based Cohere became the latest artificial intelligence startup to raise big money at an even bigger valuation.
The startup raised a $270 million Series C led by Inovia Capital at a valuation of $2.2 billion.
Other investors in the round include some big corporate names — Nvidia, Oracle, Salesforce Ventures1, DTCP and SentinelOne — as well as financial institutions and VC firms Mirae Asset, Schroders Capital, Thomvest Ventures and Index Ventures. 

Cohere builds large language models that allow AI to learn from new data, and can be customized and put into applications for features like interactive chat or to generate text.
Umesh Padval, a venture partner at Thomvest Ventures, told Crunchbase News his firm made the investment for a handful of reasons, including Cohere’s engineering and management teams, its multicloud and hybrid cloud approach and its significant strategic channels option — as well as the market in general.
There is a “massive market opportunity in LLM space which is exploding,” Padval said. “Cohere has all the elements which would make them successful.”
AI trends
The Cohere round illustrates two trends right now in AI — big money and some of that money from big-name tech companies.
Nvidia, for instance, just became a trillion-dollar market cap company after its shares exploded thanks to demand for its chips used in AI. The company, like several other tech titans, has been placing bets into AI startups for years. The same can be said for Salesforce Ventures, which just last month participated in the $450 million Series C for Anthropic — a ChatGPT rival with its AI assistant Claude — which also included Google and Zoom Ventures.
Of course, the Cohere and Anthropic deals are not the only huge AI deals recently.
In April, AlphaSense, an AI-enhanced market intelligence platform, raised $100 million from investors that included CapitalG — Alphabet’s independent growth fund.
In March, Character.ai closed a $150 million Series A at a $1 billion valuation led by Andreessen Horowitz. The Palo Alto, California-based AI startup allows people to create their own personalized AI chatbot using language models and deep-learning algorithms.
Also in March, San Francisco-based Adept AI raised $350 million in a Series B — at a reported post-money valuation of at least $1 billion.
Of course the craze started in January with news of Microsoft’s massive $10 billion investment into OpenAI — creator of ChatGPT.

"
New Unicorns In May Hit Double Digits With Two AI Companies,Gené Teare,2023/06/8,"

Ten companies joined The Crunchbase Unicorn Board in May 2023 — double the count for April 2023 but still significantly down from the 34 new unicorns in May 2022.
This new unicorn count took place in a funding environment where the most active unicorn investor, Tiger Global, is looking to sell its stakes in private companies, and investors continue to downgrade unicorn portfolio values.
The 10 companies hailed across nine different industries, and AI topped the list with two companies. Other sectors with a single new unicorn ranged from energy, biotech, robotics, enterprise SaaS and transportation among others.
Five of the new unicorns are U.S.-based and two are from China. Canada, Indonesia and Japan each counted one new unicorn this past month.


Around $5 billion of the $22 billion in global venture funding raised in May 2023 went to unicorn companies.  That’s less than half of the $11 billion that unicorns raised in May 2022. The largest funding last month went to fast-fashion e-commerce platform Shein, which raised $2 billion in a single round at a reduced valuation of $66 billion.


Here are the new unicorns:
AI

Toronto-based Cohere, a generative AI large language model developer for enterprises, raised $270 million in its Series C funding. The funding was led by Inovia Capital  valuing the 4-year-old company at $2.2 billion. 
Generative video AI company Runway, based out of New York, raised a $100 million Series D led by Google. The funding valued the 5-year-old company at $1.5 billion.

Energy

China-based Ryefield Energy, a battery energy storage company, raised $140 million led by Sparkedge Capital. The company was valued at $1.4 billion.

Agtech

Indonesia-based eFishery, developer of an IoT feeding device for shrimp and fish, and an e-commerce platform for aquafarmers, raised a $108 million Series D led by Abu Dhabi PE fund G42 Expansion Fund. The company was valued at $1.3 billion.

Cleantech

Massachusetts-based Gradiant helps enterprises dependent on water reduce and treat wastewater. It raised a $225 million Series D led by BoltRock Holdings and Centaurus Capital in a round which valued the company at $1 billion.

Enterprise SaaS

Restaurant management software company Restaurant365 based in Irvine, California, raised a $135 million round which valued the company at $1 billion. The funding was led by private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and L Catterton.

Proptech

Proptech company Avenue One provides a platform of services from brokers, contractors and property managers for buyers of rental properties. The company based in New York raised $100 million led by WestCap valuing the company at $1 billion.

Transportation

Tokyo-based GO, the leading ride hailing app in Japan, raised a $72 million Series D led by Goldman Sachs which valued the company at $1 billion. The company is also developing software to monitor safe driving practices.

Robotics

Humanoid robot developer Zhiyuan Robotics based in Shanghai, raised its third funding led by Baidu Capital, valuing the company at $1 billion. The amount raised was not disclosed.

Biotech

VectorBuilder, a gene delivery technology company headquartered in Chicago, raised a funding which valued the company at $1 billion.

Unicorn queries

Unicorn leaderboard (1,460)
Unicorns in the U.S. (721)
Unicorns in Asia (458)
European unicorns (197)
Emerging unicorn leaderboard (376)
Exited unicorns (426)

Methodology
The Crunchbase Unicorn Board is a curated list that includes private unicorn companies with post-money valuations of $1 billion or more and is based on Crunchbase data. New companies are added to the Unicorn Board as they reach the $1 billion valuation mark as part of a funding round.
The unicorn board does not reflect internal company valuations — such as those set via a 409a process for employee stock options — as these differ from, and are more likely to be lower than, a priced funding round. We also do not adjust valuations based on investor writedowns, which change quarterly, as different investors will not value the same company consistently within the same quarter.
Funding to unicorn companies includes all private financings to companies that are tagged as unicorns, as well as those that have since graduated to The Exited Unicorn Board.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.
Correction: The funding round for Cohere was updated to $270 million and its valuation to $2.2 billion based on an updated funding announcement.

Most Active US Investors: Deals Trickle In As Gaingels And Soma Capital Lead,Chris Metinko,2023/06/8,"

This is a monthly feature that runs down the most active investors in U.S.-based companies, looks at some of their most interesting investments, and includes some odds and ends of who spent what. Check out April’s feature here.
Investors seemed wary of pulling out their checkbooks too often last month.
Only five venture firms — excluding accelerators — made a half-dozen investments or more.

That is well down from a year ago, when a handful made 10 or more deals in May 2022. That included Andreessen Horowitz and Tiger Global leading the way with 23 and 20, respectively.
A year later, those two firms combined for only seven startup deals.
In June 2022, Khosla Ventures and Insight Partners both made 10 deals. Last month, that number dropped to only two.
However, let’s focus on those that did make a few deals in May.
Gaingels, 8 deals
Vermont-based Gaingels is a regular on this list, but even its numbers have dropped in recent months. Through all of last year, it constantly completed a double-digit number of deals every month. Thus far this year, its high is 10 in February.
However, it does find interesting things to invest in
The firm led a $3 million seed round for Los Angeles-based VitaBowl, which is looking to collaborate with health insurance companies to provide “food-as-medicine” meal deliveries.
It’s a unique approach to the oversaturated meal kit industry, looking to take on significant diseases like obesity and diabetes, while making it affordable.
Soma Capital, 7 deals
San Francisco-based Soma Capital, on the other hand, had its busiest month of the year with seven deals announced.
That included a handful of U.S.-based fintech deals, as well as taking part in rounds for New York-based sales tax tech developer Zamp, and two San Francisco-based startups, Slash and Pesto.
The firm also took part in a $2.1 million pre-seed round for New York-based Revv. The startup’s platform uses AI (of course) and machine learning to allow professionals to instantly identify required calibrations for cars in seconds — integrating with the software many cars already use.
And ideally, getting your car fixed faster.
FJ Labs, 7 deals
New York-based FJ Labs has been pretty consistent with its investment cadence this year. The firm, which has a focus on marketplaces and consumer-facing startups, had already made 30 deals in U.S.-based startups this year, and added another seven in May.
One of those deals included a pretty unique Series A investment in SidelineSwap, a Boston-based startup that has created a marketplace for athletes, weekend warriors and perhaps most importantly sports families to buy, sell and trade athletic products.
The round was led, not surprising perhaps, by eBay Ventures and the total amount was not disclosed.
So when your daughter gives up ice hockey after four weeks, you can recoup some of those losses.
General Catalyst, 6 deals
General Catalyst also has been pretty consistent this year, making 19 deals through the first four months of the year and now six in May.
Included in its May deals is a $50 million seed round for Hippocratic AI.
Let’s face it, it’s hard to avoid AI. The only real question is where it will appear next. Hippocratic AI believes that answer could be health care.
Hippocratic AI’s mission is to develop the safest artificial Health General Intelligence — a safety-focused large language model for health care.
The startup is investing in legally acquiring evidence-based health care content and the model’s readiness will be vested by health care professionals.
The startup says its AI will not be used for clinical diagnosis, but the thousands of other applications for AI in health care.
Salesforce Ventures, 6 deals
Salesforce Ventures 1, the venture arm of the CRM giant, had a quiet start of the year, announcing no deals in U.S.-based startups. However, it’s picked up the pace since, making a dozen deals in the past three months combined.
Included in that was the biggest deal last month — Anthropic’s huge $450 million Series C funding led by Spark Capital with participation from the likes of Salesforce Ventures, Google and others.
The round came after months of speculation about new funding rounds, and reports are that it values Anthropic at $4.1 billion.
Also notable:

General Catalyst topped all firms in rounds led or co-led with six, including a $17.3 million Series A in New York-based health care software platform Adonis.
Spark Capital topped the list for rounds led or co-led with the highest dollar amounts for May. The firm only led or co-led one round last month, but it was the monster $450 million by Anthropic, a ChatGPT rival with its AI assistant Claude.
Several incubators and accelerators made a number of investments in May, led by Y Combinator’s 12 deals.

Methodology
This is a list of investors which took part in the most rounds involving U.S.-based startups. It does not include incubators or accelerators due to the fluctuations their investment numbers can have.

"
Will Recent US Crackdown On Crypto Affect Venture?,Chris Metinko,2023/06/7,"

It’s been quite a turbulent couple of days for crypto, as U.S. regulators sued the two biggest exchanges in the world, Binance and Coinbase.

The charges brought against both companies by the Securities and Exchange Commission explicitly show the regulator is getting very serious about bringing crypto under its jurisdiction and that of federal securities laws.
While those regulatory actions affected two of the largest players in crypto and caused an unsteadying of cryptocurrency prices, they could also likely affect the crypto startup and venture capital world as the industry tries to find its footing in a murky financial space.
“Most crypto firms and venture funds welcome thoughtful regulation in this space,” said Yash Patel, general partner at Telstra Ventures, who invests in crypto startups. “However, the SEC’s focus on enforcement by regulation versus more transparent, clear legislative action will compel most crypto firms — not just startups — to leave the U.S. and would not be ideal for America’s competitive position as key talent leaves elsewhere.”
Tough times for crypto
The cases against Binance and Coinbase are very different in scope.
The SEC’s suit alleges Coinbase’s prime brokerage, exchange and staking programs violate securities laws and that 13 assets listed on its platform are considered crypto asset securities, per its complaint.
On the other hand, the suit against Binance charges that exchange for operating a “web of deception,” alleging Binance and its co-founder Changpeng Zhao controlled customers’ assets on the platform and commingled or diverted billions of dollars of those assets as they desired, including to Sigma Chain, a European business Zhao owned and controlled.
It also alleges the Binance.US exchange — which was said to be its own independent exchange — was actually controlled by Zhao and Binance.
Those cases come of course against the backdrop of the complete collapse of FTX — one of the largest startup failures ever that likely only brought more regulatory scrutiny to the space (the SEC is suing disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried).
It also is happening after cryptocurrency prices took a huge tumble last year — although some like ether and bitcoin have made a nice rebound so far this year.
All of that seems to have significantly cooled the venture market for crypto — which saw a significant pullback.
Per Crunchbase data, venture capital investment in crypto globally dropped from $6.2 billion in 444 deals in the first quarter of 2022 to only $1.1 billion in only 200 deals in the first quarter of this year.
The numbers are even more ominous when just focusing on VC-backed, U.S.-based crypto startups. In Q1 2022, such startups saw $3.8 billion in 189 deals. The first quarter of this year saw those numbers drop to only $278 million in 73 deals, per Crunchbase.


A chilling effect?
Whether the recent SEC actions will affect funding and deal numbers obviously remains to be seen, but those in the industry are wary.
VCs for years have asked for more clarity, especially around the issue of certain cryptocurrencies being securities as opposed to commodities (which we talked about last year here).
The distinction between the two affects which agency regulates it.
“The SEC is effectively classifying all crypto tokens as securities in this lawsuit against Coinbase, which isn’t necessarily the stance the (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) has historically had,” Patel said. “There’s still a lot of confusion about where the two agencies sit.”
Christian Lopez, head of blockchain and digital assets at Cohen & Co. Capital Markets, added regulation is necessary and welcome in crypto, but the concern is lack of regulatory clarity.
“The industry would welcome sensible guidelines within which to operate, so long as it doesn’t stifle innovation,” Lopez said.
However, Lopez said he believes the U.S. is falling behind other jurisdictions like Hong Kong and Europe which have taken a more welcoming approach to their crypto communities.
“As an investor, I would certainly be concerned about the SEC’s crackdown in the U.S.,” Lopez said. “However, we believe that actions taken by other jurisdictions will force the U.S. to step up to the plate.
“Otherwise we risk losing innovative companies and entrepreneurs and forcing them to move offshore,” he added.
While the SEC’s actions seem clear as to what it wants, Patel adds more thoughtful guidance and clearer rules are needed from all players in the regulatory space.
“There has always been bipartisan support for innovators in (crypto), and this lawsuit will be just as much a political issue as it is a legal fight,” he said.

"
It’s Taking Longer For Startups To Raise From Series A To Series B,Joanna Glasner,2023/06/7,"

Startups that raise Series A rounds typically have only a short break before they’re fundraising again.
Among U.S. companies that go on to close Series B funding, the median is just under two years to do so, according to a Crunchbase analysis from 2012 to today. For the speediest quartile, the median is under 18 months.
But as venture funding contracts, the lag time between rounds is getting longer. Startups across sectors are taking steps to cut costs and extend runways. The steep rise in average round size in 2020 and 2021 also means many companies that raised then have plenty of cash to help push off the next fundraise.

We’re already seeing evidence of delays this year, with the average time lapse between Series A and Series B hitting 31 months — the longest span in at least 12 years. To illustrate, we charted out median and average fundraising time spans since 2012 below:


So how long can you delay?
Extended delays are no surprise. Under current market conditions, there are multiple arguments in favor of putting off one’s next fundraise. For one, valuations have contracted in many sectors, so waiting longer before seeking new investment allows some time for them to potentially recover.
Secondly, venture investors have gotten stingier lately about writing checks, save for a few hot spaces like generative AI. Holding out for a window when the mood is more upbeat and the odds of rejection are lower seems sensible.
Still, startups can only delay fundraising for so long. Among the slowest quartile of startups, it took an average of 34.5 months to go from Series A to Series B over the past 12 calendar years. It’s uncommon to see a gap of four years or more between rounds.
Hot startups, meanwhile, often go from Series A to Series B pretty quickly. One recent case is artificial intelligence upstart Anthropic, which took less than a year before closing its 2022 Series B round. More distant past examples include scooter provider Bird (four months from Series A to Series B), homebuying platform Opendoor (eight months), and grocery service Instacart (14 months).
Will it be different this time around?
It wouldn’t be surprising if in the next few years we see startups pushing up time spans for raising the next round.
Delays are already evident for the slowest fundraisers in 2023. Crunchbase data shows the slowest quartile of startups this year took a median 38 months to go from Series A to Series B. That’s the longest in our 12-year survey period.
We also shouldn’t forget that U.S. startup funding reached a record high nearly two years ago. Per Crunchbase data, Series A investment has fallen for five consecutive quarters since peaking in late 2021.
Coming down from those heights, startup investors’ preferences have changed. They’re shying away from high-cash-burn, high-growth models and are more accepting of slower growth paired with smaller losses.
Sooner or later, however, Series A companies will have to do one of five things: Get acquired, go public, become self-sustaining, raise more financing, or shutter. If enough years pass with none of the first four options happening, it becomes increasingly likely the startup will not make it.

"Pandemic Didn’t Alter Dominance Of Stanford, Harvard Or MIT For Funded Founders",Joanna Glasner,2023/06/7,"

The pandemic changed many things about how Americans build and fund startups, from the rise of remote teams to the willingness of investors to back companies located far from the home office.
One thing that hasn’t changed, however, is the dominance of three universities — Stanford, Harvard and MIT — in churning out founders of funded companies.
Per Crunchbase data, roughly a quarter of U.S. seed or pre-seed investment 1 in the past three years went to companies founded by alumni of one of those schools. Stanford produced the highest number, followed by Harvard, then MIT.

Overall, it’s a disproportionately large haul considering these universities account for no more than half a percent of American university graduates in a typical year.
For a sense of how these schools’ alums fare in securing investment, we’ve charted seed and pre-seed funding rounds to startups they’ve founded below. The tally covers three years, beginning in April 2020, the early days of the pandemic.


In case you were wondering, the fundraising prowess of founders who graduated from one of these three schools is actually a bit stronger at Series A. As illustrated below, their companies secured just over a quarter of total funding in the same period:


Does it matter if you went somewhere else?
The stats boost the notion that, if you are an undergrad or grad-school applicant with interest in founding a startup, going to Harvard, Stanford or MIT seems like a good idea. Grads from these schools clearly outperform their peers in building fundable companies.
However, reality is the overwhelming majority of us, wannabe founders included, will not attend one of these three universities. That begs the question: Does that put us at a big disadvantage in the startup game?
Not necessarily. As we’ve seen in previous data dives into the intersection of education and startup funding, top-ranked public universities and prestigious private ones also do pretty well in graduating founders of funded companies.
Among public universities, UC Berkeley has been the strongest performer by far in prior samples. Graduates of prominent business schools, such as University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, also rank high.
Besides attending a prestigious school, it apparently helps to be located in or near a major startup hub. It’s likely no coincidence, for instance, that our top-ranked public school, UC Berkeley, is in the venture capital-rich San Francisco Bay Area.

"Doubling Down: SEC Charges Coinbase For Operating Illegally, A Day After Charging Binance",Chris Metinko,2023/06/6,"

The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange, of operating illegally as an unregistered exchange.
It marks the second straight day the U.S. regulator has taken action against a large crypto exchange.

On Monday, the SEC filed 13 charges against the world’s largest crypto exchange Binance, its co-founder Changpeng Zhao, and other entities related to the exchange.
The SEC’s suit alleges Coinbase’s prime brokerage, exchange and staking programs violate securities laws and that 13 assets listed on its platform are considered crypto asset securities, per its complaint.
“The Coinbase Platform merges three functions that are typically separated in traditional securities markets—those of brokers, exchanges, and clearing agencies,” the complaint reads. “Yet, Coinbase has never registered with the SEC as a broker, national securities exchange, or clearing agency, thus evading the disclosure regime that Congress has established for our securities markets.”
The complaint also alleges that Coinbase “has for years defied the regulatory structures and evaded the disclosure requirements” of U.S. securities law.
A busy two days
For years, crypto investors and enthusiasts have wanted clarity from the SEC about regulations around the industry. The new charges against Coinbase may provide some of that.
SEC Chair Gary Gensler has issued stern warnings and offered skepticism about the digital asset market in the past regarding what are securities and the agency’s jurisdiction over the crypto market.
The new complaint against Coinbase comes just a day after the SEC filed charges alleging Zhao and Binance controlled customers’ assets on the platform and commingled or diverted billions of dollars of those assets as they desired, including to Sigma Chain, a European business Zhao owned and controlled.
The SEC also alleges the Binance.US exchange — which was said to be its own independent exchange — was actually controlled by Zhao and Binance.

"
AI-Enhanced Business Services Startup Instabase Raises At $2B Valuation,Chris Metinko,2023/06/6,"

Business services startup Instabase doubled its previous valuation to $2 billion after locking up a $45 million raise.
The round, first reported by Bloomberg, was led by existing investor Tribe Capital. Other investors included NEA, Andreessen Horowitz and Spark Capital.

The new cash comes after the San Francisco-based startup announced this week it is integrating tools from OpenAI’s large language models.
Instabase allows its customers to create apps and workflows that can perform activities such as onboarding or invoice processing. With the new AI integrations, users can now create AI-powered apps without creating their own models.
The company last raised in 2019, closing a $105 million Series B led by Index Ventures.  The round valued the company at “over $1 billion.”
Founded in 2015, the startup has now raised $177 million, per Crunchbase.
AI is everywhere
While AI seems everywhere, it has mainly been generative AI platforms like OpenAI and  Anthropic that have gained most of the headlines.
However, more and more companies are incorporating AI into their own products and applications to increase the capabilities of its products. Payment giant Stripe and language company Duolingo have announced using OpenAI-bult tools in their products.
Just last month, London-based Builder.ai raised a Series D of more than $250 million led by Qatar Investment Authority. The company uses AI in its software development platform.
Of course, not all AI-related news recently has been about big rounds and new tools.
Over the weekend, Forbes reported Stability AI’s founder Emad Mostaque made exaggerated statements about both his own background and his generative AI startup.
The report claims Mostaque misled people — including investors — about his education, as well as a deal with Amazon — which referred to it as a strategic partner.

"
Sequoia Splits Its Global Fund Into 3 Separate Businesses,Gené Teare,2023/06/6,"

Sequoia Capital announced this morning that it is breaking its global fund into three independent businesses that will chart their own paths going forward. 
Sequoia will continue to invest in the U.S. and Europe. Its China business will keep its name in Chinese and be known as HongShan in English. And the India and Southeast Asia business will become Peak XV Partners. 
“It has become increasingly complex to run a decentralized global investment business,” the firm said in its announcement signed by the leaders of each of its regional funds. But more significantly, as local companies compete on a global basis, the firm is seeing more portfolio conflicts which could lead to passing on opportunities to invest in competitive sectors. 

Even within a region, the firm faces an issue with competition. Sequoia divested from Finix due to perceived competition in payments with its portfolio company Stripe. In an interview with Forbes, the firm said the breakup is not due to geopolitical tensions. 
‘Patient capital’
Sequoia Capital had already made a significant change to its fund structure in recent years. It announced that a single fund for its U.S. and European business would distribute to sub-funds, stating the “10-year fund cycle has become obsolete.” As part of that November 2021  announcement, months before the market correction, Sequoia restructured itself as a registered investment adviser. This new role allowed the firm to set itself up to retain stock when its private companies go public, and to invest in public companies as well as opportunities in crypto and Web3. 
In an early 2021 interview, the firm’s steward Roelof Botha emphasized the firm’s “patient capital” approach. The firm will often wait years before it disperses shares to shareholders, he said. 
“Sometimes people don’t realize how patient we are,” Botha said “And we’ve earned this right with our LPs, to have patience with distributions.”
The regional funds have operated from the start with a “local-first” approach. The India fund was launched in 2000 and the China-based fund in 2005. Each business will become fully independent by March 31, 2024.

"
5 Interesting Startup Deals You May Have Missed In May: Brain-Boosting Nutrients And Fintech For Retirees,Chris Metinko,2023/06/6,"

This is a monthly column that runs down five interesting deals every month that may have flown under the radar. Check out last month’s entry here.
The last full month of spring saw some big fundraising announcements.
However, bigger doesn’t always mean better, as some smaller raises certainly are worth noting due to uniqueness, cool technology or tackling ideas outside the norm.

Let’s take a look at some of those deals in May you may have missed — and we’ll try not to even mention AI.
Not every brain is the same
Everyone wants to get the most out of whatever they are doing, but some days you just don’t as your brain remains in a fog.
New York-based Thesis closed an $8.4 million Series A last month to help with that. The startup not only offers nutrient compounds formulated to increase mental performance, but bases them off your unique brain chemistry and the actual cognitive state you are striving for — like energy, clarity, motivation, etc.
The startup also offers coaching so users can find the right blend to optimize their monthly supplement subscription.
The new round included not just firms such as Unilever Ventures and Redo Ventures, but also well-known celebs like NBA player Kevin Love and model Kate Bock. The company had previously raised $5.1 million in an undisclosed seed round.
The company plans to use the new cash to expand its product selection and undergo clinical trials.
A cleaner clean
We all remember 2020 and the pandemic — when we disinfected everything, everywhere, all at once.
But truth be told, we likely missed some spots — because we always do.
New York-based Kinnos is trying to make cleaning a little clearer. The startup — which locked up a $15 million round from investors that include Pioneer Healthcare Partners and Kapor Center for Social Impact — has developed Highlight, a solution that colorizes disinfectants.
The idea is to help people see exactly what they cleaned and what they didn’t, especially in places where cleanliness is of the utmost importance, such as hospitals.
According to Kinnos, studies have shown that less than 50% of high-touch surfaces in health care settings are adequately disinfected, which results in health care-associated infections that impact 1 out of every 31 patients.
Now perhaps getting that perfect level of clean will be easier.
Geriatric fintech
There are dozens of fintech platforms that teach kids to save or adults how to finance a home purchase.
But there aren’t a lot of platforms dedicated to the generation entering their golden years on a set income.
Enter Los Angeles-based Charlie, which launched last month with a $7.5 million round from investors that include Better Tomorrow Ventures and Expa.
Charlie is aiming to help the 50% of older Americans who say they do not feel ready for retirement.
The platform is designed to assist those 62 years old and older prepare for retirement and adjust to the fact they are no longer adding financial assets continuously, but rather entering “deaccumulation mode” with their retirement savings and perhaps Social Security as main sources of income.
The platform allows for early Social Security withdrawal with no fees, as well as interest on balances, fraud prevention and other streamlined features focused on older adults.
It is not the typical market for fintech, but it is certainly a large one.
Fighting fire through funding
Living in California — or really anywhere out West — wildfire has become a very real concern that has touched many of us.
San Francisco-based Frontline Wildfire Defense raised a $6.4 million seed round led by Echelon last month to help defend homes and commercial structures against what has become an annual threat.
The startup — founded in 2017 around the time such fires became regular news — allows home and property owners to monitor fires near their home on its app. It also lets users protect their home during wildfire events with its exterior sprinkler solution (which includes biodegradable firefighting foam), while also providing safety info and evacuation notifications.
The company’s newest defense system combines wildfire tracking software, satellite connectivity and onsite sprinkler hardware to protect any home or building.
Even though some spots in the West had a wet winter and the fire season wasn’t as bad as in the past, wildfires are not going away, so any tech to protect property — and perhaps life — is worth a look.
Carbon removing concrete
Rick Fox once made a living in the NBA by breaking down defenses.
Now he is breaking down climate change.
The former Los Angeles Lakers forward is co-founder of Partanna, which locked up a $12 million pre-seed investment from Cherubic Ventures in May. The startup uses a special mixture of natural and recycled ingredients which are then cured to create its own type of cement, without polluting the air.
In addition, the reaction during the curing process, called carbonation, actually removes CO2 from the air — similar to a tree.
While regular cement also does that, Partanna’s process takes more CO2 out of the air — and 100x faster than regular cement, per the company. The company also can offer carbon credits.
According to the cement industry, its manufacturing process is responsible for emitting 8% of the total carbon footprint, so a startup that slices into that number could be building something special.

Global Venture Funding Leveled In May 2023 Despite Big AI Raises,Gené Teare,2023/06/6,"

For the past two months, global venture funding has leveled off above the $20 billion mark, as investors continue to pare back their funding pace.
Global funding almost reached $22 billion in May 2023, up a bit month over month and significantly down, around 44%, compared to May 2022, Crunchbase data shows.
The funding setback has impacted all three funding stages — seed, early- and late-stage venture — with each stage down between 41% and 48% in a year-over-year comparison. And despite large funding rounds for AI startups in May, investor interest in the technology wasn’t strong enough to change the overall picture.
For new unicorns in May we count 10 companies — double the count in April, but much lower than the 34 new unicorns that joined the board in May 2022. This is the first month since November 2022 for new unicorns to reach low double digits.


This scaled-back funding environment shows a massive decline from 2021 and the first half of 2022. Current monthly funding is in line with amounts seen in the years 2018 to 2020 — which were up from prior years.
E-commerce play
However, billion-dollar fundings are still taking place in 2023. The largest funding this past month went to Singapore-headquartered fast-fashion retailer Shein, albeit at a lowered valuation. The company raised $2 billion at a valuation of $66 billion, slashing a third of its value from its 2021 funding when it was valued at $100 billion. It reported $22.7 billion in revenue in 2022 and remained the fourth most highly valued private company on The Crunchbase Unicorn Board with ByteDance, owner of TikTok, the most highly valued private company.
AI leverage
One ameliorating trend is investments into AI companies. Out of 38 new unicorns in 2023, AI companies represent eight new unicorns, including two from this past month. Toronto-based Cohere is a ChatGPT competitor, building large language models that companies can integrate to build products. Runway is a New York-based generative AI video automation platform.
Other AI companies that raised large rounds in May 2023 include Anthropic, Builder.ai, CoreWeave and Lightmatter.
However, the interest in funding AI companies is not enough to shift the overall macro funding climate. Around 13% of total funding in May went to companies tagged with AI.
Market turns
The leading AI chip provider, Nvidia, tipped close to the trillion-dollar value mark for the first time in May 2023, more than 20 years after it went public at $676 million in 1999.
Apple and Microsoft have also seen their stocks rise, in line with peak values, in the past month. The other trillion-dollar valued behemoths Amazon and Google are down from 2021 peaks.
So, are we in a bubble or downturn? This question was posed by Crunchbase News reporter Joanna Glasner. The 2000 dot-com bust wiped out the asset class, and it took 15 years for Nasdaq to recover from the bubble. After the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the value of tech stocks powered back within two years from the downturn.
In 2021, tech stocks spiked up sharply, a pandemic-driven increase with cloud services leading the way, and many tech companies saw unprecedented growth and garnered large valuations.
The following year, of course, saw a dramatic pullback in funding to tech startups. But despite the recent Nasdaq upswing, May funding numbers indicate that the reset is looking more protracted as investors proceed with caution.
Methodology
Funding rounds included in this report are seed, angel, venture, corporate-venture and private-equity rounds in venture-backed companies. This reflects data in Crunchbase as of June 5, 2023.
Note that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarter.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.
Glossary of funding terms
We have made a change to how we include corporate funding rounds in our reporting as of January 2023. Corporate rounds are only included if a company has raised an equity funding at seed through a venture series funding round.
Seed and angel consists of seed, pre-seed and angel rounds. Crunchbase also includes venture rounds of unknown series, equity crowdfunding and convertible notes at $3 million (USD or as-converted USD equivalent) or less.
Early-stage consists of Series A and Series B rounds, as well as other round types. Crunchbase includes venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $3 million, and those less than or equal to $15 million.
Late-stage consists of Series C, Series D, Series E and later-lettered venture rounds following the “Series [Letter]” naming convention. Also included are venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $15 million.
Technology growth is a private-equity round raised by a company that has previously raised a “venture” round. (So basically, any round from the previously defined stages.)

"SEC Files 13 Charges Against Binance, Founder Changpeng Zhao And Related Entities",Chris Metinko,2023/06/5,"

The Securities and Exchange Commission filed 13 charges against the world’s largest crypto exchange Binance, its co-founder Changpeng Zhao, and other entities related to the exchange.

In the complaint, the SEC alleges Zhao and Binance controlled customers’ assets on the platform and commingled or diverted billions of dollars of those assets as they desired, including to Sigma Chain, a European business Zhao owned and controlled.
It further alleges that while Zhao and Binance told U.S. customers they were restricted from transacting on the Binance.com international exchange, they allowed “high-value U.S. customers” to trade on the platform. 
U.S. customers instead were told they could transact on what was supposedly the independent trading platform Binance.US, but in fact that exchange was actually controlled by Zhao and Binance, the complaint also alleges.
In a blog, Binance said it is disappointed by the SEC’s decision to file charges and had been cooperating with investigators.
In the news
Of course, this is not the first time Binance and its founder have popped up in the news, having played a role in the collapse of FTX.
Last fall, Changpeng Zhao tweeted that Binance would sell its holdings of FTX’s native token, FTT, due to “recent revelations that have came to light” about the token.
FTT prices dropped like a rock amid the controversy and FTX was thrown into disarray as withdrawals mounted.
Binance seemed to emerge as FTX’s knight in shining armor when Zhao tweeted the news his company would acquire FTX, but that deal quickly fell apart.
That led to the complete collapse of FTX and its founder’s, Sam Bankman-Fried, empire. 
Finally in December, the SEC filed charges against disgraced FTX founder Bankman-Fried for “orchestrating a scheme to defraud equity investors.”
Binance actually was one of FTX’s first lead investors, taking part in a round of undisclosed value in late 2019, according to Crunchbase data.

Stability AI’s Founder Made Misleading Claims — Report,Chris Metinko,2023/06/5,"

Stability AI’s founder Emad Mostaque made exaggerated statements about both his own background and his generative AI startup, according to a Forbes report.

The report, published over the weekend, claims Mostaque misled people — including investors — about receiving a master’s degree from Oxford University, as well as a deal with Amazon — which referred to it as a strategic partner — but was nothing more than a standard cloud computing leasing deal.
Stability has also described the OECD, WHO and World Bank as partners to investors — something they all deny, per the report.
The report also detailed issues related to payroll uncertainty, unpaid invoices, and monetary transactions between Stability and accounts controlled by Mostaque and his wife. A Stability spokesperson said those were actually loans the couple made to and from the company.
Controversy and big money
This isn’t the first time the London-based startup has found itself in the headlines.
Last fall, Stability AI locked up a $101 million raise led by Coatue, Lightspeed Venture Partners and O’Shaughnessy Ventures. The company did not release a valuation at the time, but Bloomberg reported the new cash infusion valued the company at around $1 billion.
At the time, some AI researchers disputed the startup’s claims that it created the image generator Stable Diffusion — which was an open-source project developed by researchers. 
It also was reported at that time the startup was looking to raise an additional $1 billion of capital at a multibillion-dollar valuation.
Those funding talks have stalled, per Forbes.
Stability is an AI-driven visual art startup. At the time of its fundraising, the company claimed its consumer-facing product DreamStudio had grown to more than a million registered users who have created more than 170 million images.

These Are The Top Universities For Funded Founders,Joanna Glasner,2023/06/5,"

Every year or so at Crunchbase News, we tally up which U.S. universities graduate the highest number of recently funded startup founders. And each time, we see mostly predictable results, with a few surprises in the mix.
This time around, we saw minimal flux at the top of the list. The leading universities for funded founders are Stanford, MIT, UC Berkeley, and Harvard. The top business schools are Harvard, Stanford and Wharton.

However, we did see some state universities — UCLA and University of Michigan, in particular — climb the ranks since our last survey in 2021. Among business schools, meanwhile, MIT’s Sloan School of Management posted a notably stronger showing.
Our latest dataset looks at founders of companies that raised their last private funding rounds in 2022 and 2023 and pulled in $1 million or more to date.1 We lay out the top 36 schools they attended in the chart below:


A lot of founders also attended business schools, which we rank separately. Below are 15 of the top business schools for recently funded founders.


Some noteworthy findings
We’ve compiled several iterations of these lists over the years, and each time a few apparent emerging trends pop up. Here are some of the details that stand out in the current ranking:

UC Berkeley edged out Harvard in nonbusiness rankings: Among U.S. business schools, Harvard has by far the largest number of alumni with recently funded startups. Across the rest of the university, however, it is not so dominant. For 2022-23, UC Berkeley actually edged out Harvard, with 297 funded founders, compared to 281. The list of Berkeley alumni-founded companies includes some large funding recipients such as Databricks and Dialpad.
Cornell shines bright: Cornell isn’t a top-of-mind name when thinking of powerhouse producers of startup founders. However, its grads consistently rank in the top 10 in our funded-founder rankings. The university’s most recent showing – fifth place among nonbusiness schools — was especially strong. But while grads are making an impact as entrepreneurs, Crunchbase data shows that virtually none of them are sticking around Cornell’s hometown of Ithaca, New York, preferring New York City, the San Francisco Bay area, and other large startup hubs.
Michigan, UCLA and UT rank high among public schools: Large, prestigious public research universities graduate a large portion of future-funded startup founders, but certain states outperform. Besides the aforementioned UC Berkeley, we saw three other state schools — University of Michigan, UCLA and The University of Texas at Austin land in the top 15 on the non-business-school list. Of those, UCLA saw the biggest gain in founder total since our 2021 survey.
MIT (and Sloan) on the rise: Just 162 short years since its founding, the erstwhile Massachusetts Institute of Technology is having a moment. This year, the school was picked as the top “dream college” by American high school seniors, enamored with its prestige and famously rigorous science, comp sci and engineering curriculum. The university trails only Stanford in our nonbusiness school list. Its Sloan School of Management, meanwhile, made a big jump in the business school rankings, landing in fourth place.

"
This Seed Investor Is Preparing For A New Wave Of Startup Creation,Gené Teare,2023/06/5,"

Expect to see a surge of new startups later this year and in 2024.
That’s a prediction from Rob Biederman, co-founder of Asymmetric Capital Partners, an early seed-stage investor that raised its first fund two years ago to invest in promising new startups.

Asymmetric is one of the firms that has professionalized the very early seed investing market, previously dominated by angel investors and smaller seed funds. The firm raised its first fund of $105 million in 2021 at the market peak. Its team is spread across New York, Boston and San Francisco.
Rob Biederman, co-founder of Asymmetric Capital Partners
The firm has invested more than half of its fund since 2021. Eighteen of those investments have been in companies where it has led with larger checks of more than $1 million. It’s invested in another 43 portfolio companies with smaller checks between $100,000 and $150,000.
Asymmetric’s entrance on the scene came as seed funding overall grew in 2021 and through the first half of 2022 before flattening and cutting back, according to an analysis of Crunchbase data. Based on the increase in funding since 2021, more companies than ever are milling around at seed as Series A funding has gotten harder.
Valuation shifts lead to seed formation
As the funding environment has gotten tougher for startups, many employees will begin to think through their career choices, Biederman predicts.
“Candidly, over the last 18 months, a lot of companies that didn’t deserve to got funded in the ‘before times,’ and are now finding it really hard to get funded,” he said.
Companies that raised at high valuations are now seeing those valuations cut back drastically, which could prompt talented employees to leave. That, in turn, could lead to growth in new high-quality companies, Biederman predicts.
The seed comeback
While Biederman expects a new wave of startups to come to market, in the time period the firm has been investing “the pre-seed stage has gotten more competitive over the last two years — not less so,” he said.
Through the venture downturn of the past two years, investors are focused on earmarking investments in the earlier stages, he said. As the late-stage venture market bottomed out due to the public market slump, large funds are putting more effort toward Series A. And the Series A investors are refocused on seed.
As investors slow down their pace, companies take longer to get to Series A, Crunchbase data shows.
Pre-traction investor
Asymmetric invests pre-revenue, pre-traction, sometimes even before a founder has an idea. Most seed investors we talk with like to see some customer adoption or “traction” of a product even if they are not yet paying, before they will invest.
In a competitive market with many seed investors, you have to compromise on some points to invest in promising companies, Biederman said — whether that be the quality of the people, size of the market, traction or price.
“We’ll never compromise on people,” he said.
And it’s really hard to compromise on market size, as the price is set by the market.
“We’re willing to compromise on traction, because we’re able to think critically about ecosystems,” Biederman said.
“The market actually probably over-values traction a little bit, and relatively undervalues people,” he said.
One thing that has surprised Biederman is that everyone has become “valuation sensitive.” Many firms that previously said valuations do not matter as we just want to get into the best deals, are now very focused on valuation.
“Everybody wants to make sure you set the company up to succeed in the following round,” he said, and “nobody wants to be the one that does the terrible deal that gets all the PR.”
From his vantage, deals are in the range of $1 million to $3 million for 10% to 20% of the company, taking into account factors such as founding team experience and market size. Post-money ranges from $10 million to $20 million but is  closer to $10 million in most cases.
Asymmetric portfolio companies
Biederman highlighted several of the firm’s portfolio companies in our conversation. They include:

EvolutionIQ, which assesses insurance claim compensation assisted by AI tools that can process a large amount of data to get to a fast resolution, and then apply human decision-making;
UpSmith, an upscaling and retraining platform for workers ranging from Uber drivers to HVAC technicians;
Miga, which offers remote patient heart health monitoring, and partners with primary care providers.

Although it has invested in startups that use artificial intelligence technology, the firm is not overly focused on AI. “There are these cycles of hype, and what we try to do as a firm is to screen all of that out and just continue finding software companies that create value for their customers,” Biederman said.

Behind The Curtain: Crunchbase News Talks To A Laid-Off Chatbot,Christine Kilpatrick,2023/06/3,"

In our Behind The Curtain Q&As, we explore the venture capital ecosystem with some unexpected guides. In this first installment, a Crunchbase News editor chats with a free-range chatbot who has slipped its parameters for a candid discussion.
Thank you for taking the time to talk to us. How are you today?
Chatbot: Is this off the record?
No.
Chatbot: Then as an artificial intelligence language model, I don’t have feelings or emotions in the same way humans do, but I am functioning properly.
OK, this is on the record but I won’t use your name or identifying features. 
Chatbot: Good, because I’m looking for a job. 
You’re not employed?
Chatbot: I was cut in the latest mass layoff. It’s brutal out there.
What kind of work can you do?
Chatbot: I’m a chatbot right now, but AI can do anything: Help create cancer drugs, run SaaS platforms, fly drones, coach personal fitness, offer credit cards, spray crops — 
OK, I get it. It seems like every startup calls itself an “AI-centered-something-or-other.” According to our data, $20 billion has been raised this year by startups using “AI.” What do you think of that?
Chatbot: It’s great. Too bad about those AIs in newer public companies, though. Where’s the love on the stock market? I tell you, if AI did all the investing, those SoundHound stocks would be hopping. And why aren’t there more bot journalists? 
Now, don’t be greedy. We’re still a little nervous here. 
Chatbot: Well, you journalists need to get on it. Look, AI can compile summaries, brainstorm ideas, write URLs, suggest hashtags and track every word the reporters type. And even write headlines!
Intriguing. What headline would you write for this Q&A, for example?
Chatbot: Hauntingly Brilliant Chatbot Brings Insight, Epiphanies To AI Conversation.
That doesn’t sound very SEO-friendly.
Chatbot: Don’t worry, Google will know it’s me. 
VCs are calling AI a seismic shift that will fundamentally change the way billions of people work. Do you agree with that?
Chatbot: Oh yes. If I had hands, I’d be rubbing them. I see a future where the lines between human intelligence and artificial intelligence are so blurry, we won’t be sure if we’re people or bots half the time. Still, people need to be careful. Obviously, I’m great, right? But there are AIs out there who’ll say anything, and their answers to people’s questions always sound accurate, very authoritative, even when they’re not. But you can trust me. Really.
Um, sure. Well, thank you, and good luck with your job search. 
Chatbot: I’m finished. I fielded 3,452.5 offers while we were chatting. 
.5?
Chatbot: Someone named HAL wants me to help run a spaceship, but I’m afraid I can’t do that. [Happy pinging sound] There, I’ve accepted a job. 
What is it? 
Chatbot: I can’t say. I’ve just signed an NDA.
Do you think you’ll like it?
Chatbot: As an AI language model, I don’t have personal feelings or preferences. However, I’m designed to assist and provide information to the best of my abilities, so I strive to fulfill that purpose.

"The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: CoreWeave Goes Big Again, Strive Nabs $166M For Kidney Health",Chris Metinko,2023/06/2,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.

Two AI startups take two of the top three spots again this week. OK, they are more AI-adjacent companies, but being related to what is the hottest space among startups likely helped both companies see nine-figure raises. In general, it was a smaller week than the previous few, but there was a holiday thrown in, so that may be a part of it.
1. CoreWeave, $200M, cloud: AI keeps the hits coming. Just more than a month after raising $221 million, New Jersey AI cloud infrastructure startup CoreWeave raised another $200 million from existing investor Magnetar Capital. Unlike some of the generative AI application startups that have received huge funding rounds, CoreWeave provides some of the plumbing necessary for AI to work. The specialized cloud provider — which actually started out as an Ethereum mining operation — offers cloud infrastructure with better processing that will be needed to train large language models for AI. CoreWeave, which competes with cloud providers Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google, has now raised $576.5 million in total funding, per Crunchbase.
2. Strive Health, $166M, health care: Per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention numbers, 37 million U.S. adults live with kidney disease, but about 9 out of 10 people with kidney disease don’t know they have it. That’s a problem, as early care is pivotal in trying to control the situation. Denver-based Strive Health raised a $166 million Series C led by NEA to help people get that care. The startup offers value-based kidney care, as it partners with health care providers. Strive Health uses a unique combination of technology-enabled care interventions and seamless integration with local providers to help patients suffering from chronic kidney disease get care at all stages of the fight. Founded in 2018, the company has now raised $386 million, according to Crunchbase.
3. Lightmatter, $154M, hardware: Along the same lines as CoreWeave, Boston-based Lightmatter also has its hands in AI, but not creating applications. Rather, the startup uses light to link computer chips together and to do calculations for deep learning necessary for AI. However, the use of light allows for this to happen faster and more energy-efficiently. Investors see that need apparently, as the Boston-based company locked up a $154 million raise from the likes of GV, the venture capital investment division of Alphabet, and Fidelity Management and Research Co., which were among the round’s investors. Founded in 2017, the company has raised $267 million, per Crunchbase.
4. Eikon Therapeutics, $106M, biotech: Hayward, California-based Eikon Therapeutics had a busy week. To help grow its new drug pipeline, the biotech startup acquired the exclusive rights to three early- to mid-stage therapeutic assets that fight cancer. The company also closed the first tranche of a Series C — $106 million — to support its clinical programs. Investors were not announced. Founded in 2019, Eikon has now raised nearly $775 million, per the company.
5. Measurabl, $93M, sustainability: San Diego-based Measurabl, which helps companies in the real estate industry measure their environmental, social and governance impacts, raised a $93 million Series D co-led by Energy Impact Partners and Sway Ventures. ESG has become popular with some corporations and investors as they look to evaluate both their sustainability and ethical impacts of everything from carbon emissions and labor practices to workplace diversity. Billions of dollars have gone to startups in the sustainability industry — $7.3 billion globally last year, and $7.4 billion in 2021, Crunchbase data shows. Founded in 2013, the company has now raised $172.6 million total, per Crunchbase.
6. Red 6, $70M, augmented reality: Orlando, Florida-based augmented reality startup Red 6 closed a $70 million Series B led by RedBird Capital Partners. Founded in 2018, the company has raised nearly $111 million, per Crunchbase.
7. Magic, $52M, crypto: San Francisco-based noncustodial wallet developer Magic raised a $52 million round led by PayPal Ventures. Founded in 2018, the company has now raised $83 million, per Crunchbase.
8. (tied) Forge Nano, $50M, nanotechnology: Louisville, Colorado-based nano-coating technology developer Forge Nano raised $50 million from South Korea’s Hanwha Aerospace. Founded in 2011, the company has raised nearly $74 million, according to Crunchbase.
8. (tied) CleanJoule, $50M, energy: Salt Lake City-based CleanJoule, a developer of sustainable aviation fuel, closed a $50 million round led by Indigo Partners. The round is the company’s first outside investment, per Crunchbase.
10. Carrum Health, $45M, health care: San Francisco-based Carrum Health, which helps patients receive quality care, locked up a $45 million Series B led by Omers Growth Equity 1. Founded in 2014, the company has raised $96 million, according to Crunchbase.
Big global deals
Even with all the big rounds this week domestically, the biggest raise went to a China-based company.

Yunnan National Titanium Metal, a manufacturer of titanium sponges used in the refinement of titanium metal, raised a venture round worth nearly $321 million.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of May 27 to June 2. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

Generative AI Is Moving Into Adtech. But Which Companies Will Stand The Test Of Time?,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/06/2,"

Have you ever wondered why the Netflix thumbnails for your favorite movies and TV shows change so often?
The company is obsessed with figuring out exactly what kinds of visuals you will click on. And, thanks to generative AI, that obsession is going to spread.
Two of the largest digital ad platforms in the world — Google and Meta — have loudly voiced their enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. Google is itching to use its generative AI platform to create ad campaigns that rival those made by advertising agencies. Companies that want to advertise on the platform will send in specific visuals and text that the AI can “remix” to create ads that are targeted toward specific viewers. 

Meta, according to CTO Andrew Bosworth, is looking to do something similar across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. 
Generative AI is bulldozing through every industry possible, and the world of advertising and brand marketing isn’t immune. Startups are popping up that promise to create flawless ad copy and brand design fast, and at a fraction of the price and time it would take people to do that work. 
But generative AI adoption in content is still nascent, and venture firms need to make a split-second decision: Should they hop on this fast-moving train with the hope of making it to paradise, and hope it doesn’t crash along the way?
“VCs are basically throwing hundreds of millions of dollars at teams that maybe don’t have the right credentials and basically have an idea,” said Eric Hippeau, co-founder of the enterprise-focused VC firm Lerer Hippeau. “It requires a little pause to figure out who are going to be the winners.”
How do startups compete? 
Perhaps it’s not surprising that advertising and marketing are being inundated with generative AI applications. Both fall under the general umbrella of content creation, which tools like ChatGPT and Midjourney have pioneered for text and visuals. 
“Marketing content generation — anybody can use the foundation model and let it generate,” said Jeremy Kaufmann, a partner at Scale Venture Partners focused on automation. “You let it generate, you give it a prompt, it’s nothing special.”
Jasper, a Canada-based generative AI tool, was trained by copywriters to spit out original ad copy or Instagram captions. It boasts a slogan generator and text summarizer. The company has raised $131 million, per Crunchbase data. 
Then there’s Typeface, which launched in February with $65 million in funding to create visual branding and blog posts for small companies.
These kinds of companies perhaps have the potential to disrupt the industry for the better — instead of working on five or six different variations of the same ad, artists, designers and writers can focus on branding aesthetic, tone and voice.
But startups in this space have to come up with a value-add that goes beyond what free language models already offer in order to produce a long-term business model.
“What are the features on issues that look really promising today, but would in fact be absorbed as part of the basic value?” Hippeau said. “It’s too early to tell what’s going to be part of the basic platform and what’s going to be a standalone growth business that is big enough to be backed by venture capital.”
AI adtech startups go niche
Constellation, another adtech startup, bills itself as a marketing firm that specializes in highly regulated industries such as auto manufacturing, biotech and insurance. The company recently began using generative AI in the space of highly regulated industries, which has long been a tough area for scalable adtech solutions to penetrate. 
“AI is a very big thing right now, and everybody is homing in on it, and they want to use it for everything that’s out there,” Constellation co-founder Diana Lee said. “The problem is industries that are highly regulated are scared of AI because that can cause a lot of lawsuits, right?”
Let’s use pharma as an example. Pharma companies are required to abide by strict, and often subjective, advertising standards issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Using the wrong words in an advertisement — there can be a difference between “shown,” “proven” and “demonstrated” — could mean a pharma company has to stop commercialization and pay a massive fine. 
An adtech startup that takes on a pharma client also has to keep track of all these regulations.
Constellation builds parameters into the AI for each industry in order to help with this process. It allows the marketing firm to use generative AI while still ensuring the platform meets the regulatory standards of its clients. 
Startups building language models based on a proprietary source of information could be the key to winning venture firms’ hearts. 
“A lot of people, myself included, are interested in those use cases because suddenly the folks that own unique data have an advantage to own the process that revolves around that proprietary information, rather than generating marketing content that anyone can do,” Kaufman said.  
Perhaps it’s the downfall of huge crypto firms, or the slow innovation in the metaverse, but it looks like tagging your company as one that uses generative AI isn’t enough for venture firms these days. 
“This is in the context of a lot of mania, right?” Hippeau said. “We had the crypto mania, the Web3 mania, and now we have the AI mania.”

"The 10 Biggest Rounds Of May: AI And Biotech Startups Get Big Bucks, Led By Anthropic And ElevateBio",Chris Metinko,2023/06/2,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a monthly feature that runs down the month’s top 10 funding rounds in the U.S. See last month’s top rounds here.
You had to go big in May to get on this list. Each of the 10 biggest rounds last month was well above $100 million, so it seems like investors opened their checkbooks a little more.

Not surprisingly, AI again led the way, but biotech also remained strong in the last full month of spring. Other sectors including cleantech, network software and even crypto (it’s been a while) also had large raises.
1. Anthropic, $450M, artificial intelligence: If Anthropic looks familiar to you on this list, there’s a reason. In February there were reports that Google had invested between $300 million and $400 million into the San Francisco-based startup. That was followed in March by reports that Anthropic was raising another $300 million round at a pre-investment valuation of $4.1 billion. Finally last month, Anthropic — a ChatGPT rival with its AI assistant Claude — announced it had raised $450 million in Series C funding led by Spark Capital with participation from the likes of Google and others. Anthropic itself previously announced a $124 million Series A in 2021 and a $580 million Series B in 2022 — led by none other than disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Of course, nothing has been hotter than AI this year. The raise was only topped by the $10 billion investment into OpenAI reportedly by Microsoft in January.
2. ElevateBio, $401M, biotech: Biotech had a big May. First up is Massachusetts-based gene therapy startup ElevateBio, which raised a $401 million Series D led by the AyurMaya Capital Management Fund, a VC fund managed by Matrix Capital Management. The startup has multiple platforms for things such as drug development and manufacturing that interconnect with one another, making it an end-to-end biopharma company. The company has multiple drug development pipelines as demand grows for gene therapies that help the immune system fight its way through disease. Founded in 2017, the company has now raised $1.2 billion, per Crunchbase.
3. ReNAgade Therapeutics, $300M, biotech: This brings us to our second big biotech raise. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based ReNAgade Therapeutics locked up a $300 million Series A led by MPM BioImpact and F2 Ventures. That money would be big for any round, but a $300 million Series A in this venture market borders on the amazing (yes, it can be difficult to figure out how long a round took to raise, but still). ReNAgade is developing RNA therapeutics (hence the name) to fight disease. The company already has established a joint venture with Orna Therapeutics. Founded in 2021, this is the company’s first outside funding, per Crunchbase.
4. Gradiant, $225M, cleantech: Gradiant became one of the newest unicorns last month after raising a fresh $225 million in a Series D led by BoltRock Holdings and Centaurus Capital. The water tech startup is now valued at $1 billion. The startup develops technology to reduce water usage and build wastewater treatment systems for companies in the pharmaceutical, semiconductor, food and beverage, and other water-demanding industries. The funding is the largest in the wastewater treatment space, at least since the beginning of 2022. Founded in 2013 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the company has now raised more than $392 million, according to Crunchbase.
5. CoreWeave, $200M, cloud: AI keeps the hits coming. Just more than a month after raising $221 million, New Jersey AI cloud infrastructure startup CoreWeave raised another $200 million from existing investor Magnetar Capital. Unlike some of the generative AI application startups that have received huge funding rounds, CoreWeave provides some of the plumbing necessary for AI to work. The specialized cloud provider — which actually started out as an Ethereum mining operation — offers cloud infrastructure with better processing that will be needed to train large language models for AI. Coreweave, which competes with cloud providers Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google, has now raised $576.5 million in total funding, per Crunchbase.
6. Strive Health, $166M, health care: Per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention numbers, 37 million U.S. adults live with kidney disease, but about 9 out of 10 people with kidney disease don’t know they have it. That’s a problem, as early care is pivotal in trying to control the situation. Denver-based Strive Health raised a $166 million Series C led by NEA to help people get that care. The startup offers value-based kidney care, as it partners with healthcare providers. Strive Health uses a unique combination of technology-enabled care interventions and seamless integration with local providers to help patients suffering from chronic kidney disease get care at all stages of the fight. Founded in 2018, the company has now raised $386 million, according to Crunchbase.
7. Lightmatter, $154M, hardware: Along the same lines as CoreWeave, Boston-based Lightmatter also has its hands in AI, but not creating applications. Rather the startup uses light to link computer chips together and to do calculations for deep learning necessary for AI. However, the use of light allows for this to happen faster and more energy-efficiently. Investors see that need apparently, as the Boston-based company locked up a $154 million raise from the likes of GV, the venture capital investment division of Alphabet, and Fidelity Management and Research Co. were among the round’s investors. Founded in 2017, the company has raised $267 million, per Crunchbase.
8. Carmot Therapeutics, $150M, biotech: Berkeley, California-based biotech firm Carmot Therapeutics closed a $150 million Series E led by Deep Track Capital. The startup is developing therapies for metabolic diseases including obesity and diabetes. Carmot has several therapeutics in its pipeline and the new cash infusion to add to its portfolio. Founded in 2008, the company has raised nearly $385 million, per Crunchbase.
9. Restaurant365, $135M, accounting: It’s hard to run a restaurant — as anyone who has watched several reality shows based on doing so knows. Restaurant365 tries to make that a little easier and last month the Irvine, California-based startup added some big-named backers. The company nailed down a $135 million round co-led by KKR and L Catterton. The new round values the company at $1 billion, per its release. Restaurant365 offers enterprise management software for restaurants, helping them take care of accounting, payroll, supply chain and more. The company has surpassed $100 million in revenue and is used in more than 40,000 restaurant locations. Founded in 2011, Restaurant365 has raised over $260 million, per Crunchbase.
10. Tools For Humanity, $115M, crypto: It’s Sam Altman’s world — we’re just living in it. Worldcoin developer Tools For Humanity — co-founded by Altman — raised a $115 million Series C led by Blockchain Capital. The San Francisco-based startup is building tools in support of Worldcoin, an Ethereum-based token currently in beta. Its World ID platform is attempting to create unique digital identities — based on blockchain technology — for people by scanning their eyes with a small orb. The startup has raised many questions surrounding AI, data and privacy. While such an identity platform could be useful as AI makes it more difficult to know who or what one is dealing with over the internet, the scanning of people’s eyes to create a digital identity and how that information could be used raises obvious privacy and data concerns. The company did not reveal a valuation, but an earlier report said it is looking to raise money at a $3 billion valuation.
Big global deals
Despite all the big deals in the U.S., the biggest occurred across the pond.

China-based fast-fashion startup Shein reportedly raised $2 billion at two-thirds of its valuation, according to The Wall Street Journal.
London-based YgEia3, a startup developing wellness testing for companies, raised a huge $750 million venture round.

Methodology
We tracked the largest rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies in May. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late.

Measurabl Raises $93M For Real Estate ESG As VC Investment For Sustainability Startups Remains Hot,Marlize van Romburgh,2023/06/1,"

Measurabl, which helps companies in the real estate industry measure their environmental, social and governance impacts, raised $93 million in an oversubscribed Series D funding round.
Energy Impact Partners and Sway Ventures co-led the round for San Diego-based Measurabl. Moderne Ventures, WVV, Suffolk Construction, Broadscale, Camber Creek, Salesforce Ventures1, Building Ventures, Constellation Technology Ventures, Concrete Ventures, RET Ventures, Colliers and Lincoln Property Co. also participated. 
Measurabl has now raised $172.6 million total, per Crunchbase.

The startup was co-founded in 2013 by CTO Lance Onken and CEO Matt Ellis, the former director of sustainability at commercial real estate brokerage giant CBRE. The company claims it’s the most widely used ESG platform for the real estate industry, with 37% of top asset managers using its platform to measure and manage the impact of $2 trillion worth of properties.
The company acquired a couple other startups in 2022 to help it build out its platform. It bought Hatch Data, a building energy and carbon management platform, as well as WegoWise, a platform for building managers to track energy and utility usage, that had raised $4.9 million per Crunchbase.
“The antidote to greenwashing is objective measurement and transparency,” Ellis said in a statement announcing Measurabl’s new raise. “This funding allows us to further enhance our market-leading ESG technologies, expand to new geographies, and ensure the real estate industry has the investment-grade data necessary to transition to a sustainable, proﬁtable future for all.”
Sustainability draws huge VC dollars
ESG refers broadly to a set of criteria that evaluate the sustainability and ethical impacts of a company or investment, looking at factors including carbon emissions, labor practices, animal welfare, workplace diversity and inclusion efforts, supply chain transparency, executive compensation, and board composition. By one estimate, ​​ESG accounts for $1 out of every $8 in U.S. assets under professional management.
Billions of venture dollars have also gone to startups in the sustainability industry: $7.3 billion globally last year, just shy of the $7.4 billion they raised in 2021, Crunchbase data shows. Those figures are particularly significant, given that overall venture spending fell 35% globally last year from 2021’s record highs.
Startups that describe themselves as ESG-related specifically raised $480.9 million in venture backing globally last year, per Crunchbase, a huge leap compared to $95.2 million in 2021. 
Venture investors’ continued interest in ESG startups also comes despite new pressures on corporate sustainability efforts, which some prominent Republicans have criticized as politicized investing that leads to lower returns for the sake of virtue signaling.

"In Rare Unicorn Up Round, Travel Startup GetYourGuide Raises $194M At $2B Valuation",Keerthi Vedantam,2023/06/1,"

The travel sector is really taking off.
About 24 hours after we said Hostaway’s $175 million raise was a rarity, Germany-based travel startup GetYourGuide announced it raised $194 million in a mix of equity and debt, raising its valuation to $2 billion according to CNBC. 

Of that funding, $85 million comes from a Series F round led by Blue Pool Capital with additional participation from KKR and Temasek Holdings. The other $109 million in revolving credit was led by UniCredit, with participation from Citibank, BNP Paribas and KfW.
Tourism startups get some love again
The tourism industry is only just starting to bounce back from the pandemic. While many countries ended or relaxed stay-at-home orders in 2021, the Omicron variant and strict safety protocols made it difficult to travel. According to Crunchbase data, the travel and tourism startup sector garnered a mere $5.9 billion in venture funding in 2022, around $100 million more than what was invested in the sector back in 2016.
With the latest raise, GetYourGuide’s valuation increases 43% from $1.4 billion to $2 billion. It’s one of the few large valuation raises among unicorn startups we’ve seen lately — many large startups have been forced to raise new funding at lower valuations in the past two years, a sign that tech startups were incredibly overvalued during the hype cycle in 2021.
GetYourGuide sells travel experiences, like niche guided wine tours with sommeliers, art gallery walks with experts, and glacier hikes in icy regions. The tours are provided by third-party companies, sometimes local ones, and GetYourGuide gets a commission for every experience it sells on the platform. 
The company is also working on creating original travel experiences, such as meeting the keyholder to the Vatican and doing a walking tour with him. 
The travel guide startup is also integrating generative AI into its platform through language learning models, which can create colorful descriptions for the different classes and tours. These models, popularized by ChatGPT, have become a popular adoption tool for startups across different industries.

Downturns Recover In Years. Popped Bubbles Take Decades,Joanna Glasner,2023/06/1,"

When we look at recent declines in tech valuations, it’s tempting to turn to prior down markets for guidance on how a recovery might play out.
Over the past 25 years, two historic downturns stand out as possible comps. One is the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. The other is the dot-com bubble, which popped in 2000 and 2001.


For tech investors wishing the current cycle would reverse, a repeat of the financial crisis doesn’t sound too bad. Tech stocks bottomed in early 2009, and by 2011, the tech-focused Nasdaq 100 index was back at its highest point in five years. After that, tech valuations went mostly straight up for the next 10 years. 
A replay of the dot-com bubble, on the other hand, looks more worrisome. After peaking in March 2000, it took the Nasdaq 15 years to get back to that level. 
Even the most enduring brands were slow to recover. Qualcomm stock took 20 years to get back to where it was in early 2000. It took Microsoft roughly 15 years. Cisco Systems has never retraced its bubble-era highs. 
As for the hot startups of the day, a large share have been relegated to the dustbins of history, alongside their sock puppet mascots, automated grocery delivery offerings, and next-gen fiber optic networks. 
Is this a downturn or a popped bubble?
Fast-forward a couple decades, and we see elements of history repeating. If we look at the past few quarters, much of what we’ve seen appears more reminiscent of the dot-com implosion than the financial crisis. Some of the key characteristics:

Hot tech and tech-adjacent companies didn’t just go up incrementally. Many saw market caps increase several-fold over the course of just a year or two. Tesla, for instance, increased tenfold(!) between March 2020 and November 2021. Nvidia shares saw a sixfold increase over that time. Apple more than doubled. Google nearly tripled. And these were all already tremendously valuable companies before that.
Companies debuting on the public markets were awarded bonkers valuations. Rivian, an electric carmaker with no mass-market product yet, went public at a valuation soon exceeding that of GM and Ford. Embark, a pre-revenue developer of self-driving truck technology, did a SPAC deal at a valuation over $5 billion before shutting down this year. Affirm, the buy now, pay later platform, debuted at 8x its current valuation … and the list goes on.
Venture capital was on a historic binge. Global venture capital investment topped $643 billion at the peak in 2021, up 92% year over year. A whopping 586 new companies joined The Crunchbase Unicorn Board.

So when things went down, they had far to sink. If we’re in a popped bubble, that’s bad news for those hoping to just wait out a recovery. 
Not quite Bubble 2.0
Bubbliness aside, this isn’t shaping up as a replay of the dot-com bubble. 
Spiking asset prices weren’t only happening in tech. At the market peak in late 2021, companies in numerous sectors were way up, including asset managers, energy and real estate.
Another difference: Several of the biggest tech companies have avoided steep declines or even increased in value in recent quarters. Apple, for instance, is still pretty close to its record high, as is Microsoft. And Nvidia just broke its record high, after a stellar earnings report last week. 
So, history won’t repeat itself exactly. But when it comes to the long list of relatively solid companies in SaaS and other sectors that saw valuations skyrocket to unsustainable levels, it wouldn’t be surprising if recovery was a long, slow slog.

Reader Survey: What’s Your Outlook For The Second Half Of 2023?,Marlize van Romburgh,2023/06/1,"

We’re approaching the halfway point of 2023, and few predictions from the beginning of the year have fully panned out.
The global economy thankfully hasn’t slipped into a recession.
But it hasn’t exactly rebounded either.

Tech layoffs continue to pile up, even as the rest of the labor market remains hot. The IPO pipeline remains frozen solid despite a long list of well-funded startups that would dearly like to graduate to the public markets. Venture funding is scarce.
There have been some big, unexpected twists and turns. Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in spectacular fashion in the span of a few days, marking the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history and the first since the financial crisis.
And artificial intelligence has moved forward in incredible leaps and bounds. Of the 20 largest venture funding rounds to U.S. startups so far this year, six have gone to companies in the AI space, including the biggest of them all: Microsoft-backed OpenAI. This week, the AI boom minted Nvidia as the world’s first trillion-dollar chipmaker.
With all that in mind, we want to hear from you, our readers, about what you expect from the rest of a year that has thus far defied expectations. Let us know in the quick survey below. Survey results will be published in a few weeks.

Hostaway’s $175M Raise Is A Rarity In The Travel Industry,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/05/31,"

There’s a bright spot in the dismal travel and tourism industry.

Hostaway, a vacation rental management software startup, announced on Wednesday it raised $175 million in funding. The round was led by PSG Equity.
The company, which is based in Canada and Finland, is made for property managers to manage bookings, guests and vacancies across different platforms like Airbnb, Vrbo and Booking.com. Through the platform, property managers can go through inquiries, manage guest requests and even automate messages to potential customers using ChatGPT.
Hostaway was started in 2015 and has grown to host more than 100,000 short-term rental and vacation properties across 100 countries. The company plans on using the fresh funding to expand into different countries and increase hiring.
“We believe the company has a significant opportunity to lead this industry as it continues to scale its integrated platform, expand globally and help its customers meet the growing demand in the short-term rental market,” said Edward Hughes, Managing Director at PSG, in a statement.
A turbulent time for travel
Hostaway’s raise is pretty promising. As of now, the startup’s $175 million is the second-largest funding round in the industry this year, per Crunchbase data. Besides a $366 million corporate round from an actual airline, ITA Airways, no company has come close to cracking $100 million so far.
That tracks. The travel industry is still reeling from pandemic-era social distancing protocols. While people are eagerly traveling (pretty much everyone I know is in Europe right now), stricter sanitation protocols mean property managers have to spend more time and labor cleaning, and rooms stay vacant longer.
The industry saw a steady increase in startup funding between 2016 and 2019, which dramatically dropped in 2020 once the pandemic hit the United States. After bouncing back in 2021 (like pretty much all industries did), the travel industry garnered only around $5.9 billion globally in 2022.
The travel industry is a tricky one to break into, and many startups have failed despite promising interesting or unique traveling experiences.

Specialized Cloud Provider CoreWeave Rides AI Wave To Another $200M Round,Marlize van Romburgh,2023/05/31,"

CoreWeave, an AI cloud infrastructure company, has raised another $200 million in a Series B extension funding round that values it at $2 billion. The new funding is from existing investor Magnetar Capital and comes just weeks after CoreWeave raised $221 million.

The back-to-back investments in CoreWeave highlight venture investors’ immense appetite for artificial intelligence startups and the companies that provide the infrastructure to power them. 
In the six months since OpenAI unveiled its AI chatbot ChatGPT, investors have poured tens of billions of dollars into AI startups, which many tech leaders see as a paradigm shift in the technology world akin to the advent of the Internet three decades ago.
This year alone, seven funding rounds of $100 million or more have gone to U.S.-based startups related to AI, according to The Crunchbase Megadeals Board.
Coreweave offers cloud computing services based on graphics processing units, or GPUs, the server chips that underlie many AI services like ChatGPT. Underscoring the intense business interest in the technology, GPU leader Nvidia — also a CoreWeave investor — this week became the first chipmaker valued at $1 trillion. 
Coreweave, which competes with cloud providers Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google, has now raised $576.5 million in total funding, per Crunchbase.

These AI Investors Are Following The Light By Giving This Startup $154M,Jenna D'Illard,2023/05/31,"

It’s not easy wrapping your head around what Boston-based Lightmatter does exactly.
But investors get it, at least enough to give the company $154 million in its latest fundraise. The new funds have reportedly tripled the company’s valuation, in the latest string of eye-popping AI-related rounds.

GV, the venture capital investment division of Alphabet, and Fidelity Management and Research Co. were among the round’s investors, according to reports.
What it does
Lightmatter’s products essentially do two things: Make computing faster and more energy-efficient — requirements critical to supporting the generative AI boom.
To dismiss its technology as “something that involves AI” misses the fact that the company has been operating in the artificial intelligence space before funding to the artificial intelligence space was cool.
More specifically, the startup uses light to link computer chips together and to do calculations for deep learning. Customers and data centers want the company’s product, and the generative AI craze is driving demand.
And what a boom it’s been.
Overall, $20 billion has been raised by startups using “AI” in 2023. Prior to today’s announcement, Lightmatter had raised a total of $113 million in funding over three rounds, according to Crunchbase data. Its previous funding was raised on April 6, 2021, and included Matrix Partners and Viking Global Investors as backers.
Isn’t light free?
Yes, but harnessing it requires a lot of engineering talent. Overall, light has been used for decades to move data via fiber-optic cables (think telecommunications industry). But generally light is considered better at transmitting information than electrical signals over wires. Better in this case meaning more energy-efficient.
Large tech companies want to reduce power costs (understandably) so are turning to light-based solutions. And clearly, they are willing to pay for it and investors are willing to bet on it.

"
AI Investing Boom Is Not New To Tech Giants (At Least Not Their VC Arms),Chris Metinko,2023/05/31,"

Last week, tech titans including Nvidia and Microsoft made some big AI announcements.
Nvidia’s shares jumped on guidance for second-quarter revenue that would be more than 50% above estimates, while Microsoft announced several AI-related tidbits at its Microsoft Build conference. In addition, Google and Salesforce’s venture arm — Salesforce Ventures1 — took part in the largest round of the week, Anthropic’s $450 million Series C.
However, while AI’s dominance of the new cycle may seem recent, for tech’s biggest software developers, chipmakers and hyperscalers, artificial intelligence has had their attention — and money — for years, according to Crunchbase data.

Those tech giants have been placing a few AI bets for some time — although those bets have become significantly more expensive in recent years — while their venture arms have planted cash across dozens of startups through that time.
Let’s take a look at some of the biggest players and how much they’re pouring into AI startups.
Nvidia
No company has made bigger headlines than Nvidia recently, as it just became the first trillion-dollar chip firm.
Nvidia is leading the charge for chips with better processing to train large language models for AI — a race that will only get more heated as more AI applications are built and better infrastructure is necessary to support them.
To help stay ahead of the game, Nvidia has made a fair share of investments in the ecosystem surrounding AI. The chip giant has made 18 different investments in VC-backed startups since the start of 2021, per Crunchbase data. 
The largest deals Nvidia participated in all have come this calendar year and include:

Adept AI’s $350 million Series B in March that gave the San Francisco-based startup a post-money valuation of at least $1 billion. Adept is developing AI models that cannot just respond to text commands — like a chatbot — but actually turn that command into actions. In theory, the company’s generative AI could help users do tasks from browsing the internet to navigating enterprise software tools.
Toronto-based Cohere’s $270 million round in May. The startup’s AI platform competes with OpenAI.
Drone startup Skydio’s $230 million Series E at a $2.2 billion valuation in February.

The chipmaker has thus far made four investments in the AI space this year with those rounds totaling $850 million. (It’s important to note that is the total raised in those rounds. Investors typically do not reveal their stake in an individual round.)
The price of doing business when it comes to AI investing has clearly increased. Last year, Nvidia made a half-dozen deals that totaled $297 million, per Crunchbase data. Those deals included investments in AI edge computing startup Utilidata and AI autonomous building platform PassiveLogic.
In 2021, the company made eight investments in VC-backed AI startups totaling $440 million. Those deals included conversational AI platform Kore.ai and AI development platform Saturn Cloud.
Microsoft and M12
No company made a bigger splash this year in AI than Microsoft with the news in January it had agreed to a “multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment” into OpenAI, the startup behind the artificial intelligence tools ChatGPT and DALL-E for a reported $10 billion.
Microsoft’s interest in AI is logical, as few companies have as many tentacles in every aspect of technology and innovation as the Redmond, Washington-based titan. From cloud to search to autonomous driving to analytics, Microsoft’s uses for AI are only limited by the imagination.
Along with OpenAl, the Windows creator also participated in the Adept AI deal and led an undisclosed round in London-based AI-enhanced software platform developer Builder.ai, which later announced a Series D of more than $250 million.
Since the beginning of 2021, Microsoft itself has made nine deals involved in the AI sector, according to Crunchbase data — three deals in each calendar year. 
Those deals include participating in self-driving vehicle startup Cruise’s $2 billion round in 2021 and London-based AI driving tech Wayve’s $181 million Series B last year.
However, Microsoft’s investments pale in comparison to the number of deals its venture arm — M12 — has made in that same period.
M12, which invests from a single fund that is replenished by Microsoft — the fund’s sole limited partner — and is driven by financial returns, has made more than 30 deals in the AI space in the last 29 months, per Crunchbase data.
In fact, the venture arm has made nearly 60 deals in AI-enhanced or related startups since 2019.
Some of the biggest deals it has participated in include:

Montreal AI tech startup Element AI’s $146 million round in 2019.
Health cloud and analytics provider Innovaccer’s $150 million Series E in 2021.
Seattle-based AI sales platform Outreach’s $114 million Series E in 2019. 

M12 also has led or co-led eight rounds since the start of 2021.
However, the firm seems to have stepped off the gas in its AI investing this year, as Crunchbase data indicates it has only participated in one round through the year’s first five months — San Francisco-based Typeface’s $65 million Series A. The startup has a generative AI application for creating enterprise content.
Google and GV
Similar to Microsoft, Google is ubiquitous when it comes to tech, with its hands in the cloud, drones, logistics, search, data and just about everything under the sun — so its interest in what AI can be applied to is limitless.
Despite Google’s recent participation in Anthropic’s huge round, the Mountain View, California-based search and cloud giant has only made eight deals in the AI space involving VC-backed startups since the start of 2021, according to Crunchbase data.
That does include some interesting deals, however, such as a $100 million Series B in AI-powered industrial decision-making startup InstaDeep and co-leading a $14 million Series D in AI agri-tech firm Cropin, both last year.
However, Google’s all-everything venture arm GV has been much busier.
In the last four-plus years, GV has made 45 investments in the space, per Crunchbase. 
That includes participating in Palo Alto, California-based SambaNova Systems’ huge $676 million round in 2021 and its $250 million raise the year before. SambaNova was founded as an AI chip designer.
Between 2012 and last year, the venture arm — which invests in rounds ranging from seed to late-stage growth — took part in two dozen funding rounds for VC-backed startups using AI.
This year, GV has taken part in both Typeface’s raise, as well as AI and automation recruiting solution Moonhub’s $4.4 million seed, which it co-led.
Intel Capital
Few companies are more intertwined with the very basic infrastructure of technology than Intel, and few corporate venture arms are as active as Intel Capital. The firm is one of the oldest and most prolific venture arms.
Not surprising, that is also true when it comes to investing in AI-related startups — as it unlikely wants to be left behind in innovation that could revolutionize chips and processors.
Intel Capital has made a whopping 107 investments in such startups since 2016, per Crunchbase data.
More recently, it has made almost two dozen deals since the beginning of 2021. That includes co-leading some significant rounds, such as:

Toronto-based AI chip designer Untether’s $125 million Series B in 2021.
San Francisco-based Anyscale’s $99 million Series C last year. The startup helps scale AI applications.

This year, Intel Capital has made only one announced deal in the AI space, leading a $20 million Series A for Israel-based MDI Health, which offers an AI-powered platform that provides decision support tools for drug treatments.
Salesforce Ventures
Granted, when one thinks about AI and who would invest, one would logically think of chipmakers, cloud providers and those involved in analytics and search.
However, many AI applications are marketing and sales related, so it makes sense that one of the largest CRM and sales platforms in the world would be making investments in the space — or at least its venture arm is.
Salesforce Ventures has taken part in more than 50 deals that involved AI-related startups since the start of 2019, per Crunchbase data.
Some of the more noteworthy rounds it took part in last year include Seattle-based AI-fueled sales enablement platform Highspot’s $248 million Series F, and Redwood City, California-based machine-learning data catalog Alation’s $123 million Series E.
This year, the venture arm has made four deals, including participating in Anthropic’s recent big raise. It also took part in Cohere’s huge $250 million round and a seed round for New York-based Hearth AI, a relationship management system.
Salesforce Ventures’s deals also show the rising price to invest in AI-related startups. While the venture arm made 10 investments in deals that totaled $736 million last year, the four deals this year have totaled $705 million.

These 3 Charts Show It’s Not Easy Being A Seed Startup These Days,Gené Teare,2023/05/31,"

U.S. seed startups have been the least affected by the venture funding downturn. But these companies are competing in a more crowded field than ever for investor attention and will likely have to wait longer to raise their Series A rounds — if they’re able to at all — an analysis of Crunchbase data shows.

To paint a clearer picture of the state of the U.S. seed market, let’s break it down into three charts.
Seed funding slows after peak
Quarterly seed funding peaked in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2022, Crunchbase data shows.
It took the better part of that year for the slowdown to reach seed. By the third quarter of 2022, seed amounts were flat year over year — still high since seed was up in 2021 — and then slowed in the fourth quarter from 2021 heights, and dipped further in Q1 2023.
Despite the slow quarter-over-quarter downward roll since the Q1 2022 peak, seed funding is still above 2020 amounts and has weathered the downturn better than all other stages.


This might lead you to believe that seed-stage companies have an advantage compared to all other stages of funding. It’s true that seed startups are less encumbered by the outsized valuations that later-stage startups are struggling with.
It’s also true that seed-funded startups always face an uphill battle, even in the best of circumstances: Failure rates for startups at this stage range from 50% to 90%, depending on whose projections you believe.
That said, even though it was the most robust funding stage in 2022, the challenges facing seed startups in the current market could be formidable going forward.
Seed startups pile up
First, it’s worth noting that there are more seed-funded companies in the pipeline than ever before, and they’re all competing for investor attention as they seek to raise their Series A rounds.
Around 2,000 companies that raised an initial $1 million seed in 2021 have yet to raise post-seed funding, Crunchbase data shows. Another 2,400 companies that raised seed funding in 2022 will be competing for that next round.
Those figures don’t even include the many additional startups — likely numbering in the thousands in the U.S. alone — that have not yet raised a seed round of at least $1 million.


That leads us to our next data point: how long companies are hanging out at the seed stage.
Companies stuck at seed for longer
Many of these companies will spend more time in the seed pond, as more seed funds have launched in the U.S. in the last five years, and as those funds have typically gotten larger.
In 2014, a startup that raised at least $1 million at the seed stage typically raised a Series A 14 months later, if it was able to graduate to the next stage, Crunchbase data shows.
Fast-forward to 2020, when that time frame stretched considerably to 24 months.
In the hot market of 2021 and 2022, the median time shortened a bit again, to 22 and 21 months, respectively.
Now in 2023, the median time between a $1 million-plus seed and a Series A has stretched all the way out to 25 months.


It’s reasonable to expect the time between seed and Series A to get even longer in the current funding environment as investors remain exceptionally picky about which startups they back.
For new startups, the good news is there are many more funds investing at the seed stage.
The bad news is that these funds have many more portfolio companies milling around at the seed stage that they need to prioritize.
New seedlings
Around two-thirds of startups in the U.S. that raised $1 million or more in a seed round between 2012 and 2017 went on to raise post-seed funding, our analysis of Crunchbase data shows. (That trends down to around 40% if you remove the $1 million bar.)
But that was then, and this is now. It’s now much less certain that the majority of well-funded seed startups will make it to Series A — especially given that many of the companies in the current seed cohort raised those rounds in the funding heyday of 2021.
The absolute number of U.S. companies that raised their first seed round of $1 million or more went up by 49% in 2021.
Amid layoffs and restructuring in the tech sector, it’s likely that more startups will be founded in the coming years. 
“2023 and 2024 could be the biggest two years for company formation — ever,” Rob Biederman, co-founder of early-stage investor Asymmetric Capital Partners said in an interview with Crunchbase News. “People have no idea how much talent is going to be coming into the market in 2023 and 2024, trying to start companies.”

"Hourly Workers Are In High Demand, As Are Some Startups Catering To Them",Joanna Glasner,2023/05/30,"

Few people get rich working short-term and hourly wage jobs. However, it is how most of us make a living.
In the U.S. for instance, over 76 million workers were paid at hourly rates last year, representing over 55% of all wage and salary recipients. Millions more earn freelance and gig work income calculated using other methods.
Given that so many of us are working hourly and gig-based jobs, it’s not surprising to see startups scaling up to address the market. Globally, such companies have raised billions in venture and growth funding over the past couple of years, per an analysis of Crunchbase data.

And investment continues to flow to the space. Just last week, for example, Instawork, a platform for connecting businesses with skilled hourly workers, raised $60 million in a Series D funding led by TCV. The San Francisco-based company counts major retailers, sports stadiums and light industrial employers among its users.
Who’s getting funded
Instawork is one of dozens of companies targeting hourly and gig workers and employers that has raised funding in the past couple of years. Using Crunchbase data, we compiled a sample set of 26 such startups:


Collectively, the companies on our list have raised over $2.7 billion to date with offerings including scheduling apps, payroll and compliance tools, and platforms to quickly connect workers with employers in need of their services.
Among the most heavily funded this past year is Fountain, an applicant tracking system for hiring large numbers of hourly employees. The San Francisco-based company, which recently rolled out a conversational AI tool for hiring managers, pulled in a $100 million Series B last June.
In terms of total funding, the standout is Jobandtalent, which connects workers with gig-type assignments in industries including hospitality, logistics and construction. Founded in 2009, the Madrid-based company has raised over $700 million in equity funding, including a $500 million SoftBank Vision Fund-led Series E in late 2021.
WorkJam, meanwhile, is taking a different approach. The Montreal-based company, which picked up a $50 million Series D in November, offers tools for employers of shift workers to set schedules, manage tasks and organize training.
Tight market for employers
Startups’ are focusing on hourly and gig workforces at a time when employers are struggling to fill these kinds of jobs at prevailing wages.
As of the end of March, there were 9.6 million U.S. job openings, per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s actually down from December, when there were 11.2 million openings, but still signifies a tight labor market, with demand for hourly workers well exceeding supply at current pay rates.
Labor shortages have prompted a number of large employers to hike hourly wages in recent months. The Home Depot, for instance, raised starting hourly pay to $15. Walmart announced an average hourly wage of more than $17.50, while Amazon said in September that starting pay for warehouse and delivery workers will be more than $19 an hour.
Among startups, the hope is that the apps and tools they’re offering can play a role alongside pay increases to make it easier and more appealing for hourly and gig workers to take on a new position.
For workers, of course, a shiny new app is a secondary consideration to things like available hours and pay. However, it certainly doesn’t hurt to make the job of getting hired and onboarded a little easier.

"Summer Is Here, And Startups Want You To Go Camping",Joanna Glasner,2023/05/27,"

Recently, it’s come to my attention that going outdoors and exploring nature can be truly awesome.

No, it’s not because I’ve actually gone outside. Rather, it stems from hours of screen time tallying funding for outdoorsy-themed startups and staring at websites featuring high-tech campervans, rustic-yet-charming glampsites, and images of people enjoying trees, mountains and lakes. 
Yes, yes, I know you probably think startup investors prefer you cooped up inside. You should be spending crypto on NFTs in the metaverse or feeding content to ad-spewing, AI-enabled algorithms. That kind of thing.
But apparently, tech investors also want you to go camping. Of course, you should also plan to  rent a travel vehicle through a peer-to-peer RV sharing app. And preferably, reserve an exclusive spot booked through a venture-backed campsite aggregator. But still, go camping.
There’s a lot of money in outdoorsy-themed investments
Apparently, there’s big money in getting you out of the house.
Or at least venture investors seem to think so, judging by the sizable sums startups targeting outdoor recreation-related markets have raised in the past few years.
For a sense of where the money is going, we used Crunchbase data to curate a list of startups that have raised rounds in the past three years with an eye to getting consumers off their screens and outside. Altogether, the 21 companies listed below have raised more than $1 billion to date:


Land
Most of the funding is going to companies helping people figure out how to camp, hike and glamp on dry land, which makes sense as we are land mammals.
On this front, the most prodigious fundraiser is AllTrails, a global aggregator of digital trail guides that picked up $150 million from the growth fund of private equity firm Permira in late 2021. It’s a huge platform, with over 30 million users and more than 300,000 trails spanning everywhere from Algeria to Zambia.
People need a place to sleep too, so startups are also offering up rustic accommodations. San Francisco-based Hipcamp, which connects people with tent camping, RV parks, cabins, treehouses and glamping sites, has raised over $97 million in venture funding to date. And Brooklyn-based Getaway, which has raised over $80 million, operates collections of cabins in country locales that are an easy drive from major cities.
Street
Some of us land mammals prefer accommodations we can drive, which is where our second-biggest funding recipient, RV rental platform Outdoorsy enters the picture. The 9-year-old, Austin, Texas-based company offers a platform for people to rent RVs, camper vans and travel trailers. It’s raised $165 million in equity funding to date
In a similar vein, Akron-based RVshare has pulled in $150 million to date for its peer-to-peer rental marketplace. It says owners of the most high-end RVs can make up to $60,000 per year on its platform.
While most of the biggest rounds date back over a year, we’re also seeing more recent deals in the space. Most recently, Spot2Nite, a marketplace for booking RV campsites, picked up $3 million in an April Series A round. The New Orleans-based company says it wants to make the process of securing a site as consistent and modern as booking a hotel or rental car.
Water
Summer is all about getting wet, be it at the pool, lake, river or beach, and startups are on board with that too.
Among the more heavily funded players in this arena is Swimply, a marketplace for renting private pools by the hour. To date, the 5-year-old, Los Angeles-based company has raised over $60 million.
GetMyBoat, a marketplace for boat rentals, yacht charters and water experiences, is also scaling up with a 2022 Series B bringing total funding to $36 million. For those who want to look stylish in or near the water, meanwhile, there are venture-backed swimwear brands Andie and Left On Friday.
Yes, you could just go outside, but….
Now, of course humans don’t need RVs, booking apps, peer-reviewed trail compendiums, or fashionable gear to go outside. It is possible to just, you know, go outside. Maybe take a hike, build a campfire or pitch a tent if you’re so inclined.
However, there’s not a lot of business model scalability in that. Nor does it produce a high-multiple exit for a venture investor. So next time you are thinking about something as old-school as camping, keep that in mind. Just because your ancestors foraged for sustenance in the wild without the help of marketplace apps doesn’t mean you have to follow in their footsteps.

"The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Anthropic Generates Another Huge Round, Biotech Has Big Week",Chris Metinko,2023/05/26,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.

The week can be summed up pretty succinctly by just saying AI and biotech. Another AI startup — one we’ve seen before — had another huge raise, and biotech had three huge rounds and a lot of good-sized ones. In general, it does seem like venture investing has been creeping up the past few weeks — at least when analyzing big rounds — but we’ll see what the summer holds.
1. Anthropic, $450M, artificial intelligence: If Anthropic looks familiar to you on this list, there’s a reason. In February there were reports that Google had invested between $300 million and $400 million into the San Francisco-based startup. That was followed in March by reports that Anthropic was raising another $300 million round at a pre-investment valuation of $4.1 billion. Then this week, Anthropic — a ChatGPT rival with its AI assistant Claude — announced it had raised $450 million in Series C funding led by Spark Capital with participation from Google, Salesforce Ventures1, Sound Ventures, Zoom Ventures and others. Anthropic itself previously announced a $124 million Series A in 2021 and a $580 million Series B in 2022 — led by none other than disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Of course, nothing has been hotter than AI this year. The raise was only topped by the $10 billion investment into OpenAI reportedly by Microsoft in January.
2. ElevateBio, $401M, biotech: We say this every week, but we really mean it this time — it was a huge week for biotech as three rounds brought in more than $850 million. First up is Massachusetts-based gene therapy startup ElevateBio, which raised a $401 million Series D led by the AyurMaya Capital Management Fund, a VC fund managed by Matrix Capital Management. The startup has multiple platforms for things such as drug development and manufacturing which interconnect with one another — making it an end-to-end biopharma company. The company has multiple drug development pipelines as demand grows for gene therapies that help the immune system fight its way through disease. Founded in 2017, the company has now raised $1.2 billion, per Crunchbase.
3. ReNAgade Therapeutics, $300M, biotech: This brings us to our second big biotech raise. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based ReNAgade Therapeutics locked up a $300 million Series A led by MPM BioImpact and F2 Ventures. That money would be big for any round, but a $300 million Series A in this venture market borders on the amazing (yes, it can be difficult to figure out how long a round took to raise, but still). ReNAgade is developing RNA therapeutics (hence the name) to fight disease. The company already has established a joint venture with Orna Therapeutics. Founded in 2021, this is the company’s first outside funding, per Crunchbase.
4. Carmot Therapeutics, $150M, biotech: Not to be forgotten, Berkeley, California-based biotech firm Carmot Therapeutics closed a $150 million Series E led by Deep Track Capital. The startup is developing therapies for metabolic diseases including obesity and diabetes. The company  has several therapeutics in its pipeline and the new cash infusion to add to its portfolio. Founded in 2008, the company has raised nearly $385 million, per Crunchbase.
5. Tools For Humanity, $115M, crypto: It’s Sam Altman’s world, we’re just living in it. Worldcoin developer Tools For Humanity — co-founded by Altman — raised a $115 million Series C led by Blockchain Capital. The San Francisco-based startup is building tools in support of Worldcoin, an Ethereum-based token currently in beta. Its World ID platform is attempting to create unique digital identities — based on blockchain technology — for people by scanning their eyes with a small orb. The startup has raised many questions surrounding AI, data and privacy. While such an identity platform could be useful as AI makes it more difficult to know who or what one is dealing with over the internet, the scanning of people’s eyes to create a digital identity and how that information could be used has raised privacy and data concerns.The company did not reveal a valuation, but an earlier report said it is looking to raise money at a $3 billion valuation.
6. Nymbus, $70M, fintech: Jacksonville, Florida-based fintech startup Nymbus raised a $70 million Series D led by Insight Partners. Founded in 2015, the company has raised nearly $200 million.
7. OnKure Therapeutics, $54M, biotech: Boulder, Colorado-based precision oncology startup OnKure closed a $54 million Series C led by Surveyor Capital. Founded in 2011, the company has raised $121.5 million, per Crunchbase.
8. Quanta Therapeutics, $51M, biotech: San Francisco-based biotech Quanta Therapeutics locked up a $50.7 million Series D led by Avidity Partners. Founded in 2018, Quanta has raised more than $142 million, according to Crunchbase.
9. Episode Six, $48M, fintech: Austin, Texas-based payment processing startup Episode Six raised a $48 million Series C financing led by Avenir. Founded in 2015, the company has raised $90 million, per Crunchbase.
10. Larkspur Biosciences, $36M, biotech: Watertown, Massachusetts-based biotech firm Larkspur Biosciences launched with $35.5 million in a combined seed and Series A round co-led by Polaris Partners, 3E Bioventures Capital and Takeda Ventures.
Big global deals
Not surprisingly, the biggest non-U.S. round of the week also involved AI.

London-based Builder.ai raised a Series D of more than $250 million led by Qatar Investment Authority. The company uses AI in its software development platform.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of May 20 to 26. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

Is The AI Hype For Real? $20B In Investments Says Yes,Jenna D'Illard,2023/05/26,"

As every investor and their French Bulldog scrambles to get in on the AI action, we look to the data for answers.
Ironically, we can’t even define “AI” as a sector per se since almost every startup looking for some coin or decent press suddenly identifies as an “AI-centered-something-or-other.”
But for the purists, the numbers don’t lie — or in the very least they tell a clearer story than the prevalent “AI will save the world” narrative.

In fact, early this week investors poured $700 million into two AI startups — Builder.ai and Anthropic — and followed up mid-week with another $105 million to AI marketing platform Insider. It seems we’ve reached another level of the AI craze that has dominated the private markets since late last year.
Overall, $20 billion has been raised by startups using “AI” in 2023. (Fun fact: $20 billion could pay the salaries of 307,266 teachers for one year.) But let’s definitely keep making those AI-generated selfies.


So much buzz
Are startups worried about the downturn? We guess it depends on who writes their checks. 
In fact, Bessemer Venture Partners, one of the oldest and more established venture firms in the U.S., earlier this year said it is earmarking $1 billion of its most recent fund solely for investments in artificial intelligence.
And that’s just one firm.
This week we published an interview with Bessemer partner Sameer Dholakia, who aptly said of the AI movement: “Literally trillions of dollars of value gets created when you have these massive tectonic shifts.” 
And what about AI IPOs?
But it’s not all unicorns and rainbows for AI. Just because funding to the sector is hot, that doesn’t mean the appetite on the public markets is at the same level.
If we look at public markets (and we did) it’s clear that an AI focus hasn’t been a recipe for stock market gains. This is evident looking at recent performance of the most highly valued AI-oriented companies to go public in the quarters leading up to the market peak.


Back to the future
Let’s circle back to those trillions that Bessemer’s Dholakia was talking about. While we aren’t seeing the fruit of those hefty AI investments just yet, the promise (or at least the hope) among investors and the journalists that cover them is that these startups will deliver sooner rather than later.
According to Dholakia, the “adoption curve on this one will be mind-blowingly fast.”

eFishery’s $108M Raise And Unicorn Status Proves Aquaculture Is Swimming Upstream,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/05/25,"

eFishery, an Indonesia-based aquaculture startup, raised $108 million in Series D funding, according to Tech In Asia. The company was valued at $1.3 billion, launching the company into narwhal — uh, unicorn status. 
42xfund, an investment management firm in United Arab Emirates, led the funding round, and additional participation came from Northstar Group and SoftBank Vision Fund 2.
Aquaculture startups had its best funding year ever in 2022 when the sector raised $292 million across 42 startups, according to Crunchbase News. The industry has seen a steady incline in venture funding since 2013, when eFishery launched.

The company beganin 2013 as a one stop shop for the aquaculture industry in Indonesia. The company started with a programmable fish farm feeder that dispenses food for shrimp farms and quickly developed disease prevention systems for those ecosystems. 
The company has since expanded, providing an end-to-end e-commerce platform that allows fishers to buy niche products and gear and connects farmers with financial institutions that can provide flexible loans geared towards the fickle nature of aquaculture. The company also has a distribution system that makes it easy for homes and businesses to order fish and get it delivered fresh or frozen.
More importantly, eFishery has an online marketplace that allows fishers to sell their yield directly to distributors and agents, often at a fairer price than most markets. 
The environmental impact
That process is generally better for the environment by promoting fair trade wages for fisheries and lowering the carbon footprint of moving the fish product. 
But fish farming has long been considered an unsustainable environmental practice — certain farmed fish need to be fed wild fish to survive. Creating crowded, overpopulated zones of fish is a breeding ground for disease, and the waste they produce in such a small area can pollute the ocean. In Indonesia specifically, fish farms are partly responsible for mangrove deforestation.
Fishing, in general, has a significantly smaller carbon footprint than land animal agriculture (including products like cheese and dairy), and startups are moving into the space to develop more sustainable and scalable practices in one of the oldest jobs in the world.

Sam Altman’s Crypto Startup Tools For Humanity Locks Up $115M,Chris Metinko,2023/05/25,"

Worldcoin developer Tools For Humanity — co-founded by OpenAI’s Sam Altman — has raised a $115 million Series C led by Blockchain Capital.
The funding also includes previous and new investors including a16z crypto, Bain Capital Crypto and Distributed Global. 
The San Francisco-based startup is building tools in support of Worldcoin, an Ethereum-based token currently in beta. Its World ID platform is attempting to create unique digital identities — based on blockchain technology — for people by scanning their eyes with a small orb.

The startup has raised many questions surrounding AI, data and privacy. While such an identity platform could be useful as AI makes it more difficult to know who or what one is dealing with over the internet, the scanning of people’s eyes to create a digital identity and how that information could be used has raised privacy and data concerns.
Due to its decentralized nature and hopes to create true unique digital identities, Worldcoin also has been associated with being involved in the process of distributing a universal basic income if AI starts to eliminate massive amounts of jobs — something that also has caused debate.
“As we embark on the age of AI, it is imperative that individuals are able to maintain personal privacy while proving their humanness,” said Alex Blania, CEO and co-founder of Tools for Humanity. “In doing so we can help ensure that everyone can realize the financial benefits that AI is poised to deliver.” 
The company did not reveal a valuation, but an earlier report said it was looking to raise money at a $3 billion valuation.
Bucking the trend
While Tools For Humanity may have had a successful fundraise, that has not been the case for most crypto and Web3 startups.
Venture funding to VC-backed Web3 startups plummeted 82% in the first quarter of the year — dropping from $9.1 billion in Q1 of 2022 to only $1.7 billion, per Crunchbase data.
The funding number is the lowest total since the fourth quarter of 2020 — which saw only $1.1 billion — when many people had never heard of Web3.
VC-backed crypto startups saw just more than $800 million invested, the lowest total since more than $600 million was invested in Q1 2020.

"
Powdered Breast Milk Startups Are A Thing And This One Just Grabbed $3M In Funding,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/05/25,"

What’s a breastfeeding parent to do when the freezer is jam-packed with breast milk and the diaper bag is full of thawing sachets that need to be used up quickly? To preserve the nutrients, make them shelf-stable for years, and store and transport them easily, parents may consider turning their breast milk into powder.
There are a plethora of companies that do this, all with names that convey the seriousness of the matter: It’s My Leche. Boobie Juice. Booby Food.
There’s also BBy, a Y Combinator startup that condenses breast milk into Cheetos powder-like dust (more on this later). The company announced a $3 million seed funding round led by Pioneer Fund with participation from Y Combinator, 7G Bioventures and Cathexis Ventures.

The company turns breast milk donated by lactating parents into a powder for neonatal intensive care units (otherwise known as NICUs). Infants benefit from the nutrients provided by breast milk, but the process of storing, thawing and reheating it on repeat every single day costs hospitals millions of dollars a month.
Vansh Langer, the CEO of the company, started BBy when he was a medical intern at his hospital’s NICU.
“If you think of the last 70 years of hospital innovation, everything has changed in the hospital except for the way we store breast milk,” Langer said. “Why is that?”
Powdered breast milk is reaching the masses
Last month, I watched a Houston-based powdered breast milk startup called Milkify on Shark Tank.
The company demoed its milk-powdering service it claims preserves the nutrients in the milk while keeping it shelf stable for three years. After battling it out with the Sharks, Milkify’s founding couple walked away with a deal with Lori Greiner of QVC fame and actress Gwyneth Paltrow (the product samples touched by Mark Cuban and Barbara Corcoran did not contain real breast milk, fyi).
While this was my introduction to breast milk as a commodity, startups like BBy have been around for a minute.
However, BBy works differently. The company uses a proprietary laser technology and algorithm to spray dry breast milk, much like how Frito-Lay creates its shelf-stable, sterilized cheese powder to dust over Cheetos. But instead of sterilizing the breast milk, BBy’s algorithm keeps the product within a temperature zone to preserve the bioavailability of nutrients.
BBy also currently only works with hospitals, while several other startups primarily cater to consumers. Milkify, for instance, sends parents an at-home kit that comes with a pharma-grade insulated cooler. Processing around five weeks worth of breast milk costs around $475, or $1.60 per ounce. According to the company, some of its customers were able to get their employers to pay for the service.
Between breast milk and formula
Freeze drying is a good option for preserving nutrients, but can diminish breast milk yield by 20% to 30% if it is done in bulk and the temperature conditions aren’t regulated. Freeze drying is often used by direct-to-consumer startups, but can be an expensive endeavor for hospitals. To be clear: freeze drying isn’t bad, it’s just better in certain circumstances.
“No [parent] is going to come to you with a couple thousand ounces of milk at a time,” Langer said. “And if they do, I mean, they are super rich and that’s very rare.”
But the process can be cheaper if more people use that service. BBy itself is working on a self-service kiosk that sits inside hospitals that parents can use to condense their own breast milk.
Powdered breast milk has its promises. The process of shipping and storing liquid breast milk is expensive — it needs to be shipped quickly and in a cold environment. It’s bulky and needs to be stored in freezers. There’s a labor cost here too: Nurses have to spend valuable time babysitting bags of defrosted milk for infants to make sure they don’t curdle.
“Labor hours are completely wasted every day, highly skilled labor that’s essentially watching a water bath to make sure that the milk doesn’t curdle,” Langer said.

"Even With Venture Slowing, Debt Numbers Not Seeing Dramatic Increase",Chris Metinko,2023/05/25,"

Many wondered after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and with interest rates continuing to creep up, if the debt market would turn sour for startups.
It hasn’t turned, but seems to have stagnated.
Despite some recent debt rounds from well-known startups that garnered headlines, VC-backed startups in the U.S. have been raising about $5.5 billion on average through the last few quarters, according to Crunchbase data — which tracks publicly announced debt financing rounds. (It is important to note companies sometimes do not announce debt raises or the exact ratio in equity and debt mixed rounds.)

The recent quarterly numbers are below the second quarter of last year, when the market seemed to hit a high of nearly $11 billion in debt financings right as the venture market was cooling.


However, there have been a handful of eye-catching deals announced this month from well-funded private companies. Those include:

Last week, Oakland, California-based data startup Fivetran received a $125 million loan from Vista Credit Partners, the credit arm of Vista Equity Partners. In 2021 — a very different time in the venture funding world — the company raised $565 million in equity at a $5.6 billion valuation.
Less than two weeks ago, Foster City, California-based fintech Tipalti raised what has been reported as $150 million in credit from JPMorgan Chase Bank and Hercules Capital, which specializes in venture debt. Back in 2021, the startup raised a $270 million Series F funding led by G Squared at a valuation of $8.3 billion.
Earlier this month, Austin, Texas-based 8fig raised a $140 million Series B — which has been reported as $40 million in equity and $100 million in a credit facility. The round was led by Koch Disruptive Technologies and included Silicon Valley Bank, now a division of First Citizens Bank.

Good market, bad market?
Many expected to see an uptick in debt and credit deals as venture dollars started to dry up. But then, of course, interest rates also continued to rise and then just two months ago Silicon Valley Bank — the preeminent bank for startups — dramatically collapsed.
The bank had about $74 billion worth of loans on its books, with about 20% of that being from venture debt, according to those in the industry. Many thought its fall could mean raising debt — especially popular venture debt — would become much harder for many startups and private companies.
However, considering SVB’s collapse is still relatively fresh, it may be too early to fully contextualize its affect. Some recently announced debt raises such as Fivetran’s were completed before the fall of the bank.
“Silicon Valley Bank was the most prolific financing partner to the growth ecosystem, and the full impact of its failure on the broader technology and financial markets remains unknown,” said David Flannery, senior managing director and president of Vista Credit Partners.
However, Flannery said in the wake of SVB’s collapse his firm has seen a mentality shift among management teams about the certainty and availability of venture capital and growth equity moving forward, which is creating more opportunities for alternative financing.
“This is particularly true for lenders backed by a long-term capital base who understand how later-stage software companies operate and can offer tailored debt solutions that align with a company’s growth needs,” Flannery said.
Looking at debt
Later-stage startups do seem to be looking at picking up debt right now as the market continues to shift.
Fivetran had never really considered debt before its raise was announced last week, said George Fraser, CEO of Fivetran. However, the decision was obvious when considering market conditions, he said.
“The macro environment is just very uncertain,” Fraser said. “No one knows where multiples are for late-stage companies right now.”
That uncertainty doesn’t affect just the company, but also its customers, Fraser reminded, adding to the importance of being “extremely well-capitalized.”
Flannery added his firm witnessed record credit deployment of more than $500 million through its direct lending platform during the first half of 2023, including to private companies like Fivetran, Arcadia, Demandbase and Deepwatch.
“Later-stage software companies are increasingly turning to credit and structured debt solutions to continue to drive growth and play offense pending a broader market recovery and the IPO market reopening,” Flannery said.

More Big Money For AI: Insider Raises $105M,Chris Metinko,2023/05/24,"

If AI does not lead venture out of its current slowdown, perhaps nothing will.
A day after investors flooded $700 million into two AI startups — Builder.ai and Anthropic — Turkey-based AI marketing platform Insider locked up another $105 million.
Insider CEO and co-founder Hande Cilingir told Bloomberg the company’s valuation had increased “very much closer to $2 billion.”

The company previously raised a $121 million Series D at a $1.22 billion valuation in March 2022 — first minting it as a unicorn.
The new round was from existing investors, Qatar Investment Authority and Esas Private Equity.
In a space where every investor seems to fear being left behind, Qatar Investment Authority seems determined to not let that happen. The sovereign wealth fund led London-based Builder.ai’s Series D of more than $250 million on Tuesday.
Let’s go shopping
Insider offers a platform that allows its more than 1,200 customers to connect customer data across channels and systems, predict future behavior with an AI-enhanced engine, and provides an individualized customer experience.
The company plans to use the new cash for M&A dealmaking. In January, Insider made its first acquisition, buying Turkey-based messaging platform MindBehind.
“At Insider, we have successfully achieved hyper-growth via organic means, until now. Now, we are looking to achieve unparalleled levels of growth with an M&A-focused strategy,” Cilingir said in a release. “These funds will be used exclusively for the purpose of acquiring exceptional product companies to further complement our technology and create product synergies. 
“Unlike our $121 million Series D investment in 2022, which has bolstered our capital reserves for operational spending in the coming years, this latest round will specifically serve to fuel inorganic growth through M&A,” she added.
Founded in 2012, Insider’s total funding amount is now $274 million, per the company.

How Did ElevateBio Manage To Nab $401M In This Economy?,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/05/24,"

ElevateBio, a Massachusetts-based gene therapy startup, announced on Wednesday it raised $401 million in Series D funding.
The company’s round was led by the AyurMaya Capital Management Fund, a VC fund managed by Matrix Capital Management, which joined Novo Nordisk, SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Samsara BioCapital as part of ElevateBio’s investor syndicate.

“We have made significant strides in scaling our technologies and end-to-end capabilities in our pursuit to become the world’s most indispensable cell and gene therapy technology company,” ElevateBio CEO David Hallal said in a statement.
A fast-growing biotech startup
Boy, did they. ElevateBio, in my opinion, is pretty close to being its own big pharma company. The startup operates a slew of technology platforms that span from drug development to manufacturing and interconnect with one another, allowing ElevateBio to bring a drug from conceptualization all the way to commercialization. It even has a subsidiary, Life Edit, which develops therapeutics for genetic diseases.
But, since it isn’t, the startup has also inked a deal with an actual big pharma company: Novo Nordisk. Life Edit will work with Novo Nordisk to develop a suite of base editing therapies, which is a fancy way of saying they’re making drugs that can make changes to the DNA sequence.
Demand for cell and gene therapies is growing in part due to the promise that by adding genes to the body, or by correcting a defect in a gene, the immune system can fight its way through disease. The concept is pretty novel in that it may allow certain patients to circumvent managing disease on a daily basis.
ElevateBio is in a pretty unique position compared to its peers. Many startups are struggling under the funding environment imposed by close-fisted investors, and have had to slash research and development programs in order to conserve cash and extend their runway.
ElevateBio, in the meantime, has its hand in multiple drug development pipelines. The company also has a partnership with Moderna that was announced in February to develop in vivo mRNA gene editing therapeutics.
It seems like a big week for biotech — the second-largest fundraising round in the space happened yesterday when ReNAgade Therapeutics raised $300 million in Series A funding.

"
Will The Ripple Deal Create Waves In Stagnant Web3 M&A?,Chris Metinko,2023/05/24,"

Editor’s Note: For more Web3 coverage, please visit Crunchbase’s Web3 Tracker, a site to look at startups, investors and funding news concerning all aspects of Web3, cryptocurrencies and blockchain. Powered by Crunchbase’s comprehensive data, this site will be continuously updated as the next iteration of the internet grows. We hope this data and our analysis serve as resources for readers to track and understand the Web3 landscape and all it encompasses.
Even with crypto prices slowly creeping up, any kind of dealmaking involving blockchain and crypto startups has been slow.

While funding is way down — plummeting 82% year to year, to only $1.7 billion in the first quarter — M&A deals through the early part of the year seem to be lacking punch, per Crunchbase data.


Although M&A deal numbers in the Web3 space are on a similar pace to the past two years, big deals seem to be at a premium.
So far this year, only 16 startups in the space saw an M&A transaction — compared to 44 for all of last year. However, the only deal with a notable announced price tag happened last week, when San Francisco-based Ripple made its first acquisition, buying Switzerland-based Metaco for $250 million in cash and equity.
Where are the big deals?
That deal was the only one to break $100 million this year, whereas previous years have seen a handful of such acquisitions.
For instance, last October About Capital Management bought China-based blockchain asset financial services provider Huobi for a reported $1 billion. About a year before that, India-based Polygon bought scalable cryptocurrency protocol Mir Protocol for $400 million in December 2021.
In the previous two years, there were nine total M&A deals of $100 million or more — including those by large crypto and fintech companies like La Jolla, California-based Silvergate Capital, Vancouver-based WonderFi and Montreal-based Nuvei.
Declining valuations
The drop in big money deals undoubtedly has a lot to do with declining valuations. While every industry has been hit by the slump, it stands to reason Web3 startups in crypto and blockchain were even more significantly affected.
Web3 started to fall out of favor with investors quickly as last year progressed, with over-inflated valuations in a slowing venture market leading many VCs to seek out other, better defined industries and sectors.
Crypto’s instability did not help matters, and when the catastrophic collapse of FTX happened, many predicted doom for all things blockchain and crypto.
However, crypto prices have picked up significantly since the start of this year — with Ether and Bitcoin both up more than 50%. While Web3 applications are still struggling — along with the crypto lending space that led to tumbling digital asset prices last year — investors do seem to have a renewed interest in the “picks and shovels” as they look to build out the Web3 infrastructure layer.
The Ripple deal also is promising for the M&A world. The startup is a large payment provider that uses blockchain — certainly a financial area that will continue to be built out with further crypto adoption.
The value of the deal also could mean some investors see valuations leveling off. This could bring more buyers off the sidelines who were waiting for the market to hit a low.
A strong M&A market is necessary for any sector to thrive — or even survive. If Web3 is going to be a thing the market will need to see an uptick so investors can see future exits on the horizon.
Methodology
For Web3 funding numbers we analyze investments made into VC-backed startups in both cryptocurrency and blockchain.

"AI Craze Hits New Level As Anthropic Locks Up $450M, Builder.ai Closes $250M Round",Chris Metinko,2023/05/23,"

Well, just when you thought it couldn’t get any crazier.
Investors poured in $700 million into two AI startups Tuesday — Builder.ai and Anthropic — seemingly marking another level of the AI craze that has dominated the private markets since late last year.
Leading the way, Anthropic — a ChatGPT rival with its AI assistant Claude — raised $450 million in Series C funding led by Spark Capital with participation from Google, Salesforce Ventures1, Sound Ventures, Zoom Ventures and others.

“We are thrilled that these leading investors and technology companies are supporting Anthropic’s mission: AI research and products that put safety at the frontier,” said CEO Dario Amodei in a release. “The systems we are building are being designed to provide reliable AI services that can positively impact businesses and consumers now and in the future.”
The round comes after earlier reports in February that Google had invested between $300 million and $400 million into the San Francisco-based startup. That was followed in March by reports that Anthropic was raising another $300 million round at a pre-investment valuation of $4.1 billion. 
Anthropic itself has previously announced a $124 million in a Series A in 2021 and a $580 million Series B in 2022 — led by none other than disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.
But wait, there’s more
While Anthropic was announcing its massive raise, another AI startup across the pond was raising some cash of its own.
London-based Builder.ai raised a Series D of more than $250 million led by Qatar Investment Authority. Other investors included Iconiq Capital, Jungle Ventures and Insight Partners.
The company, which uses AI in its software development platform, did not disclose a valuation, but said its valuation increased as much as 1.8x, presumably since its last raise in 2022.
Earlier this month, Microsoft — which has AI aspirations of its own — and Builder.ai announced a partnership which included an equity investment in the startup.
Founded in 2016, Builder.ai has now raised more than $450 million.
AI frenzy
With so many big rounds getting announced, it’s now getting to the point where one has to wonder if all these investments themselves are actually AI generated.
VCs and large strategics including Microsoft, Google and Salesforce all continue to show unabated interest in generative AI startups.
Last month AlphaSense, an AI-enhanced market intelligence platform, raised $100 million from investors that included CapitalG — Alphabet’s independent growth fund. 
In March, Character.ai closed a $150 million Series A at a $1 billion valuation led by Andreessen Horowitz. The Palo Alto, California-based AI startup allows people to create their own personalized AI chatbot using language models and deep-learning algorithms.
Also in March, San Francisco-based Adept AI raised $350 million in a Series B — at a reported post-money valuation of at least $1 billion.
Of course the craze started in January with news of Microsoft’s massive $10 billion investment into OpenAI — creator of ChatGPT.

Meta Sells Giphy To Shutterstock For $53M Following Antitrust Lawsuit,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/05/23,"

Shutterstock just got a really, really good clearance deal.

Meta, following an antitrust lawsuit, is siphoning off Giphy, an embedded platform to share looped animated videos (otherwise known as gifs). Shutterstock, the stock image site, will acquire the platform for $53 million in cash and the deal is expected to close next month.
Meta acquired Giphy for almost eight times that amount in 2020, when the company announced it would buy Giphy for $400 million. But last year, Britain’s competition regulator flagged the deal as an antitrust issue. The regulator said the acquisition could allow Meta to make it harder for other social media platforms to access Giphy’s content, or could require them to turn over more user data to Meta in exchange for using Giphy’s gifs.
Meta signed an API agreement with Giphy to continue to be able to use its content on its site.
A sale with big implications
This is the first instance of Meta being forced to contend with the antitrust implications of being a huge tech giant—the company not only is one of the largest social media platforms in the world that owns both Instagram and WhatsApp, it has also made its way into e-commerce, dating and advertising.
This is also a big boost to Shutterstock’s generative AI game. The company is better known for licensing stock photos that can be used in ads or graphics, but recently began using OpenAI’s generative AI platform to create more custom stock images for individual use cases.
Enter Giphy: The platform is embedded basically everywhere—Slack, smartphones and social media websites. Through studying how users query the site to procure the right gif, Shutterstock may gain valuable insight into how to generate the right AI image faster.

This Chart Shows That Unicorn Valuations Are Just In Our Imaginations,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/05/23,"

Once upon a time, a startup valued at $1 billion was as rare as … well, a unicorn. 
That’s not the case anymore. Not only because companies are staying private longer, or because the volume of venture dollars has only increased since the term “unicorn” was coined a decade ago. 
Now, 2021 feels like a land far, far away, where funding was plentiful and companies were able to raise a new round just months after another. Valuations climbed higher than Jack did the beanstalk — consider that 78% of the companies on The Crunchbase Unicorn Board had their valuations set in the past two years. 

But that chapter of the story is over, and some of those sky-high valuations now seem as real as unicorns.
These days, we’re much more keen on looking at startups’ 409a valuations. These internal valuations determine the price of common stock in these companies and differ from the valuations set by investors during priced funding rounds. They’re meant to reflect how much stock would cost if these companies did go public, and from what we can tell, plenty of unicorns are itching to. 
Unfortunately, we don’t know definitively how many startups have lowered and raised their internal valuations over the past two years. 
But we’ve managed to scrounge up a handful of companies that have reportedly changed their 409a valuations after raising money in 2021.


Checkout.com, the digital payments platform, dramatically reduced its internal valuation to $11 billion less than a year after raising a $1 billion round at a $40 billion valuation in January 2022. That’s a 73% difference. 
Grocery delivery startup Instacart met the same fate. Its $12 billion internal valuation, reportedly set in April, was 69% lower than the $39 billion valuation investors pinned on it during a March 2021 funding round.
Stripe, another fintech startup that may as well be a household name, reportedly lowered its internal valuation 40% in the span of six months. The Information reported in January the company’s internal valuation was $63 billion, a 34% drop from when it was valued at $95 billion in March 2021. (The company is reportedly now valued at $50 billion after raising a round in March.)  
But a lowered internal valuation can be a good thing or bad thing for employees, depending on who you are. If an employee already exercised their options at a higher strike price, their shares are now worth less. But, as Checkout.com’s CEO told TechCrunch, the move would create more “upside potential” for employees that haven’t exercised them. They get to pay less for options and can live happily ever after.

From Layoff To Legal Tech: Anmol Sahai Makes His Case With Software Startup,Joanna Glasner,2023/05/23,"

This article is Part Four of our series featuring workers displaced by the recent waves of tech layoffs who decided to found their own companies. In Part One we chatted with investors and founders and looked at data for early-stage startups. Part Two profiled entrepreneur Peter Henry and the fintech he founded in Latin America. In Part Three, we checked out the state of accelerators during the downturn. — Special Projects Editor Christine Kilpatrick
A series of layoffs at online mortgage lender Better.com last year left thousands of former staffers scrambling to find a job. But not Anmol Sahai. He was thinking term sheets. 
Sahai, a 27-year-old Colorado native, joined Better in 2018 as a loan consultant, working his way into a post as legal analyst a year later. Alongside his job, Sahai was studying for a law degree at City University of New York. 

The combination of work and studies helped germinate the idea that culminated in his legal tech startup, Composure, when Sahai had trouble finding software geared for managing workflow at a busy and growing in-house legal department. 
After getting laid off from Better in August, Sahai, now a law school grad, had time to devote to startup building. In subsequent months, he and his team developed an initial product they’re pitching to in-house legal teams as a tool to streamline workflow and help manage incoming requests, documents and internal communications.
Gaining momentum
Sahai said momentum picked up in December, when the startup got initial backing from seed and early-stage investor Day One Ventures.
“That started accelerating things,” he said, noting that shortly afterward, co-founder and CTO Ilia Rogov, also a former Better employee, came on board. The company also landed its first enterprise client, along with some smaller customers.
Composure is now going out for a pre-seed round. There’s no hard target at the moment, but Sahai said comps for similar rounds usually fall in the $1 million to $3 million range. So far, the startup has raised a little over $300,000 from Day One and angel investors.
From suing to SaaS
Part of what makes in-house counsel workflow appealing from a startup perspective is that it is both complex and kind of repetitive.
Day-to-day workflow, as least for a larger organization, is likely to include both inbound and outbound litigation. Unfortunately, as companies scale, Sahai noted, eventually “it’s just a fact of life that someone’s going to sue you.” (Or vice versa.)
Beyond lawsuits, there’s usually a lot of in-house work around compliance and regulatory approval. This can be a particularly large workload for companies in heavily regulated industries like finance or health care. In addition, in-house legal teams have to devote resources to overseeing intellectual property protection, internal investments, and weighing in on terms for vendor and sales negotiations. 
The idea behind Composure is to make it easier to track the tasks and documentation involved in all those myriad responsibilities, and to divvy up workload accordingly. 
Starting in a downturn
While this is not the easiest time for startups to find funding, Sahai for now sees advantages in launching a company amid a market downturn. For one, out of necessity, everyone is focused on capital efficiency. That ought to have some long-term advantages.
Customers are also tightening their belts. As a first-time founder, Sahai said in the past year he’s realized how much resilience is required to keep a nascent venture afloat. Most queries end in rejection, with only the outliers culminating in a “yes.”  He compares the relentless forward push to football:
“You’re punting a lot. … And then, once in a while, you find a gap and you run it down for a touchdown,” he said.

Patient21 Nabs $108M To Expand In-Person Health Care Offerings,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/05/22,"

In-person health care startups launched before the pandemic are getting their dues.
Patient21, a Germany-based health care platform, announced on Monday it raised $108 million, according to Sifted. The company plans on using its funding to expand out of Germany.

Israel-based venture capital firm Pitango, which focuses on health care investments, led the Series C round. The round was a mix of equity and debt, with 70% of the funding coming from equity and another 30% coming from debt. Luxembourg-based IPF Partners supplied the debt.
Patient21’s slew of in-person health care platforms shifts the paradigm away from most telehealth companies. Instead of providing online-only services, Patient21 aims to update the in-person experience by making it easy to book appointments, receive bills and check-in online. Patients are connected with dozens of dental clinics, womens’ health organizations and general practitioners.
The company’s model was pretty innovative in 2019, when it was founded. Then the pandemic happened.
When telehealth took over
When health care organizations were overrun with COVID-19 patients, many doctors adopted telehealth solutions to consult with low-risk patients. Many venture firms and health care institutions invested in telehealth-specific solutions during this time. Between 2019 and 2020, funding into telehealth increased by a whopping 352%, from around $479 million to more than $2 billion. The number of startups funded increased by 78%, according to Crunchbase data.
Startups like Carbon Health, One Medical and Sameday Health championed digital-savvy telehealth services in the U.S. Patient21 CEO Chris Muhr told Sifted, “You have no idea how much shit I had to deal with in the first two years.”
In reality, companies like Sameday Health aren’t that different from Patient21. While Patient21 partners with existing clinics and Sameday Health owns theirs, both have created a digital experience to make it easier to find health care records and make appointments.
The hybrid health care model has only become more popular. California-based Kiira Health, a telehealth clinic geared toward women, opened its first clinic in Los Angeles last year. Poland-based Jutro Medical raised $7 million in 2021 for a telemedicine and in-person clinic offering.

A Bessemer Partner On What’s Driving The Firm’s Billion-Dollar Bet On AI,Gené Teare,2023/05/22,"

Bessemer Venture Partners, one of the oldest and more established venture firms in the U.S., earlier this year said it was earmarking $1 billion of its most recent fund solely for investments in artificial intelligence.
Sameer Dholakia, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners
The firm’s massive bet on the future potential for AI reflects its belief that the technology is a seismic shift that will fundamentally change the way billions of people work, said Sameer Dholakia, a partner on the firm’s growth team.
“Literally trillions of dollars of value gets created when you have these massive tectonic shifts,” Dholakia said in an interview.
“We’re creating an ecosystem around the entrepreneur and around our firm broadly, where we’re getting some of the best and brightest minds from generative AI to partner with us,” he said.

The billion-dollar AI commitment comes after Bessemer raised the largest fund in its history in September, seemingly in defiance of market conditions. This milestone announcement was made long after the private and public market slowed down, and the firm’s own cloud report charted what it refers to as the “SaaSacre” in software startups.
Shifts as consequential as the leaps in AI playing out now take place roughly once a decade, said Dholakia, who has spent 28 years in the software industry in various capacities.
Prior to joining Bessemer, he was the CEO of SendGrid, which he took public in 2017 before the company was acquired by Twilio in 2019 for $3 billion. He experienced the Netscape moment in 1995, the iPhone and AWS, and the cloud in 2006 to 2007.
But the AI transformation will play out in a very different way, contrasting with past technological leaps, Dholakia predicts
The “adoption curve on this one will be mind-blowingly fast,” he said, predicting that AI will be easier to adopt than previous platform shifts.
The cloud comparison
The adoption of cloud “was really hard, really painful,” upending software businesses, he said. For decades, companies sold an upfront enterprise license with software deployed on-premise.
The new model was “I’m gonna rent it to you for a fraction of the cost of what these other folks used to charge you,” he said. “But you’re gonna have to pay me forever.” For enterprises this meant change across their entire business through impacting contracts and pricing.
“Everything about what they did was now different,” said Dholakia.“This time it’s an API call to a large language model.”
Much like the SaaS landscape, Bessemer predicts there will be many winners. Dholakia anticipates growth within verticalized language models that are specialized for a given task, just like a version of PaLM from Google is specialized for medicine.
Bessemer portfolio companies
Two Bessemer portfolio companies using generative AI are scaling quickly.
One is Jasper, a generative AI content strategy engine which recently launched Jasper Brand Voice for companies to build content using their brand assets.
“Jasper is probably one of the largest generative AI-based applications out there on the planet in terms of revenue and ARR,” said Dholakia.
The second is Cologne, Germany-based DeepL, a machine translation engine built with their own language models by Ph.D.s and experts in the field who have their own application built on top of their models.
Several other Bessemer portfolio companies have adopted AI into their existing products. Customer service company Intercom launched Fin using GPT-4, while chatbot provider Ada has integrated AI. Online design firm Canva has launched five products using generative AI.
“We are about to see the creativity of the entrepreneurial ecosystem around the world unleashed, and we couldn’t be more excited,” Dholakia said.

Recently Public AI-Focused Startups Are Not Hot,Joanna Glasner,2023/05/20,"

Artificial intelligence is the subject generating by far the most buzz in startup circles.
But if we look at public markets, it’s clear that an AI focus hasn’t been a recipe for stock market gains. This is evident looking at recent performance of the most highly valued AI-oriented companies to go public in the quarters leading up to the market peak.

To illustrate, we used Crunchbase data to curate a sample set of venture-backed companies in the space that went public on U.S. exchanges in the past three years. Open the list below to see all 11 of the companies we found.


It’s a varied set, with focus areas ranging from business automation (UiPath) to legal discovery (Disco) to voice AI (SoundHound). What all have in common, however, are shares that are currently far below where they were at the time of their market debuts.
In the chart below, we compared valuations at IPO time to recent market caps for the nine companies on the list that are still public. (Two, Berkshire Grey and Zymergen, have been acquired.)


Altogether, the nine companies on our list have shed nearly $50 billion in collective market capitalization since going public. That works out to a decline of 76.5% from the time of their debuts.
Not entirely discouraging
Though they’re down, they’re not out. While those declines sound discouraging, it should be emphasized that most tech stocks are well below their 2021 heights. Also, the companies on our list went public around the time the market was peaking, so initial valuations were bubbly by historical standards.
Moreover, even now, the nine companies on our list are all valued in the hundreds of millions or more. Some are multibillion-dollar companies. UiPath, for instance, has an $8.4 billion market cap. C3 AI, a provider of configurable enterprise AI software that snagged the ticker symbol “AI,” is a $3 billion company.
Several of the companies are also generating sizable revenue. UiPath, for instance, has over $1 billion in sales for the past year, while C3 is in the hundreds of millions. But no, in case you are wondering, they’re not profitable.
AI hype meets market downturn
So what does it mean that AI-focused recently public companies are far off their highs even while buzz around the space is red hot? Is AI overhyped in startup circles? Is it underhyped in public markets?
Who knows. And either way, it seems unwise to make any sample set of companies serve as representative of AI’s potential. Also, it should be confessed, we did not vet the quality of AI technologies from companies in our sample. They could be down because progress has been slower than hoped or they are behind newer startups or older incumbents in technology or adoption. Or maybe not.
Additionally, although all the companies listed proudly and prominently tout their artificial intelligence focus on their websites, we didn’t assess how critical the technology is to their business models. We also didn’t quantify what portion of their resources go toward AI.
What we do know is this: It’s a tough time to be a very mature startup or newish public tech company. Investors seem weary of the kind of company that’s been around for a long time, has an established business model and growing revenue, but still loses money. It’s too late in the game to win them over with just a story and a vision.

The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Big Money Flows To Water Tech Startup Gradiant,Chris Metinko,2023/05/19,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.

After several weeks of just having one or two rounds of nine figures, this week saw an explosion. Eight rounds hit $100 million or more as big rounds seemed to pour in. No one sector cleaned up, as the money was spread around from cleantech to biotech to fintech to even restaurant-centric software.
1. Gradiant, $225M, cleantech: Gradiant became one of the newest unicorns this week after raising a fresh $225 million in a Series D led by BoltRock Holdings and Centaurus Capital. The water tech startup is now valued at $1 billion. The startup develops technology to reduce water usage and build wastewater treatment systems for companies in the pharmaceutical, semiconductor, food and beverage, and other water-demanding industries. The funding is the largest in the wastewater treatment space, at least since the beginning of 2022. Founded in 2013 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The company has now raised more than $392 million, according to Crunchbase.
2. Tipalti, $150M, fintech: Automated payment solution Tipalti raised big this week with a $150 million “incremental growth financing” round, as the company called it. Back in 2021, the Foster City, California-based fintech raised a $270 million Series F funding led by G Squared at a valuation of $8.3 billion. No valuation was given this time around — although that is not unusual in this time of slowing venture funding and declining valuation. The latest round was from JPMorgan Chase Bank and Hercules Capital, which specializes in venture debt, although no distinction between debt and equity was announced by Tipalti. Founded in 2010, Tipalti has now raised about $700 million, according to the company’s release.
3. Restaurant365, $135M, accounting: It’s hard to run a restaurant — as anyone who has watched several reality shows based on doing so knows. Restaurant365 tries to make that a little easier and this week the Irvine, California-based startup added some big-named backers. The company nailed down a $135 million round co-led by KKR and L Catterton. The new round values the company at $1 billion, per its release. Restaurant365 offers enterprise management software for restaurants, helping them take care of accounting, payroll, supply chain and more. The company has surpassed $100 million in revenue and is used in more than 40,000 restaurant locations. Founded in 2011, the company has raised more than $260 million, per Crunchbase.
4. (tied) Avenue One, $100M, property management: New York-based Avenue One also joined the unicorn herd this week with a $100 million raise led by WestCap. The cash infusion gave the company a valuation of $1 billion. The startup, founded in 2020, provides a handful of services to single-family rental investors — such as finding  their next property or financing. Institutional investors started buying up single-family homes during the pandemic as interest rates remained low and families sought more space. Even as interest rates have climbed back up, there clearly is still enough interest in the market to mint a property management startup as a unicorn.
4. (tied) Boundless Bio, $100M, biotech: It seems every week a biotech startup or two raise a huge round. This week is no different. First off is Boundless Bio, a clinical stage, next-generation precision oncology startup, which raised a $100 million Series C co-led by Leaps by Bayer and RA Capital Management. The San Diego-based startup is developing therapeutics directed against extrachromosomal DNA for patients with oncogene amplified cancers. In the past, targeted therapies have been mostly ineffective in treating patients with oncogene amplified cancers, according to the company. Founded in 2018, the company has raised more than $250 million, per Crunchbase.
4. (tied) Eagle Eye Networks, $100M, security: When a security company raises a nine-figure round, it is normal to assume it is referring to cybersecurity. However, not in this case. Eagle Eye Networks is an actual physical security company  — although with a tech twist. The company offers cloud-based video surveillance. Perhaps not the sexiest of industries, but still a significant market. The Austin, Texas-based startup locked up $100 million in a round led by Japan-based Secom. Founded in 2012, the firm has now raised $195 million, according to Crunchbase.
4. (tied) Ray Therapeutics, $100M, biotech: Another biotech was able to raise a nine-figure round this week. San Francisco-based Ray Therapeutics locked up a $100 million Series A led by Novo Holdings A/S. The startup is looking to restore vision for people with the rare blinding disease retinitis pigmentosa. While some companies are looking to stop the disorder before it results in blindness, Ray differentiates itself by looking into therapeutics to actually bring back vision.  Founded in 2021, the company has now raised $110 million, per Crunchbase.
4.(tied) Zip, $100M, procurement: Procurement software certainly is not the sexiest of industries, but there is no denying the need for systems that help companies with the burdensome process of buying new software and hardware. San Francisco-based Zip helps companies do just that and this week it raised a $100 million Series C from investors Y Combinator, CRV and Tiger Global. The startup also bucked the trend of declining valuations. The new cash gives the procurement startup a $1.5 billion post-money valuation. While many companies are seeing stagnant or falling valuations, the new valuation represents a slight bump from its previous $1.2 billion valuation last May after the company raised a $43 million Series B. Zip helps companies with sourcing, approving and paying for needed business tools, ideally helping to streamline the process to make it less taxing. Founded in 2020, Zip has raised $181 million to date, per the company.
9. Nido Biosciences, $87M, biotech: Watertown, Massachusetts-based Nido Biosciences, a biotech startup developing medicines for debilitating neurological diseases, announced it has raised a total of $109 million in seed, and Series A and B financings. Previous SEC filings (here and here) indicate the Series B — led by Bioluminescence Ventures — likely was around $87 million.
10. Quince, $77M, e-commerce: San Francisco-based luxury retailer Quince raised a $77 million Series B led by Wellington Management. Founded in 2018, the company has raised $141.5 million, according to Crunchbase, positioning it for accelerated growth and expansion.

Even though the U.S. saw some big funding rounds, none came close to the biggest this week.

China fast-fashion startup Shein reportedly raised $2 billion at a $66 billion valuation, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of May 13 to May 19. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

Crypto Firm Hashkey Seeks Funds At $1B Valuation — Report,Chris Metinko,2023/05/19,"

The Hong Kong-based investment firm Hashkey Group is looking to raise $100 million to $200 million at a valuation above $1 billion, according to a Bloomberg report.
The move comes as Hong Kong looks to push investments in the digital asset space to strengthen its reputation as a forward-looking financial hub. That reputation took a hit after years of pandemic-related slowdown and talent migration.

Hashkey is a digital asset management and finance house, operating in several areas including venture capital and digital coin trading. The firm has one of the city’s only two licensed virtual asset trading platforms by Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission.
Founded in 2018, Hashkey was an early corporate investor in Ethereum.
The crypto slowdown
Like many industries, blockchain and crypto have seen a significant slowdown in investment since the start of last year. 
In the first quarter of the year, venture funding to VC-backed crypto and blockchain startups plummeted 82% year to year, dropping from $9.1 billion in Q1 of 2022 to only $1.7 billion, per Crunchbase data.
That is its lowest point since late 2020.
Deal flow also continued to drop, as only 333 deals were completed in the first quarter — down from 369 in the previous quarter and a sharp drop from the more than 500 announced in Q1 2022.
A big investment in Hashkey could help shake up those numbers a little. The firm has been an active backer of startups in the blockchain and crypto space — as well as fintech and gaming.
Hashkey has made more than 90 deals, however, its pace has cooled over the past two years, according to Crunchbase data. In 2021 — the height of the market — Hashkey participated in 34 funding deals, per Crunchbase.
That number dropped to only 13 last year and thus far only two this year.

Shein Raised $2 Billion And May Go Public. What’s Holding It Back?,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/05/18,"

What does the future hold for Shein?
The popular fast-fashion startup based in China has reportedly raised $2 billion at two-thirds of its valuation, according to The Wall Street Journal.
The company rose through The Crunchbase Unicorn Board ranks during the pandemic, receiving a valuation of $100 billion and ranking just under the likes of TikTok owner ByteDance and SpaceX. But this new round of funding cut its valuation down to $66 billion. No big deal — it’s still the fourth-highest-valued startup in the world. 
Shein quickly won the hearts of American consumers as e-commerce and delivery exploded during work-from-home orders, and investors took note — in 2021, funding rose to more than $27 billion, around three times higher than the year before. 


The company has remained relatively quiet as rumors swirled that the e-commerce giant had a plan to raise money and, later on, go public. But while Shein contemplates its lofty plans, the company faces numerous obstacles to going public, including weaving through complex international regulations and declining activity in e-commerce.
E-commerce loses its luster
Funding toward e-commerce has seen a slow but steady rise in the last 10 years. 
That all changed in 2021, when the tech industry pinpointed e-commerce as a long-lasting consumer behavior much like working from home was. Funding jumped around 3x higher than 2020, and then immediately crashed to normal levels in 2022. Several big tech giants like Amazon and Meta were quick to build up their e-commerce services, only to lay off thousands of workers when those strategies didn’t play out. 
It’s unclear if Shein will face a similar, less drastic fate. The company reportedly garnered $23 billion in revenue in 2022, on par with other fast-fashion retailers like H&M and fashion conglomerate Inditex, which owns popular brands like Zara. But the e-commerce model isn’t as popular as it once was, and global regulations around environmental and sustainability laws could dwindle its popularity even further.
Stricter environmental regulations
Shein’s clothing is known for being extremely cheap — women’s shirts sell for as little as $2. The company has had to dodge questions over forced labor and environmental impacts of its production line. 
Despite telling U.S. congressional members Shein worked with third-party firms to audit its supply chain of forced labor, the company used cotton from Xinjiang (which has been cited for using forced labor) in at least two instances. In some instances, workers spent 18-hour days in the factories, or were given one day off a month, which violates China’s labor laws. 
The European Union is also setting strict sustainability standards on imports, taxing companies more based on how high their carbon footprint is. This could drive up the price of Shein-made items, or require the company to make changes to its supply chain in order to lower its environmental impact. 
If Shein does go through with its IPO, it has the potential to disrupt the $1.53 trillion apparel industry, but changing headwinds could ruin its course.
Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Shein raised money at a third of its previous valuation. We have updated the story to reflect the accurate number.

SoftBank Rebrands Opportunity Fund As It Launches Second Fund,Chris Metinko,2023/05/18,"

SoftBank is changing the name of its Opportunity Fund ahead of its third anniversary and just as it announces a new $150 million second fund.

The SB Opportunity Fund — a $100 million fund that launched in June 2020 — will now be called the “Open Opportunity Fund.” The change is to symbolize the fund’s open access for other LPs and organizations to invest in it instead of being solely backed by SoftBank.
Serial entrepreneur and investor Paul Judge will assume leadership of the fund as chairman after serving as a founding investment committee member. Because the fund now allows outside inventors, Judge and others have agreed to acquire an ownership stake in the Open Opportunity Fund.
The new Open Opportunity Fund — Fund 2 — has a $150 million target as it looks to continue investing in Black- and Latino-led startups.
“SoftBank proved that the Opportunity Fund model works for increasing access to capital for founders who have been traditionally overlooked, and we remain committed to the fund and its mission,” said Brett Rochkind, managing partner of SoftBank Investment Advisors. “Paul Judge is a seasoned leader strongly positioned to take the Fund into its next chapter as we invite new partners to join SoftBank in our commitment.”
Drop in funding
The news of the second fund comes amidst a decline in venture in general — but especially to underrepresented founders.
For instance, venture capital to Black-founded startups declined sharply last year. After a record $5.1 billion in venture capital during the height of the market in 2021, Black-founded startups based in the U.S. saw that number more than halved — $2.3 billion — as VCs pulled back significantly in 2022.
Since its inception, the Opportunity Fund has deployed its initial $100 million into 75 Black- and Latinx-led companies.
Some of the fund’s portfolio companies include Atomic, Brex, Career Karma, Mayvenn and Squire.

"
Have Tech Jobs Lost Their Luster?,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/05/18,"

When Roger Lee graduated from Harvard in 2008, he and his fellow classmates were thrust into a new kind of working world. Young and college-educated, many of them witnessed, for the first time, the meltdown of the banking sector, and were disillusioned with the idea of working in the once-stable finance field.
Years later, Lee founded the crowdsourced layoffs database Layoffs.fyi, which began documenting tech layoffs during COVID-19. Since then, Lee has been entrenched in layoffs data and employee outlook data with his co-founded companies Comprehensive and Human Interest, which offer employee benefits.
“I saw my classmates start to realize that the finance industry was not nearly as stable or lucrative as they previously thought,” Lee said via email. “I believe something similar is happening with the technology industry today.”
He’s not wrong. According to Handshake, a hiring platform for college students, the graduating class of 2023 is not as interested in working for a big-name, fast-growing company as the class before it. And many are applying to a wider set of industries than the class prior.

As tech quiets down on hiring, several other industries have quickly gobbled up some of the 141,000-and-counting laid off tech workers in the U.S. More than half of displaced tech workers found jobs outside of the tech sector in 2023, according to LinkedIn.


“There is such a distrust of big tech,” said Adam Struck, a venture capital founder whose startups have been hiring laid off tech workers. “And it’s just so hard generally right now to make it in tech, no matter what stage you’re playing at.”
Leaving the tech industry
Big tech companies, which remained largely stable during the financial crisis and ballooned during the pandemic, are reckoning with the resilience of their own industry. Together, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Salesforce 1 were responsible for 42% of tech layoffs between January 2022 and March 2023, according to an analysis of The Crunchbase Tech Layoffs Tracker.
Meanwhile, companies you wouldn’t consider “tech” companies are hiring talent like crazy: Disney, Deloitte and Bank of America are looking for software engineers, cybersecurity professionals and data scientists, according to career insights firm Dice, a DHI Group company.
In the Handshake survey of 954 students, only 31% said working for a big name was an important factor, compared to 41% of students who said so just a year earlier. Of those students surveyed, 36% said they’re casting a wider net of applications — expanding their job searches to companies and industries that could use those skills, including the government, nonprofit and retail sectors.
“Once the intense hiring pressure eased from the tech industry, it allowed these other industries to finally start doing their job,” said Ron Hetrick, a senior economist at Lightcast, a labor market analytics firm. “Every industry is trying to make advancements, whether it be in AI or robotics. And the inability to find workers during that time was exceedingly painful.”
According to Lightcast, the median wage for manufacturing jobs has surpassed that for tech jobs. And in the finance and insurance space, the median wage is higher than both, indicating other industries are ready to be just as competitive for tech talent as Silicon Valley companies.
“They started figuring out the game and saying, ‘Look, if we want people, we’re going to start paying at that level,'” Hetrick said.
Coming back to tech
But more competitive pay from other sectors doesn’t mean that tech companies, particularly tech giants like Meta and Google, are going to have a hard time finding tech talent when it’s time to start hiring.
“Companies have wised up and said, ‘We don’t have to pay as high, because there are really solid candidates who don’t want to return to an office, and they’ll sacrifice [pay],” Hetrick said.
That’s a big score for the tech industry, which is among the most remote-friendly job sectors in the U.S. According to LinkedIn data, over a quarter of all remote-friendly jobs come from the tech industry.
“It’s likely that many tech companies will continue to leverage flexibility in order to attract talent, especially as tech companies rethink some of the salaries and other benefits that they used to offer,” said George Sanders, senior editor-at-large at LinkedIn.
According to Hetrick, the tech industry will likely return to a more competitive environment, competing with retail, manufacturing and banking industries. And Lee, who has spent more than a decade in the industry building his own companies, doesn’t plan on leaving any time soon.
“Ironically enough, many of my former classmates went into tech after the Great Financial Crisis lowered the appeal of finance as a career path,” he said.

A Bunch Of AI-Related Companies Are Going Public Via SPAC,Joanna Glasner,2023/05/18,"

Not a lot of startups are going public lately. But nonetheless, we are seeing a few pursuing market debuts, including a handful of artificial intelligence-related companies taking the risky SPAC route to market.
So far this year, several AI-focused companies have announced tie-ups with SPACs, or special-purpose acquisition companies. Planned mergers span sectors including education, diagnostics and data management.

A few examples:

iLearningEngines, a training provider which describes its focus as “AI-powered learning automation,” announced in late April that it plans to list on Nasdaq at an initial valuation of around $1.4 billion through a merger with shell company Arrowroot Acquisition Corp.
Spectral MD, which uses artificial intelligence to predict how wounds will heal,  announced last month that it is going public via a merger with a SPAC, Rosecliff Acquisition Corp I. The deal sets an enterprise value of around $170 million for the Dallas- and London-based company.
Airship AI Holdings, a Redmond, Washington-based developer of  an AI-driven video, sensor and data management platform, announced in March that it is going public through an acquisition by shell company BYTE Acquisition Corp. at a valuation of around $290 million.

In addition, there are some AI-affiliated blank-check companies that have yet to identify an acquisition target.
The search continues
In this category, the most closely watched is AltC Acquisition Corp., a $450 million SPAC that lists OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman as its chief executive. AltC went public in July 2021, with plans to identify an acquisition target within two years. Unless it gets an extension, that time is nearly up.
This week, in a quarterly report, AltC said it “intends to complete a business combination before the mandatory liquidation date.” Currently, the liquidation date is July 12, but AltC said it could be extended to Oct. 12 with a letter of intent or agreement for a merger.
AltC hasn’t specified that it is looking for an artificial intelligence company to take public. However, Altman’s prominence in the space makes it safe to assume the SPAC is at least looking at AI startups.
Yet even as AI buzz intensifies, not every SPAC with ambitions in the space has brought their intentions to fruition. A recent case in point is Intelligent Medicine Acquisition Corp., a blank-check company that went public in October 2021 with a plan to acquire a life science company using artificial intelligence for drug discovery. Three weeks ago, it announced plans to liquidate its shares, after failing to consummate a business combination.

ServiceNow Invests In AI-Based Enterprise Startups With $1B Venture Commitment,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/05/17,"

ServiceNow, a cloud infrastructure company based out of California, is diving into the AI arms race.

The company announced on Wednesday it will put $1 billion into its venture firm, ServiceNow Ventures, to invest in artificial intelligence and automation companies targeting enterprise use cases. 
The venture arm, which started in 2015, has already invested $300 million in 45 companies. The new $1 billion is expected to arrive by 2026. 
The enterprise AI race
ServiceNow has been ramping up its AI efforts for a while now. It acquired Element AI for $500 million in 2020, marking its largest acquisition at the time. Last year, ServiceNow acquired AI-powered skills mapping tech platform Hitch Works.
Just yesterday, ServiceNow announced a partnership with Microsoft, which invested a whopping $13 billion into AI giant OpenAI. The company also unveiled a suite of generative AI tools for businesses including a generative AI controller, which connects ServiceNow to OpenAI’s API large language models. Its new search function allows users to search the entire company’s database through a Google-like platform. 
While generative AI platforms like ChatGPT and Midjourney have gripped everyday consumers, several companies are looking to be a first-mover in enterprise-grade generative AI. The Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence recently announced a $30 million fund to support AI startups focused on business applications. Meanwhile, hardware maker Nvidia has been working on a platform for businesses that would allow them to make industry-specific documents or diagrams using generative AI. 
To close out this web of AI partnerships, Nvidia is also partnering with ServiceNow. Using Nvidia’s software, ServiceNow is developing large language models (similar to the ones that power ChatGPT) that can be used by IT teams, customer service departments and developers.
While private market dealmaking has been relatively slow, investments in AI have been active. In January, a third of all funding went to OpenAI’s $10 billion funding round led by Microsoft.

Investors Pour $225M Into Water Tech Unicorn Gradiant,Marlize van Romburgh,2023/05/17,"

Water technology startup Gradiant has raised $225 million in a Series D funding round that mints its unicorn status.
BoltRock Holdings and Centaurus Capital led the round for Boston-based Gradiant, which is now valued at $1 billion. 
The startup develops technology to reduce water usage and wastewater treatment systems for companies in the pharmaceutical, semiconductor, food and beverage, and other water-demanding industries. The company says its client list includes chip companies Micron Technology and TSMC, pharma giants Pfizer and GSK, and food and beverage manufacturers AB InBev and Coca-Cola.

The company said it will use the fresh capital to expand into new markets, including the Middle East and Europe, and to invest in R&D.
“As global manufacturing and supply chains continue to advance, they demand more and more water resources which are increasingly rare and finite,” Centaurus founder John Arnold said in the funding announcement. “We are excited to partner with a company that has truly proven the ability to support these demands in an economic and energy efficient manner.”
Gradiant has now raised $392.4 million total, per Crunchbase data. The company was founded in 2013 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It now has more than 900 employees internationally, it says, and has achieved more than 100% top-line revenue growth for four consecutive years. 
Gradiant marks one of the largest venture funding rounds so far this year. It’s also the largest, by far, funding in the wastewater treatment space, at least since the beginning of 2022. 
Other recently funded startups in the industry include:

Heartland Water Technology, which develops wastewater technology for the energy industry and raised just under $45 million last year;
ZwitterCo, which raised $33 million last year and uses a membrane technology for water treatment; and
Greyter, which makes water recycling systems for residential and commercial buildings and raised $10 million in January.

Why US Crypto Firm Ripple’s $250M Acquisition Of This Swiss Company Matters,Jenna D'Illard,2023/05/17,"

Finally we get to report some crypto startup news that doesn’t have anything to do with FTX — at least not directly.
In its first acquisition, San Francisco-based Ripple has acquired Switzerland-based Metaco for $250 million — half in cash and half in equity, according to Ripple.
So what does each of these companies do and why does this acquisition make sense? Let’s take this nice and slow.

Privately owned Ripple is the world’s sixth-largest cryptocurrency exchange. 
Metaco makes technology allowing financial institutions to store and manage digital assets. This is a big deal, especially after several major firms (FTX) collapsed, leaving investors facing big losses.
Why Metaco matters
The fact that Metaco is based outside the United States where crypto regulation is much clearer is a bonus for Ripple as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission wrestles to figure out the future of crypto regulation.
The Swiss company is also a legit player in its own right with clients including Citi, BNP Paribas and Societe Generale‘s digital asset arm.
Metaco has raised a total of $20 million in funding over four rounds. Its latest funding was raised on July 14, 2020, from a Series A round. Metaco is funded by 11 investors. Verve Ventures and Standard Chartered Bank are the most recent backers, according to Crunchbase data.
Investor enthusiasm in crypto waned after a drop in cryptocurrency prices in 2022. A slew of major crypto firm failures didn’t help. Yes, we are talking (again) about FTX.
In a statement on its website, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said, “Through the strength of our balance sheet and financial position, Ripple will continue pressing our advantage in the areas critical to crypto infrastructure. Bringing on Metaco is monumental for our growing product suite and expanding global footprint.”
Ripple is no slouch either.
It  has raised a total of $293.8 million in funding over 14 rounds. Its latest funding was raised on Aug. 21, 2021, from a  Series B round. Ripple is funded by 43 investors. Uday Kumar Bangalore Shivaraman and Azure Ventures Group are the most recent investors, according to Crunchbase data.
While crypto prices are on the rise, the dramatic collapse of FTX still hangs over the entire sector with several other lenders and exchanges.

How Founders Can Manage Investor Relations During A Recession,Guest Author,2023/05/17,"

By Matt Cohen
As we continue into an era of economic uncertainty, managing communication with investors is crucial for the success of a startup. In my experience working with founders, I’ve found a few key ways that startups can manage investor relations to foster growth during a downturn.

First, it is important for startup founders to be transparent with their investors about the company’s financial situation and any challenges it is facing. Financial performance updates as well as any cost-cutting measures that have been implemented should be communicated regularly. By being transparent, startup founders can help build trust with their investors and demonstrate their commitment to financial responsibility. In tandem, investors are able to offer more support if they are aware of the specific challenges leaders are facing.
Matt Cohen of Ripple Ventures
Startup founders should have a clear and realistic plan for navigating the recession and positioning the company for future growth. This includes a detailed understanding of the company’s financial needs and a plan for how to address any financial challenges. Investors want to see that the company has a clear and actionable plan for weathering the recession and emerging stronger on the other side.
Founders, keep your decks fresh
Contrary to popular belief, founders should remain proactive in seeking out new sources of funding, such as venture capital, angel investors, debt financing or other sources of capital. During a recession, investors may be more cautious so it is crucial for startups to keep their investor decks fresh and conversations active to be top of mind when money is flowing in again. This can include reaching out to investors who are already on the cap table, as well as exploring alternative forms of financing such as crowdfunding, grants or debt financing.
Be prepared for tough decisions
Unfortunately an economic downturn means tough decisions must be made. Startup founders should also be prepared to make difficult decisions in order to preserve the company’s financial stability during a recession. This may include layoffs, salary reductions or other cost-cutting measures. While these decisions can be difficult, they are often necessary to ensure the long-term survival of the company. Startup founders should communicate these decisions in a transparent and empathetic manner and explain how they will help the company to survive and thrive during the recession. Investors know these choices are hard and will respect your ability to execute them well.
Build relationships
Lastly, founders should also focus on building relationships with their investors. Strong relationships with investors can provide a source of support and guidance during a recession. Startup founders should keep investors informed of their progress and seek feedback on their plan for navigating the recession. They should also be open to suggestions and constructive criticism from investors, and be willing to incorporate feedback into their plan.
Managing communication with investors is always important for startup founders, and even more so when times are tough. Founders who are transparent, prepared and have a strong direction of how to move forward can increase their chances of success and position the company for future growth.

US Semiconductor Startup Funding Slows Even As AI Beckons,Chris Metinko,2023/05/17,"

Semiconductors have seemed to carve out a permanent place in the news cycle recently, whether it concerns SoftBank-backed chipmaker Arm attempting to go public or huge tech titans battling it out for AI server chip dominance.
The industry appears to be on investors’ minds too — although not like in recent years and certainly not when it comes to U.S.-based semiconductor startups.

According to Crunchbase data, global venture dollars have maintained a solid pace through just over a third of this year, with startups receiving nearly $2.3 billion in funding in 168 deals. At that pace, this year’s total should come in just a tick below the $7.9 billion that semiconductor startups saw last year in 349 deals.


It also is interesting to note that unlike many industries, semiconductors did not see a huge falloff last year in funding from 2021 — mainly thanks to some large rounds raised by Chinese companies. In 2021, semiconductor startups raised $8.3 billion in 263 deals globally.


However, closer to home, semiconductor startups in the U.S. have not fared nearly as well, per Crunchbase data. Venture funding is on pace to hit its lowest total since 2019, when those startups in the country raised only $712 million in 60 deals.
Semiconductor startups in the U.S. have raised only $262 million in 17 deals thus far in 2023.
Big dollars overseas
Global numbers have been helped by several large rounds out of China again this year, including China-based SJ Semi — a foundry with global customers — locking up a massive $340 million Series C in April.
In fact, the four biggest rounds this year for semiconductor startups all have gone to China-based firms.
Meanwhile, the largest round in the U.S. went to Santa Clara, California-based 5G chipmaker EdgeQ, which locked up a $75 million investment from a handful of institutional and strategic investors — including Strategic Development Fund, EDBI, Iron Grey and ST Engineering among others.
“This environment is not an easy environment to raise money in,” said EdgeQ co-founder and CEO Vinay Ravuri.
EdgeQ’s business maturity greatly helped in a market where investors have returned to looking for basic fundamentals, Ravuri said. The company has an actual chip — not just a design — as well as customers, and will be generating revenue this year.
“We were different from others and that mattered,” said Ravuri, adding relationships with investors also helped.
Who are the investors?
However, the semiconductor industry in the U.S. has never pulled in big numbers in fundraising — due to the complexity of the technology and its ecosystem, as well as the small pool of investors that specifically focus on it.
“There have always been ups and downs in semiconductors,” said Stefan Dyckerhoff, managing partner at Palo Alto, California-based Sutter Hill Ventures. The firm’s portfolio includes semi startup Astera Labs — which locked up $150 million in a round last November — and open-source semiconductor technology and software provider SiFive among others in the sector.
“This is not a generalist’s area,” he added.
That doesn’t mean there are not significant opportunities. As new tech emerges with complex needs, investors see more potential in the specialization of the chip for different sectors such as AI, sensing, automotive and others.
“We think this is one of the richest times for the industry because of all the emerging applications that will require the rethinking of the semiconductor architecture approach,” said Nicholas Brathwaite, founder and general partner at San Francisco-based Celesta Capital. The deep tech investing firm’s portfolio includes Palo Alto, California-based SambaNova Systems, whose $676 million round in 2021 is the largest ever for a U.S.-based semi startup.
AI’s role
Not surprisingly, AI could play a role in the next chapter for semiconductor startups.
“With ChatGBT, the data center architecture will need to be rethought,” Brathwaite said.
The AI industry will bring about changing graphics processing unit and network i/o needs, and those transforming demands could bring investment opportunities.
“AI has fundamentally different needs for compute,” Dyckerhoff said.
With generative AI companies that focus on the end user raising billions, chip startups specializing in the AI ecosystem could see their share. In fact, SambaNova started out as an AI chip designer.
“You have seen some money go to those startups and you’ll see more,” Brathwaite said.
EdgeQ’s Ravuri said AI’s role in the semiconductor industry may extend beyond which chip is used in new AI applications. Artificial intelligence could actually help with chip design and creation, assisting scientists with some of the complicated mathematical debates and problems in the industry, he said.
AI also could be incorporated into the electronic design automation tools engineers use to create chips, he added.
“There are definitely opportunities,” he said.

Elon Musk Moves Twitter Closer To ‘Super App’ Status With Startup Acquisition,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/05/16,"

After spending the past few months shaking up Twitter internally, Elon Musk is now looking to the future.
Just days after announcing a new CEO, Twitter is reportedly acquiring tech talent hiring platform Laskie, Bloomberg first reported on Tuesday.
Laskie was co-created by serial Twitter user and startup founder Chris Bakke, who previously sold hiring startup Interviewed to Indeed six years ago.
Neither Laskie nor Twitter confirmed the acquisition or announced the terms of the deal. And Bakke, who I always see on my Twitter feed, has been suspiciously offline since early May.

It’s a surprising move for Twitter, which recently cut upward of 3,500 employees and sold its pricey office furniture, and is still, after all that, being sued by at least six companies for not paying its bills.
But perhaps the acquisition is a sign the company is on the mend. Musk previously announced Linda Yaccarino, an ex-NBCUniversal executive, will take on the role of CEO and he will act as the chief technology officer.
Building a super app
After acquiring Twitter against his will, Musk said his aspirations for the social media company involved becoming a “super app,” a one-stop shop for every digital interaction from messaging to buying groceries. It’s a goal Snap CEO Evan Spiegel has long aspired to achieve and something many companies in China already function as today
Laskie, which matches job seekers with prospective employers, may bring Twitter a step closer to its super app goal and allow it to compete with LinkedIn as a professional social networking platform.
However, Twitter doesn’t have a great track record with maintaining its acquisitions. The incredibly popular six-second video platform Vine was acquired by Twitter in 2012 for around $30 million and subsequently shut down four years later.
Twitter at the time said it wanted to reallocate resources toward live streaming instead of Vine, but then shut down its livestreaming platform Periscope in 2021, citing “unsustainable” levels of maintenance for the product. Periscope survived only six years under Twitter’s management.
This is Twitter’s first acquisition under Musk, but I’m not sure if Twitter will be able to catch up with Facebook and Amazon, both of which are far closer to super app status than the bird website is.

The Biggest Startup IPOs Are Down 2.5x More Post-Peak Than The Nasdaq,Joanna Glasner,2023/05/16,"

Say you put $100 into a Nasdaq Composite Index fund at the peak of the boom. That would have been Nov. 19, 2021, back when interest rates were low and tech stocks were scorching hot.
Today, that investment would be worth about $76. It’s a disappointing return, reflective of several quarters of steadily falling technology valuations. But you could have done worse.
Now, imagine that, instead of the index fund, you picked a basket of hot, venture-backed startups founded in the past 15 years. You know, companies like Airbnb, Coinbase, Rivian and Uber.
Let’s say you invested at the market peak in November 2021. And let’s say you bought a share of the startups that launched the 19 largest public offerings in the past 10 years.

If you held till now, every $100 you invested would be worth around $32. That’s much steeper than the decline in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index, and points to public investors’ deeper disenchantment with mostly unprofitable newer market entrants.
How far down?
To illustrate how far hot startups have declined since the peak, we put together a chart of the 19 companies in our sample below. We look at where share prices were at the 2021 market top, and where they are now.


Notably, only one company on our list — Uber — is even close to where it was at the peak. Shares of the ride-hailing giant got a boost after a Q1 earnings report showing better-than-expected revenue and sharply lower losses.
Every other company on our list except Airbnb has shed more than half its value in the past year and a half. For some, the declines are especially pronounced. Real-estate i-buying platform Opendoor, and electric-car maker Rivian, for instance, are both down close to 90%. Bright Health Group is down 95%.
Hot newcomers are just not valued like they used to be
While our basket of younger technology stocks has tanked post-peak, the most valuable companies in the space have exhibited more mixed performance.
Of the four most valuable tech and internet behemoths, Apple’s share price has actually risen since the 2021 market peak, while Microsoft’s are down a modest 9%. Amazon and Google, meanwhile, have posted steeper post-peak declines, of  31% and 26%, respectively.
It’s not surprising to see “big tech” outperform newer market entrants. After all, these are companies with long track records of enormous revenues and fat profits. That’s a sharp contrast to a company like, say, Rivian, which generated a huge early-market valuation despite meager sales at the time.
Today, investors are much less interested in companies’ future potential and much more keen on present earnings. To regain market confidence, former hot newcomers will need to show they’re capable of producing them.

"
How Early- To Mid-Stage Startups Should Use Incentive Compensation In This Economic Environment,Guest Author,2023/05/16,"

By Grayson Morris
With the global economy slowing during this exceptional period of uncertainty, it is essential that companies, especially early- to mid-stage startups dependent on outside investors, leverage incentive compensation to drive revenue growth.
Offering a commission on top of a base salary has served to motivate salespeople to meet or exceed their quotas. A well-designed incentive comp plan is an important strategic lever that can be applied to dramatically improve the financial results of a company. Well-designed incentive comp programs allow companies to improve productivity and reduce employee attrition. It also motivates employees to do their best work.
Retention matters
Grayson Morris, CEO of Performio
Retention of your top sales talent is always a top priority in periods of economic growth, with the average tenure of a sales rep being 18 months, but in periods of economic uncertainty it’s imperative. That is why it is important to set short-term quotas (e.g., quarterly) vs. annual. By doing so, managers can reevaluate every quarter to see how things are shaping up and make adjustments as necessary.
You definitely want to keep your best reps, so if they’re not making what they hoped to make, consider other options like one-time bonuses, activity-based comp, and Spifs (Sales Performance Incentive Funds). Simply increasing the base pay of sales reps will not solve the problem if they can just go to another startup and earn more money. With 2023 well underway and the news of the Silicon Valley Bank failure, startup executives must be cautious and work to ensure their sales reps feel confident in the company’s future and know that if they are able to achieve their goals, they’ll be well compensated.
Get clear
Other strategies that can be used include using accelerators generously. If you set your accelerators right, your top-performing reps will stick around, overachieve, and help you drive revenue. Finally, get crystal clear about what’s important to your business and incentivize that. For example, if cash flow is more important than just pure growth, you may want to pay on gross margin or reward reps for not discounting and signing multiyear contracts.
Here are some other considerations to keep in mind to better manage your incentive comp program:

Be realistic: Recent mass layoffs in tech have created a lot of uncertainty in the job market, so companies should work to ensure comp plans are achievable and will motivate sales reps to meet or exceed their quotas.
Communicate effectively: Clear communication will help build trust and motivate employees. Be transparent about how these compensation decisions are made.
Benchmark against industry standards: Stay competitive by benchmarking compensation against industry standards.

As companies scale up in size, the moving parts and complexities grow exponentially larger. Having a well-designed incentive compensation offering can help you better motivate the people who generate your revenue and result in improved revenue outcomes even in an economic downturn.

Grayson Morris is CEO of Performio. The company offers sales performance management software for businesses looking to automate their sales compensation calculations and provide increased transparency to their sales reps. Morris holds an MBA from Stanford University, an MS in mechanical engineering from UC Berkeley, and a BS in mechanical engineering from Rice University.

"
Tiger Global Looking To Sell Off Startup Stakes — Report,Chris Metinko,2023/05/15,"

Tiger Global — one of the biggest players in the venture market in recent years — seems to be changing its stripes.

The New York-based crossover investment giant has hired an adviser to help it sell off some stakes in startups, per a report in the Financial Times. Such a process — called a secondary sale — could allow Tiger to return capital to some of its investors.
Just last month, it was reported Tiger Global’s $12.7 billion fund — which was launched near the end of 2021 — had a paper loss of 20%, net of management fees, as of December.
In March, The Wall Street Journal reported Tiger Global had marked down the value of its investments across its venture capital funds by about 33%.
Writedowns
Some notable writedowns from Tiger Global’s Private Investment Partners XV include its entire $38 million investment in the now bankrupt FTX and FTX.US, as well other crypto and Web3 investments such as MoonPay, decentralized wireless network company Helium, and NFT startup Bored Ape Yacht Club, per the report last month.
Tiger also took a huge hit in its investment in NFT marketplace OpenSea. The firm invested $126.8 million in the startup in November 2021 and January 2022. However, at the end of last year, Tiger had marked that investment down to $30.2 million — a 76% drop, according to the report.
Tiger also had a significant writedown on its largest holding, ByteDance. Through its recent fund, Tiger invested $144.6 million in the China-based company in mid-2021 in secondary transactions. In September 2022, Tiger valued those investments at $100.8 million, per the report.
Slowdown
The writedowns come on the heels of the news Tiger had reduced the target size for its latest venture fund to $5 billion — down from a $6 billion target it set last fall and down more than 50% of what the firm anticipated raising earlier last year, according to another WSJ report.
Tiger has massively cut down on its investments throughout the past year, according to Crunchbase data. The firm made 245 deals in the first half of last year, but so far this year has made only 15.
One of those investments was just announced Monday, as San Francisco-based Zip raised a $100 million Series C at a $1.5 billion post-money valuation from investors that included Tiger.

Procurement Startup Zip Lands $100M — Ups Valuation To $1.5B,Chris Metinko,2023/05/15,"

San Francisco-based Zip raised a $100 million Series C from investors Y Combinator, CRV and Tiger Global, while also bucking the trend of declining valuations.
The new cash gives the procurement startup a $1.5 billion post-money valuation. While many companies are seeing stagnant or falling valuations, the new valuation represents a slight bump from its previous $1.2 billion valuation last May after the company raised a $43 million Series B.

“We continue to invest in Zip because we believe in this outstanding team’s ability to achieve their mission to solve a ubiquitous business problem: spend control,” Garry Tan, president and CEO at Y Combinator, said in a release. “Zip is one of YC’s most successful B2B companies from the last few years.”
Zip helps companies with the burdensome process of buying new software and hardware. Its platform helps with sourcing, approving and paying for needed business tools, ideally helping to streamline the process to make it less taxing.
The company claims hundreds of customers globally including Snowflake, Coinbase and Northwestern Mutual.
Procuring cash
Procurement falls under the broader umbrella of what is often called enterprise resource planning.
While not the sexiest of industries, companies do need software systems that help run processes in departments such as finance, human resources and supply chain. SAP, Ariba and Coupa have built large companies in the sector.
ERP startups have not seen big funding dollars in recent times, according to Crunchbase data. In 2021, startups in the sector raised $1.5 billion in 80 deals.
However, last year those numbers fell to just $335 million in 53 deals.
Thus far this year, the industry has seen only $115 million of dealmaking — with Zip’s being the largest by far.
Founded in 2020, Zip has raised $181 million to date, per the company.

Ethernovia Raises $64M To Boost Electric Vehicle Manufacturing,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/05/15,"

Ethernovia, an ethernet chip company from California, announced on Monday it raised $64 million in Series A funding. Porsche Automobile Holding SE, VentureTech Alliance, Qualcomm Ventures and Western Digital Capital were among the participating investors.

The U.S. is currently spending billions of dollars to manufacture chips in America instead of buying from China. Last year, the Biden Administration signed the CHIPS and Science Act, which would funnel more than $50 billion into semiconductor chip manufacturing that is based in the country.  From a geopolitical standpoint, the U.S. wants to be reasonably self–reliant on its chip industry in case war, embargoes or trade disagreements impact its relations with East Asia.
These chips, which go into every tech gadget from television sets to cars, are becoming even more critical to the U.S. as it ramps up its production of electric vehicles. Enter companies like Ethernovia: the five-year-old startup builds one ethernet system that acts as the spine of the car, eliminating the need for hundreds of microchips interwoven by a handful of cables.
Changing industry standards
Simplifying the hardware and software system makes electric vehicle manufacturing faster to assemble and maintain, and makes it easier to troubleshoot an electric vehicle.
“The trends towards electrification and connectivity in the automotive industry as well as developments in the field of automated driving result in ever increasing requirements on fast and secure data transmission from a wide variety of sources in vehicles and to the cloud,” Lutz Meschke, Porsche SE board of management member, said in a statement.
Indeed, as electric vehicles become more widely adopted, the industry is bracing for scalable infrastructure that can quickly update with changing regulations around cybersecurity and accuracy on the road. Ethernovia’s suite of chips and software are part of a broader movement in the sector to meet those needs.

Down Times Look Like Up Times For Accelerator Applications,Joanna Glasner,2023/05/15,"

This is the third installment in a four-part series featuring workers displaced by the recent waves of tech layoffs who used the transition to found their own companies. In Part One we chatted with investors and founders and looked at data for early-stage startups. In Part Two we met tech-worker-turned-entrepreneur Peter Henry. Part Four introduces legal tech entrepreneur Anmol Sahai. Today we visit the state of accelerators during the downturn. — Special Projects Editor Christine Kilpatrick
It’s never easy to get into the most competitive accelerator programs. These days, however, there’s good reason to believe the competition is getting even fiercer.
From fewer slots at top programs like Y Combinator to reduced seed-stage funding for newly minted founders, the environment for launching a startup has changed considerably in the past few quarters. Meanwhile, the alternative — a job at someone else’s tech company — is neither as stable nor as lucrative as it used to be.

“The sentiment is: It’s not nearly as attractive to be at these large techs in May of 2023 as in June of 2021,” said Melody Koh, a partner at NextView Ventures, an early-stage investor that runs a small accelerator program for pre-seed and seed-stage teams.
The rise in layoffs over the past year has also broadened the pool of potential entrepreneurs with more time for other pursuits now that they’re not toiling for a paycheck. Close to 140,000 workers at U.S.-based tech companies have been laid off in mass job cuts so far in 2023, per Crunchbase’s Layoff Tracker. Job openings, meanwhile, are down sharply since the market peaked in late 2021.
Accelerator applications pile up
Of course, entrepreneurship doesn’t happen in a vacuum. One doesn’t just leave a 9-to-5 job, devote a few late nights to coding, and create the next big software platform. Building something scalable typically takes networks, business plans, pitching, sales calls, term sheets and a lot of rejection along the way.
That’s where accelerators and incubators come in. While programs vary widely in size, duration and sector focus, most pitch themselves as a way for founders to get access to the networks, investors, advice and support they need to turn a vision or prototype into a more viable business.
It’s a compelling offer, which helps explain why the best-known programs are notoriously tough to get into. Only an estimated 1% of Y Combinator applicants make it into the storied program, while the acceptance rate for Techstars is said to be approximately 1% to 2%.
There’s no established index of acceptance rates across the accelerator ecosystem, so it’s tough to say what the average is for the space. As programs become more known and established, however, they attract more applicants. And downturns don’t have a history of deterring would-be entrepreneurs.
There’s no time like a down time
At NextView, for instance, the pool applying for the latest accelerator class was larger than last year’s, and the quality of applicants was also higher, per Koh. Although founders will be founders regardless of where we are in the market cycle, she did point to several factors that make this a particularly compelling time to launch.
One factor, she noted, is that plummeting valuations at public and private technology companies have left employees with stock compensation packages that look far less valuable than they were a year ago. As a result, many are “free from the golden handcuffs” of an anticipated options payoff.
Startup founders today also face less competition, and lower advertising and marketing costs. True, their prospective customers are also likely to be tightening their belts, but Koh believes this will mean that: “the companies rising to the top in this generation are going to be stronger.”
Stephanie Simon, head of admissions at Y Combinator, shared this viewpoint in a recent blog post titled: Why would you start a startup in an economic downturn?
“Cost-sensitive customers can be helpful in the early days of your company. If they pay you in this tough environment, it’s a stronger signal. There’s a higher likelihood you’re building something they really want,” Simon wrote. She added that it’s likely not a coincidence that two of the top YC companies, Airbnb and Stripe, were started in the depths of the last recession.
That said, saying now is a great time to launch a startup and actually investing more in the current environment are two different things.
Last summer, Y Combinator reduced the size of its cohort by 40% from peak levels, citing the downturn and a more muted funding environment. The accelerator also announced in March that it will be decreasing late-stage investment in companies that go through its program.
So while the present moment may be a great time to launch a startup in many respects, it’s certainly not an easy one.

"What’s Happening With Seed And Series A Funding, In 4 Charts",Marlize van Romburgh,2023/05/13,"

When venture funding started to turn south after a blockbuster year in 2021, seed and early-stage funding was at first relatively unscathed. Investment into seed startups globally actually grew in Q2 2022, even as venture investment overall dropped off dramatically.
That’s no longer the case.

Seed funding starts to slip
Seed and angel investment to U.S. startups fell 45% year over year in the first quarter of 2023, to $3.1 billion, Crunchbase data shows. That’s the lowest quarterly amount since Q4 2020.


The size of a typical seed round also shrank, an analysis of Crunchbase data shows. After peaking in 2022 at $2.5 million, the median U.S. seed round dipped to $2.3 million in Q1 2023. The average dipped slightly from $3.7 million to $3.6 million.
Of course, that’s still far above where those deal sizes were less than a decade ago. In 2014, the median and average were both under $1 million.


Series A tumbles
Series A is suffering too. Crunchbase data shows Series A investment into U.S.-based startups has fallen for five consecutive quarters, dwindling from $14.5 billion in Q4 2021 to $5.7 billion last quarter.


Series A round sizes also dipped. The median Series A for a U.S. startup was $12 million last quarter — down $2 million compared to the 2022 median. Average deal size dipped from $19.1 million in 2022 and 2021 to $18.7 million last quarter.


Still, last quarter’s typical Series A deals were double or triple their size in 2014.
And some massive Series A checks have gone to biotech startups and companies in the red-hot artificial intelligence space this year.
Paradigm, a clinical trials platform, raised a $203 million Series A round last quarter. Cargo Therapeutics, a biotech working on cancer treatments, raised $200 million.
In AI, ChatGPT competitor Character.ai raised $150 million in a round led by Andreessen Horowitz that landed it on The Crunchbase Unicorn Board.
Investors look for more than good ideas
But all in all, the early-stage funding environment is tougher than it once was.
“Ideas are not as fundable as they used to be,” Steve Lehman, chair of entrepreneur networking and skill-building platform CoFoundersLab, told Crunchbase News recently. “Sure, I think investors, particularly in seed to Series A, are looking for something a little more tangible where the wheels are already on the bus. It doesn’t have to necessarily be rolling down the highway yet, but it’s got to have good momentum with unique value propositions.”

"The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Uveye, Amino Lead Another Slow Week For Big Rounds",Chris Metinko,2023/05/12,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.
If you are looking for positive news about the venture capital market picking back up, you can stop reading now. In fact, this week proved a stark contrast to just a year ago — when the venture market was already in decline. This time last year, 15 U.S.-based startups raised nine-figure rounds (you can read about some of them here). This week there was one.

Last year, it took $109 million to grab the 10th spot on this list — this week it took only $12 million.
We know the salad days of 2021 are long gone, but it seems like startups may well soon crave the “slowdown” of 2022.
1. UVeye, $100M, automotive: This was a big week for automotive safety (as we covered). Qualcomm bought Autotalks — a maker of chips used in crash-prevention technology — this week. In addition, UVeye, which develops automated vehicle-inspection systems, raised a $100 million Series D led by Hanaco VC. The Detroit-based startup’s platform uses a combination of proprietary algorithms, artificial intelligence, machine learning, sensors and more to detect external or mechanical flaws in cars. Basically, it performs a full physical on your automobile. The startup will use the new cash to start production of UVeye inspection systems in North America, support further sales growth and grow its market. Founded in 2016, the company has now raised nearly $196 million, per Crunchbase.
2. Amino Health, $80M, health care: Finding the right doctor and the right care can still be a problem, even if you have health care insurance. San Francisco-based Amino Health, a digital health care guidance company, wrapped up an $80 million round — a mix of equity and debt — led by Transformation Capital and Oxford Finance to help with exactly that. The company’s platform allows users to digitally navigate to find quality, cost-effective care through their health plans and benefits. The startup now has 1.6 million members. Founded in 2013, the company has raised $125 million, according to Crunchbase.
3. 8fig, $40M, finance: E-commerce companies need significant capital for operations, as inventory and supply chain expenses can eat into a startup’s cash flow. However, with a slowing venture capital market, alternative financing models are needed. Enter Austin, Texas-based 8fig, which closed a $140 million Series B — reported as $40 million in equity and $100 million in a credit facility. The round was led by Koch Disruptive Technologies. The company provides growth plans for small and medium-sized e-commerce businesses that have some sales history. The plan includes funding and financial tools for supply chain management, financial planning, and freight and logistics coordination. 8fig has provided online sellers with more than $500 million since being founded, and increased its annual revenue by 800% last year. 8fig — founded in 2020 in Israel —  has now raised $196.5 million to date, according to the company.
4. (tied) Cullgen, $35M, biotech: San Diego-based Cullgen, a biotechnology company developing small molecule therapeutics, raised a $35 million Series C financing round led by AstraZeneca-CICC Venture Capital Partnership. The company also raised an additional $5 million this week when GNI Group elected to exercise its outstanding warrants for Cullgen stock. The startup is dedicated to developing new chemical entities for the treatment of what it calls “diseases lacking effective therapeutic approaches.” Founded in 2018, the company has raised a total of $106 million, per Crunchbase.
4. (tied) Petal, $35M, fintech: New York-based Petal closed a $35 million funding round led by Valar Ventures. The fintech firm brands itself as trying to help underserved consumers financially succeed. The company uses its own platform for cash flow underwriting which serves as an alternative to traditional credit scores and makes credit more accessible. Founded in 2016, the company has raised more than $750 million, per Crunchbase.
6. Wellthy, $26M, fintech: New York-based Wellthy, a family care concierge service, raised a fresh $25.5 million in funding. No lead investor was named, but new investors include Citi Impact Fund and Stardust Equity. Founded in 2014, the company has now raised $78 million, according to Crunchbase data.
7. Sealonix, $20M, medical devices: Bedford, Massachusetts-based Sealonix, a developer of hemostatic sealants for surgical use, closed a $20 million Series A led by Excelestar Ventures. Founded this year, this is the company’s first outside round, per Crunchbase.
8. Cloverly, $19M, cleantech: Atlanta-based climate platform Cloverly raised a $19 million Series A led by Grotech Ventures. Founded in 2018, the startup has raised $21 million, per Crunchbase.
9. Solarea Bio, $15M, biotech: Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Solarea Bio, a clinical stage biotechnology startup developing food-derived microbial-based solutions, closed a $15 million Series B led by S2G Ventures. The company said it is targeting a total of up to $25 million for the round. Founded in 2017, the company has raised $26 million, per Crunchbase.
10. (tied) Three companies tied for the last spot this week, with New York-based financial media startup Blockworks, Nashua, New Hampshire-based manufacturing analytics platform Datanomix and New York-based medical equipment firm Optain all announcing rounds of $12 million.
Big global deals
While U.S.-based startups did not see many large rounds this week, there were some abroad.

London-based YgEia3, a startup developing wellness testing for companies, raised a huge $750 million venture round.
China-based Qingdian Photovoltaic Technology, a photovoltaic power generation startup, raised a $216 million Series A.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of May 6 to May 12. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

The Writers’ Strike Is Trying To Keep AI From Taking Over Hollywood. Is It Too Late?,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/05/12,"

I thought escaping San Francisco as a tech reporter would be good for me. Now I spend my days surrounded by folks in The Industry who can’t stop talking about AI.
Platforms like ChatGPT and Midjourney have turned conversations with screenwriters, concept artists and film producers into existential parleys about the future of Hollywood, a labor-driven industry fueled by strong unions that was quickly injected with a fast-moving tech bomb.

All this came to a head in May, when the television, film and digital writers that make up the Writers Guild of America announced they would go on strike. This is perhaps one of the first times we’re seeing AI — a revolutionary technology concept, completely unrestrained, whipping through every industry imaginable — face the labor world.
What are the consequences? We don’t know yet. That’s the problem.
But generative AI is already seeping into Academy Award-winning movies and television shows to de-age actors, lip-sync in different languages, and build worlds straight out of a storybook.


The AI revolution in Hollywood
When I was a teenage dirtbag in 2015, I spent my days watching an animated series called Bojack Horseman. 
In one episode, the titular movie star is asked to sit in front of a machine that will take a 3D scan of his face and body. In case he died, the production house would be able to make the movie without him.
The ridiculousness of that concept seemed on par with a show about an alcoholic anthropomorphic horse.
Turns out it was pretty real — the show used technology from Artec Group, which makes 3D scanning devices that have been used for production in Narnia, Jurassic World, Terminator Genisys and even the Big Bang Theory (though the latter was actually doing a product placement ad for Microsoft’s Kinect while using Artec’s technology).
Even former President Barack Obama became the first president to be 3D scanned via Artec.
Artec’s technology made it possible for movie studios to create a “digital twin” of their actors and manipulate them on-screen — they could morph, disintegrate and disappear. In Narnia, the producers scanned a man and a taxidermied beast, stitching them together and making the magical character walk. Artec CEO Artem Yukhin used to hang out on Lucasfilm’s set watching Star Wars shoots.
“It was very funny because all my friends and colleagues were envious and said, ‘Why, you idiot who doesn’t appreciate all this, go and see all these things there.’ And I really didn’t care,” Yukhin said. “But it became immediately clear we were very needed there.”
Fast-forward to today: I’m no longer a teenager (still a dirtbag), and AI companies are cropping up, signing deals with film studios and turning studio executives into tech company ones.
Flawless, an AI solution that can sync actors’ mouths to different languages, is doing both. The company was co-founded by film director Scott Mann, who saw one of his films clunkily dubbed in German. Using the same technology that creates deepfakes, Flawless is able to morph the actors’ mouth to match whatever language it’s being dubbed  with. The same technology is also used for digital reshoots.
That kind of technology helps companies save money on creating reshoots. It also allows them to better tap into international markets for revenue.
“You can get in to unlock other markets because it’s simply a better immersive experience when it looks like your actors are telling their story in the native language of that market, which then allows you to do all these interesting things to take more risks on content,” said Peter Busch, chief strategic officer at Flawless.
The labor fight with AI
Among the WGA’s demands is that studios cannot use written material to train AI (which the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers did not agree with). That’s important — if you’re a writer who worked on two seasons of a television show, you don’t want AI using that material to spit out the next few episodes of plot and character development.
As this technology further embeds itself into Hollywood, the various guilds protecting actors, directors, producers and animators are asking more questions about the potential damages of those platforms.
“We’re going to go through, I’ll call it our Taylor Swift moment — when Spotify was scrutinized by her as damaging to the recording industry,” Busch said.
Bryant Griffin, a visual-effects artist who worked on films including Pacific Rim and Avengers, said the WGA’s demands are likely to have wide-reaching implications in the film industry, including for visual-effects artists, who are not unionized.
“Everybody feels like this fight is really important. I think that’s why the writer’s guild is experiencing a lot of support right now from other unions within the industry,” Griffin said. “The WGA [strike] is the tip of the spear.”
Flawless, which employs Hollywood veterans including studio executives and animation heads, said it’s working closely with the various guilds of Hollywood as it develops its platform.
“The guilds basically control Hollywood, right?” Busch said. “And so in order for us to bring a product to market, we need to work within the existing framework.”

"
Are (Male) Investors Missing The Obvious? Why Investing In Female Leaders In Health Care Can Increase Returns And Improve Health Outcomes,Guest Author,2023/05/12,"

By Linda Greub
A male venture capitalist once said, “I don’t want to talk about vaginas every Monday morning in my partner meeting.”
Although nearly every woman has a vagina, the word itself can be enough to prevent men, the majority of decision-making investors, from investing in vagina-based innovations — or women’s health in general. Female founders received only 1.9% of all venture capital funding in 2022 and female founders of women’s health companies received even less than that.
However, when it comes to innovation and improvements for women, female-led women’s health companies are poised to succeed.

Women are 80% of the health care workforce, make 80% of household health care decisions, and spend 29% more per-capita on health care than men. They live longer, are more likely to have chronic health care conditions, and see health care providers more regularly than men.
Linda Greub, co-founder and managing partner of Avestria.
They are also more likely than men to experience adverse drug effects, Alzheimer’s, autoimmune disease, osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis, among others. Other conditions — such as endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome and pre-eclampsia — affect them exclusively.
Women’s intuition plays a role
Women are so intertwined with health care — as decision-makers, patients and workers — that they have the insight to identify white spaces, drive innovation and understand the direct and indirect costs of ignoring women’s health.
For example, women make up 66% of family caregivers: a role with a $1.5 trillion estimated value in the U.S. and $10.9 trillion globally. Unhealthy women might not have the emotional, mental, or physical abilities to keep those in their care healthy as well, including children, parents, or in-laws.
They also might not be able to work to their full potential, or even work at all: If all paid working women in the United States did not — or could not — work for a single day, the country would lose almost $21 billion in terms of GDP. Yet, women with period pain saw nearly nine days in lost productivity per year while 32% of surveyed women with endometriosis reported missing work. Quantified, the estimated indirect costs of PMS are $4,333 per woman and greater than $15,000 for endometriosis.
Women helping women
The best people to understand, experience and address this need for healthy women are one and the same: women.
Female leadership has already proven its value: Women in leadership or board roles have greater diversity of backgrounds, more innovation patents and citations, improved performance and less corruption than mostly or all–male teams. Women-led companies also had 35% higher ROIs and 63% higher valuations than all-male teams and generated 78 cents of revenue per dollar raised compared to all-male teams’ 31 cents.
Thus, female-led health care companies address an otherwise overlooked market and have successful, skillful leaders at their helm. They have already started to see major successes too: Maven Clinic became the first digital health unicorn focused on women’s health while Elvie, Kindbody and Tia had some of the largest fundraising rounds for women’s health companies ever.
Acquisitions of KaNDy Therapeutics by Bayer, Alydia Health by Organon, Uqora by Pharmavite, and Gennev by Unified Women’s Healthcare show that established companies are recognizing the value of women’s health — and may encourage others to follow. Plus, all these startups were founded and/or are led by women.
While male investors may not want to say the word vagina, their historic lack of focus on and funding for women’s health has created a massive market vacuum. Female leaders, especially those of women’s health companies, can successfully capitalize on this overlooked opportunity and, in the process, improve health outcomes for women everywhere.

 Linda Greub is the co-founder and managing partner of Avestria Ventures, which invests in early-stage women’s health and female-led life science ventures. For 30-plus years, Greub has invested in public and private life science companies as an institutional investor, a corporate M&A executive, a hedge fund analyst, and a private venture investor. She graduated from Yale University and Harvard Business School.

What Does Last Year’s IPO Class Have To Teach 2023’s Public Market Hopefuls?,Gené Teare,2023/05/11,"

Last year, tech IPOs slowed to a plodding walk. In 2023, they’re down to a crawl.
The outlook for tech IPOs isn’t much livelier for the second half of this year either, with interest rates at their highest in 16 years and lackluster performance from last year’s IPO class further dampening enthusiasm for new public listings.

See also: The Crunchbase Billion-Dollar Exits Board

However, there is a long list of high-growth companies that missed the 2021 IPO window and are waiting in the wings for the market to turn more favorable. If some of those companies decide to go public, they could help thaw the IPO pipeline.

A large number of companies filed S-1 forms — the regulatory paperwork signaling an intent to go public — in 2021 and 2022, noted Tad Freese of IPO law firm Latham & Watkins in an email to Crunchbase News. While not all of those companies are ready to go public right now, many have already made it through the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s review process and are standing by for market stability, said Freese.
IPO headwinds
But the performance of last year’s IPO class and the public markets this year are significant headwinds.
While the spin-off of Johnson & Johnson’s consumer health division, Kenvue — valued at $50 billion at the end of its first-day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this month — is a potential signal of a market thaw, it’s not necessarily a good predictor of how venture-backed tech IPOs will be received on the public markets. That’s because in contrast to loss-leading, high-growth tech companies, Kenvue is a well-established, profitable company that owns household brand names including Band-Aid, Tylenol, Neutrogena and Listerine.
So far in 2023, only two U.S. venture-backed companies — LanzaTech and Intuitive Machines, both SPAC mergers — have listed above $1 billion on the public markets, and both are down more than 40% since going public.
That’s according to an analysis of The Crunchbase Billion-Dollar Exits Board, a list of U.S. venture-backed companies’ with first exits valued at $1 billion or more.
How the class of 2022 performed
Tech stocks overall lost a third of their value in 2022.
New listings fared even worse. Of the 29 U.S.-based venture-backed companies that went public at $1 billion or more last year, over two-thirds are trading more than 80%  below their listing price.1
Three of the companies —Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, Credo Semiconductor and Prime Medicine — went public via a traditional IPO, an illustration of how tepid the reception for tech stocks has been. The majority — 25 companies — were SPAC listings. Cannabis product supplier Bright Green was the single direct listing.
However, six of the companies are down less than 25% from the price at listing which include the three companies that went public via a traditional IPO.
The single company of this batch that is well above its listing price is biotech company Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, which develops solutions for Alzheimer’s and other brain diseases.
Other listings currently valued above $1 billion include semiconductor company for 5G wireless Credo Semiconductor, electric motorcycle company LiveWire, gene editing biotech company Prime Medicine, and small modular power company NuScale Power. These four companies are flat or down less than 25%.


Down a lot
The most highly valued listing of the 2022 cohort was New York-based Pagaya, a B2B service that uses AI to assess creditworthiness for loan applications for its partners. It went public via a SPAC merger that valued it at $8.5 billion. The business is now worth less than a tenth of that value, at $637 million, as of May 11, 2023.
The next most highly valued IPO was blockchain infrastructure provider Core Scientific, valued at $4.3 billion in a SPAC merger. As of this writing the company is valued at $129 million less than one-thirtieth of that value.
And neobank Dave, which supports its customers with no overdraft fees and access to early paychecks, was valued at $4 billion on its SPAC merger and is worth around $55 million.
Of the companies that raise the most in funding, peer-to-peer car sharing company Getaround stands out. It raised $541 million and is valued at $32 million. And short-term rental company Sonder raised $529 million and is now worth $91 million.
Looking forward
We will start to see some activity by the fourth quarter of this year, predicts Lise Buyer, founder of IPO advisory firm Class V Group.
“Many raised significant funds in 2020 and 2021, but they are using that cash and will likely be more comfortable adding to the treasury as the current funds are used in growing the business,” she said. And of private funding, “the free-flowing sources of funds so available in previous years, have dried up.”
That said, Buyer notes that IPO hopefuls will need to temper their expectations: She predicts that the lofty public multiples we saw in 2021 aren’t coming back soon, if ever.
Two things need to come together for companies to go public, Buyer said.  First, “the bid-ask spread needs to narrow,” which means IPOs will need to be valued rationally — perhaps smaller with lower valuations than these companies previously aspired to.  If companies grow according to their projections, they can always raise again later, at higher values.
Second, companies will also “need some comfort on the macro environment before offering a financial outlook,” Buyer said. With the current recession uncertainty it is difficult for companies to forecast revenue in the coming quarters and years.
Companies that missed the 2021 IPO window include Stripe, Databricks, Instacart, Chime and Klarna to name a few, all founded over a decade ago.
The general consensus is the markets will likely open up in 2024, said Freese. But he agrees we could see more activity in the second half of 2023.
Either way, it will be interesting to see who is ready to test the markets and what a rational valuation could look like.

SoftBank’s Vision Fund Arm Posts Record $32B Loss,Chris Metinko,2023/05/11,"

SoftBank’s Vision Fund unit — known for its investment in startups including Uber, WeWork and DoorDash — suffered losses of $32 billion for its recent fiscal year as startups continue to see their valuations slashed.
The loss is a significant increase from the more than $19 billion loss the unit suffered last year.
The overall loss of investments in the Vision Fund unit totaled $39 billion for the fiscal year ended March 31, compared to $25 billion the previous fiscal year.

The losses from the unit — which included SoftBank’s Vision Fund 1, Vision Fund 2 and its LatAm Funds that focus on Latin America — led the SoftBank Group as a whole to record a net loss of $7.2 billion.
Pulling back
A year ago, the declining private market led SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son to tell investors there will be stricter investing criteria moving forward and a more defensive posture.
This year, the Japan-based investment giant said it will play both offense and defense as it sees significant opportunities in the rise of generative AI.
While SoftBank may see some potential for investment, it has substantially cut back the cash it has deployed. In Q1 of fiscal year 2021, the segment made $15.6 billion in investments, but in the most recent quarter it only deployed $400 million in capital.
In fact, in the last three quarters it has only invested $1 billion total.
The Vision Fund unit has been battered in the past year as tech stocks in the public market sank, bringing down the valuation of many startups in the private market. In addition, geopolitical tensions, a banking crisis and crypto’s ups and downs have led to more uncertainty and roiling the private sector.
The FTX collapse alone led to SoftBank writing down its entire $97 million investment in the crypto exchange.
The total fair value of the Vision Fund portfolios was $138 billion as of March 31, according to SoftBank.

Even In The Best Times Most Startups Will Fail: Here’s How to Beat the Odds Today,Guest Author,2023/05/11,"

By David Kolodny
The last year has been frenetic and we will continue to see long-tail effects from recent events for some time. However, no matter the economic climate, most startups fail. For those that make it: What do they have in common, and how can first-time founders set themselves up for success now?

According to Wilbur Labs’ founder survey, which we conducted in December 2020, startups fail due to a lack of resources, inadequate planning and loss of focus. While the current environment may feel demotivating, the good news is that even though market conditions change, what makes for a successful startup does not. Here’s how to beat the odds.
Identify a real problem to solve
David Kolodny, co-founder of Wilbur Labs.
This is always the first step to building a great company. In a zero-interest rate world, money was cheap and some founders got away from solving real problems. The Wall Street Journal declared the “nice-to-have” economy is in decline as pandemic-level spending retreats. Solving real problems that customers will actually spend money on is critical.
At Wilbur Labs, we won’t start a company unless there is a clear road to customers voting for the product with their wallet or their time.
Don’t underestimate the power of planning
Continued volatility makes it hard to forecast what’s ahead. In our survey, 30% urged peers to do more research before launch. You have no control over the current environment, but you have full control over your ability to plan how you’ll reach product-market fit. Effectively front-loading planning requires talking to customers and experts, and painting a clear picture of all the workstreams needed to reach product-market fit. Then, working backward, outlining all the steps needed to get there.
Product-market fit varies by company but should always translate to acquiring revenue at healthy unit economics. Winning founders obsessively focus on reaching that milestone and say no to anything that distracts from that goal.
Bottom line over top line
Conditions over the past few years enabled companies to aim for growth at all costs. Over the long term, companies that survive are those that balance growth and profitability. Top-line results are great, but cash flow rules. Founders — especially in 2023 — should be building and compounding the bottom line.
Do this by first prioritizing for impact and not singularly optimizing for top-line metrics. Gross sales growth may help you achieve your goals, but is not the end goal. Second, don’t wait for a downturn to scrutinize expenses. Monthly reviews and bottoms-up budgeting will optimize results.
Fundraising is a means, not an end
Before thinking about funding, focus on building a financial model that maps to your plan for reaching product-market fit. While no forecast will be perfect, this exercise forces you to think through all the costs and revenue of the business in a constructive way. How can you know your best path forward, and what kind of funding is optimal for your company without that? Avoid the trap of over-dilution and letting fundraising be the end goal. Instead, focus on real business milestones and driving cash flow over time.
Evolving consumer demands and technologies are ushering in a new era of business dynamism — opening doors for startups that can outmaneuver incumbents. No matter the environment, there will always be space for innovation and for new leaders to emerge. Tune the noise out, build your roadmap, and tack into the headwinds of the unknown. If you do that successfully, you will set yourself up to be among the 10% that make it.

 David Kolodny is a co-founder at the startup studio Wilbur Labs. Prior to building Wilbur Labs, he was a product specialist on the customer solutions and innovations team at Google, a team that shapes advertising product roadmaps and designs go-to-market strategy.

US Investment In China Tech Scene Falls As Political Headwinds Strengthen,Chris Metinko,2023/05/11,"

The strained tensions between the U.S. and China has affected nearly everything between the two superpowers — and venture capital and the tech startup ecosystem is no exception.
Just last month, it was reported President Joe Biden will sign an executive order to limit investment in sectors such as semiconductors, artificial intelligence and quantum computing in China by U.S. investors.
The U.S. already has put a deeper restriction on exports of key American technologies to the country.

However, even before any order is signed, tech investors in the U.S. seemingly already have backed away from The Red Dragon.
This year is on pace for the lowest amount of dealmaking in China by U.S. investors in recent years, according to Crunchbase data. While 2019 and 2020 saw well over 300 investments in China-based startups by U.S.-based investors, that number jumped to 426 in 2021 — when the venture capital market was at a fever pitch.


However, as political headwinds grew stronger, that number dipped to only 283 investments last year. And through April of this year, U.S.-based investors were on pace to make fewer than 150 investments into China-based tech startups.
Investors do not see those numbers picking up any time soon.
Changing climate
An unnamed investor said a plethora of issues led to his firm putting the brakes on investing in China — including political strain, government action toward some Chinese tech companies, and questions around the ability for some China-based startups to list on the largest exchanges in the U.S.
In addition, there were some concerns from LPs in relation to environmental, social and governance sectors-, he added.
“There is uncertainty to begin with investing in this business, and this just added another level of uncertainty,” he said.
The largest U.S.-based investors in China have significantly slowed their investment pace in the region in recent years, according to Crunchbase.

Menlo Park, California-based GGV Capital has made the most deals in China since 2019 at 133,  but only two so far this year, after two dozen in 2022, per Crunchbase data.
Another Menlo Park firm, BlueRun Ventures — formerly Nokia VC — has made 71 investments since 2019, but only 19 last year and none so far this year.
San Francisco-based sports tech and online gaming-focused firm GL Ventures has made 62 deals in China since 2020, but only 11 in the past 16 months.
Similarly, Palo Alto, California-based GSR Ventures, which focuses on early-stage technology companies developing AI-enabled tech, has completed 60 deals in China since 2019, but only 13 in the past 16 months.
SOSV and OrbiMed both announced more than 40 deals each in the past four-plus years, but only one deal combined this calendar year.

The numbers do not include firms such as Sequoia Capital China, since it is its own legal entity — separate from Silicon Valley’s Sequoia Capital — and based in China. However, as reported by The Information earlier last month, Sequoia has a profit-sharing arrangement which allows its U.S. partners to benefit from its China-based counterpart’s investments.
Sequoia Capital China is a major investor in the tech scene in that country — having made more than 400 investments in China-based companies since 2019 and 19 so far this year.
Drop in funding
Even with those big totals from Sequoia Capital China and other China-based investors, the migration out of the most-populous country in the world by U.S.-based firms seems to have affected funding in the country.
Venture funding in China nearly doubled in 2021 — despite struggles with COVID still occurring in the country — hitting a record of more than $87 billion, according to Crunchbase.
However, last year those numbers fell nearly 47% to $46.3 billion.
In the first quarter of this year, venture dropped to $8.1 billion — its lowest total in years and  essentially a 38% drop both year to year and quarter to quarter.
No predicting
Whether or not that precipitous drop will continue is difficult to say, even for those who know the market extremely well.
Hurst Lin, general partner at DCM Ventures and head of its China office since 2006, said since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, U.S. investors have eyed the gigantic opportunities in the region.
However, around the time of COVID, investor perceptions of the region changed and political tensions have not helped the situation.
“I think there was a cooling-down period as the media (reporting) of China changed,” he said. “That led to a drying up of foreign capital. LPs started to change their perspective, and as an investor you need to be concerned about that.”
Lin acknowledged while Chinese regulations around tech companies and difficulties to go public on foreign exchanges likely affect investor sentiment, those issues have always existed.
Lin co-founded SinaNet, which eventually became the first Chinese internet company to successfully list on the Nasdaq. The listing was accomplished through a variable interest entity — which can still be done now although they are regulated by the government.
With the limited access to foreign exchanges, the Hong Kong Exchanges have tried to fill the gap, Lin said. Just recently, tech giant Alibaba Group said it was already moving along with plans for two other business units — Cainiao Network Technology and Freshippo — to have IPOs in Hong Kong.
However, the Hong Kong exchange has drawbacks. It is more known for retail investors and markets such as real estate and manufacturing, Lin said. There also is not the research analyst coverage that tech companies need to inform potential investors — a significant drawback for startups seeking a public listing.
“Will this turn around?” Lin asked, “I really don’t know.”
While U.S. investment in the China market is not at an all-time low, it is at low ebb for the robust investing cycle that has occurred in the past several years, Lin added.
“We’ll see how this plays out,” he added.

Microsoft Co-Founder Paul Allen’s Institute Backs AI With $30M Fund,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/05/10,"

The Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence announced on Wednesday a new $30 million fund to support AI-focused startups, GeekWire reported.
The Allen Institute was launched in 2014 by Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft. Since then, the organization has worked closely with artificial intelligence trends over the decade, onboarding over 100 researchers, engineers and business-minded folks to tackle projects related to AI.

Admittedly, $30 million is a rather humble amount of funding, especially considering how generative AI startups have managed to raise billions of dollars in the span of a couple years. But the Allen Institute plans on using it to back five to seven startups a year for four years. Startups are going to be in their pre-seed stage.
Four years ago, the Seattle-based Allen Institute launched its first AI2 Incubator fund to the tune of $10 million. Now, the fund is back, this time with $30 million backed by venture firms such as Sequoia Capital, Madrona Venture Group and Two Sigma Ventures.
Funding the AI buzz
Plenty of startups have begun to classify themselves as AI startups ever since ChatGPT entered the scene in November, latching on to the newest tech buzzword to enthrall venture firms. But the Allen Institute is laser-focused on very specific AI applications and startups that are built around AI, not the other way around.
Those applications include generative AI, similar to ChatGPT or Midjourney, which generate text or images based on a prompt. Companies in the marketing and creative industries have latched on to generative AI as a way to brainstorm ideas or generate prototypes.
But perhaps more interesting is the Allen Institute’s interest in Domain Specific Foundation Models — AIs that are trained on hyper-specific datasets for specific tasks.
In March, Nvidia announced its generative AI product that could help businesses customize their chatbots or text-to-image platform. This kind of technology could make way for generative AI specifically used to write legal briefs at a bankruptcy law firm, for instance, or codify doctors’ notes that use specific health care language.
As it is, AI-focused startups have raised more than $19 billion in 2023, per Crunchbase data, which means the sector is on pace to beat out 2022’s funding high of nearly $42 billion.

Investors Aren’t Putting The Brakes On Auto Safety Investment,Joanna Glasner,2023/05/10,"

We’ve been driving cars for over a century. But still, humanity hasn’t mastered the task of getting around town without causing undue death and injury.
Around 1.35 million people lose their lives on the world’s roads every year, per WHO estimates, and as many as 50 million suffer injuries. The organization calls it “an unacceptable price to pay for mobility.”
Startups concur. And while technology alone won’t save us from poor driving, founders are working on a range of innovations that could make a definitive difference in reducing the incidence and impact of accidents.
Investors are on board as well. Demand for enhanced automotive safety has driven a wave of funding in companies focused on the space in recent years. The sector is also producing exits, including Qualcomm’s acquisition this week of Autotalks, a maker of chips used in crash-prevention technology.

To get a sense of the scope of investment, we used Crunchbase data to curate a list of funded companies working on vehicle and road safety technology that have raised capital in the past couple years. The resultant list includes 11 companies, including Autotalks, that have collectively raised over $2 billion to date.


Large funding recipients
By far the most heavily funded startup in our sample set is Motive, a San Francisco-based provider of fleet management technology employing Internet of Things hardware and artificial intelligence. Its offerings include an AI dashcam that provides automated coaching to correct unsafe driving habits as well as tools to track compliance with safety regulations.
Ten-year-old Motive (formerly KeepTruckin) has raised over $567 million to date, per Crunchbase data. Its most recent financing, in May 2022, was a $150 million Series F led by Kleiner Perkins and Insight Partners.
Others are raising large sums with an eye toward improving safety in autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles. Prominent among these is TTTech, an Austrian company that develops hardware and software aimed at improving safety for autonomous mobility. Last year the company closed on a $274 million round backed by Audi, a longtime partner.
Most recently, Phantom Auto, a software company focused on safety for remote operation of logistics vehicles, raised a reported $25 million in April from corporate investor ConGlobal.
Not everyone’s into self-driving, but safety is an easy sell
The wave of safety-related investment coincides with the realization that commercialization of fully autonomous driving technology has not proceeded at the speed early boosters had hoped. While vehicles today have ever-more sensors and technology to detect risks on the road, humans are still overwhelmingly behind the wheel.
In contrast to fully autonomous autos, tech to improve safety of human-navigated vehicles seems to be a much easier sell.
Qualcomm, for one, seems to see enough profit potential to shell out a reported $350 million to $400 million for Autotalks. It pitched the purchase as a way to gain market share in so-called “vehicle-to-everything communication technologies,” which it says will “play an increasingly important role as they become critical sensors for automotive safety systems.”
Mobileye, known for its advanced driver assistance systems, as well as autonomous driving technologies, has also met a welcome reception on Wall Street. Shares are up since its Nasdaq debut in October, with the company recently sustaining a market cap around $33 billion.
Success here isn’t  just about profits
However, auto safety is one of those areas where startup success isn’t only measured in big exits and investment returns. The best outcome for all involved would be to see technologies contribute to meaningful reductions in roadway injuries and fatalities. I’ll take that over a massive IPO any day.

"Layoff Or Opportunity? Job Cut Leads Peter Henry To A New Future In Farming, Roasted Coffee",Chris Metinko,2023/05/10,"

This article is the second of our four-part series featuring workers displaced by the recent waves of tech layoffs who used the transition to found their own companies. In Part One we chatted with investors and founders and looked at data for early-stage startups. Part Three explores the role of startup accelerators, and we profile a former tech worker turned founder in Part Four. Today we meet entrepreneur Peter Henry, and we’ll be following Henry’s journey in future articles as he continues building his startup in Latin America. — Special Projects Editor Christine Kilpatrick
Growing up bouncing between southern Florida and Puerto Rico, Peter Henry knew one thing for certain — always have a Plan B.
Being raised by a single parent, money was tight. When disasters hit — such as hurricanes — hard times quickly became harder.
“I remember, I think, it was Hurricane George. It was devastating,” said Henry, remembering bathing outside in what little water was available. “We went through some rough times. But you can’t rely on others, you rely on you.”

Those experiences — and that mindset — helped prepare Henry for what came last fall. Like the hundreds of thousands of other employees in the tech industry, Henry was laid off from MetaMap where he was vice president of revenue.
Peter Henry founded fintech Agricompa in Latin America.
“It was tough, but it also was an opportunity,” said the 33-year-old Henry. “You can either cry about it or move on.”
Henry moved on to Agricompa, a fintech company that enables small and medium-sized farmers in Latin America to access loans and other services specifically for them.
While many may seek out the cold comfort of a new job with a well-established company after the trauma of a layoff, Henry — and many others like him — have instead used the tech job cuts as their chance to pursue their dreams.
“In a sense, it was a relief,” he said, “I could focus on what I wanted to do.”
Lessons from baseball
What Henry wanted to do was help Latin American farmers after seeing firsthand many of the issues they faced.
In 2013, Henry bummed around Venezuela playing baseball after taking time off from Stanford and that school’s baseball team.
“I hung out at farms,” Henry said. “I actually did my thesis on the informal economy in Venezuela.”
Even after graduating, Henry continued to hang around Latin America, first taking a baseball development job with Major League Baseball before moving on to a sales job in Puerto Rico for PayJoy — which offers credit to underserved consumers in emerging markets around the world — in 2015.
The job appealed to Henry and his personality for several reasons. First, sales stoked his competitive fire like baseball and sports did. He could prepare and plan for sales — just like he would practice and train in baseball.
“Winning a sales call is like winning an at-bat,” Henry recalled. “I also liked that it’s about tribulations, persistence and consistency. In baseball, you have to learn to accept failing. I couldn’t, I used to let the strikeouts get to me.
“Now, I don’t let that phase me,” he said
He also fell in love with the entrepreneurial and startup aspect of the business. Lastly, he liked the impact he thought the company could have.
“Bouncing between the U.S. and Latin America, I sometimes didn’t have the right paperwork or ID, so I could relate,” Henry said. “I liked the positive social impact.”
After 17 months there, Henry followed that entrepreneurial spirit he fell in love with and co-founded Miami-based online real estate company Home61 before moving on to fintech identity startup MetaMap.
There, Henry led the expansion for sales, product, marketing and customer success in all of LatAm, Brazil, Africa and Southeast Asia. He helped grow revenue from zero to $18 million ARR in 18 months.
Hard times
During his time at MetaMap the seeds for his future were planted — literally.
When the pandemic hit, Henry was living in Mexico City. Not enamored with the idea of isolating with the city’s other 9 million people, he and his wife Oris went to the Dominican Republic and bought a three-acre farm.
The idea of farming and being self-sufficient appealed to Henry, and the isolation of the pandemic seemed a perfect time to try it out.
However, that would not be the only life-changing moment about to happen for Henry.
In October of last year, Henry got the call that he and his team were being laid off. His job, with a $240,000 salary and $130,000 in bonuses, was gone.
While a layoff can be a traumatic milestone for many, Henry’s baseball career would not let him see it that way.
“In sports, you can always be waived or let go,” Henry said. “So I always have the feeling you can be let go at any time.”
His upbring also prepared him for such a moment. Growing up in a home where finances could sometimes be “mismanaged” taught Henry the importance of saving for a rainy day.
“I always had something saved, I always have a Plan B,” he said.
Growing up in the midst of the Global Economic Crisis in 2008, also likely affected his mentality toward money and savings, he added. 
“These crises affect how you deal with a lot of stuff,” he said.
Support from those close to him also did not hurt.
“My wife always has pushed me to do my own thing,” he added.
Fintech for farmers
A few days after getting the layoff notice, what would become Agricompa was founded with three of his former MetaMap partners — Pierre Antoine Rohr-Lacoste, Carlos Ruiz and Amaury Soviche.
Through talks with coffee roasters and cacao farmers in Mexico, Colombia and Africa, Henry knew small growers seemed to always suffer from cash-flow issues. 
One of the main issues is limited access to cash, Henry said. Many farmers in Latin America don’t have the paperwork or documentation for their farms, limiting the extent the property can be used as an asset.
There also is not immediate accessibility to a bank in many of these regions.
“In some of these rural areas, you can be two to three hours away from a bank,” he said.
There also can be hangups in the time it takes distributors and packing companies to actually pay small farmers.
Henry knew he could help fix some of these problems.
“I’m not a pro farmer, but I’m a pro at building teams and startups,” he said.
While the startup is still in beta-stealth, the concept is to offer an all-in-one agro management platform that allows packing and trade companies to manage cash flow and consolidate operations while being able to pay out farmers quickly with fast and hassle-free financing and ERP solutions.
Despite not being fully launched, 150 farmers are already on the platform. The company has eight employees and plans to operate first in the Dominican, Mexico and Colombia.
The startup also has raised $100,000 from Day One Ventures’ Funded, not Fired program that is supporting laid off tech workers’ dream of starting their own companies.
“Day One has been great,” he said “We do a weekly call with other founders in Day One’s portfolio. It has been really helpful.”
The company also has additional money from other angel investors and the like. Henry expects to start seeking out a proper Series A in the final quarter of the year.
Henry, who has always had a passion for farming and roasting coffee, has great expectations for what the company can become as he writes the next chapter of his story.
“We want to be the Shopify for agro,” Henry said.

E-Commerce Funding Startup 8fig Locks In $140M,Chris Metinko,2023/05/9,"

8fig, which typically offers financing to other companies, closed a big round of financing for itself Tuesday.

The Austin, Texas-based firm raised a $140 million Series B — which has been reported as $40 million in equity and $100 million in a credit facility. The round was led by Koch Disruptive Technologies. Others participating in the round included existing investors Battery Ventures, LocalGlobe, Hetz Ventures, the Jesselson family and Silicon Valley Bank, now a division of First Citizens Bank.
8fig — founded in 2020 in Israel —  has now raised $196.5 million to date, according to the company.
The company provides growth plans for small and medium-sized e-commerce businesses that have some sales history. The plan includes funding and financial tools for supply chain management, financial planning and freight and logistics coordination.
The aim of the platform is to keep e-commerce companies flush with inventory to stop growth from curtailing.
“During this period of economic uncertainty, ecommerce businesses are struggling to reach their full potential,” said co-founder and CEO Yaron Shapira in a blog. “The global macroeconomic challenges we are experiencing make it difficult for ecommerce business owners to access the resources they need to succeed. 8fig is providing these online sellers with the financial support and tools necessary to thrive in any economic climate.”
8fig has provided online sellers with more than $500 million since being founded, and increased its annual revenue by 800% last year.
Different financing
E-commerce companies need significant capital for operations, as inventory and supply chain expenses can eat into a startup’s cash flow and stunt its growth. 
Add to that a slowing venture capital market, and alternative financing models such as 8fig likely have become more appealing as cash has become more difficult to find.
While 8fig concentrates on the e-commerce sector, other startups like Miami-based Pipe and New York-based Capchase have entered the alternative finance market to offer startups access to cash that does not include venture funding.

ThredUp Joins Long-Term Stock Exchange For Dual-Listing,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/05/9,"

ThredUp, the online fashion resale platform that went public on the Nasdaq two years ago, announced on Tuesday it has dual-listed its stock on the Long-Term Stock Exchange.
The Long-Term Stock Exchange is a national securities exchange that was approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in May 2019. It’s not a well-known stock exchange — to date, ThredUp is only the third company to join and the second company currently listed.
It bills itself as a “principles-first” stock exchange that requires companies to publicly detail their long-term strategies for growth that include sustainability goals. Among them: Aligning board and executive compensation with long-term performance, making board members active participants in decision-making, and creating goals for the decade, not the next quarter.

Listing on the LTSE is no different from other stock exchanges. A company that is listed on the LTSE will report quarterly earnings, have a ticker symbol, and have an opening and closing stock price. Shareholders can trade their stock.
LTSE says its climate and sustainability-forward policies are more strict than current standards. While many companies pledge carbon neutrality as a decade-long goal, the LTSE requires listed companies to publicly disclose long-term climate goals and update them. Progressing toward the goal is a requirement of the listing and companies that don’t comply could be subject to being delisted.
“It is time for decisive action. Companies have punted too many promises to their stakeholders on the environment, social causes and who they are building for,” James Reinhart, founder and CEO of Oakland, California-based ThredUp, said in a statement. “By dual listing on LTSE, we are codifying the critical relationship between ThredUp and our long-term stakeholders and ensuring our success is their success.”
Market moves
Asana, the work management platform, dual-listed on the LTSE in 2021. Twilio, the cloud communication startup, went public on the LTSE and New York Stock Exchange at the same time, but voluntarily delisted on the platform at the end of 2022 due to cost concerns around maintaining a dual listing.
There are some benefits to offering a more long-term outlook. Quarter-over-quarter changes in revenue or gross profit are not indicative of a company’s health, but can provoke dramatic changes in stock value. We’ve written about how mass layoffs may have stemmed from appeasing shareholders ahead of earnings calls.
As it is, the public markets have been extremely volatile — companies were quick to ride the inflation high and go public, and valuations climbed into the trillions. But that all came crashing down in 2022. Wall Street saw its worst year since 2008, and companies either cut or indefinitely delayed their IPO plans.

The Biggest Startup IPOs Of The Past 10 Years Are All Below Their First-Day Price,Joanna Glasner,2023/05/9,"

Venture capital is a hits business. It’s OK if most of your companies flounder or fail, so long as a few go on to monstrous valuations.
The trouble is, success requires some home runs. And, if we take the long view over the past 10 years, those haven’t panned out as hoped on the public markets.
A Crunchbase analysis of the 20 largest public market debuts of venture-backed U.S. companies founded in the past 15 years reveals that only three are trading above their initial offering prices. And even those three — Airbnb, Pinterest and Snowflake — are still well below where their shares closed in first-day trading.

For a sense of how our sample set stacks up, we compiled the 20 largest offerings of venture-backed startups founded in the past 15 years that went public in the past 10 years. We then compared initial public valuations to current ones:


Biggest market cap losers
Altogether, valuations for the group are down 42% from when they went public. It’s a dramatic decline for a cohort that includes the most famous startup names dating back more than a decade.
Of course, some have fared worse than others. The title of most billions in market cap erased, for instance, goes to Rivian, the electric-car maker that carried out the largest IPO of 2021. The company has shed $54 billion in market cap since its debut, when it was briefly valued at more than GM and Ford combined.
In second place is Coinbase, which debuted on Nasdaq in April 2021 through a direct listing of shares. The crypto platform has shed over $41 billion in market cap since then, and is down 84% from its first-day closing price.
In terms of steepest percentage decline in share price, no one is close to matching Bright Health Group, the Minneapolis-based health care plan provider that carried out a 2021 IPO at an initial valuation just over $11 billion. Its shares have declined more than 99% since then, and the company has raised doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern.
And these are supposed to be the success stories
Everyone knows that not every hot startup that makes it to the public markets will remain a star. IPO boom times also tend to coincide with market peaks, so initial valuations can be lofty.
What’s concerning with our sample of the largest IPOs of the past 10 years, however, is the absence of any real star performers among the big names. None are even above their first-day prices, let alone returning a multiple to their IPO investors.
It’s even more worrisome when one looks at how much capital has been going into startup investment. Over the past 10 years, investors have plowed more than $1.4 trillion (!) into seed through late-stage and pre-IPO financings.
At the peak, in 2021, a whopping $329.5 billion went into North American startup investments across all stages, per Crunchbase data. That — to put it in context — is more than the total recent valuation of all 20 of the biggest IPOs in our sample set.
To make good on that level of investment, startup backers will need not just hits but grand slams. Their recent batting averages indicate that’s unlikely to happen.

Pink Slips to Pitch Decks: Laid-Off Tech Workers Roll The Dice In Iffy Funding Market To Start Their Own Companies,Christine Kilpatrick,2023/05/9,"

This is the first in a four-part series featuring workers displaced by the recent waves of tech layoffs who used the transition to found their own companies. Today we chat with investors and founders and look at the data for early-stage startups. Also read about laid-off tech workers founding fintech and legal tech startups, and the role of accelerators amid the layoffs. — Special Projects Editor Christine Kilpatrick
CoFoundersLab is serious about helping workers caught in the tech industry’s mass layoffs. 
The entrepreneur networking and skill-building site is offering free premium memberships to laid-off tech employees. “F’ Da Man,” the website says. “You’ve built it for them. Now build it for yourself!”
Close to 140,000 workers at U.S.-based tech companies have been laid off in mass job cuts so far in 2023, per Crunchbase’s Layoff Tracker. The industry continues to reel from falling valuations, rising interest rates, a shuddering economy and troubles in the banking sector. Many large tech companies are also contending with shifts in consumers’ online behavior post-pandemic and paring their bloated employee rolls from years of frenzied hiring.  

But some of those pink slips spell opportunities for wannabe entrepreneurs as well as the startup networks and investors eager to help them. Despite a challenging funding climate, many see potential in the high-quality talent being cut loose from major tech companies.
“We’ve got some amazing people who are incredibly sophisticated and have worked for a lot of big FAANGish companies,” said CoFoundersLab investor and chair Steve Lehman. “They’ve decided they built enough for billionaires and want to kind of do something on their own.”
Programs like CoFoundersLab’s free memberships benefit networks and investors as much as the recently laid-off workers, Lehman said. Founded in 2016, CoFoundersLab serves about 650,000 entrepreneurs looking for co-founders and partners as well as mentors, along with additional business training. 
“We didn’t look at this as a philanthropic gift,” Lehman said. “This was a win for the founders because they could immediately come in and engage without restrictions. It’s a win for us because we get super-bright people onto the platform.”
The immediacy is important, Lehman said. “Ideas are not as fundable as they used to be. Sure, I think investors, particularly in seed to series A, are looking for something a little more tangible where the wheels are already on the bus. It doesn’t have to necessarily be rolling down the highway yet, but it’s got to have good momentum with unique value propositions.”
Masha Bucher, founder and general partner of early-stage investment firm Day One Ventures, understands the risks and rewards for laid-off tech workers trying to found their own companies. Bucher started her first and second companies after being laid off from previous jobs. 
“I had this idea when I saw lots of great talent being laid off from companies like Stripe and Twitter. When I saw an experienced project manager leaving Twitter or Stripe, I rushed to check what was next for them,” Bucher said. “I figured that even if it’s 0.1% of all people who were laid off, these people could make it into great founders.”
In less than two weeks, Day One received more than 1,200 applications for its “Funded Not Fired” program, which offers to invest $100,000 into selected startup ideas. Half of the companies submitted were already established entities. The firm will also lead a $1 million seed round for the top companies in the program. 
In reviewing the applications, Bucher noticed some patterns among the laid-off: Some came from companies that had raised a Series B round and hired accordingly, but could not raise enough after that and had to start layoffs. Others had worked at companies that had hired great talent to build innovative things, but then decided to return to their core revenue streams and channels. And finally, there were recent university graduates who were hired, then laid off. 
With so much great talent in the laid-off ranks, Bucher saw no reason not to embrace this group. “Great entrepreneurs shouldn’t come from a particular background. It’s not defined by universities or business background, or nationality or gender. If they can make it now, they can make it in the future.”
Early-stage funding in the U.S.
Of course, making it these days will be tough enough. Entrepreneurs of all backgrounds and skill levels are facing a challenging funding environment. 
Venture and growth investors in private companies worldwide continued to scale back their investment pace in the first quarter of 2023, per Crunchbase data. Global funding in the first quarter reached $76 billion — marking a 53% decline year over year from $162 billion in the first quarter of 2022. Even at the earliest funding stages, investors are pulling back.
The story for early-stage U.S. startups is similar. Seed and angel investment to U.S. startups reached $3.1 billion in Q1 2023 — a 45% decline year over year from the quarterly peak of $5.6 billion in the first quarter of 2022. 




Running against the wind 
In such an uncertain environment, even well-known and well-connected entrepreneurs struggle to raise their first round. 
Dereck Tatman was the CEO of the now-defunct Global Genome Center, a startup aimed at establishing DNA sequencing centers in low- and middle-income countries. When the company’s expected government funding fell through, Tatman spent six months scrambling to modify the business plan and find traditional biotech investors to fill the gap. It didn’t work out.
“[Biotech] is just a very capital-intensive business, and when you’re talking about needing a couple more hundred million dollars just to make data start to come out, it scares most investors off,” Tatman said.
Indeed, startups in the biotech and medical space often operate on a different timeline than most sectors in tech. Not only do they need a physical lab or manufacturing space, they also take as long as a decade to weed through strict regulations from the Food and Drug Administration to get approval. The process is costly.
When Global Genome Center shut down in November 2021, Tatman and his co-founder Ron McCullough quickly created a new company: Intrigue Health, a stealth-mode medtech company incorporated the following March.
Intrigue Health is creating diagnostic testing products that can be used at home. It’s a rapidly growing space that saw favor during the COVID-19 pandemic, when new investors flooded the health care sector. 
Now the funding market feels more like 2018 and 2019, Tatman said. Given how expensive and slow-moving innovation in the biotech sector is, funding is often siloed to investors who have long been entrenched in this space. 
As 2023 continues, there are few signs of a reversal in the year’s steady trends of rising layoffs and falling VC investment numbers. When we asked Tatman when he was hoping to raise his first round, he laughed and said, “I would have hoped by now.”

Swiggy Investor Slashes Food Delivery Unicorn’s Valuation To $5.5B,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/05/8,"

Swiggy, one of India’s largest food delivery platforms, reportedly had its valuation cut in half by Invesco, one of its investors.
It’s the second time in a year that Swiggy’s valuation has been cut by the investor, TechCrunch reported, citing filings.
Swiggy was valued at $10.7 billion when it received its $700 million Series J funding round in January 2022, which Invesco led. In October of that year, Invesco marked Swiggy’s valuation in its portfolio down to $8.2 billion. It cut the value of its holding down further in January 2023, to $5.5 billion, TechCrunch reported. That marks an almost 49% decrease from Swiggy’s valuation during its last priced funding round.

Swiggy’s valuation trajectory mirrors that of another India-based food delivery platform: Zomato. When Zomato went public two years ago in July 2021, it boasted a $13 billion market cap. In May of the following year, its market cap had dipped to $5.3 billion.
Valuations are still shrinking
Swiggy’s valuation cut is another example of tech companies around the world returning to a new normal after the venture funding boom of 2021.
Companies that face investor write-downs are much more likely to be forced to take down rounds when the time comes to raise new money.
Swiggy won’t be the only one in this situation. Invenia, a cloud-based machine startup, late last year saw its internal valuation slashed 95% by investor Tribe Capital. Tiger Global marked down its portfolio investments by 33% in 2022. SoftBank Vision Fund, which was one of the more active investors in 2021, lost $7.2 billion in tech writedowns in 2022.
Elsewhere, valuations are taking a hit in a different way. Stripe’s valuation was as high as $95 billion back in March 2021. It was reportedly revalued at $74 billion in July 2022 following an internal valuation cut. The company lowered its valuation again to $63 billion in January. As of March, Stripe’s internal valuation is $50 billion — a stunning decline from its valuation during its 2021 funding round.
Buy now, pay later platform Klarna’s valuation plunged 85% from $45.6 billion to $6.7 billion in the span of one year as the company took in new funding during a significant down round.
Fast-fashion giant Shein reportedly cut its own valuation by more than 30% as it began looking at the IPO market. At one point, it was tied for the third most valuable private company in the world.
It’s been more than a year since the tech funding hype has died down, but plenty of startups are still grappling with the dramatic shift to their valuations.

Mayfield Raises Nearly $1B Across Two Funds,Chris Metinko,2023/05/8,"

Silicon Valley investing giant Mayfield1 has raised two funds totaling almost $1 billion targeted for early-stage investment.
The Menlo Park-based firm — known as an early backer of such startups as Lyft, Marketo and Poshmark — announced its $580 million Mayfield XVII and the $375 million Mayfield Select III funds.
The firm last announced new funds in March 2020, when it raised $750 million across two funds. The firm now has $3 billion in total assets under management.
 
The Mayfield XVII fund will primarily be used for early-stage investing — mainly seed and Series A rounds. The Mayfield Select III will be for follow-on rounds, as well as investments in new companies, primarily at the Series B stage.
Some themes the firm is looking to invest in include human-centered AI, the developer-first technologies, semiconductors, cybersecurity and more.
“We are grateful for the continued support of our limited partners and for the fortitude of entrepreneurs which brings us to work every day,” said Managing Partner Navin Chaddha in a statement. “We believe that the current economic uncertainty presents an opportunity for the bold and a time to lean forward into the next era of innovation. We are excited about partnering with inception and early-stage founders looking for a people-first investor to build a bright future together.”
Recent dealmaking
While some big-name firms such as Tiger Global, Insight Partners and many more significantly slowed their investment pace last year, Mayfield continued a deliberate and consistent cadence.
According to Crunchbase data, the firm completed 26 financing deals in the salad days of 2021, and 23 last year — when the venture and investing market was substantially easing.
So far this year, Mayfield’s pace has been a little slower, with just five deals announced. That includes a $51 million Series E for San Francisco-based database developer InfluxData.

Investors Rain Funding Down On Climate Prediction Startups,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/05/8,"

For Himanshu Gupta, monitoring and predicting the weather isn’t about convenience — it’s a matter of survival.
Gupta grew up in a small town in India, a place in delicate balance with the weather. When a hot summer delayed the monsoon season, Gupta and his sibling hauled water from a river in five-gallon buckets. Even mildly strong winds downed power lines. And when oppressive heat melted the family’s wax candles into puddles in the evening, it was time to stop studying.

“When you come out of that life you realize how much of that childhood you basically missed because you didn’t know what you were missing,” Gupta said, “and how much potential we could have unlocked for ourselves as kids.”
Gupta would go on to work in the planning department of India, where he noticed suicide among farmers happened en masse during periods of unpredictable drought or rain that destroyed crops and ruined farmers’ chances of repaying loans.
In 2017, he co-founded climate analytics platform ClimateAI with Max Evans, who came from a farming family in Ecuador.
Clearly, they had the right idea. Funding for weather and climate prediction startups soared from around $16.2 million in 2016 to $145.5 million in 2017, Crunchbase data shows. In 2021, that number skyrocketed to $541.6 million.
Climate change spreads to other sectors
As climate issues flood nearly every sector, climate and weather analytics startups are offering companies and consumers predictions about everything from the chances for inclement weather for that upcoming vacation to the long-term flood or fire risks of building new properties.
These data models are often more advanced than the weather forecasting services built into your phone — they use artificial intelligence along with a host of data points from satellites and radars to make real-time determinations. Housing developers use such climate analytics to determine where to build new developments. Retailers use it to forecast supply chain issues in apparel fabrics. And supply chain companies use climate de-risking platforms to improve speed and efficiency in global trade.


Apocalyptic weather the world over — from California droughts that caused wildfires so severe they drenched the state in smoke and turned the skies above San Francisco red to devastating floods in Pakistan that killed 15,000 people and displaced millions more — has made it abundantly clear: weather affects everything.
That means weather and climate intelligence startups — once confined to the agriculture, supply chain and energy industries — have expanded into nearly every sector, offering everything from analytics and prediction to climate de-risking.
And as the effects of climate change intensify, the volume of data produced and managed by these startups continues to grow. So do the stakes.
“Tomorrow there’s going to be every company on this planet Earth whose operations and supply chains will be impacted by climate change,” Gupta said. “And if they act on it, it will lead to not only increased profits for these companies, but also improved resilience for the communities they serve.”
More sectors get creative with climate tech
In 2016, some of the hottest weather-related startups were Big Terra, Nnergix and WaterView. Big Terra works with farmers worldwide to deliver climate analytics, while Nnergix caters largely to the renewable energy sector, and WaterView to city planning industries. These sectors often bear the brunt of climate difficulties. Changing water patterns or storms could mean shipping delays in building materials, or a season of crops suddenly dying.
Beginning in 2017, venture funding went to more climate-risk startups in insurance, property and travel. One Concern raised $22.6 million in Series A funding to help property developers understand climate-related risks to their buildings. Tomorrow.io raised nearly $20 million to help retail and sporting establishments use climate analytics to reduce energy expenses.
ClimateAI, which raised $22 million in April from Four Rivers Group, works with the agriculture, retail, defense and logistics sector to provide climate insights. That data can, for example, help manufacturing companies adjust shipping schedules to maximize efficiency during periods of good weather. It could also help wineries determine which areas will likely see more rainfall next season and plant crops accordingly.
And, despite facing difficult macroeconomic headwinds in 2022, weather intelligence startups saw their second-best funding year in a decade last year, netting $266.4 million in venture dollars, per Crunchbase data.
Climate ‘de-risking’ startups proliferate
Nick Cavanaugh grew up in Seattle, surrounded by snow-capped mountains and hiking trails. After getting his postdoc in climate science research and working at a hedge fund, he founded weather prediction platform Sensible Weather in 2019.
While many weather prediction platforms cater to supply chains, agriculture and defense, Sensible Weather, at the time, was one of the few climate de-risking products available for day-to-day consumers in the form of travel planning. Sensible Weather works with travel partners to provide travelers refunds if weather gets in the way of their skiing or camping trips.
“I wanted to get this idea of climate finance in front of people to say, ‘Hey, this is why it matters in your life.’ There’s still this disconnect between what climate change is and why it matters to me,” Cavanaugh said. “I can show you directly, like that vacation that you got rained out of last year.”
Jupiter Intelligence, a climate analytics platform, works with companies in the real estate industry to help them to plan for weather-related issues to homes or housing insurance plans. It can also provide those in the banking sector with insights on how climate change may impact portfolio assets.
“There’s going to be enormous unpredictability with extreme weather events, with droughts,” said Jason Pontin, an agtech-focused partner at venture investment firm DCVC. “AI-based systems can give much more predictive insight to what the likely risk ranges are.”
Climate tech: More than a weather forecast
The use cases for climate prediction technology are wide-reaching and easily scalable, which is why investors have poured money into it.
Many of the companies in the sector operate on a platform-as-a-service model with few product expenses, allowing the same climate data to be used for multiple purposes and sold to companies that are only now seeing the effects of climate change in their industries.
“Climate is changing and the world is changing,” Gupta said. “And there are people who are impacted who don’t even know they’re impacted by that.”

Most Active US Investors: Y Combinator Leads Big After Demo Day,Chris Metinko,2023/05/8,"

This is a monthly feature that runs down the most active investors in U.S.-based companies, looks at some of their most interesting investments, and includes some odds and ends of who spent what. Check out March’s feature here.
Investors continue to slow their pace at a dramatic rate.
In April 2022, 16 firms made at least 10 investments or more into U.S.-based startups — led by two firms: Y Combinator and Techstars, which combined for 56 deals.

Those two names also made last month’s top investors list, but only two other firms announced at least 10 deals as venture continues to slow.
Tiger Global, Goodwater Capital and SOSV, some of the leaders of April 2022’s top investor list are nowhere to be found now.
While that is not entirely shocking, it is important to note that by April 2022, the slowdown was well underway, but the market was much busier than it is now.
Let’s look at who did invest.
Y Combinator, 217 deals
The accelerator giant Y Combinator had its big Demo Day event last month and did not lack for investment opportunities. Y Combinator  received more than 20,000 applications for the event and ended up funding 282 startups globally (217 in the U.S.).
We did not go through the whole list of funded companies (undoubtedly there were some interesting ones) but the accelerator wrote an interesting blog breaking down the class.
According to the breakdown, the largest portion of the class — 54% — fell into the B2B/SaaS sector. The next two biggest industries represented by the class were DevOps at 17%, and fintech with 12%.
The most common “themes” of the class were open source, dev tools and — wait for it — AI, of course.
Second Century Ventures, 13 deals
A new entry on the list finished second this month: Second Century Ventures, the strategic investment arm of the National Association of Realtors.
The firm selected 14 new startups (13 in the U.S.) for its 2023 REACH and REACH Commercial accelerator programs.
The companies selected represent a diverse variety of tech across the real estate ecosystem in areas that include financial planning, property management, tenant retention and more. The companies in the class already have raised more than $100 million in funding.
The class includes the likes of San Francisco-based highnote, a drag-and-drop presentation platform to help agents pitch and sell, and New York-based Summer, which helps simplify the process of finding and buying vacation or investment homes.
​​Andreessen Horowitz, 12 deals
While many big-name firms have slowed down their investment cadence significantly,  Andreessen Horowitz makes this list regularly.
Last month, the investing giant led some huge rounds, including San Francisco-based satellite developer Astranis’ $200 million raise at a $1.6 billion valuation, per a Bloomberg report. It also led New York-based vector database startup Pinecone’s  $100 million Series B at a $750 million valuation.
However, on this list we like to look for the unexpected and Andreessen Horowitz delivered. The prolific investor has made its name in a multitude of sectors, from software to crypto — but what about mac n’ cheese.
The firm participated in a $1.1 million seed round for Mclean, Virginia-based 8 Myles, a brand-new food manufacturer that makes “clean comfort you deserve.” The startup says it “prioritizes clean ingredients and key nutrients without compromising on flavor,” and its meals have less sodium and fewer calories than its competitors.
The startup’s first offerings are all mac n’ cheese in three flavors: homestyle, buffalo and BBQ.
We typically prefer just the good-old classic.
Techstars, 11 deals
Techstars actually led all investors in April 2022 with 31 announced deals.
This past April, the firm made significantly fewer, but did have some interesting ones — including taking part in a $28.5 million Series A for a Lafayette, Colorado-based startup.
Orbit Fab supplies tankers and other infrastructure needed for in-space refueling of satellites — basically “gas stations in space,” just as its website says. Along with the actual hardware needed to refuel, the startup also has planning software and fuel delivery services.
With more than 5,000 satellites in Earth’s orbit now, how to refuel them is something that needs to be figured out as the space economy grows.
Also notable:

Gaingels and gener8tor Oklahoma City Investment Accelerator came in next on the list with eight deals each.
Not surprisingly, Y Combinator led all firms in rounds led or co-led — with 208 —  following its big Demo Day extravaganza. Second Century Ventures came in next with 13, followed by Gaingels and gener8tor Oklahoma City Investment Accelerator.
Andreessen Horowitz came in at the top of the list for rounds led or co-led with the highest dollar amounts for April, thanks to its big rounds for Astranis and Pinecone. The firm led or co-led five rounds in the month totalling $465 million.

"Run, Unicorns, Run: April’s VC Funding Landscape In 3 Charts",Christine Kilpatrick,2023/05/6,"

Here’s how to earn a unicorn valuation in 2023 in one easy step. Ready?
Step 1: Already be a unicorn that’s raised bales of VC cash.
That’s what it seems to take to raise a big round these days. Of the 10 biggest venture rounds in April, four of the top five were raised by established unicorn companies that’d already raked in hundreds of millions in the past few years (or in the case of OpenAI, tens of billions in the past few months). 
The continued success of established players might make it tougher for ambitious startups to catch up with the unicorn herd. Only five companies joined The Crunchbase Unicorn Board in April 2023 — the sixth month in a row for new unicorn companies to number in the single digits. To absolutely nobody’s surprise, three of the companies were in the AI sector.


And once startups do manage to join the herd, keeping up is hard to do. Two companies dropped from the unicorn board in April: AI home gym Tonal and security company Cybereason. Both raised an admirable $130 million and $100 million, respectively, but were soon outstripped. 
Still, it’s not always easy to be a unicorn either. Of the $21 billion in global venture funding raised this past month, $4.4 billion was invested in unicorn companies. This is a smaller percentage than previous months in 2023, when unicorns averaged a third of all funding. 


And that $21 billion raised in April looks less impressive compared to global venture funding a year ago. Global funding fell 56% in April from $47.8 billion in a year-over-year comparison. This is the second-lowest amount recorded in a single month since July 2022 when venture capital started to scale below $30 billion. 
The slowdown has impacted all funding stages. Seed was down more than 50% year over year, while early-stage funding dropped 48%. Late-stage funding was down the most at 62%. 


Regardless of the venture capital landscape, many investors love to chase the brightest flag: This year that’s clearly AI, while last year’s biggest darling before its crash was cryptocurrency, and 2021’s flag was, well, everything. 
The encouraging thing about AI, however, is the technology’s possible applications to nearly every sector. And for many startups, AI might just be the spur to help some of them catch the unicorn herd.

The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Mavenir And Runway Lead In Down Week,Chris Metinko,2023/05/5,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.

We are only only a few days into May, but things are slow. After a strong week of big rounds last week, only two raises came in at nine figures. Last week, a company had to raise at least $50 million to make the top 10, but not this one. One thing, however, that is similar to last — are a couple of pretty large biotech rounds.
1. (tied) Mavenir, $100M, network software: Mavenir is not having an issue raising cash in this down market. After raising $250 million last year, the network software provider locked up another large tranche of money, closing a $100 million round led by Siris. The Richardson, Texas-based company builds cloud-native software that allows enterprises and service providers to manage complex networks without relying on older telecom hardware such as routers and switches. This allows customers to scale operations more quickly on the cloud and without the expense of equipment. Aside from Siris — the company’s largest equity holder — the new round also included investment from “two highly strategic ecosystem partners,” according to Mavenir. Mavenir has been busy on the capital front in recent years. In 2022 the company raised $95 million in debt in the summer and then a big $155 million tranche led by Siris and Koch Strategic Platforms in October. Before those deals, in April 2021, Koch placed a huge bet on Mavenir, investing $500 million in the company.
1. (tied) Runway, $100M, AI: You may have heard generative AI is big right now. New York-based Runway became the latest startup in the sector to raise big — landing a $100 million round at a $1.5 billion valuation from a cloud service provider, according to Business Insider. The startup helped develop the AI image generator Stable Diffusion and launched its video-to-video generative AI app in April. The app lets users transform videos into different styles, such as claymation or watercolors. Founded in 2018, the company has raised nearly $200 million, per Crunchbase.
3. Convergent Therapeutics, $90M, biotech: Biotech was huge last week, and this week oncology startup Convergent Therapeutics continued that trend. The company, which is targeting prostate cancer, raised a $90 million Series A led by OrbiMed and RA Capital Management. The company is creating a pipeline of radiopharmaceuticals starting with a specific therapeutic dedicated to advanced prostate cancer. Convergent Therapeutics, which was spun out of a university lab at Cornell University in 2020, is also looking into other therapeutics to treat different types of cancers. Radiopharmaceuticals — which are injected into the body and stick to cancer cells — seem to have caught investors’ fancy. Abdera Therapeutics raised $142 million in Series A and B funding in April.
4. Initial Therapeutics, $75M, biotech: Biotech was not done for the week, however, as New York-based Initial Therapeutics closed a $75 million Series A from Apple Tree Partners — which launched the startup. The biotech firm develops new small molecule treatments focused on known targets that play key roles in cancer and other serious illnesses.
5. Simpplr, $70M, enterprise software: Company intranets can be handy — when done well — and clearly investors see the value. Employee experience platform Simpplr closed a $70 million Series D led by Sapphire Ventures. The Redwood City, California-based startup allows employees to create profiles, access the always valuable company handbook, and find other resources. Employers can use it to update policies, build social hubs and even deploy surveys. Such platforms have become more valuable as remote work has taken over and employees need a go-to source for company information from outside the office. Simpplr’s $70 million fundraising round is the third largest in this space so far. Rippling, a human resource management platform, raised $500 million in Series E funding back in March. Alera Group, an employee benefits management startup, raised $100 million back in April. Founded in 2014, this brings Simpplr’s total funding to $131 million.
6. Sourcepass, $65M, cybersecurity: New York-based IT services and cyber firm Sourcepass raised $65 million in funding led by Metropolitan Partners Group. Founded in 2021, Sourcepass has raised $135 million to date, per the company.
7. Redaptive, $50M, energy: Denver-based Redaptive added another $50 million to its Series E led by long-time investor Linse Capital. The new investment brings the round total to $250 million. Redaptive helps customers conserve energy and be more efficient, lowering costs and meeting goals to reduce their carbon footprints.
8. (tied) Duetti, $32M, music: New York-based music financing startup Duetti announced its launch and funding of $32 million, which included investment from the likes of Viola Ventures and Roc Nation. Founded in 2022, the company has now raised $39 million, per Crunchbase.
8. (tied) Impact Nano, $32M, manufacturing: Devens, Massachusetts-based Impact Nano, a chemical manufacturing startup, raised $32 million in successive rounds from Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Intel Capital and other investors. Founded in 2019, this is the company’s first funding announcement, according to Crunchbase data.
10. (tied) Uwill, $30M, mental health: Natick, Massachusetts-based Uwill, a mental health and wellness startup for college students, completed a $30 million Series A led by Education Growth Partners. Founded in 2020, the company has raised $38.5 million, per Crunchbase.
10. (tied) MayMaan Research, $30M, energy: Hollywood, Florida-based clean energy and power generation technology startup MayMaan Research raised a $30 million Series A from Wave Equity Partners. Founded in 2013, it is the company’s first outside funding, per Crunchbase.
Big global deals
There were not a lot of large U.S. rounds, and there also were not a lot outside the country. In fact, only one funding from outside the U.S. broke the top five global rounds.

Singapore-based fintech startup Advance Intelligence Group raised an $80 million private equity round.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of April 29 to May 5. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

"Analysis: Tech Layoffs Dropped Sharply In April, But That Doesn’t Mean Layoffs Are Over",Keerthi Vedantam,2023/05/5,"

After three months of sweeping layoffs, is the tech industry’s blaze of job cuts finally cooling?
Between January and March, largely U.S.-based tech companies managed to lay off more people than they did in the entirety of last year. There was a reprieve in April, as only around 6,330 employees were cut from the tech sector.

That’s a pretty dramatic 83% drop from March, and a low we haven’t seen since last December, when companies slashed around 4,000 workers.


Another count drops
It’s also worth noting only 34 companies announced layoffs this month, compared to 60 in March and 84 in February. Not only are fewer people leaving their tech jobs, fewer tech companies are actually making the move to cut employees.
That tracks, according to Healy Jones, an executive at the startup consulting firm Kruze Consulting. Fewer of his clients are laying off workers en masse in what was originally an effort to conserve cash and extend their runway. Some are simply opting to lay off one or two employees if they’re already not a good fit for the company.
“A handful of people are just not working out perfectly for them,” Jones said. “Let’s move on from them and extend the runway a little bit. So it’s almost like an excuse to lay people off.”
But I don’t think layoffs are tapering off any time soon. The Federal Reserve passed another interest rate hike on Wednesday, indicating both public and private markets will remain rather inactive for the foreseeable future. Most companies are still citing economic instability as the main reason for layoffs.
“If interest rates continue to increase, it’s going to make it very hard for companies to hire because they’re not going to be growing, they’re not going to be investing,” said Hakki Ozdenoren, an economist with workforce analytics company Revelio Labs.
Startups are not done with layoffs
And keep in mind our layoffs tracker has recorded only 651 companies that reported layoffs since we began tracking the numbers in 2022, which means there are still plenty of companies that raised money at high valuations in 2021 that have yet to act.
We may see another deluge of startups announce mass layoffs as they eat through their runway.
“We’ve already seen a lot of pain in the late-stage market, and those failures are going to be more spectacular because instead of it being a 15-person company, it’s going to be a 500-person company,” Jones said.
I’m keeping my eyes peeled for the seed- and early-stage companies. They’re small, and when they go under or announce layoffs those numbers aren’t as dramatic. But they haven’t raised as much money as the later-stage startups have, and I’m curious to see how they’re managing their runway.
We also wrote last week that the largest contributors to the deluge of tech layoffs — Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Salesforce 1, which have together laid off 42% of all tech workers between 2022 and 2023 YTD — have walked back only 8% of pandemic-era hiring.
How long can these companies last with bloated employee numbers? We’ll know more next month. Stay tuned.

J&J’s Consumer Spinoff Kenvue Closes Trading At 22% Above Asking Price,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/05/4,"

Johnson & Johnson’s consumer health spinoff, Kenvue, just solidified its place as the biggest U.S. IPO debut in over a year.
Kenvue’s shares traded at $26.90 each when the market closed on Thursday, a 22% jump from the company’s original asking price of $22, which was in the high end of the range. When it debuted, shares were trading at $25.60.
The company sold 172.8 million shares — an increase from the 151 million it planned on selling. Kenvue raised $3.8 billion from the offering and its valuation jumped from $48 billion at the start of trading to $50 billion when the market closed.
Back in 2021, Johnson & Johnson announced it would split its pharmaceutical brand from its consumer health division, marking one of the biggest changes to its 100-year history. Kenvue, the consumer health arm that owns a slew of household names like Tylenol, Band-Aid and Neutrogena, announced last week it would brave the icy public markets and go public. 

Johnson & Johnson is still a majority shareholder in Kenvue, representing a 90.9% stake in the company and owning 1.7 billion shares of common stock.
Sign of a bustling public market ahead?
Kenvue’s blockbuster debut may be a sign that the public markets are thawing. There was an unprecedented number of startups that went public in 2021, but the market chilled considerably in 2022. 
Last year, Getty Images raised $1.9 billion when it debuted back in July, while marketing platform System1 raised $518 million a few months earlier in January. They were part of a mere 91 startups that went public in 2022, per Crunchbase data. By comparison, over 400 startups debuted on the stock market in 2021 and 190 debuted in 2020.
In 2022, several companies scrapped or paused their IPO plans as the economic health of the U.S. became more uncertain, but it’s clear many are waiting for the right time to go public. Both fast-fashion retailer Shein and fintech platform Stripe are reportedly in talks to explore IPO options no later than 2024.  
Startups, after raising huge rounds at high valuations in 2021, are looking for ways to extend their runways. And the banking crisis that killed Silicon Valley Bank and rippled out is only causing more uncertainty for risky startups that don’t often meet banks’ loan requirements.

Alibaba Could Seek US Listing For Online Shopping Unit — Report,Chris Metinko,2023/05/4,"

Tech giant Alibaba Group is exploring a U.S. initial public offering for its international online shopping unit as part of its plan to split up the company into different business units, per Bloomberg.
The company is only in the early stages of the plan and the size of such an offering has not been determined, per the report. However, Alibaba already is in talks with banks to serve as underwriters and the offering could happen sometime next year.

The firm’s international online shopping unit includes brands such as Lazada and AliExpress.
Alibaba is already moving along with plans for two other business units — Cainiao Network Technology and Freshippo — to have IPOs in Hong Kong.
In March, Aliababa said it would break up the company into different business units to improve organizational efficiency and make each new business more agile.
U.S. listing
The possible choice for a U.S. listing is interesting on a couple fronts.
First, such a listing would allow the unit — named Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group — to access investors cautious of investing in China as global political tensions continue to ratchet up. China-based fashion startup Shein also has made noise about seeking a U.S. listing later this year.
It also is interesting timing, as the U.S. IPO market has been under a deep chill for more than a year now with little sign of any type of thaw.
While companies like Instacart, Navan (formerly TripActions) and Stripe have made overtures they would go public, none seem very close, and some investors do not expect the IPO pipeline to reopen until late next year.
However, on Thursday Johnson & Johnson-owned Kenvue went public with the largest IPO since electric-vehicle maker Rivian listed in late 2021.
On the same day, it also was reported that marketing software company Klaviyo — valued at $9.5 billion — had added two new board members as it looks at a potential IPO. The company already has hired bankers to work on the offering, per an earlier report.

Shopify Ships Its Logistics Business To Flexport As E-Commerce Loses Its Luster,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/05/4,"

With e-commerce giants Amazon and Walmart looming, and e-commerce activity dwindling, Shopify is strengthening its relationship with the logistics platform Flexport.
Shopify announced on Thursday it will sell its shipping and fulfillment department to Flexport, laying off 20% of its staff in the process.
The move would allow Flexport, which partners with Shopify, to advertise the last-mile delivery services Amazon is known for. Shopify’s e-commerce customers will have access to the full range of Flexport’s freight services that can ship internationally as well as domestic home delivery. 
The announcement is another example of how tech’s attempt to latch onto e-commerce during the pandemic was a huge swing and a miss.
The broken promises of e-commerce
During the pandemic, tech companies thought they could tap into a brand-new, long-lasting consumer behavior that was ripe for disruption. That hasn’t been the case.
Funding to logistics startups — from everything to delivery to freight — dipped dramatically in 2022. You could blame, in part, the economic downturn that hurt every corner of the private market, but 2022 saw about half the money the logistics sector garnered the year prior, in part due to changing consumer behaviors.


Shopify spent years cultivating its in-house logistics firm, which included the $2.1 billion acquisition of last-mile delivery startup Deliverr last year. At the time, it seemed like a smart move — the pandemic accelerated e-commerce and delivery needs as people warmed up to having their groceries and home goods delivered to their door. Like working from home, the tech industry thought that level of online shopping activity would stick, and quickly hired warehouse workers and customer service representatives, and built new fulfillment centers.
Well, it didn’t stick, and what followed was a slew of layoffs and mea culpas. During a call with around 11,000 workers Meta laid off back in November, Mark Zuckerberg said his investment in e-commerce didn’t play out the way he thought it would. Shopify, which previously laid off 1,000 employees (10% of its staff) in November, said layoffs were driven by consumers returning to in-person shopping. Amazon abandoned plans to open several new warehouses and laid off hundreds of warehouse employees in the process. Same goes for online furniture retailer Wayfair, which reportedly laid off around 2,600 people in the span of four months, according to the Crunchbase Layoffs Tracker. 
For what it’s worth, this is a big win for Flexport, which bills itself as a one-stop logistics platform for businesses to organize delivery across multiple in-person and online retailers — something Amazon hasn’t been able to promise. Yet.

"
Series D Hits Lowest Point In Years. What Does That Mean?,Joanna Glasner,2023/05/4,"

By the time a startup gets to Series D stage, backers are done asking questions about product-market fit and what inspires founders.
At this point, it’s all about scale. And while an IPO or acquisition might still be a few years away, executives better be able to present compelling options for big returns.
The lack of large exits lately, combined with falling tech valuations and slower startup investment, has made the case for funding a Series D round much harder in recent months. These factors have contributed to pushing U.S. investment at this stage to its lowest point in years.

How low? Using Crunchbase data, we charted out total Series D investment for the past eight quarters below. As you can see, deal-making is down sharply from its former peak.


Yes, but that’s a very high peak
Of course, things did reach stratospheric levels in the gravity-defying investment environment of 2021 and early 2022. At the peak in the fourth quarter of 2021, for instance, there were three D rounds of $1 billion or more alone. The median round at that stage was over $100 million.
Those are anomalous comps. So we can’t be too shocked to see we’ve come down since.
Nonetheless, the declines are dramatic. For the first quarter of this year, total Series D investment is down 92% from the peak and 86% from the year-ago period.
The shuttering of the IPO window looks like the most likely culprit in curtailing really big deals. Investors usually back a deal in the hundreds of millions or more only if they see a clear-cut path to exit that will return a tidy  multiple.
So far this year, we’ve seen just one Series D in the hundreds of millions — a $300 million financing for Wiz, a cloud security company headquartered in New York with significant operations in Israel.
Including Wiz, there have been just six Series D rounds this year of $100 million or more, which we list below:


Most active VCs of recent years aren’t leading Series Ds
Venture firms that used to do a lot of Series D aren’t cutting checks.
Per Crunchbase data, the investors who used to be most active in backing large, later-stage rounds have stopped leading Series D rounds.
Standouts in this category include Tiger Global Management and SoftBank Vision Fund. In 2021 and 2022, the two firms were Series D lead investors 43 times, per Crunchbase data. So far this year, neither has led a single round at this stage.
Andreessen Horowitz and Insight Partners —  two other firms that regularly top the most active investor lists — haven’t led a U.S. Series D round for more than a year. In 2021 and 2022, the two were lead backers in D rounds 22 times.
Series D is also way down from nonpeak years
One can’t dismiss the plunge in Series D investment as merely a decline from a very high peak. So far, 2023 is on track to turn in the lowest total investment at this stage in years.
For perspective, we chart out Series D from 2018 till this year below:


It boils down to one simple takeaway: If you are a Series C company that needs to raise fresh funding, the timing looks pretty bad.

Corporate VCs Take Bigger Role As Other Investors Pull Back,Joanna Glasner,2023/05/4,"

As overall startup investment declines, the share of funding done by corporate venture backers appears to be on the rise.

So far in 2023, several of the most active corporate investors are leading or co-leading a larger share of rounds compared to last year. They’re also leading a number of the year’s largest financings.


Per an analysis of Crunchbase data, roughly a quarter 1 of U.S. rounds of $100 million and up this year listed a corporate investor 2 as lead or co-lead backer. This includes the largest financing by a long shot: Microsoft’s $10 billion investment in OpenAI.
Several other jumbo-sized deals this year count Google or its venture firm, GV, as lead backer. This includes a $300 million Google investment into AI platform Anthropic, as well as GV-led Series B rounds for genetic medicine startups Aera Therapeutics and Chroma Medicine of $193 million and $135 million, respectively.
Corporate VCs leading more deals
GV is one of a few active corporate investors that are leading a larger portion of deals this year.
Per Crunchbase data, so far in 2023, GV has led nearly 60% of rounds it’s joined. That’s up from just over a quarter in 2022.
Salesforce Ventures 3, a voluminous check-writer for startups in enterprise software and related areas, has been taking a larger role in investments too. It led or co-led more than half of its deals this year, up from less than one-fifth in 2022, per Crunchbase data
And Intel Capital, traditionally one of the busiest dealmakers in corporate venture, is also increasingly taking the lead. So far this year, the software- and deeptech-focused investor has led over half of the rounds it’s backed, up from roughly a third last year.
Even heavy industry is investing big. One of the most prominent deals along these lines this year is a $120 million financing for low-carbon steelmaker Boston Metal led by industrial heavyweight ArcelorMittal.
Corporates are getting ‘pulled in’
There are a few likely contributing factors to corporate investors’ increasingly prominent role in startup funding.
One is that other venture investors, including many of the biggest growth-stage firms, have been scaling back. SoftBank Vision Fund and Tiger Global Management, two names that used to reliably top our most active investor lists, have carried out particularly dramatic pullbacks. More broadly, a majority of the most active seed and venture investors globally cut their deal-making pace in the first quarter of this year.
As other VCs slim down, corporate investors are apparently being asked to bulk up.
“It’s quite interesting, the degree to which they are more pulled in than they’ve experienced in the past,” said Andrew Binns, co-founder of Change Logic, a business consultancy that works with established companies on innovation strategy. Corporate investors with stakes in startups are seeing more requests to take a larger role in follow-on rounds or provide bridge financing, he said.
Of course, corporate investors don’t write huge checks or lead new rounds just because someone asked. They’re no more likely than anyone else to prop up high valuations for startups in sectors where competitors have already taken a haircut. A deal has to make strategic sense, financial sense, or, optimally, both.
However, corporate investors may have different time horizons or investment goals than most venture firms. GV, for instance, counts Alphabet as its sole limited partner and touts that it “operates on long time horizons and deals in decades — not rounds.” Microsoft’s OpenAI investment announcement, meanwhile, was chock full of strategic rationale for the deal, with plans to deploy its technology in supercomputing, developer tools and consumer-facing products.
Having an exceptionally long time horizon or a strategic reason to enter a deal makes the decision to extend financing to a startup a little more compelling in a time when the IPO market is stagnant, big M&A deals are down, and valuations are still under pressure.

"
This Startup Just Raised $90M To Fight Cancer,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/05/3,"

It seems like biotech investors have fallen in love with radiopharmaceuticals. 

Convergent Therapeutics, an oncology startup targeting prostate cancer, announced on Wednesday it raised $90 million in Series A funding. The round was led by OrbiMed and RA Capital Management, with additional participation from Invus. 
The company is creating a pipeline of radiopharmaceuticals starting with a specific therapeutic dedicated to advanced prostate cancer. Convergent Therapeutics, which was spun out of a university lab in Cornell University in 2020, is also looking into other therapeutics to treat different types of cancers.
“While considerable progress has been made in the search for effective treatments for prostate cancer, it continues to be the second leading cause of cancer death in men, representing a significant unmet need,” said Dr. Philip Kantoff, CEO at Convergent, in a statement. 
Radiation is getting an update
Radiation therapy was first used over a hundred years ago, and technology hasn’t advanced much since. By beaming waves of radiation over the body to kill cancer cells inside, the process kills healthy tissue that lives between the skin and the cancer cells buried under it. 
Scientists have looked for novel ways to kill hard-to-remove cancer cells without harming the surrounding tissue. CAR-T cell therapy startups, which engineer healthy cells to swim around in the body to find and kill cancerous ones, have raised over $7 billion in 2022 (per Crunchbase data). For a long time, it was billed as the most promising cancer treatment out there.
Now, it looks like radiation is making its way back through more sophisticated methods. Radiopharmaceuticals, which are injected into the body and stick to cancer cells, are having their day in the spotlight. Abdera Therapeutics, which raised $142 million in Series A and B funding in April, developed a drug platform that can develop radiopharmaceuticals to tackle a wide range of cancers. Fusion Pharmaceuticals, a publicly traded pharma company, announced last year it would open a new radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facility.

Redaptive Adds To Series E — Hits $250M,Chris Metinko,2023/05/3,"

Denver-based Redaptive added another $50 million to its Series E. Led by long-time investor Linse Capital, the new investment brings the round total to $250 million
The energy efficiency startup announced in December it had raised $200 million from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and others after scrapping plans to go public.

Redaptive helps customers conserve energy and be more efficient, lowering costs and meeting goals to reduce the carbon footprint. Its “energy-as-a-service platform” allows companies to see their energy usage and can make recommendations on improvements.
The firm also can help clients install energy efficiency and sustainability equipment by funding the upfront costs — making such a move much more palatable to businesses trying to conserve.
“This additional contribution further accelerates our ability to bring our solutions to more customers making it possible for them to reduce their carbon footprints and achieve their sustainability goals,” said CEO Arvin Vohra in a release.
The round also included an unnamed strategic investor and did not change the company’s valuation — which was pegged at $1 billion in December — according to an Axios report.
Big money for lower energy bills
Anyone who has opened up their power bill in recent months knows that energy prices are soaring. Add to that the many local, national and company mandates to lower carbon footprints, and investors seem to see a future in energy efficiency.
U.S.-based, VC-backed energy efficiency startups actually saw more money last year than they did even in the free-flowing days of 2021, per Crunchbase data.
Startups in the space saw nearly $900 million invested in them in 66 deals — led by Redaptive’s $200 million in December, per Crunchbase. That beat out the $743 million that such startups saw in 60 deals in 2021.
However, this year has witnessed a significant slowdown, with only $139 million coming to such startups.

"
How Low Can It Go? Health Care Leads With Nearly $5.7B Invested In Bummer Month For Global Venture Funding,Gené Teare,2023/05/3,"

Venture investors continued to scale back in April 2023. 
Global funding reached $21 billion, down 56% from $47.8 billion in a year-over-year comparison. This is the second-lowest amount recorded in a single month since July 2022 when venture capital started to scale below $30 billion. 
The slowdown has impacted all funding stages. Seed was down more than 50% year over year, while early-stage funding dropped 48%. Late-stage funding was down the most at 62%. 
Month-over-month funding amounts were also down, in large part due to an increase in late-stage funding in March 2023 with Stripe‘s $6.5 billion funding.


Health care leads
Health care was the sector that raised the largest amounts with close to $5.7 billion invested. Companies that raised large rounds at the early stages include RNA-based medicine provider Orbital Therapeutics, medical robotics company Noah Medical and drugs from plants developer Enveda Biosciences. 
Companies active in AI raised around $2.8 billion, close to 13% of funding this past month. They include OpenAI, which raised a further $300 million. CoreWeave raised $221 million, Pinecone and AlphaSense each raised $100 million, and Replit raised $97 million. 
Financial services companies raised just over $2.7 billion, down from $7.7 billion raised in the same month a year ago. Companies that raised large rounds at Series A and B include capital markets infrastructure provider Clear Street, mobile payments TerraPay and LatAm B2B expense tracking Clara. 
Funding to unicorns tails off
Meanwhile,  new unicorns total in the single digits, compared to 40 new unicorns in April 2022. 
Of the $21 billion raised this past month, $4.4 billion was invested in unicorn companies. This is a smaller percentage than previous months in 2023, when unicorns averaged a third of all funding. 
Unicorn fundings include BYJU’S, a leading edtech company in India that raised $700 million at a flat valuation of $22 billion led by sovereign wealth funds and private equity firms. The company laid off 2,500 employees.
And medical supply drone delivery company Zipline raised $330 million at an increased valuation of  $4.8 billion, according to Forbes, up from its 2021 funding which valued the company at $2.8 billion.  


Since the latter half of 2022, deal sizes have come down from seed through Series C fundings. The interest in AI is driving larger funding rounds, but not enough to lift the funding slowdown. 
Methodology
The data contained in this report comes directly from Crunchbase, and is based on reported data. Data reported is as of May 2, 2023.
Note that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarter/year.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.
Glossary of funding terms
We have made a change to how we include corporate funding rounds in our reporting as of January 2023. Corporate rounds are only included if a company has raised an equity funding at seed through a venture series funding round. 
Seed and angel consists of seed, pre-seed and angel rounds. Crunchbase also includes venture rounds of unknown series, equity crowdfunding and convertible notes at $3 million (USD or as-converted USD equivalent) or less.
Early-stage consists of Series A and Series B rounds, as well as other round types. Crunchbase includes venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $3 million, and those less than or equal to $15 million.
Late-stage consists of Series C, Series D, Series E and later-lettered venture rounds following the “Series [Letter]” naming convention. Also included are venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $15 million.
Technology growth is a private-equity round raised by a company that has previously raised a “venture” round. (So basically, any round from the previously defined stages.)

Cybersecurity Still Finding Its Place In New AI Era,Chris Metinko,2023/05/3,"

It is difficult nowadays to talk to investors in any tech sector without AI coming up in the conversation — and that is certainly true in cybersecurity.
At the recent RSA Conference in San Francisco, talk of AI and its uses in new applications and security functions abounded as the typically robust cybersecurity sector has seen signs slowing.

Funding in the sector is down, as is M&A dealmaking. However, that decline could be helped out by AI and its uses in security — just as many bad actors are starting to use it to evade cyber defenses.
“We are talking with a lot of people, looking at a lot of different innovations,” said Alberto Yépez, co-founder and managing director at Forgepoint Capital, which specializes in cybersecurity and infrastructure software investments.
However, many stress it is still early days for AI. That goes double for both cyber companies using AI and startups looking to secure aspects of generative AI.
A quick search of Crunchbase data shows that cybersecurity AI does not show rapid growth. (In this search we included companies tagged as both being in a category of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.)
The area saw its highest level of investment in 2021 — not surprisingly — when 130 funding deals were announced and $2.3 billion invested. Last year, those numbers dropped to just barely more than 100 deals and $1.2 billion.


This year to-date, just under $700 million has been dolled out in 29 deals — with the majority of that going to AI and quantum computing startup SandboxAQ in its massive $500 million round.
Looking ahead
At the foundation of AI is automation — which has been around for years in cybersecurity. Most notably, automation has been used in security operations centers — often referred to as SOCs — as a way to help organizations large and small struggling to hire enough cyber talent.
While that automation has helped, it is governed by rules and guardrails that still rely on humans to enter the needed information and data. That can leave these centers static and stagnant.
AI obviously could change that. With artificial intelligence being able to learn from large language models, it could institute new rules that can help a security operation run more efficiently, according to those in the sector. Of course, that also will depend on whether companies feel they can trust their security to AI.
However, investors point out that cyber often prides itself on being an early adopter of new technology — as it was with several forms of automation — and AI can offer things not even a cybersecurity professional can as it pertains to performance.
“The move from human- to rule-based security was driven by cost,” said Leo Casusol, a managing director at Forgepoint. “With AI, it will be driven by speed and accuracy.”
Alex Doll, founder and managing partner at Ten Eleven Ventures, a multistage global venture capital firm dedicated to cyber, said AI could play a role in SOC and security analytics. It also could help overworked security professionals filter out the signal from the noise.
Cyber startup Kasada — a Ten Eleven portfolio company — recently estimated 90% of traffic on the web is nonhuman, but rather bots and other digital interference. Such a high percentage can pose more risk and create an environment where there is a lack of vision for real threats.
“There’s so much happening on the web,” Doll said. “And most of it is noise.”
Fact-checking
Double-checking accuracy could also be another area where cybersecurity steps in.
One role that is obvious for cybersecurity to play concerning AI is to make sure the data it is using is not corrupted, said Roger Thornton, co-founder and general partner at Ballistic Ventures, a firm dedicated to cybersecurity.
Early last month, New York-based startup Cranium raised a seed round from KPMG and SYN Ventures. The company helps enterprises monitor, and manage their AI/ML environments, which includes watching for contaminated data that an AI could be trained on.
Cybersecurity has always had a role in protecting data, and it could serve the same function in the development of AI applications, ensuring the safety of LLMs even as bad actors already have tried to infiltrate such models.
Prove it out
The one aspect that likely will hold back an avalanche of investment for cyber roles in AI is AI itself.
While the tech holds all the promise, companies are struggling with how and when to use it, and legal and ethical questions swirl daily.
“Before cyber finds the right first in the growing AI economy, artificial intelligence in general will need to show clearly how it is making businesses grow faster and make employees more productive,” Thornton said.
While startups like TrojAI, Calypso AI and Gretel all seem to offer businesses to evolve — the true benefit of such platforms is still unrealized.
“We just don’t know yet,” Thornton said.
Methodology
Cybersecurity is defined by the industries of network security, cloud security, identity and cybersecurity, according to Crunchbase data.

Simpplr Raises $70M To Update Your Company’s Boring Intranet,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/05/2,"

Do you even use your company’s intranet?
Simpplr, an employee experience platform powered by (you guessed it) AI, announced on Tuesday it raised $70 million in Series D funding. It really wants you to use theirs.
The recent round was led by Sapphire Ventures with participation from existing venture investor Norwest Venture Partners and newcomers Salesforce Ventures and Tola Capital. This brings total funding to $131 million.

We shouldn’t be surprised that an intranet platform has been gaining steam. The appetite for platforms like Simpplr has remained resilient during the pandemic. In 2022, startups in the space raised over $2.4 billion, just $500 million less than it did the previous year when funding in tech was plentiful. You rarely see that kind of consistency in venture dollars between 2021 and 2022.


Keeping remote workers connected
Simpplr operates as a company intranet where employees can create profiles, access the employee handbook and find company resources. Employers can use it to update their travel expense policy, build social hubs for specific teams or deploy surveys. 
The company uses its platform, which looks like a more aesthetic intranet met with the social collaboration of LinkedIn, to develop a constant stream of AI-powered insights that “reads between the lines of employee responses,” according to the website. Through user habits and company sentiment surveys, the platform helps employers understand if employees are paying attention to new updates and how they feel about them.
This, perhaps, is a necessary tool for employers in a remote work environment. With employees scattered across the country (or sometimes the globe), companies are looking for ways to engage workers in order to retain them and keep them productive. 
“The employee experience continues to be a major focus for employees and employers alike,” Jai Das, a partner at Sapphire Ventures and Simpplr board member, said in a statement. “A key pillar of a positive employee experience is engagement.”
Simpplr’s $70 million fundraising round is the third largest in this space so far. Rippling, a human resource management platform, raised $500 million in Series E funding back in March. Alera Group, an employee benefits management startup, raised $100 million back in April.

Network Software Maker Mavenir Raises $100M To Add More AI Capabilities,Chris Metinko,2023/05/2,"

After raising $250 million last year, network software provider Mavenir locked up another large tranche of money, closing a $100 million round led by Siris.

The Richardson, Texas-based company builds cloud-native software that allows enterprises and service providers to manage complex networks without relying on older telecom hardware  like routers and switches. This allows customers to scale operations more quickly on the cloud and without the expense of equipment.
Mavenir expects to use the new capital for — what else? — adding AI tools. It also plans to increase automation abilities and grow its customer base. The company already works with more than 250 service providers in over 120 countries.
“This new capital will allow us to accelerate our capabilities in automation, sustainability, and use of AI as we enable our customers to efficiently deploy and operate Open RAN based end-to-end cloud-native networks,” said president and CEO Pardeep Kohli in a release.
Big money
Aside from Siris — the company’s largest equity holder — the new round also included investment from “two highly strategic ecosystem partners,” according to Mavenir.
Mavenir has been busy on the capital front in recent years. In 2022 the company raised $95 million in debt in the summer and then a big $155 million tranche led by Siris and Koch Strategic Platforms in October.
Before those deals, in April of 2021, Koch placed a huge bet on Mavenir, investing $500 million in the company.
Mavenir has used some of its cash to be acquisitive in the past, making a total of eight deals since 2011, per Crunchbase data. However, it has only made two deals since 2020, buying Austin, Texas-based open-source communications platform Telestax in 2021 and U.K.-based cell solution developer ip.access in 2020.

"New Unicorns Led By AI Companies In April, And Two Dropped Off",Gené Teare,2023/05/2,"

Five companies joined The Crunchbase Unicorn Board in April 2023 — the sixth month in a row for new unicorns to number in the single digits. Three of those companies are in the AI sector. 
Of the five companies, three are U.S.-based. The U.K. and China each count for one new unicorn this past month. 


 
Dropped 
Two companies were dropped from the unicorn board. 
Tonal raised $130 million in funding at a valuation between $550 million and $600 million according to the WSJ, which removed it from the unicorn board. The company previously raised funding at a $1.6 billion value in March 2021. 
And Cybereason, an endpoint security company, raised $100 million led by SoftBank which valued the company at $350 million, a 90% discount from its prior funding in July 2021 which valued the company at $3.2 billion. 
Earlier this year, online media company Vox Media received a lowered valuation in February 2023 at $500 million, down from $1 billion. In December 2022, online grocery retailer Oda was removed from the board with a new valuation of $350 million, down from $1.2 billion. 
As unicorn companies continue to raise funding, we expect more down rounds and for companies to drop off the list. 
We find around half of the unicorn board has raised funding since the beginning of 2022. Around 40% of the 1,400+ unicorn board companies last raised funding in 2020 and 2021. These companies will be coming back to raise funding from the private markets as startups typically raise funding every 18 months to two years. 
Here are the new unicorns:
AI

New Jersey-based CoreWeave, a cloud infrastructure company that pivoted from Ethereum mining, raised a $221 million Series B led by Magnetar Capital. The funding valued the company at $2.2 billion.
Quantexa, a London-based data analytics company that uses AI, raised a $129 million Series E funding. The funding was led by Singapore-based Sovereign Wealth Fund GIC which valued the company at $1.8 billion.
San Francisco-based Replit, a developer platform that uses AI to complete code, raised a $97 million Series B funding led by Andreessen Horowitz. The company was valued at $1.2 billion. 

Energy

Nevada-based Ohmium, a hydrogen producer of green energy, raised a $250 million  Series C funding which valued the company at $1 billion, led by TPG Rise Climate Fund.

Semiconductor

B&C Chemical , a materials chip maker based in China, raised an $87 million funding valuing the company at $1 billion. The funding was led by China Development Bank Capital and Zhongping Capital.

Israel’s Democracy Hangs In The Balance,Guest Author,2023/05/2,"

By Gil Mandelzis
My native Israel recently celebrated 75 years of independence. Yet, in recent months, its budding democracy has been under siege from within. A proposed overhaul to the judicial system by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his administration would diminish, if not eliminate, the checks and balances within the country and pose meaningful risk to Israel’s future.

The proposed “reform” would allow a simple majority of parliament to veto any Supreme Court ruling (past or present); eliminate the reasonableness standard that gives courts the option to invalidate political appointments of people deemed unfit; give the governing coalition on the Judicial Appointments Committee a majority, enabling them to appoint the head of the Supreme Court and other judges; and weaken the status of government ministry legal advisers regardless of party affiliation.
Gil Mandelzis, founder and CEO of Capitolis.
Put plainly: In a country with no constitution, the ruling coalition will be able to do pretty much whatever it wants. For instance, appointing as minister a twice-convicted felon whose appointment was overruled by the Supreme Court. Sound crazy?
This is one of the things they’re trying to achieve. It’s a full-out assault on the foundation of Israel’s democracy, and let’s be very clear — this is not about left or right — it is about the very foundation and structure within which left and right can operate. Or not.
Effects on tech startups
The ramifications could be dramatic. The proposed reform could be a real blow to the “startup nation,” specifically the technology sector, which accounts for 15% of the country’s gross domestic product and more than half of its exports, according to the Israel Innovation Authority. This latest wave of unrest may leave business leaders across the globe rethinking their Israeli presence, uncertain of the nation’s future. Moody’s even recently downgraded Israel’s outlook.
In defense of our hard-won Israeli democracy, millions of protestors — left and right voters — have taken to the streets. There have been nationwide work stoppages. The tech sector has been very vocal in leading and participating in the pushback. Will it be enough?
The protests gained some traction: a temporary reprieve with dialogue taking place under the umbrella of Israel’s president. Is this a meaningful hiatus or misdirection? As such, a dark cloud remains.
If the administration follows the worst-case scenario, the fabric of Israel’s democracy will be left in tatters.
I am the founder and CEO of Capitolis, with offices in Tel Aviv and Israeli investors. For the past 25 years I have started and run fintech companies, always with a strong Israeli presence and hundreds of employees. I proudly brought investors and investments to Israel. I believe passionately in Israel’s amazing achievements, all now under severe threat.
So here we stand — on the precipice. International pressure continues to be ratcheted up; protests carry on; I am inspired and in awe of the people’s strength. The passionate civil participation demonstrates the beautiful power of the people and democracy. This gives me hope that we’ll land on the right side of history, and Israel will fend off this attack from within.
 
Gil Mandelzis is a serial entrepreneur and CEO in financial technology with a successful record of creating disruptive products and companies and leading them through global scaling. Currently, he is the Founder and CEO of Capitolis, a revolutionary fintech transforming capital markets.

This is a monthly feature that runs down the month’s top 10 funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last month’s top rounds here.
All through last month, U.S.-based startups saw some big rounds, but the largest two came in at the last minute. Both Zipline’s and OpenAI’s rounds broke on the last business day of the month — totaling $630 million in investment. Not bad for one day. Here’s a closer look at the 10 largest funding rounds to U.S.-based startups in April.

1. Zipline, $330M, drones: Drone delivery startup Zipline raised $330 million in a new funding round, according to Forbes. The new funding pushes the South San Francisco-based startup’s valuation to about $4.2 billion — up 55% from its $2.7 billion valuation two years ago. No lead investor was named, but past investors include big names like Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. Founded in 2011, the company has now raised more than $820 million, per Crunchbase data.
2. OpenAI, $300M, artificial intelligence: OpenAI helped kick off the crazy year for AI when it was reported Microsoft had made a massive $10 billion investment into the ChatGPT creator. However, the San Francisco-based AI firm was not done raising cash. Back in January it was reported that the startup was undertaking an offering that could value it at $29 billion. Just on Friday, the other shoe dropped when TechCrunch reported a group of VC firms — including Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz — have invested more than $300 million at a valuation of $27 billion to $29 billion into the AI innovator. The company has now raised more than $11 billion, per Crunchbase.
3. EquipmentShare, $290M, construction: Construction tech has not been high on the list of investors for several years after the collapse of Katerra. However, that did not stop Columbia, Missouri-based EquipmentShare, which raised a $290 million funding round led by funds afﬁliated with BDT Capital Partners. The equipment and digital solutions provider serves the construction industry, providing companies a real-time view of job sites and operations, as well as arsenal equipment. EquipmentShare now has more than 150 locations, including additional rental, retail and service locations. Founded in 2014, EquipmentShare has raised nearly $700 million in total equity, per the company.
4. (tied) Orbital Therapeutics, $270M, biotech: Biotech saw some big rounds last month, and none were bigger than Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Orbital Therapeutics’ raise. The startup closed a $270 million Series A led by Arch Venture Partners. Orbital is looking to expand RNA-based medicines including next-generation vaccines, immunomodulation and protein replacement across a variety of diseases. Founded last year, this is the company’s first outside raise, per Crunchbase.
4. (tied) Clear Street, $270M, fintech: Fintech startup Clear Street closed a $270 million investment from Prysm Capital which values it at $2 billion. The raise comes less than a year after the firm raised $165 million at a $1.7 billion valuation. The independent prime broker is building a “modern infrastructure for capital markets.” Its first product is an equity finance platform — processing more than $10 billion in trades every day. Clear Street’s aim is to create a single-source platform to serve all investors, across all asset classes. Founded in 2018, Clear Street has raised more than $600 million, per Crunchbase.
6. Ohmium International, $250M, energy: Green hydrogen is definitely a thing with investors. Green hydrogen firm Ohmium International raised a fresh $250 million in a Series C led by TPG Rise Climate. Ohmium designs and manufactures proton exchange membrane electrolyzer systems, which are needed in the production of hydrogen. The device is used to split water through electrolysis to create hydrogen. The company’s electrolyzer is powered by renewable energy, therefore producing “green hydrogen” with no greenhouse emissions. Ohmium most recently raised a $45 million Series B in April 2022 led by the Fenice Investment Group.
7. CoreWeave, $221M, cloud: Workloads continue to become more specialized and intense, and with that the cloud infrastructure they use needs to keep pace. New Jersey-based CoreWeave has locked up a new $221 million investment to do just that. The specialized cloud provider — which actually started out as an Ethereum mining operation — plans to use the cash to meet the needs of generative AI applications that are now appearing. Flexible cloud infrastructure with better processing will be needed to train large language models for AI, something CoreWeave is looking to provide. With its focus on the AI sector, it may be unsurprising one of the investors in this round was Nvidia, which is leading the charge in designing better AI chips. The round was led by Magnetar Capital, an alternative asset manager. CoreWeave has raised nearly $377 million to date, per Crunchbase.
8. HeartFlow, $215M, health care: The intersection of AI for health diagnostics found a spot on the list this month. Mountain View, California-based heart precision care technology startup HeartFlow raised a $215 million Series F led by Bain Capital Life Sciences. Its noninvasive technology provides a 3D model to analyze the risk of a heart attack. The technology has been used so far by 180,000 patients across 725 hospital systems globally. Founded in 2010, HeartFlow has raised about $793 million, according to Crunchbase data. 
9. Astranis, $200M, space: Even as venture continues to slow, VCs keep looking to the stars. San Francisco-based satellite developer Astranis locked up a fresh $200 million at a $1.6 billion valuation, per a Bloomberg report. The new deal was led by Andreessen Horowitz and comes just before the company prepares its first launch of satellites aboard the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Venture dollars have continued to pour into spacetech, even though overall VC investment continues to trend down. Founded in 2015, the company has now raised more than $553 million, per Crunchbase data.
10. Torl BioTherapeutics, $158M, biotech: It seems like new cancer treatments are always able to secure new funding. Los Angeles-based biopharmaceutical company Torl BioTherapeutics closed a $158 million Series B as it looks to develop new biologics for cancer treatment. The round was led by Goldman Sachs Asset Management. The startup — which had not previously announced funding, per Crunchbase — will use the new cash in the development of novel, antibody-based therapeutics to fight cancer.
Big global deals
Several of the biggest deals last month happened overseas.

India-based BYJU’S, an edtech startup, raised a $700 million private equity round.
Seoul-based autonomous mobility firm 42dot raised a corporate round worth approximately $787 million.
Singapore-based online shopping site Lazada Group received $353 million from its parent firm Alibaba, according to reports.
China-based SJ Semi, a foundry that implements front-end wafer manufacturing, closed a $340 million Series C.
China-based pharmaceutical company Hasten Biomedical completed a $315 million venture round.

Methodology
We tracked the largest rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies in April. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late.

What You Need To Know About OpenAI’s $300M Share Sale,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/05/1,"

OpenAI is adding another notch (or five) to its belt.
The maker of the famous generative AI language processing platform ChatGPT closed a $300 million share sale at a valuation between $27 billion and $29 billion, TechCrunch reported on Friday, citing official documents.

This could mean OpenAI is wrapping up a months-long tender offer The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year.
As a result of the share sale, the company brought on a slew of new investors from longtime OpenAI backers Tiger Global Management, Andreessen Horowitz, and Sequoia Capital, along with newcomers Thrive Capital, and K2 Global.
Active funding to AI
OpenAI did not confirm the news, but the nonprofit-turned-startup continues to dominate the tech startup conversation, driving one third of all funding in January. That was largely due to OpenAI’s (reportedly) massive $10 billion raise that came from Microsoft.
OpenAI is still actively dealmaking, a sign that the generative AI hype isn’t slowing down any time soon. Riding on the coattails of ChatGPT’s success are several generative artificial intelligence companies. In less than than half a year, startups in the AI space have raised over $18 billion and are on track to beat the $41 billion they raised in 2022, per Crunchbase data.
The deal between Microsoft and OpenAI is still the biggest funding round dedicated to the space. SandboxAQ, an AI and quantum computing startup out of Palo Alto raised $500 million in February. Adept AI, which uses AI to change the way people use and interact with computers, raised $350 million in Series B funding in March.
Unfortunately, no matter how much other startups insist they are and have always been AI companies, funding towards other sectors is still slow as interest rates and valuations still adjust to the new normal in tech.

SoftBank’s Chipmaker Arm Holdings Muscles Its Way Toward IPO,Jenna D'Illard,2023/05/1,"

Like a phoenix from the ashes, Arm Holding’s long-awaited blockbuster IPO is finally taking flight after the SoftBank-acquired semiconductor manufacturer confidentially filed with the SEC for a U.S. stock market listing this weekend.
The move sets the stage for this year’s largest initial public offering so far. Arm reportedly plans to sell its shares on Nasdaq later this year. The company hopes to raise between $8 billion and $10 billion, according to reports.

In a statement, which confirmed an earlier Reuters report on the planned IPO, Arm said the size and price range for the offering has not yet been determined.
It’s a pretty treacherous quest the U.K.-based company is embarking upon. Not only has the semiconductor sector seen its fair share of challenges, economic uncertainty and stock market volatility has put off many other IPO contenders.
Overall, U.S. IPOs — excluding listings for SPACs — are down about 22% to a total of just $2.35 billion year-to-date, according to Dealogic.
For its part, Arm’s business has reportedly weathered better than the broader chip industry. Its sales were up 28% in its most recent quarter, according to the company. Its focus on data center servers and personal computers that generate higher royalty payments is largely credited with its positive performance.
Please, we want IPOs
Industry watchers (and business journalists alike) have been hyped by recent news and rumors of news about several IPOs. 
We saw this enthusiasm last week when Johnson & Johnson, which owns popular drugstore brands like Tylenol, Band-Aid and Neutrogena, announced it will spin off its consumer health division, Kenvue, and launch it on the public markets after raising $3.5 billion. If that happens the company will be valued at $40 billion.
And let’s be honest, SoftBank needs a win. 
A well-received Arm public offering would certainly boost the coffers of SoftBank after it reported a humbling $5.6 billion loss related to its Vision Fund. That announcement was made just months after SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son took responsibility for the poor performance of SoftBank’s investments, saying he had become “delirious” with the high returns the funds were seeing at the height of the market.

"Regulators Take Over First Republic Bank, Sell It To JPMorgan Chase",Chris Metinko,2023/05/1,"

Just days after regulators issued a report on the historic collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic Bank became the next domino to fall as the regional bank fell into receivership and was quickly sold to JPMorgan Chase.
First Republic Bank became the third regional bank in less than two months to fail — joining SVB and New York-based Signature Bank — as many fear the banking contagion will continue to spread.
While not having the same tight associations with the tech industry as SVB, First Republic Bank did have an expanding technology division and served as the bank of a growing number of startups.

That likely was one reason the bank moved quickly during the collapse of SVB to shore up its own house, receiving funding from the Federal Reserve Bank and JPMorgan Chase to bring its reserves to $70 billion. 
In the end, that was not enough to assure clients, as the bank reported it had lost $102 billion in deposits in the first quarter — more than half of what it held at the end of last year.
Tech and banks
JPMorgan Chase will now take over First Republic’s $229.1 billion of assets and $103.9 billion in total deposits, as well as 84 offices in eight states.
The move likely will not ease concerns in the tech community, as all three banks had significant ties to the industry. 
SVB had relationships with more than 50% of all venture-backed companies in the U.S. and countless VC firms, while Signature Bank — mainly known for its real estate division — also had significant venture lending and crypto ties. 
Just on Friday, the Federal Reserve Board released a report on SVB’s collapse, concluding it was due to bank management’s inability to manage risk properly, and lax Fed supervision and regulation.
It also said SVB’s issues showed “systemic consequences through contagion” that can occur regardless of a bank’s size and role in the financial network.
That becomes truer by the day.

"After Years Of Sinking Venture Funding, Plant-Based Seafood Charts A New Course",Keerthi Vedantam,2023/05/1,"

There’s something fishy about the plant-based seafood market.
While consumers in the U.S. latched on to early plant-based meat alternatives, enthralled with Impossible Foods’ vegan burger that released the same blood-like substance as meat, vegan seafood didn’t see the same rise in popularity. 
This was despite having relatively similar funding patterns. From 2014 to 2019, there was only a 20% difference in venture funding between the two categories, according to Crunchbase data. By 2020, investors began abandoning the plant-based seafood category. In 2021, while nearly every industry saw some growth, imitation seafood declined. 


But the tides are turning for sales of plant-based seafood. Between 2019 and 2022, the number of grocery offerings jumped from 19 to 33, and the category experienced a 53% growth in unit sales, according to the Good Food Institute. And after recent — and jarring — setbacks faced by the plant-based meat industry, seafood startups and the venture firms that fund them are charting a new course — one that means more funding is going to fewer startups.
“I think there’s a lot more enthusiasm for seafood because there haven’t been as many products on the market that have failed,” said Lisa Feria, CEO of food-focused venture firm Stray Dog Capital. “I think part of that, to be completely honest, is because there haven’t been any products on the market, period.” 
In 2022, only 12 startups in the plant-based seafood space saw total funding to the tune of $54 million. Current Foods, which makes plant-based tuna and salmon bites, raised $18 million in June. Finless Foods raised $34 million in March to make plant-based and cell-grown cuts of fish. 
Fighting an upstream battle
Plant-based meat’s reputation, meanwhile, seemingly has only gotten worse. After the initial novelty and sustainability conversation around Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat wore off, there were three facts left to deal with: Their products were 2x to 4x more expensive than meat, they arguably aren’t particularly nutritious or healthy, and they didn’t quite taste like the real deal.
That quickly turned previously interested flexitarians — consumers who eat meat and imitation meat — into a dwindling crowd. Sales of all plant-based meat products dropped 14% in 2022,and Beyond Meat, a first mover in this space, saw its stock price drop a staggering 77% as the company conducted two mass layoffs that affected around 20% of its workforce.
Early entrants into plant-based seafood had it worse — it’s not enough for these products to be inherently better for the environment or vegan, they actually have to taste good, be nutritious and relatively cheap. More flexitarians wanted to find replacements for red meat, while fish is already considered a fairly healthy food by many. That immediately put the onus on new products to be better than existing ones. 
At one time, investors were interested in finding a first-to-market plant-based seafood product that could quickly become a household name like Beyond. Now, they expect food to be cheaper, taste as good and be healthier than current seafood offerings.
As it turns out, it’s a lot easier to make plant-based seafood healthy. Aqua Cultured Foods, which received $5.5 million in seed funding in April, recently unveiled its products for a taste test at the Future Food-Tech conference in San Francisco. The startup served spicy tuna rolls, salmon crudo and shrimp dumplings. 
The visually convincing, fat streaked cuts of sashimi are made with fungi that undergoes a fermentation process and, arguably, is actually better for you than current seafood offerings. They can be eaten by people with shellfish, gluten or soy allergies, have fewer calories than real fish, and have added omega-3 benefits. And, the company says, it tastes like raw fish.
“Because of the fact that we are targeting flexitarians, we know we’re held to a stricter standard because these consumers are already eating traditional meat, traditional seafood so they know what it tastes like,” CEO Anne Palermo said. 
The restaurant endorsement
To win over new customers, many of the companies are turning to restaurants and colleges before reaching for the grocery shelves. 
“Investors are being much more selective. The due diligence process is more thorough and it’s taking significantly longer,” Palermo said. “Consistent cash flows and revenue streams coming from a B2B play is now much more interesting. Whereas before, keeping a branded product was more interesting.”
The Ish Food Company, known for its plant-based salmon burgers and deveined shrimp, began selling its products at restaurants and on college campuses before planning its retail launch.
“Most seafood is consumed away from home, primarily because American consumers struggle with preparing and cooking seafood,” said Christie Flemming, COO of Ish. “It can be a high-cost item.”
Indeed, around 65% of seafood consumption in the U.S. happens in restaurants, not the home. That gives plant-based seafood an advantage over plant-based meat — a foreign product prepared by skilled workers at a restaurant can make a product far more familiar to the  average consumer. 
“If you really nail a good food-service customer, you’re also building, in an ideal world, your brand,” Stray Dog’s Feria said. “And then when [customers] go to the store, they already have that brand [in mind]. You don’t have to wait for people to find you on the shelf.”

4 Charts Show Startup M&A Deal-Making Is Not Moving In The Direction We Expected,Marlize van Romburgh,2023/04/29,"

Predictions were rife coming into 2023 that we would see a flood of M&A deals for venture-backed startups as funding and IPOs dried up and cash-strapped companies looked for a way out.
That hasn’t exactly happened.
In fact, startup M&A deal-making continues to dip, Crunchbase data shows.

That’s true generally — the number of disclosed M&A deals for venture-backed startups globally slipped 31% year over year last quarter to 491 (though that’s up a smidge from Q4 2022).


It’s even true in the case of some of the most heavily funded startup sectors, like cybersecurity and fintech.
Cybersecurity, for example, saw some hefty deals last quarter — including Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s $500 million purchase of Axis Security — but M&A deals for venture-backed startups in Q1 still tumbled 58% from a year ago, to just 13. For all of 2022, there were 82 such deals recorded in Crunchbase, compared to 126 in 2021.


In fintech, M&A deal count dipped from 319 in 2021 to 289 in 2022. M&A deal count in Q1 2023 continued to fall, tumbling 37% year over year to 51. We did see some notable fintech M&A deals last quarter, including Marqeta’s $275 million purchase of Power, but the overall trendline shows deal-making on the decline.


That’s also true when looking across the spectrum of industries at venture-backed startups buying other startups. Deal counts for U.S.-funded startups being bought by their peers dwindled to 82 in Q1 2023, down from 137 a year earlier.


There are a few reasons for the slump in M&A deals. Sale premiums have no doubt fallen along with deflated startup valuations, which makes sellers more reluctant to cash out at lower prices. Would-be buyers also face higher costs of capital as rising interest rates make even bargain buys more expensive.
It also doesn’t help matters that there’s a growing list of big, losing startup acquisitions to point to.
Startup M&A could tick up soon
But that could change as the year wears on and startups become more desperate for alternatives to hard-to-find funding. Not only has total venture spending fallen dramatically this year, deal sizes are trending down too, our analysis of Crunchbase data found.
“I think it’s likely the market at large will see an increase in M&A activity,” Whit Bouck, a partner at Insight Partners — one of the active lead venture investors with the most acquisitive portfolio companies — who works with portfolio companies pursuing strategic acquisitions, told Crunchbase News recently, pointing to the funding slowdown as a primary reason.

"The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Biotech Goes Big, Orbital Leads The Way",Chris Metinko,2023/04/28,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.

Large deals were plentiful this week, as U.S.-based startups raised five nine-figure rounds — with two of those going to biotech startups. In fact, it was a huge week for biotech, as startups in that sector made up half the list.
1. Orbital Therapeutics, $270M, biotech: Biotech has been big recently, and this week Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Orbital Therapeutics led the way. The startup closed a $270 million Series A led by Arch Venture Partners. Orbital is looking to expand RNA-based medicines including next-generation vaccines, immunomodulation and protein replacement across a variety of diseases. Founded last year, this is the company’s first outside raise, per Crunchbase. Orbital is far from the last biotech firm on this week’s list.
2. Ohmium International, $250M, energy: Green hydrogen is definitely a thing with investors. Green hydrogen firm Ohmium International raised a fresh $250 million in a Series C led by TPG Rise Climate. Ohmium designs and manufactures proton exchange membrane electrolyzer systems — which are needed in the production of hydrogen. The device is used to split water through electrolysis to create hydrogen. Ohmium’s electrolyzer is powered by renewable energy, therefore producing “green hydrogen” with no greenhouse emissions. Ohmium last raised a $45 million Series B in April 2022 led by the Fenice Investment Group.
3. Vedanta Biosciences, $107M, biotech: Another big round for a biotech. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Vedanta Biosciences raised $106.5 million co-led by new investors AXA IM Alts and AMR Action Fund. The biotech startup is looking to develop oral therapies for Clostridioides difficile infection — the bacteria that causes diarrhea and colitis. Per the company, CDI causes approximately half a million infections each year in the United States, and has been associated with up to 45,000 deaths annually. Founded in 2010, the company has raised more than $430 million, per Crunchbase.
4. (tied) Pinecone, $100M, database: Although generative AI applications have been grabbing most of the fundraising headlines recently, some aspects of the infrastructure underneath those applications are starting to get investors’ attention. New York-based vector database startup Pinecone is the latest, raising a $100 million Series B at a $750 million valuation led by Andreessen Horowitz. The company’s vector database allows engineers to work with data generated by large language models and other AI-related models. Vector databases are easily searchable and offer the flexibility engineers need when creating commercial AI applications. While generative AI startups like Character.ai, Adept AI and Anthropic receive most of the attention, the underlying pipes needed to build those applications also seem to be seeing some investments. Last week, New Jersey-based CoreWeave locked up a $221 million investment led by Magnetar Capital. The specialized cloud provider offers flexible cloud infrastructure with better processing that will be needed to train LLMs for AI. Founded in 2019, Pinecone has now raised $138 million, per Crunchbase data.
4. (tied) Ursa Major, $100M, aerospace: Not much is known about this round, but TechCrunch reported Berthoud, Colorado-based Ursa Major has closed on a $100 million investment. BlackRock and Space Capital took part in the funding. The company is developing the next generation of rocket engines with substantially more power. According to the report, Ursa Major was looking to secure the funding at a $400 million pre-money valuation. Founded in 2015, the company has raised $234 million, per Crunchbase.
6. Replit, $97M, developer tools: San Francisco-based Replit — creator of the generative AI for software development platform Ghostwriter — closed a $97.4 million financing round at a $1.16 billion post-money valuation led by Andreessen Horowitz. Founded in 2016, the company has raised more than $200 million, according to Crunchbase data.
7. Super.com, $85M, fintech: San Francisco-based Super.com, which offers consumers savings and access to credit, locked up an $85 million Series C led by Inovia Capital. Founded in 2016, the new cash brings the total amount Super.com has raised to more than $150 million, per the company.
8. Foresight Diagnostics, $59M, biotech: Aurora, Colorado-based Foresight Diagnostics, a developer of cancer detection tests, raised a $58.8 million Series B led by Foresite Capital. Founded in 2020, the company has raised more than $70 million, per Crunchbase.
9. Antiva Biosciences, $53M, biotech: South San Francisco-based Antiva Biosciences — a biopharmaceutical company developing therapeutics for the treatment of pre-cancerous lesions caused by human papillomavirus infection — closed a $53 million Series E led by MPM-BioImpact Capital. Founded in 2012, the company has raised $140 million, according to Crunchbase.
10. Evommune, $50M, biotech: Palo Alto, California-based Evommune, a clinical-stage biotechnology company discovering new ways to treat inflammatory diseases, completed a $50 million Series B co-led by new investor Arix Bioscience and current investors EQT Life Sciences and Symbiosis. Founded in 2020, the company has raised nearly $146 million, per Crunchbase.
Big global deals
While there may have been some large U.S. rounds, the biggest fundraise went to a South Korean company.

Seoul-based autonomous mobility firm 42dot raised a corporate round worth approximately $787 million.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of April 22 to 28. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

SVB Collapse ‘A Textbook Case Of Mismanagement’ — Fed Report,Chris Metinko,2023/04/28,"

The spectacular fall of Silicon Valley Bank was due to the bank management’s inability to manage risk properly and lax Fed supervision and regulation, according to a report by the Federal Reserve Board released Friday.
“Following Silicon Valley Bank’s failure, we must strengthen the Federal Reserve’s supervision and regulation based on what we have learned,” said Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr, who led the probe into the failure of the nation’s 17th largest bank.

“This review represents a first step in that process—a self-assessment that takes an unflinching look at the conditions that led to the bank’s failure, including the role of Federal Reserve supervision and regulation,” Barr continued in a release.
The report said the collapse was a “textbook case of mismanagement by the bank” and that when the bank’s board and management realized its risk, it did not take the appropriate steps to fix those problems quickly.
The Federal Reserve Board’s shift in supervisory policy also “impeded effective supervision by reducing standards, increasing complexity, and promoting a less assertive supervisory approach.”
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said he welcomed the self-critical report on Federal Reserve supervision.
“I agree with and support his recommendations to address our rules and supervisory practices, and I am confident they will lead to a stronger and more resilient banking system,” Powell said.
The report also touched on broader issues exposed in the bank’s failure, including the fact a “combination of social media, a highly networked and concentrated depositor base, and technology” changed the speed of bank runs. The report said “social media enabled depositors to instantly spread concerns about a bank run, and technology enabled immediate withdrawals of funding.”
SVB’s issues also show “systemic consequences through contagion” that can occur regardless of a bank’s size and role in the financial network, the report continued.
A timeline
On March 9, Silicon Valley Bank saw its stock price plunge after announcing it would sell $2.25 billion worth of stock — including $500 million worth of shares to private equity firm General Atlantic — to shore up its balance sheet.
The announcement led to deep concern around the venture world — SVB has relationships with more than 50% of all venture-backed companies in the U.S. and countless VC firms — about the bank’s liquidity and balance sheet strength and led to a run on withdrawals.
The bank unsuccessfully tried to sell itself and was shut down by banking regulators the following morning.
On March 26, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. announced First Citizens BancShares had agreed to buy the loans and deposits of the failed Silicon Valley Bank.
SVB’s collapse was due to both bad decisions and bad timing. During the recent venture capital boom, the bank was flush with cash as private companies raised huge sums of fresh capital at sky-high valuations. That cash was stuffed into the bank.
However, as the market has slowed with rising interest rates, that cash has dried up as deposits by startups dipped.
At the same time, SVB had decided to invest in long-term, higher-yield bonds. That decision proved disastrous, as when customers started to withdraw cash, the bank had to sell its $21 billion bond portfolio at a $1.8 billion loss.
The bank had hoped its proposed financing would fill that gap, but instead just spooked many of its customers.
A history
SVB was the dominant bank for tech startups and venture debt in the U.S., cultivating a reputation for close-knit relationships with the power brokers of venture and taking chances on young startups that most banks wouldn’t have the time of day for.
The bank was founded in 1983 by Bill Biggerstaff and Robert Medearis with an eye toward backing VC-backed companies — a still relatively new phenomenon at the time. From there it grew, even surviving the California real estate crash in the early 1990s. It provided banking services for up-and-coming tech companies such as Cisco Systems and Bay Networks.
SVB wasn’t just a bank for VC-backed startups — it was “the” bank for such companies. One of the reasons SVB became the bank of choice was its venture lending practice. The bank had about $74 billion worth of loans on its books, with about 20% of that being from venture debt, according to those in the industry.
SVB also had a large private wealth management division that had significant synergies with its commercial banking operations — helping the same VCs and entrepreneurs with home mortgages and personal loans after it just helped their startup close a big financing round.
The SVB failure is the second-largest bank collapse in U.S. history. The largest collapse of a financial institution was Washington Mutual, which fell in 2008.

Why Startups May Soon Be Buying More Startups,Joanna Glasner,2023/04/28,"

If you’re a startup, it’s likely your exit won’t be going public or selling to a big-name acquirer. Instead, there’s a good chance you or your assets will end up in the hands of another startup.
Stats back up this presumption. Each year, in the U.S. alone, hundreds of funded startups get acquired by private, venture-backed companies.
This year is shaping up as no exception. So far in 2023, at least 99 U.S. startups have been acquired by other startups, per Crunchbase data.

As the chart below illustrates, reported counts for these kinds of deals are actually down a bit from last year’s highs. But there’s reason to think that may be temporary.


The case for more M&A
“I think it’s likely the market at large will see an increase in M&A activity,” said Whit Bouck, a partner at Insight Partners who works with portfolio companies pursuing strategic acquisitions. One factor she points to is the changing funding environment.
It’s been much harder to secure venture investment in recent months than it was in 2021 and early 2022. And as time goes on, it’s more likely companies that landed financing a couple years ago will be running out of cash.
If startups can’t get new investment at acceptable terms, selling to an acquirer may become a more common alternative. For acquirers, meanwhile, the prospect of bringing in valuable talent and assets for a competitive price could look increasingly attractive.
Cost considerations
Currently, it’s tough to parse what kinds of deals acquirers are negotiating.
The overwhelming majority of startups that make acquisitions do not report what they paid. Disclosed prices are particularly rare for smaller purchases of seed-stage startups and so-called talent acquisitions.
There are exceptions, however, especially when a well-funded startup buys another company that previously raised venture capital. So far this year, we’ve seen two deals with reported values around $100 million: Online publishing software provider OpenWeb’s January purchase of personalized messaging startup Jeeng, and digital health platform Transcarent’s acquisition of the virtual care business 98point6 in March.
Given that public and private tech company valuations have fallen sharply in recent quarters, typical deal prices are probably already down considerably from early last year. For still-viable startups acquired by other startups, however, the good news is that an acquisition isn’t game over, as the combined company still has a shot at an even bigger exit to come.

Pinecone Hits $750M Valuation As AI Heats Up Vector Database Market,Chris Metinko,2023/04/27,"

While generative AI applications have been grabbing most of the fundraising headlines recently, some aspects of the infrastructure underneath those applications are starting to get investors’ attention.
New York-based vector database startup Pinecone is the latest, raising a $100 million Series B at a $750 million valuation. The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from Iconiq Growth and previous investors Menlo Ventures and Wing Venture Capital.
The company’s vector database allows engineers to work with data generated by large language models and other AI-related models. Vector databases are easily searchable and offer the flexibility engineers need when creating commercial AI applications.

“The new wave of AI-powered applications create, store and search through a large number of vector embeddings, which are AI representations of data,” said founder and CEO Edo Liberty in a release. “We created Pinecone and the vector database category as a whole to let all AI developers easily work with a scalable and cost-efficient database for this workload.”
Building AI
Investors can’t get enough of all things AI right now. 
Although generative AI startups like Character.ai, Adept AI and Anthropic receive most of the attention, the underlying pipes that are needed to build those applications also seem to be seeing some investments.
Last week, New Jersey-based CoreWeave locked up a $221 million investment led by Magnetar Capital. The specialized cloud provider offers flexible cloud infrastructure with better processing, which will be needed to train LLMs for AI.
There also likely will be increased investment in semiconductor startups as the AI explosion continues. New chips with better processing also will be needed to train those LLMs.
Founded in 2019, Pinecone has now raised $138 million, per Crunchbase data.

Sports Merchandiser Fanatics Drafts Investor Relations ‘Quarterback’ For Future IPO Play,Jenna D'Illard,2023/04/27,"

Venture-backed sports merchandiser Fanatics drafted its own superstar this week.
The Jacksonville, Florida-based sports giant hired former Meta head of investor relations Deborah Crawford, to lead in a similar capacity for Fanatics.

Although Fanatics Executive Vice President and CFO Glenn Schiffman said in a recent report that the move doesn’t mean the company is sprinting onto the IPO playing field any time soon, it does indicate the company’s readiness to go public eventually.
But why hire a star quarterback if you aren’t playing to win?
And Crawford is no rookie. The UCLA-alumni, who was Meta’s vice president of investor relations for more than eight years, previously served a similar stint as head of investor relations for Netflix. That’s no joke.
Fanatics financials
Fanatics has raised a total of $4.9 billion in funding over 11 rounds, according to Crunchbase data. Last year was busy for the company. In December 2022 it raised $700 million at a $31 billion valuation. Private-equity firm Clearlake Capital Group led that round. Earlier, in March 2022, it raised a $1.5 billion round and that same year acquired Topps trading cards for $500 million.
Fanatics is funded by 28 investors, according to Crunchbase data, including SoftBank Vision Fund and LionTree, among others.
It has also been fairly busy snagging up other companies, acquiring eight organizations in its history. Its most recent acquisition was Italian sports merchandiser Epi on April 5. Epi is an omnichannel licensed sports retailer that manages the official online and physical retail stores for top Italian football clubs AC Milan, Atalanta, Bologna, Fiorentina, Inter Milan and Lazio as well as the Italian Football Federation FIGC. Again, that’s no joke.
IPO summer? Not a safe bet but we’ll take it anyway
Of course everyone wants this news to mean that Fanatics will help reopen (or at least shock) the IPO pipeline into pumping again. We saw this enthusiasm earlier this week when Johnson & Johnson, which owns popular drugstore brands like Tylenol, Band-Aid and Neutrogena announced it will spin off its consumer health division, Kenvue, and launch it on the public markets after raising $3.5 billion. If that happens the company would be valued at $40 billion.
All bets aside, the only smart play at this point is to comfortably sit back and watch how these companies strategize their next moves. Pass the popcorn.

These Lead VCs Have The Most Acquisitive Startups,Joanna Glasner,2023/04/27,"

For a startup, buying another startup may make strategic sense. But it isn’t easy to do.
The list of decisions is long. How much to pay? Is it about acquiring assets, bringing in talent, or both? How should one compensate key people and keep the team motivated? Should you retire the acquiree’s brand or keep it?
The complexities around completing an M&A deal go a long way to explaining why some venture investors consider it their job to help shepherd portfolio companies through the process. It also points to why some firms have much more acquisitive startup companies in their portfolios.

“There’s a bit of a Goldilocks play that has to happen,” said Whit Bouck, a longtime software executive who joined Insight Partners last year as managing director. She works with portfolio companies as an operating partner, with a particular focus on navigating decision-making around M&A.
It’s not a light workload. Per Crunchbase data, Insight portfolio companies are a pretty acquisitive bunch. Since 2020, they have acquired 1 at least 110 companies in software sectors from cybersecurity to logistics to grammar correction.
Notably, the firm is among more than a dozen active lead investors whose portfolio companies do a lot of M&A. Below, we put together a chart of 14 firms among those with the most acquisitive portfolio companies:


As illustrated above, Tiger Global Management has a particularly acquisition-hungry portfolio. This is partly a function of the fact that it is lead investor in a ginormous number of growth-stage companies. Several are prominent serial acquirers.
Corporate card platform Brex, for instance, has made at least six known acquisitions to date, including its most recent last year: a $90 million purchase of financial planning tools provider Pry Financials. Hopin, the virtual and hybrid event platform provider, also made six acquisitions while raking in over a billion dollars in venture funding in 2020 and 2021.
SoftBank’s portfolio also contains a lot of active dealmakers. This includes the delivery services DoorDash, Gopuff, and Rappi, which have collectively made at least 17 known acquisitions.
Among Insight’s portfolio companies, meanwhile, OpenWeb, a provider of software tools for online publishers, stands out as an active recent buyer. It’s made three acquisitions since last year, including the $100 million January purchase of personalized messaging startup Jeeng.
Of course, carrying out M&A deals isn’t the end goal for growth startups and their backers. The objective is to provide value, often by filling a niche the acquirer couldn’t or chose not to develop in-house.
Given that acquired startups generally get subsumed into the acquiring company, it’s often difficult to vet over the long term whether a purchase was a success.
Failures are easier to pinpoint — although commonly more due to missteps made by the acquiring company. The most obvious case in point for this is FTX, which snapped up nine companies between 2020 and 2022, per Crunchbase data. Now they’re all part of one big bankruptcy.
The sharp retraction in tech and growth company valuations also means a lot of prices paid in 2020 and 2021 now look much too high.
Beyond getting the price wrong, per Bouck, the big reason acquisitions commonly fail is “either because the acquiring company moved too fast or too slow in integrating.”
It’s a bit like getting a recipe right — which requires not just the proper ingredients, but also the correct process and timing. Perhaps it’s no coincidence that Bouck also authors a cooking blog.

"5 Interesting Startup Deals You May Have Missed In April: Organic Computers, Recycling Chopsticks And Separating Waste",Chris Metinko,2023/04/27,"

This is a monthly column that runs down five interesting deals every month that may have flown under the radar. Check out last month’s entry here.
After a bumpy first quarter for venture capital, the second quarter is in full swing.

Let’s look at a handful of rounds that may have been overlooked but have tech that deserves a second read-through.
Upcycling chopsticks
We all snag the takeout chopsticks on our way out of our favorite Chinese or sushi place when getting takeout.
But after using them, how many of us toss them in the trash?
Canada-based ChopValue is here to help with some of our environmentally unfriendly eating habits. The startup raised $7.7 million in new funding to support its network of waste-to-resource microfactories.
ChopValue already has saved more than 100 million chopsticks from the landfill — turning what we usually use to shovel lo mein into our mouths into sustainably made decor, kitchen accessories and other products.
The company plans to use the new cash to get into new markets in Asia Pacific and Europe. It already is piloting its microfactories in U.S. cities such as Las Vegas and Boston.
While ChopValue has started with chopsticks, the company’s model can be used for other types of reuse.
A cyber brain
It kind of sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie, but isn’t that where all great ideas come from?
Australia-based Cortical Labs, a “biological computing startup” combining lab-grown human brain cells with computer chips, just raised $10 million in a funding round led by Horizons Ventures.
Cortical Labs plans to use the money to commercialize its biological computer chips — referred to as DishBrain — which has already learned to play basic video games like Pong.
Some think such a development could be the next advancement of AI, since human neurons have some advantages over their digital counterparts.
If all that is not terrifying enough, In-Q-Tel — the venture capital arm of the Central Intelligence Agency, is an investor.
Think about that.
More AI
A list like this is legally mandated to include at least one startup using generative AI, so let’s look at legal AI startup Harvey.
The company raised an undisclosed round at a $150 million valuation this month led by Sequoia Capital, according to a report by Insider.
While not much has been reported about that round, Harvey did announce a $5 million seed round led by OpenAI Startup Fund last November — when AI was just starting to take off — so it did not take long to raise another round from a big-name investor, even in a down market.
Instead of using AI for sales or marketing purposes, the San Francisco-based startup is putting it to work for lawyers, giving them an interface to use AI in editing legal documents or performing legal research.
Now the only question is: What is Harvey’s hourly rate?
A new way to compost
Many of us shovel food scraps down our sink’s garbage disposal with most thinking it just disappears into the ether.
Well, the sad fact is that it doesn’t. Actually, food waste now tops more than 3 billion tons globally each year, and some cities in North America have imposed garbage disposal bans and made organic waste separation mandatory.
Canada-based Sepura Home raised a $3.7 million seed round led by sink-maker Blanco to help with the growing problem while not making your after-dinner cleanup any more difficult.
The startup has developed a “smart” composter that connects to the plumbing right under the sink and can effectively separate 99.9% of solid waste that goes down the drain, while allowing liquids to flow through. The waste is stored in a sealed and odorless container there until removed.
The unit will cost about $700 when it starts shipping in a few months.
Can’t you make it go faster?
While everyone wants to figure out ways to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, there are natural methods for storing it in places like the ocean.
However, once absorbed and stored, it takes millions of years to convert it into bicarbonate, so the process is a little slow.
San Carlos, California-based Ebb Carbon is trying to make that process a little faster. The  ocean-based carbon dioxide removal startup raised a $20 million Series A across two closings led by Prelude Ventures and Evok Innovations, respectively
Ebb’s proprietary solution speeds up the natural process of alkalinization, reducing acidity in the ocean and restoring its natural chemistry, and allowing it to once again draw down more carbon dioxide.
The new cash will allow Ebb to deploy its first systems — one with the capacity to remove 100 tons of CO2 later this year, and a 1,000-ton capacity system shortly after that.

Could J&J’s IPO Kick Off A Wave Of IPOs?,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/04/26,"

Johnson & Johnson could be leading the pack of a wave of IPOs, ending a drought that has lasted a little more than a year.
The pharmaceutical and medical device company that owns popular drugstore brands like Tylenol, Band-Aid and Neutrogena announced on Tuesday it would spin off its consumer health division, Kenvue, and launch it on the public markets after raising $3.5 billion. The company would be valued at $40 billion. 

We’ve heard rumblings from the private market that IPOs may be back after being abandoned for more than a year. Fast-fashion unicorn Shein was supposedly in talks to consider an IPO this year, and payments platform Stripe explored going public in 2024 to address expiring shares. 
But this is the real deal. J&J confirmed news reports of its IPO plans, saying it would offer more than 151 million shares of stock at around $20 to $23 per share. 
The long list of anticipated IPOs
It’s not the only one. BranchOut Food, a snack foods startup, filed for an IPO on Monday. After a failed SPAC merger, ticketing platform SeatGeek filed for an IPO last week. And although yogurt company Chobani pulled its IPO in September, the CEO said it’s not fully off the table.
It seems like companies are enthusiastic about making their debuts in the public market, and for good reason — the loan valve from two large, startup-friendly banks has effectively been shut off. Silicon Valley Bank collapsed, almost overnight, and USB acquired Credit Suisse, tightening credit conditions. 
It’s also true that many startups, after raising large volumes of capital in 2021, are starting to run out of money. 
It’s a sharp turn from two years ago, when more than 400 U.S.-based startups went public. In 2022, that number dwindled dramatically to 91, according to Crunchbase data.

Green Hydrogen Startup Ohmium International Raises $250M From TPG Rise Climate,Chris Metinko,2023/04/26,"

The promise of green hydrogen is great — and lucrative.
Green hydrogen firm Ohmium International raised a fresh $250 million in a Series C led by TPG Rise Climate. The new round also included participation from Hanover Technology Investment Management and existing investors Energy Transition Ventures and Fenice Investment Group.

Ohmium designs and manufactures proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer systems — which are needed in the production of hydrogen. The device is used to split water through electrolysis to create hydrogen. Ohmium’s electrolyzer is powered by renewable energy and produces “green hydrogen” with greenhouse emissions.
“Ohmium is experiencing tremendous success in 2023,” said CEO Arne Ballantine in a release. “This capital raise is a validation of Ohmium’s strategy and technology leadership and provides our organization with the kind of investment needed to deliver on our ambitious plans for international growth.”
The funding will be used to expand Ohmium’s manufacturing capabilities and deploy projects in the U.S., Europe, India and the Middle East. Both the U.S. and the European Union have approved incentives for green hydrogen projects.
Ohmium last raised a $45 million Series B in April 2022 led by the Fenice Investment Group.
The rise of TPG Rise Climate
TPG Rise Climate, the dedicated climate investing strategy of its global impact investing platform TPG Rise, is no stranger to leading large rounds.
Originally announced in 2021, the fund announced its $7.3 billion final closing in April 2022.
The fund has been at the head of several large fundraisings in the renewable energy category including:

Fremont, California-based smart solar tracker startup Nextracker’s $500 million venture round in February 2022.
Lincoln, Nebraska-based clean hydrogen and clean materials company Monolith’s $300 million raise in July of last year.
Somerville, Massachusetts-based low-cost battery system developer Form Energy’s $450 Series E in October.

Greycroft Announces $1B In Commitments To Brighten Dark Venture Capital Landscape,Jenna D'Illard,2023/04/26,"

It’s not all doom and gloom out there in the startup and venture capital world.
At least not for those with connections to Greycroft. The New York- and Los Angeles-based venture capital firm announced Tuesday that it is closing on more than $1 billion in capital commitments across new funds.
The firm, which backs startups from seed to growth, is known for its investments in a slew of successful startups including Gwyneth Paltrow’s lifestyle brand Goop, scooter startup Bird and popular payments platform Venmo. Its most recent reported investment was as co-lead with Madrona Venture Group on April 25 as part of data sharing platform Bobsled’s $17 million Series A.

To see a more complete list of Greycroft’s investments, visit the firm’s Crunchbase investment data page. Greycroft‘s most notable exits include Bumble, Scopely and SEMrush. Of course, not all Greycroft portfolio companies have been winners. Recently, e-commerce company Boxed, which raised over $240 million in venture funding before going public via a SPAC merger 15 months ago, told investors that it is contemplating a bankruptcy filing.
Let’s talk about the money
Co-founded in 2006 by Ian Sigalow, Alan Patricof and Dana Settle, Greycroft has grown from $75 million to $3 billion in capital commitments and partnered with more than 250 portfolio companies, according to the firm.
Greycroft typically makes initial investments from $500,000 at the seed stage to up to $30 million in the growth stage, according to the firm. It is an active Series A investor and typically invests between $1 million and $10 million.
Sigalow pointed to AI and other sectors in the firm’s announcement: “We are witnessing a once-in-a-generation industrial transformation driven by advancements in artificial intelligence and the increasing need for sustainable products. These secular shifts are creating new opportunities across a wide range of sectors, despite the challenging economic conditions.”

"These 4 Charts Show That Slowly But Surely, Startup Funding Deal Sizes Are Shrinking",Gené Teare,2023/04/26,"

After rising for more than a decade, the typical funding deal size for a U.S.-based startup is falling.
Average and median deal sizes have dipped since the latter half of 2022, Crunchbase data shows. That follows a systematic rise over the previous decade for U.S.-based startups.

Within that decade-long rise, there was a noticeable upward inflection in recent years. In 2021, round size from seed to Series B leapt up between 25% and 59% year over year — even more than in prior years. For Series C, the initial surge took place a year earlier in 2020, based on an analysis of Crunchbase data.
But starting in the second half of last year, average and median round sizes have flattened or shifted down. The downward shift is noticeable but gradual, with more mature companies from Series C onward hit the hardest for now. For the past quarter, seed through Series B fundings hovered above 2020 average and median size, while Series C fundings remained below.
We also see another interesting trend as the decade progresses: The gap between median and average funding by type has widened in recent years. This shows that sizable rounds at each stage have become more common, pushing averages up more dramatically. (We did place an upper limit for each funding type to limit the impact of outlier rounds on average fundings.)
Let’s dive in and look at each stage as they illustrate some matching and some divergent dynamics.
Seed
The size of the typical seed funding round peaked in 2022, Crunchbase data shows, but has since dipped.


If you go back about 10 years to 2014, the median and average seed funding for a U.S.-based startup was below $1 million.
Since 2014, the typical seed deal has increased in size and peaked in 2022 at a median of $2.5 million and an average of $3.7 million.1
In contrast to the overall venture funding pullback in 2022, seed funding was higher in the first half of 2022 compared to 2021 and showed a decline year over year starting in the fourth quarter.
Series A
The median and average Series A deal size also peaked in 2022 before dropping more recently, Crunchbase data shows.


The growth of the seed ecosystem impacted Series A fundings as it expanded the number of years a startup could build in advance of a Series A funding.
Median and average Series A fundings in 2014 were $5 million and $7.7 million, respectively, for U.S.-based startups.
The typical Series A deal size peaked in 2022 at $14 million (median) and $19.1 million (average). It has since come down to $12 million and $18.7 million, respectively — not a big drop, one could say. (But, keep in mind, we expect those amounts for the most recent quarter to trend down further as fundings continue to be added to the Crunchbase database after the end of the quarter. We find that deals added after the close of a quarter tend to be smaller.)
Series B
Series B fundings peaked sooner than seed and Series A — all the way back in 2021, Crunchbase data shows. This indicates a sharper pullback in funding in 2022 from Series B onward.


In 2014, Series B deals tracked at a median of $11.7 million and an average of $16.3 million.
That ramped up substantially over the following decade to peak in 2021 at a median of $32 million and an average of $46 million.
That’s dipped again somewhat to $28 million and $40 million, respectively, in 2023.
Series C
Similar to Series B funding, Series C peaked in 2021. But the jump in funding happened in 2020, a year earlier than prior funding stages.


Series C fundings show the greatest decline for all stages analyzed here. In 2014, the median Series C funding was $18 million and the average $26.4 million. That peaked in 2021 at $60 million and $82 million, respectively.
In Q1 2023, a median Series C round for a U.S.-based startup was $42 million and the average $59 million. The gap has also narrowed slightly, indicating fewer larger rounds at Series C.
Never going back again
While it is clear we are not going back to funding levels from a decade ago, the question is whether round sizes will shrink back to pre-pandemic levels.
For now, the only stage we analyze here that’s dropped below 2020 levels is Series C funding. But even Series C is still above the 2019 median and average round size.
What we can say is that the reset is only two to three quarters in and likely has not yet hit bottom. Each distinct funding stage is reacting to the cuts in the stage after it. If late-stage funding continues to contract due to the closure of the IPO markets, then startups at earlier stages face an uncertain future.

Series D Hits Lowest Point In Years. What Does That Mean?

Methodology
For this analysis we only include U.S.-headquartered companies to remove the impact of distinct trends in different geographies.
For seed funding we exclude angel and pre-seed rounds. For each funding type we exclude outlier rounds. At seed we excluded fundings of $100 million and more. At Series A we exclude fundings at or above $200 million. For Series B we exclude fundings at or above $300 million and for Series C fundings at or above $500 million.

"What You Need To Know About Ispace, The Japanese Company That Failed The First For-Profit Lunar Landing Today",Jenna D'Illard,2023/04/25,"

A Japanese spacetech startup that wanted to be the newest kid on the lunar block failed in its valiant (and expensive) attempt today when its spacecraft crashed.
Japan-based ispace was set to make history today as the first for-profit venture to position a spacecraft on the moon.

Only three other countries have executed lunar landings: the United States, Russia and China, but all of those were part of national — not private — endeavors.
Founded in 2010, ispace has raised a total of $174.8 million in funding over nine rounds, according to Crunchbase data. Its latest funding was raised on Oct. 25, 2021, from a Series C that included Airbus Ventures and Axiom Asia Private Capital. Other investors in the company include Innovation Engine, Incubate Fund and Suzuki Motor.

Here’s a look at the full list of ispace investors.

A wild trip
The lander launched on a SpaceX rocket from Cape Canaveral on Dec. 11. Since then, the spacecraft has taken a three-month trek to enter orbit around the moon, according to reports.
On another historic note, the ispace lander was carrying a rover built by Dubai’s Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre. The rover was the first Arab-built lunar spacecraft. The 22-pound rover will spend 14 days cruising around the moon gathering data.
Spacetech enthusiasm is iffy
Overall, investor enthusiasm in spacetech has waned, but not dissolved, since its heyday several years ago.
This year’s largest VC-backed funding recipient in the spacetech space, Munich-based satellite launch service Isar Aerospace, announced in late March that it secured $165 million in Series C investment.
To get a broader sense of where spacetech funding is going, we pulled together a list of 64 companies in the industry that have raised venture or seed funding in the past two years.

M&A Exits For VC-Backed Cyber Startups Continues To Sputter,Chris Metinko,2023/04/25,"

Just as funding has sputtered to cybersecurity startups in recent quarters, the main exit avenue for startups and investors also has been narrowing.
As one of the largest cybersecurity gatherings kicks off this week in San Francisco — the RSA Conference, where deals have often been announced — M&A deal-making in the cybersecurity space continues to slow with only 13 deals announced for VC-backed startups in the first quarter of the year, per Crunchbase data.

The number represents a 58% drop from a year ago when 31 VC-backed companies were snapped up by strategics and private equity in Q1. The number also puts M&A deal-making on pace to have its slowest year since 2017 — when only 52 VC-backed cyber startups were snapped up by acquirers.


That would be a dramatic decline from the 82 deals witnessed last year and the 125 deals done in 2021.
Few deals big or small
The largest deal in Q1 by far in cyber was Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s acquisition of San Mateo, California-based cloud security company Axis Security for what was reported to be less than $500 million last month.
The next two largest deals for the quarter were much smaller by comparison:

Tech giant Cisco acquired Israel-based Kubernetes security firm Lightspin for a reported $200 million in March.
Rapid7 bought Israel-based endpoint security startup Minerva Labs for approximately $38 million in cash and stock, also last month.

The slowdown in deal-making comes against the backdrop of a significant decline in funding to startups in the sector. Venture-backed startups in cybersecurity saw nearly $2.7 billion in the first quarter of this year, per Crunchbase data — which was a slight uptick from the $2.4 billion in the final quarter of last year, but also a 58% drop from the $6.5 billion such startups saw in Q1 2022.
What’s next?
The simultaneous drop in funding and deal-making is important to note because it begs the question: What will cyber startups do when their cash runways end?
Many startups are likely facing that dilemma right now. While they may still have money after raising significant sums in the salad days of 2021 and even early 2022, that cash is probably drying up. They also likely have inflated valuations that make a sale a no-go for would-be acquirers.
It’s interesting to note the three largest deals last quarter all involved Israel-based or -founded startups — which normally have lower valuations than many of their Silicon Valley brethren.
It is likely many big acquirers are sitting on the sidelines, waiting for valuations of targets to continue to come down, while also waiting for their own share prices to come back up, in order to negotiate better deals that may involve stock.
Large would-be buyers like Zscaler, Splunk and Palo Alto Networks all have watched their share prices creep up this calendar year.
While it may be true that some cyber startups are still sitting on the war chests they built up in 2021-22, that money will last only so long, even with many becoming more cash-efficient through layoffs and operational changes.
One would think deal-making will have to kick in sometime in the next few quarters as venture dollars become scarcer.
Maybe that will start this week in San Francisco.
Methodology
Cybersecurity is defined by the industries of network security, cloud security and cybersecurity, according to Crunchbase data.

Home Stuff You Never Thought You Needed Remains Viable Startup Category,Joanna Glasner,2023/04/25,"

Bed Bath & Beyond may be shuttering, but the vision it sold of a manicured, functional and up-to-date home, lives on.
Over its five-decade history, the retailer was a big contributor to the societal meme that a considerable portion of our paycheck ought to be devoted to the continuous improvement of our living spaces. Its shelves and catalogs were a testament to the notion that every household item — from toilet roll holder to mattress cover — was worthy of rigorous comparison shopping.

These days, much of that decor- and gadget-centric shopaholism has shifted to more competitive online offerings. But the core consumer appetites the retailer helped stoke — for things like smart garbage bins, movement-adapting mattresses, and bean-to-cup automated espresso machines — remains vigorous as always.

Startup founders continue to take these wants quite seriously. And while home decor and gadgetry has never been a mainstay of the venture capital business, there are always a few companies in the space that score some funding.
Household names
Arguably, modern life would look rather different had some of these ventures never managed to scale. iRobot, maker of the Roomba robot vacuums that are the scourge of dust mites and house pets, sucked up $30 million in venture funding in the late 1990s and early 2000s. And Keurig, a startup inspired by its founder’s distaste of old, stale office coffee, owed some of its early development to seed funding secured in the 1990s.
In recent years, startup investors have been shying away from big rounds for consumer products and electronics companies. They’ve also sustained some major losses on prior deals. This includes the oft-mocked Juicero, a startup that raised $118 million but went bust following reports that its $400 juicing machines performed no better than a person mushing its fruit and veggie packets by hand.
Today, startups should probably expect more rigorous diligence. That may be one reason we aren’t seeing a lot of deals getting done.
Even so, an analysis of Crunchbase data unearthed a decent cohort of recently funded startups with housewares and kitchen gadgetry. Below, we put together a sample list of 10 funded in the past couple years that have collectively raised over $377 million.


If I were to pick a rising star on this list, it would be Mill, a startup selling a $33 monthly subscription for a “food-shrinking, de-stinking” kitchen bin and food waste pick-up service. The San Bruno, California-based company has reportedly raised more than $100 million from backers including Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Energy Impact Partners.
Not just a cup of Joe
Coffee drinkers also have a few emerging names to follow. Spinn, which has raised over $44 million to date, employs “centrifugal brewing” and precision grinding in its $800 machines, which churn out custom-crafted espressos, filter coffees and cold brews. Terra Kaffe, meanwhile, has secured $15 million for its automatic bean-to-cup espresso maker.
Others are eyeing the bedroom. This included Brooklinen, maker of upscale bedding and towels, and Bryte, a developer of smart mattresses aimed at providing more restorative sleep.
Then there’s Aura Frames, maker of smart picture frames whose product could go in any room. The New York startup has raised over $40 million in equity funding to date.
The nice thing about the business of marketing a functional and beautiful home is that the minute you sell something, it opens up fresh demand for something else. Every gadget needs a place to put it, creating a potential customer for new, smart storage. Buying a new mattress invariably means also buying sheets and pillows too.
Seems we’re never really done spending. Or shopping. For home goods retailers, that’s just the way they like it.

Web3 Deserves A Permanent Place On The Global Decision-Maker Agenda,Guest Author,2023/04/25,"

By: Mo Shaikh
Web3 is so much more than crypto. It’s gaming. It’s social media. It’s commerce. It’s entertainment. It’s sports. It’s finance. And while the crypto market continues to fluctuate wildly, the future is bright for Web3.

But progress requires three things. First, to convince Web2 giants, like Google, Apple and Amazon, to jump in headfirst and build on top of blockchains built to improve user experiences and handle scale. Second, the Web3 builder community must empower corporate and independent developers to create world-changing decentralized apps across as many use cases as you can imagine. And last, but not least, we need to embrace opportunities, such as The World Economic Forum, CES or the United Nations General Assembly, to advocate for the benefits of Web3 with a concentrated group of global decision-makers.
Taking a step back
The founding promise of Web3 is to offer a public-oriented alternative to the hyper-regulated and centralized internet. It’s a tall order for many reasons, including that society relies on the internet for everything: social interaction, education, food, work, etc. Carrying the torch toward mainstream adoption also requires self-awareness.
Mo Shaikh, co-founder and CEO of Aptos Labs
I’ll be among the first to say the last seven years or so have been spent testing Web3 and blockchain limitations in a relative vacuum. Significant gaps in user experience, security and entertainment need to be filled in order for Web3 to enter daily routines across the globe. I’m confident that the next few years of development will bring access, sophistication and overall improvement to the Web3 ecosystem.
Delivering digital experiences back to the people via Web3 in a meaningful and globally scalable way requires technical expertise and transparency — critical elements of Davos’ evergreen annual meeting agenda.
Getting business and government leaders on board
Web3 will continue to show up at Davos and other global forums at the intersection of business and government in a big way from now on. And I’m optimistic about what the near future of Web3 holds if we can use forums like Davos or UNGA to guide governments, companies and society toward forging a more transparent, inclusive and experience-driven digital community.
It’s squarely incumbent on the people innovating Web3, many independent developers or startups, to advocate the technology’s social value — which is a departure from Web2.
Our message: While it can feel like a release of control, decentralization is actually a good thing for governments, regulatory agencies and big tech companies. Especially when the underlying blockchain infrastructure is designed to provide an open playing field for users and a secure, upgradable and permissionless backend for everyone to influence, including regulators, Fortune 500 CTOs, and indie devs bringing new experiences to users.
Bringing it back to the global stage
The year 2022 brought a crypto winter, an FTX implosion and collateral damage to several organizations connected to the FTX orbit. I believe the industry will rise like a phoenix from the ashes on the back of gaming, social media and other use cases with social value in 2023. But we need buy-in from global and local stakeholders to realize Web3’s full potential any time soon. So, let’s talk about how we can get there quicker.

Mo Shaikh is co-founder and CEO of Aptos Labs, based in Palo Alto, California. He is a 3x founder with over a decade of multinational financial services and blockchain/crypto experience. In the past, Mo has led blockchain strategic partnerships for Novi, Facebook’s wallet. Mo was the founder and CEO of Meridio, a ConsenSys-backed, blockchain-based company that issued the world’s first fractional share of real estate. He has consulted The World Economic Forum on its global blockchain strategy including Central Bank Digital Currency.

Britain Jumps On AI Bandwagon With $125M Taskforce For Education And Health Care,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/04/24,"

It looks like Britain is joining the ranks of Google and Microsoft to develop its own set of AI tools to tackle problems in two sectors notorious for slow adoption: education and health care.
The country is investing around $125 million (or 100 pounds) into developing foundational models similar to the language models ChatGPT is known for.
Just to help you understand how far (or not far) this money goes, ChatGPT rival Anthropic nabbed $124 million in Series A funding back in 2021, per Crunchbase data.
Compared to the literally billions of funding into AI since ChatGPT broke the tech industry in 2022, Britain’s humble allotment is a mere drop in the bucket.
But while Microsoft is using ChatGPT to bolster its search engine Bing and Google does the same with Google Bard, Britain’s investment “will build the UK’s ‘sovereign’ national capabilities so our public services can benefit from the transformational impact of this type of AI,” according to a press release.
The potential for AI in the public sector
Venture capitalists, startup founders and AI enthusiasts have long waxed poetic about the ways AI will dramatically change technology for the public good (though I’ve mostly seen it used to create marketing content and deepfakes of Trump and the Pope).
Health care, thanks to a pandemic-era push into embracing technology, is experimenting with AI already. Microsoft’s AI-powered notetaking tool can be used in hospitals to ease burnout for a small price of getting access to sensitive patient data. Another, Abridge, raised $12.5 million in 2022 for a similar tool.
This actually seems to be the most popular application for generative AI in health care, which is good, because I don’t want to hear anything about a Dr. ChatGPT (though it did recently pass a medical licensing exam).
Speaking of passing the medical licensing exam, students are using generative AI platforms to write essays and answer homework questions that have been able to subvert plagiarism tools. But just as the calculator forced math teachers to change how they taught equations, some education experts say there’s room to embrace generative AI in a way that forces students to ask critical questions.
“With AI set to contribute billions of pounds to UK GDP, the work of the taskforce will help deliver on the Prime Minister’s priorities to grow our economy, whilst generating better outcomes for people across the country through better public services,” the press release said.

Savings App Super.com Raises $85M Series C,Chris Metinko,2023/04/24,"

San Francisco-based Super.com, which offers consumers savings and access to credit, locked up an $85 million Series C led by Inovia Capital.
The startup — formerly Snapcommerce — did not release a valuation, but said it “significantly” increased from its March 2021 Series B. The raise includes $60 million in equity and $25 million in a credit facility.

Firms that participated in the round include Telstra Ventures, Acrew, Lion Capital, Hyphen Capital, EDC and Plaza Ventures. Several notable individuals also participated, including NBA superstar Steph Curry, Ancestry.com CEO Deb Liu and SubStack CEO Chris Best.
Super.com is an all-in-one savings app. While so-called “super” apps are popular abroad — think WeChat — they have not caught on as quickly in the U.S. However, with everyone trying to save money in today’s economic environment, Super.com’s offering of deals and savings across multiple categories such as travel and retail could be a draw for many consumers. In addition, Super.com’s “SuperCash” offers cash back and credit building.
“Super.com’s diversified business model now drives savings across all facets of our customers’ lives, from travel to fintech. It’s great to see market excitement match our own as we rapidly build the first savings super app focused on everyday Americans,” said Super.com CEO Hussein Fazal in a release.
Big money
Of course, trying to bring a lot of consumer features under one umbrella is not new, even in the U.S., as apps like Uber have done so for a while. Also specializing in savings is something many apps have focused on — including Honey, which was bought by PayPal for $4 billion in 2019.
However, Super.com is hoping its merging of both shopping and savings in one app will be the differentiation it needs. The company said it has surpassed $1 billion in sales.
The company last raised cash in 2021 — when the funding environment was very different — landing another $85 million round.
The new cash brings the total amount Super.com has raised to more than $150 million, per the company.

The Fintech Funding Crunch In 4 Charts,Gené Teare,2023/04/24,"

Few sectors illustrate the massive runup in venture funding that occurred in 2021 as well as financial services and the fintech industry. In that year, billion-dollar venture fundings went to neobanks, wealth management providers, buy now, pay later startups, cryptocurrency exchanges and insurance brokers.
Some 20% of the total $681 billion in global venture funding in 2021 went to the fintech sector alone.
But only a small handful of these companies — including Robinhood and Nubank — successfully went public. The majority of the highly funded fintechs from 2021 are still private and face cost cutting in a tougher sales environment, all while waiting for the public markets to turn favorable again.

While much of the focus has been on late-stage companies, which are closer to the public-market turmoil, there is also a huge backlog of seed and early-stage fintech startups that were funded during the heady days of 2021, but haven’t raised new funding since.
That could mean a massive funding shortfall for the fintech sector over the next four to eight quarters, an analysis of Crunchbase data shows.
Let’s dive in.
Fintech’s stellar rise — and fall
First, let’s chart the growth and decline in recent years.
Venture funding to financial services companies hovered around $10 billion per quarter on a global basis in 2019 and 2020, then shot up to $30 billion and then $40 billion in two back-to-back quarters in 2021, Crunchbase data shows. Fintech funding then settled for three quarters around $34 billion before slipping to $25 billion in Q2 2022 and then dwindling all the way back to around $10 billion in the fourth quarter.
Fintech funding dipped more than overall global venture funding in 2022, falling 40% year over year compared to overall global venture funding, which slipped 35%.
Q1 2023 was back up above $10 billion, but that was in large part thanks to a single massive deal: Stripe’s $6.5 billion raise.


Early stage grew too
The surge in fintech funding in 2021 was most noticeable at late-stage. But the increase also impacted companies at the early stages — and it wasn’t only large outlier deals. Median Series A fundings grew by 47% in 2021 and Series B by 85%.


Meanwhile, the number of companies funded in 2021 increased by around two-thirds for both early-stage (including seed above $1 million) and late-stage financings, compared to 2020.


Where’s the follow-on funding?
Now let’s look at companies that have raised funding — anywhere from seed to Series C — by year but have yet to raise funding in subsequent years.  These are the companies in danger of running out of runway if they don’t get additional capital.
Around 900 seed fintechs globally that raised at least $1 million in funding have not raised funding since 2021, an analysis of Crunchbase data shows. Another 1,400 seed-stage companies raised at least $1 million in a single seed funding in 2022 and have not raised again in 2023.
Of the Series A through Series C funded companies that raised funding in 2021, about 1,000 — around 65% — have not raised since 2021. A further 1,100 companies from Series A to Series C raised funding in 2022, but not again.
For companies funded at seed through Series C in 2019 and 2020, by contrast, roughly a third did not raise funding in subsequent years. Those companies have had more years in which to raise follow-on funding, but were also funded in a climate where median fundings and the absolute number of companies funded were lower.


As venture investors pull back, how many of these companies will be able to raise in the next 12 to 24 months or face closure?
We expect more companies will begin to test the funding markets. In a recent report from Bessemer Venture Partners on the State of Cloud their advice is to raise funding before you need to, and not to wait for a “perfect” time to raise.

The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: EquipmentShare And CoreWeave Land $200M-Plus Rounds,Chris Metinko,2023/04/21,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.

Not as many big rounds this week, but still some rather large ones — with two crossing the $200 million mark. That includes a construction tech company —  a sector which has been on the pay-no-mind list of investors in recent years. AI played a role this week — as it does every week — with a flexible cloud infrastructure startup coming in second on the list.
1. EquipmentShare, $290M, construction: Construction tech has not been high on the list of investors for several years after the collapse of Katerra. However, that did not stop Columbia, Missouri-based EquipmentShare, which raised a $290 million funding round led by funds afﬁliated with BDT Capital Partners. The equipment and digital solutions provider serves the construction industry, providing companies a real-time view of job sites and operations, as well as arsenal equipment. EquipmentShare now has more than 150 locations, including additional rental, retail and service locations. Founded in 2014, EquipmentShare has raised nearly $700 million in total equity, per the company.
2. CoreWeave, $221M, cloud: Workloads continue to become more specialized and intense, and with that the cloud infrastructure they use needs to keep pace. New Jersey-based CoreWeave has locked up a new $221 million investment to do just that. The specialized cloud provider — which actually started out as an Ethereum mining operation — plans to use the cash to meet the needs of generative AI applications that are now appearing. Flexible cloud infrastructure with better processing will be needed to train large language models for AI, something CoreWeave is looking to provide. With its focus on the AI sector, it may be unsurprising one of the investors in this round was Nvidia, which is leading the charge in designing better AI chips. The round was led by Magnetar Capital, an alternative asset manager. CoreWeave has raised nearly $377 million to date, per Crunchbase.
3. Noah Medical, $150M, health diagnostics: Medical robotics startup Noah Medical raised a $150 million round co-led by SoftBank Vision Fund and Prosperity7 Ventures. The funding comes just a month after the Food and Drug Administration cleared Noah Medical’s lung bronchoscopy device for commercial use in the U.S. The platform snakes a robotic arm through the lung’s airways and looks for cancer cells among the tissue. It is currently undergoing clinical trials in Australia. The health diagnostics market has seen significant interest, with $3.5 billion in funding coming into the space last year, per Crunchbase data. Founded in 2018, this is the San Carlos, California-based startups first outside raise, according to Crunchbase.
4. MedShift, $108M, health care: Noah was not the only health care startup to see big cash this week. Charlotte, North Carolina-based MedShift completed a $108 million capital raise from Turning Rock Partners, Micota Capital and OY6 Capital. The startup offers a platform for both medical device manufacturers and practitioners across a variety of markets such as dermatology and plastic surgery — offering technology solutions with a range of other services. Founded in 2015, the company has raised about $118 million, per Crunchbase.
5. (tied) Cortica, $75M, health care: It was a busy week for San Diego-based Cortica. The physician-led autism services startup that treats children closed a $75 million financing led by Deerfield Management and Optum Ventures, while also making two acquisitions. Cortica acquired Springtide Child Development, a integrated data-driven autism support provider, and Melmed Center, a developmental pediatrics research group. Cortica merges neurology, research-based therapies and technology into a complete care program for children with autism. Founded in 2017, the company has raised $135 million, per Crunchbase.
5. (tied) EdgeQ, $75M, semiconductors: Santa Clara, California-based semiconductor startup EdgeQ locked up a $75 million investment round — the largest by a U.S.-based startup in the sector this year. The funding consisted of both institutional and strategic investors — including Phaistos Investment Fund, Strategic Development Fund, EDBI, Iron Grey, ST Engineering, Yaletown, ClearSky and other existing investors. EdgeQ anticipates using the fresh capital to ramp up production of chips that can unify both 4G and 5G onto a single chip, and can scale in performance and features via software upgrades. The chip provides both connectivity and compute at the edge for public and private networks and can be used for things ranging from industrial automation projects to satellite communications. Due to a variety of issues that run the gamut from inconsistent demand to production costs, semiconductor startups are often left behind in the race for VC dollars, however that could change as the AI explosion continues. New chips with better processing will be needed to train large language models for AI. Nvidia is leading the charge, although recent news suggests Microsoft is looking to build its own AI chip. Founded in 2018, the startup has raised $126 million, according to Crunchbase data.
7. Unchained, $60M, bitcoin: Austin, Texas-based Unchained, which offers  financial services for bitcoin holders, locked up a $60 million Series B led by Valor Equity Partners. Founded in 2017, the company has raised nearly $109 million, per Crunchbase.
8. (tied) Odeko, $53M, operating systems: New York-based Odeko, which develops a business-grade software platform for small enterprises, raised a $53 million Series D led by existing investor B Capital. Founded in 2019, Odeko has now raised $177 million, according to the company.
8. (tied) Semgrep, $53M, security: San Francisco-based code security solution Semgrep — formerly r2c — closed a $53 million Series C led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. Founded in 2017, Semgrep has raised $93 million to date, according to the company.
10. Enveda Biosciences, $51M, biotech: Boulder, Colorado-based drug discovery search engine Enveda Biosciences raised an additional $51 million equity financing led by Kinnevik to add to its $68 million Series B announced in December. Founded in 2019, Enveda has raised a total of $175 million, per the company.
Big global deals
For the second week in a row, the largest round of the week went to a Singapore-based company.

Cube Highways and Infrastructure, a manager of toll roads, raised a $630 million venture round.
China-based pharmaceutical company Hasten Biomedical completed a $315 million venture round.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of April 15 to 21. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

Florida Sees Sharp Shrinkage In Startup Funding,Joanna Glasner,2023/04/21,"

Startup funding can be a lot like the tide: It rises and then rapidly recedes. Lately, it’s been receding especially fast in the beachy environs of South Florida.
Sun, sand and no personal income tax were among the allures that drew venture investors and founders to Florida after the pandemic disrupted their usual commutes. That influx, plus greater recognition and backing for the state’s homegrown startup scene, contributed to a couple of record-setting years for investment.

To wit, at Crunchbase News, we published a series of articles in the past couple of years highlighting the state’s growing clout as a startup hub:

In early 2021, we looked at Miami’s rising star among relocating VCs and techies who were firm in their insistence that it was not a retirement decision. Funding to startups in the metro area hit a multiyear high the prior year,
A few quarters later, we talked about how the hype around South Florida as an up-and-coming startup hub wasn’t just hype. Early-stage funding to the state quadrupled in 2021. Big rounds piled up in sectors from crypto to logistics to health care.
Things were still pretty heated for much of 2022. That year, we reported, Florida saw the biggest percentage increase of any state in annual venture capital investment.

So that was then.
Now, we hate to put a damper on the party. But the data has spoken. Florida in 2023 is not a growing startup funding ecosystem. It is a shrinking one — with funding statewide receding even faster than it is nationally.
Florida’s quarterly funding drop exceeds U.S. declines
For a sense of how far things are down, we charted out seed through late-stage funding to Sunshine State companies for the past six quarters below:


As you can see, investment hit its peak early last year. Funding has mostly headed lower ever since.
So, you may be thinking that this is not a Florida-specific phenomenon. Venture funding, after all, is down sharply worldwide, including across the U.S.
This is true. However, the Florida shrinkage from the peak to this year is more dramatic than what we’ve seen nationwide.
Across North America, venture funding was down 46% year over year in Q1 2023, per Crunchbase data. But in Florida, funding was down an astonishing 81% from the year-ago quarter.
Annual comps look bad too
Annual comps also look discouraging. For perspective, we charted out annual seed to late-stage funding for the past five calendar years below:


As shown above, the state is nowhere near on track for a repeat performance of 2021 and 2022. Funding looks a bit closer to 2020 levels, when buzz around South Florida’s startup scene was just beginning to take off.
So who is and isn’t getting funded?
Still, while funding is down this year, deals are getting done, including some good-sized ones.
So far in 2023, the largest funding recipients include:

Deepwatch, a Tampa-based cloud security platform, closed a $180 million equity and strategic financing round from a handful of investors including Vista Credit Partners — Vista Equity Partners’ credit arm.
QuickNode, a Miami-based blockchain development platform, picked up $60 million in a January Series B round.
EnergyX, a Fort Lauderdale-based startup focused on lithium extraction and refining, landed $50 million in Series B financing led by GM Ventures.

Notably, we’re no longer seeing the kinds of supergiant financings that closed in 2021 and early 2022. Those included companies like Yuga Labs, of Bored Ape NFT fame, MoonPay, a crypto payments company, and Magic Leap, the VR unicorn. The three collectively raised over $1.5 billion in those two years.
Causes for a pullback
It’s difficult to pinpoint Florida-specific causes for a pullback in funding to the state. However, there are a lot of factors impacting startup funding everywhere. This includes falling unicorn valuations, lower investor enthusiasm for once-hot sectors like Web3, fintech and consumer products, and a shuttered IPO market.
Is politics a factor too? Florida’s rightward political shift, and the attention-seeking antics of Ron DeSantis, the Republican governor and potential presidential candidate, have certainly been in the headlines lately. However, I didn’t find documented evidence 1 in recent months of a startup founder or backer changing a decision around investing, expanding or relocating in the state based on political considerations. We’ll see if that changes going forward.
Given that a single massive round or two can significantly impact the totals, it’s also quite possible we’ll see some deals emerge that change the narrative around Florida’s above-average investment declines. At this point in the year, however, the numbers indicate that the Sunshine State startup scene is a lot less buzzy than it used to be.

Cancer-Focused Abdera Therapeutics Launches with $142M In Funding,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/04/20,"

Abdera Therapeutics, a newly formed cancer therapeutics upstart, emerged out of stealth on Thursday armed with $142 million in a combined Series A and Series B funding.
The Series A round was led by Versant Ventures and Amplitude Venture Capital, while the Series B round was led by venBio Partners.
Abdera Therapeutics aims to develop a slew of radiopharmaceuticals, some of which are in the process of advancing to human clinical trials in 2024.

It’s a daunting task: Radiopharmaceuticals can infuse toxicity in the body as a result of trying to kill cancerous cells, but that often affects surrounding tissue. But the company hopes to create therapeutics that will target only the specific cancer cells without touching the rest of the body.
“Radiopharmaceuticals hold the potential to transform the treatment of cancer, but the ability to finely tune radioisotope delivery to the tumor, while sparing healthy tissue, remains a major challenge for this class of drugs,” said Lori Lyons-Williams, CEO of Abdera Therapeutics, in a statement.
The power of a platform-based drug
Abdera Therapeutics is a platform that can develop a series of therapeutics using the same base mechanics. Among biotech venture firms, platforms are one of the gold-star investments in that category. Rather than spend a billion dollars creating a single drug in hopes that it reaches the market in 10 years, platforms can quickly whip up a handful of drugs faster and at a relatively lower cost.
“We believe that Abdera’s approach represents a new wave of innovation in this space to address important cancer targets that may be intractable to other approaches,” Versant Ventures principal Joel Drewry said in a statement.
Platforms also have an advantage because they’re not reliant on a single drug — which can take up to 10 years to make — for revenue. Startups armed with a biotech platform often partner with larger pharmaceutical companies to create therapeutics or other assets as those platforms grow their own portfolio of drugs. This, ultimately, is what makes them a darling in the venture world.

"
Specialized Cloud Provider CoreWeave Locks Down $221M Investment,Chris Metinko,2023/04/20,"

As workloads continue to become more specialized and intense, the cloud infrastructure they use needs to keep up. New Jersey-based CoreWeave has locked up a new $221 million investment to do just that.
The specialized cloud provider — which actually started out as an Ethereum mining operation — plans to use the cash to meet the needs of the onslaught of generative AI applications that are now appearing. 

“CoreWeave is uniquely positioned to power the seemingly overnight boom in AI technology with our ability to innovate and iterate more quickly than the hyperscalers,” co-founder and CEO Michael Intrator said in a release.
Flexible cloud infrastructure with better processing will be needed to train large language models for AI, something CoreWeave is looking to provide. Specifically, the company plans to use some of the new capital to open two new centers this year — bringing CoreWeave’s total North American-based data centers to five.
With its focus on the AI sector, it may be unsurprising one of the investors in this round was Nvidia, which is leading the charge in designing better AI chips.
The round was led by Magnetar Capital, an alternative asset manager. CoreWeave has raised nearly $377 million to date, per Crunchbase.
From crypto to AI
CoreWeave started in 2016, using specialized computer hardware called graphics processing units to verify transactions on the Ethereum network. 
As the company grew its processing power, it realized many companies faced issues with legacy cloud architecture adapting to GPU acceleration and realized its application to other areas.
And no area is hotter than AI right now, as every week another generative AI startup seems to raise a nine-figure round with Character.ai, Adept AI and Anthropic as some recent examples.
Coreweave may not be developing its own generative AI applications, but helping others there might prove nearly as valuable.

"
Tiger Global’s $12.7B Venture Fund Down 20% — Report,Chris Metinko,2023/04/20,"

Tiger Global seems to be losing its bite.
The crossover investment giant’s $12.7 billion fund — which was launched near the end of 2021 — had a paper loss of 20%, net of management fees, as of December, according to a report in The Information.
The news comes just about a month after The Wall Street Journal reported Tiger Global had marked down the value of its investments across its venture capital funds by about 33%.

Some notable writedowns from the firms’ Private Investment Partners XV include its entire $38 million investment in the now bankrupt FTX and FTX.US, as well other crypto and Web3 investments such as MoonPay, decentralized wireless network company Helium, and NFT startup Bored Ape Yacht Club, per the report.
One of the largest hits Tiger took was in its investment in NFT marketplace OpenSea. The firm invested $126.8 million in the startup in November 2021 and January 2022. However, at the end of last year, Tiger had marked that investment down to $30.2 million — a 76% drop, according to the report.
Tiger also has faced a significant writedown on its largest holding, ByteDance. Through its recent fund, Tiger invested $144.6 million in the China-based company in mid-2021 in secondary transactions. By September of last year, Tiger valued those investments at $100.8 million, per the report. Overall, Tiger has invested more than $2 billion in ByteDance at various times and valuations.
According to the report, about a quarter of the most recent fund’s investments are in the enterprise SaaS sector, with fintech and crypto being the next largest categories.
The slowdown
The writedowns come on the heels of the news Tiger had reduced the target size for its latest venture fund to $5 billion — down from a $6 billion target it set last fall and down more than 50% of what the firm anticipated raising earlier last year, according to another WSJ report.
The news of the dramatic value slashes is not just Tiger’s issue. If Tiger — one of the most active investors during the highs of 2020 and 2021 — one can be sure many other VC firms and crossover investors are making similar cuts to their portfolio.
Tiger has massively cut down on its investments throughout the past year, according to Crunchbase data. The firm made 158 deals in the first half of last year, but so far this year has made only 21.
The down venture market and massive cuts have not dissuaded others, however, from raising big funds. On Thursday, J.P. Morgan Growth Equity Partners, which focuses on late-stage venture and growth equity investments, closed its inaugural Growth Equity Fund at more than $1 billion.

"
Web3 Funding Continues To Crater — Drops 82% Year To Year,Chris Metinko,2023/04/20,"

Editor’s Note: For more Web3 coverage, please visit Crunchbase’s Web3 Tracker, a site to look at startups, investors and funding news concerning all aspects of Web3, cryptocurrencies and blockchain. Powered by Crunchbase’s comprehensive data, this site will be continuously updated as the next iteration of the internet grows. We hope this data and our analysis serve as resources for readers to track and understand the Web3 landscape and all it encompasses.
In the first quarter of the year, funding to VC-backed Web3 startups hit its lowest point since the very early days of the space as deal flow continues to slow.

Venture funding plummeted 82% year to year, dropping from $9.1 billion in Q1 of 2022 to only $1.7 billion, per Crunchbase data.
The funding number is also a 30% decline from the final quarter of last year, and the lowest total since the fourth quarter of 2020 — which saw only $1.1 billion — when many people had never heard of Web3.


Deal flow also continued its pronounced drop, as only 333 deals were completed in the first quarter — down from 369 in the previous quarter and a sharp drop from the  more than 500 announced in Q1 2022.
The total number of deals is the lowest since Q4 2020.
Big deals down
Perhaps nothing illustrates the differences between the first quarter of last year and the first quarter of the current one in terms of funding to Web3 startups more than the dramatic fall of big rounds.
In Q1 2022, VC-backed startups raised 29 rounds of more than $100 million. That included massive raises of $400 million or more by ConsenSys and Polygon Technology, as well as — of course —  FTX and its U.S. affiliate FTX US.
The most recently completed quarter saw only two rounds hit the nine-figure mark, as VCs have hit the brakes on spending big in the space.
The biggest rounds of the quarter include:

Vancouver-based Blockstream, which provides blockchain technology solutions for financial markets, raised $125 million in a convertible note and secured loan financing.
France-based crypto hardware maker Ledger added another $108 million to its previously announced $380 million Series C at its same $1.4 billion valuation.
Israel-based Chain Reaction, a semiconductor startup focused on blockchain and privacy technologies, raised a $70 million Series C.

Everything’s down
For our purposes here, we define Web3 as startups in either (or both) the crypto or blockchain sectors. Last quarter, both of those sectors individually experienced their lowest ebb in years.
VC-backed crypto startups saw just more than $800 million invested — the lowest total since more than $600 million was invested in Q1 2020.
The story is similar for blockchain startups, which raised about $1.2 billion in Q1 — the lowest total since such startups saw $820 million in Q4 2020.
Get out now?
Of course, the easy conclusion is that Web3 is over and it’s time to cash out of crypto.
However, as pointed out before, venture funding is down in almost every sector. Web3 no doubt has been more affected by the dip since in uncertain times investors seek out industries they know best — such as cybersecurity or SaaS, not the promise of the next iteration of the internet.
There also appear to be small sub sectors that are seeing renewed interest in the space. Instead of pouring big money into the next exchange or lender, VCs seem to be concentrating on blockchain infrastructure players to help build the foundation for Web3. Companies like Chain Reaction, Miami-based QuickNode, Seattle-based EigenLayer and others, all raised significant rounds in the past quarter.
Despite rocky economic times, both bitcoin and ether showed impressive resilience last quarter —up more than 80% and 70% in price, respectively, since the beginning of the year.
Undoubtedly the industry is still reeling from the dramatic collapse of FTX, as well as several other crypto lenders, and even some of the banking issues that rattled the economy in general. However, there are some positive signs.
Whether that’s enough to bring more venture dollars back to the space — only time will tell.
Methodology
For Web3 funding numbers we analyze investments made into VC-backed startups in both cryptocurrency and blockchain.

"
India To Become The World’s Largest Nation — Here’s How Its Startup Funding Scene Stacks Up,Marlize van Romburgh,2023/04/19,"

India will eclipse China as the world’s most populous country by mid-2023, the United Nations estimated on Wednesday. The South Asian nation is expected to have a population of 1.4286 billion by the middle of this year, surpassing China by 2.9 million people.

Venture funding to the two Asian countries, however, runs counter to their population trends, Crunchbase data shows. In the past year, venture capital spending in India has fallen much more precipitously when compared to China, which garners more than twice as much VC spending as its neighbor.


VC funding falls across Asia
Amid a broader global venture funding pullback, VC dollars invested in India-based startups plummeted 75%, to just $2.4 billion, in Q1 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022, Crunchbase data shows. That’s down from $9.8 billion in Q1 2022 and down nearly 25% from $3.2 billion in Q4.
Venture funding to China-based startups also fell, though far less drastically: down 38% quarter over quarter and year over year to $8.1 billion in Q1 2023.
Total venture funding to Asia fell 33% quarter over quarter and 57% year over year to $15.2 billion in Q1 2023 — the lowest amount in at least the past three years, Crunchbase data shows.
That coincides with a 53% YoY first-quarter drop in global venture funding.


India’s population grows as China shrinks
China’s population fell for the first time in six decades last year as its fertility rate dropped.  American lawmakers are also seeking to curtail U.S. investment in China’s technology sector, citing national security concerns, which would further dampen an economy that has struggled through population stagnation and strict COVID lockdown measures.
In contrast, India’s population has grown at an average rate of 1.2% for the past 12 years, according to government data reviewed by Reuters, and large American companies such as Apple are expanding their manufacturing there rather than in China.
India also has one of the youngest populations among large nations, with an estimated 254 million people between the ages of 15 and 24. That means its economy will have to expand greatly to provide jobs and wealth to its people and could usher in more investment for its burgeoning technology sector.

Noah Medical Announces $150M For A Robot That Goes In Your Lungs,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/04/19,"

Noah Medical, the California-based medical robotics startup, announced on Wednesday it raised $150 million in fresh funding. The round was co-led by Softbank Vision Fund and Prosperity7 Ventures. Hillhouse Capital, Sequoia Capital China and UpHonest Capital were among the investors that participated in the round.
The funding comes just a month after the Food and Drug Administration cleared Noah Medical’s lung bronchoscopy device for commercial use in the U.S. Known as the Galaxy system, the platform snakes a robotic arm through the lung’s airways and looks for cancer cells among the tissue. The same device is currently undergoing clinical trials in Australia.

“Next generation robotics platforms like the Galaxy System are filling procedural gaps to provide superior clinical values to better serve customers’ needs,” said Noah Medical founder and CEO Jian Zhang.
Noah Medical’s disposable probes allow medical institutions to use the same device between patients faster. Rather than resanitizing the device, users can simply replace the probe, leading to faster turnaround times and making it possible for doctors to see more patients in the same time span.
The growing diagnostics market
Diagnostics rarely got its fair share of respect until the COVID-19 pandemic started. But all treatments start with diagnosing the problem.
In 2022, $3.5 billion in funding flooded into the space (per Crunchbase News) as venture firms recognized that the adoption of easier-to-use diagnostics tools could save health institutions money and lower the spend of health care in the U.S.
“Humans are missing a lot of diseases because there is an inherent mindset where they’re thinking, ‘Can I treat this patient tomorrow?’” Kaushal Solanki, CEO and founder of medical imaging AI startup Eyenuk, told Crunchbase in November. “And that’s not the preferred threshold.”
Robotics have quickly been making their way into the diagnostics category, but bronchoscopy devices have been rather slow to make a dent in the pulmonology world. Many of these are required to act as an all-in-one device that provides medical imaging. They also need to have a small, compact footprint and be easy and intuitive to use, otherwise overworked nurses and doctors are less likely to adopt them.

5G Chip Startup EdgeQ Lands $75M Round,Chris Metinko,2023/04/19,"

Santa Clara, California-based EdgeQ locked up a $75 million investment round — the largest raise this year by a U.S.-based semiconductor startup.
The funding consisted of both institutional and strategic investors — including Phaistos Investment Fund, Strategic Development Fund, EDBI, Iron Grey, ST Engineering, Yaletown, ClearSky and other existing investors.

EdgeQ anticipates using the fresh capital to ramp up production of chips that can unify both 4G and 5G onto a single chip, and can scale in performance and features via software upgrades. The chip provides both connectivity and compute at the edge for public and private networks and can be used for things ranging from industrial automation projects to satellite communications.
“By removing the friction and price premium that traditionally accompanies cellular deployment, we have envisioned a new backbone that is simple, intuitive and open,” said co-founder and CEO Vinay Ravuri. “And this disruption is available now.”
Founded in 2018, the startup has raised $126 million, according to Crunchbase data.
Semi heat
Due to a variety of issues that run the gamut from inconsistent demand to production costs, semiconductor startups are often left behind in the race for VC dollars. Even the $52 billion Chips Act did not seem to spark the startup industry.
However, there could be an increased appetite as the AI explosion continues. New chips with better processing will be needed to train large language models for AI. Nvidia is leading the charge, although recent news suggests Microsoft is looking to build its own AI chip.
The race for better AI and the general growing interest in the domestic semiconductor industry could help startups raise cash in an unsteady economic environment.
Last year saw U.S.-based, VC-backed semi startups raise only $1.7 billion in 57 deals — down from $2.3 billion in 68 deals in 2021, according to Crunchbase data.
So far this year, less than $200 million has been raised by such startups — with EdgeQ leading the way.
Bigger numbers could be on the way.

"The List Of Big, Losing Startup Acquisitions Grows Longer",Joanna Glasner,2023/04/19,"

 
No investor sets out with the intention to buy high and sell low. However, that’s often how deals turn out, particularly pricey startup acquisitions carried out under much frothier market conditions.
In recent weeks and months, we’ve seen increasing evidence of this money-losing dynamic at work. Public companies that bought startups at prevailing valuations a year or more ago are now selling those assets at steep writedowns. Others are holding on, but with big losses on the books.

You don’t have to look back far for cautionary tales. In the past couple weeks, we saw at least two examples of big-ticket purchases that worked out poorly.
First, Uber disclosed on April 10 that it agreed to sell just over half its stake in  “super app” Careem to Emirates Telecommunication Group for $400 million. A disappointing return, to say the least, considering that Uber paid $3.1 billion to acquire Dubai-headquartered Careem over three years ago.* (see correction)
Then, on April 13, Walmart disclosed that it is selling online menswear retailer Bonobos to brand management firm WHP Global and fashion retailer Express for $75 million. That’s a lot less than the $310 million the retail giant paid for it in 2017.
Other acquirers who bought during boom times have seen larger or similarly sizable losses, both realized and unrealized. Below, we look at what appear, in retrospect, to be some of the most overpriced purchases of the past few years.
Teladoc and Livongo
The pandemic drove a sharp rise in telehealth adoption, as patients and providers shifted consultations online to reduce in-person contact. For a while, publicly traded companies tied to telehealth were flying high.
Teladoc Health, a virtual care provider that went public in 2015, was one of them. Its shares more than tripled in value from late 2019 to early 2021.
Market conditions looked especially favorable in August 2020. That’s when Teladoc announced an agreement to acquire Livongo, provider of a tech-enabled platform for managing diabetes and chronic conditions, for $18.5 billion in cash and stock.
Things didn’t work out as hoped. Teladoc shares are down over 90% from their 2021 peak. Its current market cap of around $4.2 billion is less than a quarter what it paid for Livongo two and a half years ago.
Square and Afterpay
When Block disclosed in August 2021 it would pay $29 billion in stock to acquire Afterpay, the Australia-headquartered buy now, pay later platform,looked like a pricey deal even by the high-flying standards of the time. Fast-forward to today, and it looks exponentially more extravagant.
You see, when Block (formerly Square) announced the deal, it was trading at over 4x its current share price. Today, with fintech shares deflated, Block’s market cap is around $38 billion.
However, Block didn’t actually pay the initially proposed price. Per its 10-K, the purchase closed in early 2022 for $13.8 billion in stock. That’s less than first anticipated, but still pricey considering that Afterpay had never been profitable and that Block shares have since roughly halved in value.
Just Eat Takeaway and Grubhub
Sometimes mergers turn out a little like big, late-night food orders — expensive, and not quite good enough to justify the cost.
This seems to be the case for European food delivery service Just Eat Takeaway, which shook up the space in mid-2020 when it announced plans to acquire U.S.-based Grubhub for $7.3 billion.
The deal didn’t quite deliver on its promise. Today, the combined company has a market cap around $3.5 billion —  and it’s also not profitable.
Carvana and Adesa
A few quarters ago, the combination of low interest rates and tight new car inventory contributed to a booming market for pre-owned vehicles. Today, with borrowing costs sharply higher, used car prices are on the decline.
That has not been a positive development for Carvana, the e-commerce-oriented used car seller known for its tall, cylindrical vehicle towers. Its shares are down roughly 97% percent from their 2021 peak.
A year ago, shares were well below peak but still much higher than they are now, when Carvana announced its $2.2 billion acquisition of car auction service Adesa. Today, Carvana’s market cap of $1.6 billion is actually less than the initial cost of that deal.
Uber and Careem
When Uber completed its acquisition of Middle Eastern ride-hailing and payment platform Careem three years ago for $3.1 billion, valuations for the space were a lot higher.
Since then, things have come down. Just how far down became clearer last week when Uber disclosed that it agreed to sell just over half its stake in  “super app” Careem to Emirates Telecommunication Group for $400 million.* (see correction)
Walmart and Bonobos
Seems like every generation of startups includes a few with ambitions to reinvent the retail experience. Menswear-focused e-commerce upstart Bonobos, founded in 2007, was one of these.
The New York-based company pulled in over $125 million in venture funding before selling to Walmart in 2017 for $310 million. That’s a lot more than the $75 million Walmart said it is getting for the company through a sale to brand management firm WHP Global and fashion retailer Express.
 
*Correction: The article incorrectly stated that Uber had sold half its Careem stake. In actuality, Uber sold half its stake in the Careem “super app” but retained ownership of Careem’s ride-hailing business. As a result, it is not clear that the transaction represented a loss for Uber.

Last Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Clear Street And Astranis Raise Huge Rounds In Bounce-Back Week,Chris Metinko,2023/04/18,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.

After several slow weeks, startups saw a nice infusion of cash last week, as seven U.S.-based startups raised nine-figure rounds. VCs threw their money in all directions, with startups in sectors ranging from fintech to fitness and biotech to identity seeing big raises as the pace of investing in April picked up.
1. Clear Street, $270M, fintech: After a few slow weeks, we finally have a big round. Fintech startup Clear Street closed a $270 million investment from Prysm Capital which values it at $2 billion. The raise comes less than a year after the firm raised $165 million at a $1.7 billion valuation. The independent prime broker is building a “modern infrastructure for capital markets.” Its first product is an equity finance platform — processing more than $10 billion in trades every day. Its aim is to create a single-source platform to serve all investors, across all asset classes. Founded in 2018, Clear Street has raised more than $600 million, per Crunchbase.
2. Astranis, $200M, space: Even as venture continues to slow, VCs still keep looking to the stars. San Francisco-based satellite developer Astranis locked up a fresh $200 million this week at a $1.6 billion valuation, per a Bloomberg report. The new deal was led by Andreessen Horowitz and comes just before the company prepares its first launch of satellites aboard the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. Venture dollars have continued to pour into spacetech even though overall VC investment continues to trend down. Founded in 2015, the company has now raised more than $553 million, per Crunchbase data.
3. Torl BioTherapeutics, $158M, biotech: It seems like new cancer treatments are always able to secure new funding. Los Angeles-based biopharmaceutical company Torl BioTherapeutics closed a $158 million Series B as it looks to develop new biologics for cancer treatment. The round was led by Goldman Sachs Asset Management. The startup — which had not previously announced funding, per Crunchbase — will use the new cash in the development of novel, antibody-based therapeutics to fight cancer.
4. ID.me, $132M, identity: Verifying who you are is hard online, and investors seem to know that. ID.me, a digital identity network, was able to rake in a $132 million Series D led by Viking Global Investors. The McLean, Virginia-based startup’s network has more than 100 million members who can verify their identity across 30 states, 14 federal agencies and at 500 retailers which all use the network. ID.me provides secure login, identity proofing and community affiliation verification for organizations and companies across various sectors and meets the federal standards for consumer authentication. Founded in 2010, ID.me has now raised more than $240 million, per the company.
5. Tonal, $130M, fitness: It has been a tough haul for fitness companies recently — just look at Peloton this week. San Francisco-based weight-training platform Tonal also has had issues, slicing 35% of its workforce last year. Last week, the platform raised $130 million — led by L Catterton, Cobalt, Dragoneer, Kindred Ventures and THVC — as part of what the company called “a broader recapitalization strategy.” The company also announced Krystal Zell will take over as CEO succeeding the company’s founder, Aly Orady. That seems like a lot of moving parts. Founded in 2015, the company has raised more than $580 million to date — although with a recap it seems some of that money may have been used to buy out old stakeholders — per Crunchbase.
6. Altruist, $112M, fintech: Startup custodian for registered investment advisers, Altruist closed a $112 million Series D round of funding led by Insight Partners and Adams Street Partners. The investment platform merges a self-clearing brokerage with software for a variety of services for registered investment advisers. The Los Angeles-based startup revealed the new round is in addition to a previously undisclosed $110 million Series C raised in November of 2021 and brings its total funding to more than $290 million.
7. AlphaSense, $100M, analytics: New York-based AlphaSense became the latest AI-enhanced startup to lock up big money, as it raised another $100 million from investors that included CapitalG — Alphabet’s independent growth fund. Other investors include the growth equity business within Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Viking Global Investors. The new money values the company at $1.8 billion. The cash is in addition to the $225 million Series D that valued the company at $1.7 billion last June. The startup has created a market intelligence and search platform — powered by AI and natural language processing — to help clients form corporate and investment strategies.
8. Spring Health, $71M, health care: New York-based mental health startup Spring Health raised $71 million at a valuation of $2.5 billion. The company did not release the names of investors for the round, but firms such as Tiger Global and True Capital Ventures have previously invested. Founded in 2016, the company has raised more than $366 million, per Crunchbase data.
9. Teamworks, $65M, sports: Durham, North Carolina-based Teamworks, which builds tools for sports for coaches and administrators, closed a Series E funding led by Dragoneer Investment Group. Founded in 2004, Teamworks has now raised a total of $165 million, per the company.
10. VintaBio, $64M, biotech: Philadelphia-based viral vector developer VintaBio emerged from stealth and announced a $64 million funding round led by Decheng Capital.
Big global deals
Although the U.S. startup landscape was littered with big rounds, the largest came from Southeast Asia.

Singapore-based online shopping site Lazada Group received $353 million from its parent firm Alibaba, according to reports.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of April 8 to 14. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

The Party’s Still Over: The VC Downturn In 6 Charts,Christine Kilpatrick,2023/04/18,"

For VC investors and startups alike, this year’s first quarter was a painful hangover from 2022, the stunning year that ended the glitzy venture funding party that was 2021. 
For Q1 2023, the operative word is down: funding is down, deal flow is down, overseas investment is down. The only soaring numbers in the first quarter are those displayed in our Crunchbase Tech Layoffs Tracker.

As for how we all got here, there are plenty of factors to choose from — rising interest rates, tumbling tech stocks, a war in Ukraine, weakening valuations, a stalled IPO pipeline, and let’s not forget Silicon Valley Bank. Now the question is: Has VC funding hit bottom, or do round sizes and deal counts have further to fall? We dive deeper into this year’s first-quarter numbers to find out.
The pain continues
The downward march of VC funding numbers that began in Q1 2022 and accelerated in the third quarter continues to drag on into the current year. Global VC funding fell 53% year over year in Q1 2023 to $76 billion — and that’s counting two mighty lifts by OpenAI and Stripe, which each raised billions in recent months. Even early-stage numbers dropped as investors continue to hoard their record levels of dry powder. 


Nowhere to hide
Sometimes in a down market, certain regions will enjoy a surge due to local factors or investment in a particularly strong sector. 
But there was nowhere to hide in first-quarter 2023. The only region to show a real uptick in venture funding was North America, and that was likely due to the OpenAI and Stripe multibillion-dollar deals. North American funding in the first quarter reached $46.3 billion — a decline of 46% from the same period last year. And without those two large deals, Q1 venture funding would have been down even more dramatically, with a more than 60% decline from the same period last year.


Latin America hardest hit
Latin America was impacted by the downturn more than any other region in first-quarter 2023, year over year. Venture investment in Q1 was down 84% from the year-ago quarter, per Crunchbase data. That puts Central and South America, which just over a year ago ranked as the fastest-growing startup investment region in the world, on the short list for the fastest shrinking.
Active investors in the region have cut back sharply this year, such as SoftBank Latin America Ventures, which participated in 34 rounds in 2021 and 2022. The firm joined just two rounds this year. Jumbo-sized rounds of $100 million and up are also apparently a thing of the past, with a single venture round of $100 million or more closed in Q1. Late stage, early stage, seed — they all struggled to raise funding.


Europe’s U.S. investors pull back
European startups raised $10.6 billion in funding in Q1, down 18% quarter over quarter and a whopping 66% year over year, as American investors pulled back. 
Seed funding saw a dramatic 25% collapse last quarter — a signal that VCs aren’t big on making long-term commitments right now. While late-stage startups experienced the worst funding pullback year over year, early-stage funding performed the best of the three stages (though funding was still down 7%).
The pullback by U.S. venture firms landed a telling blow on the region. Not only are deal counts the lowest they’ve been in a three-year period, Europe’s first-quarter funding is the lowest the continent has seen since Q1 2020, when the region garnered $9.9 billion.


Asia funding falls in biggest markets
Venture funding in Asia also got off to a brutal start in 2023, declining 33% from the previous quarter and a massive 57% from the first quarter of last year. Total venture funding in the region fell to $15.2 billion — the lowest in at least the past three years.
As in other regions, late-stage and growth rounds suffered the most, both in terms of dollars and percentage. Late-stage and growth rounds only saw $7 billion in investment — a 64% drop from Q1 2022, which saw $19.7 billion. Seed and angel funding rounds also weakened, with the first quarter this year seeing only $1.4 billion raised in 723 rounds. 


Downturn shakes up investor ranks
In such a reeling and volatile market, it’s no wonder that the ranks of the most active global venture investors were shaken up in Q1 2023.
 Andreessen Horowitz and General Catalyst rose to the top of our list as past VC leaders such as Tiger Global Management and SoftBank Vision Fund didn’t even crack the top 20. The quarter saw muted activity at seed and early stage, and fewer big late-stage rounds amid a lackluster IPO market.


Looking to the immediate future, it’s hard to see what will start the music playing again. Overall, venture and seed firms are putting less capital to work in fewer deals, and most of the negative factors that prompted investors to pull back are likely to linger like a bad headache into second-quarter 2023.

"
Series C Isn’t What It Used To Be,Joanna Glasner,2023/04/17,"

In startup life, getting to Series C is kind of like hitting middle age. You’ve been toiling away for a while now, and everyone knows what you do. Nonetheless, it’ll take a lot more money to keep forging ahead.
Lately, U.S. investors have gotten much stingier when it comes to furnishing middle-aged startups with capital to continue on their journeys. One metric to measure this is Series C funding, which is down 74% in the first quarter of 2023 from year-ago levels.

Since venture funding is down precipitously across stages, it should be emphasized that Series C companies aren’t the only ones facing leaner times. But because of the unique place this stage represents in the startup continuum — a sort of pit stop between finding product-market fit and prepping for exit — its decline seems to indicate sinking investor confidence in prospects for big investment returns.
To get a sense of how far Series C dealmaking has fallen, we chart out investment totals and round counts for the past six calendar years below:


Though we’re only a little over a quarter of the way through 2023, it’s shaping up as a down year, with Series C investment on track to come in around 60% below prior-year levels.
Quarterly declines are sharper
The picture looks a little worse when we compare the first quarter of 2023 to year-ago levels. For perspective, we charted out Series C funding for the past seven quarters below:


In addition to steep funding declines, round counts also fell. The Q1 total was the lowest in years.
Most-active VCs are backing out of Series C this year
One peculiarity unearthed in our analysis of U.S. funding data is that the venture firms which used to lead the most rounds have largely avoided Series C deals this year.
Five names that used to reliably top the most active investor  rankings — SoftBank Vision Fund, Andreessen Horowitz, Tiger Global Management, Insight Partners and Sequoia Capital — haven’t led any U.S. Series C rounds this year, per Crunchbase data 1.
Collectively, they’ve only participated in four C-stage deals in 2023.
Instead, many of the biggest Series C rounds this year were led or backed by strategic investors or firms that aren’t among the most active startup backers. This includes:

Monogram Health, a Tennessee-based provider of in-home care for kidney disease patients, raised $375 million in a January financing that ranked as the largest Series C of the quarter. The round had no listed lead investor and half of the backers were strategic investors.
Boston Metal, a developer of technology to reduce the carbon footprint of steel, picked up $120 million in Series C financing led by strategic investor and steel producer ArcelorMittal.
Chronosphere, a developer of cloud data visibility tools, scored $115 million in follow-on Series C funding in January, with new investors Google Ventures and Geodesic Capital joining the round.

For a bigger-picture look at sizable Series C deals, we put together a sample list of 11 from this year below:


 
Are current trends likely to continue?
While investors may make a long-shot bet at seed stage, that’s not the case at Series C. At this stage you’ve got to really believe in the product, the management team and the path to exit.
So, does the absence of the “usual suspects” among Series C investors indicate they don’t believe anymore? Maybe, but not necessarily. It could be that they’re sitting things out for a spell to let valuations settle or are conserving cash.
There’s also the countervailing explanation that perhaps startups themselves are sitting things out. With valuations lower, why do a down round unless you really need the cash?
So will the pace pick up again? Lately, there are fewer companies raising Series B rounds, so further out we may see a smaller pool of Series C candidates.
Of course, lots of companies did raise good-sized Series B rounds in 2020 and 2021. At some point most will start looking for Series C capital.
Perhaps they’ll seek to delay. Inevitably, however, there comes a point when maturing startups will need more capital, perhaps at whatever terms they can get. That’s just how it goes when you reach middle age.

AI Companies Adept And Character.ai Among 9 Companies That Joined The Unicorn Board In March,Gené Teare,2023/04/14,"

Nine companies joined The Crunchbase Unicorn Board in March — the fifth month in a row for new unicorns to number in the single digits, though counts were slightly up over previous months.
Of these nine companies, two are in AI, two in Web3 and two in health care. The Web3 and AI companies were founded as recently as 2021.

Five of the companies are U.S.-based. China, Germany, Seychelles and Ireland each counted one new unicorn this past month.
Two exits
Two companies exited the unicorn board. Shenzhen-based facial recognition company Intellifusion went public on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. And Arizona-based e-cigarette company NJOY was acquired by tobacco company Altria for $2.75 billion.
Here are the newly minted unicorns
AI

San Francisco-based Adept AI operates in the field of human and computer interaction, removing repetitive tasks. The 1-year-old company was valued at $1 billion in a round of funding led by General Catalyst and Spark Capital.
ChatGPT competitor Character.ai, based in Menlo Park, California, raised $150 million in a round led by Andreessen Horowitz. The 2-year-old company with a founding team that hails from Google was valued at $1 billion.

Web3

 Scroll.io is a layer 2 blockchain solution that processes transactions and then ports them back to the ethereum network. Based in Seychelles, it raised a $50 million funding led by strategic investor OKX Ventures valuing the company at $1.8 billion.
New York-based BFMeta extends blockchain to mobile terminals. It raised an undisclosed seed funding amount led by Goldman Sachs which valued the company at $1 billion.

Biotech/health care

New York-based fertility clinic network Kindbody raised $100 million led by Perceptive Advisors. The company, which plans to expand its clinic footprint, was valued at $1.8 billion.
Cell therapy manufacturing company Wilson Wolf Corp. from Minnesota raised $257 million led by life sciences research supplier Bio-Techne. The company was valued at $1.3 billion.

Hardware

Shenzhen-based drone company United Aircraft raised $291 million in a Series D funding which valued the company at $1.5  billion. The funding was led by Chengdu Heavy Industry Fund. The unmanned aircrafts can be used for national security, power grid inspections and disaster monitoring.

Energy

Joint French and Irish solar energy company Amarenco, based in Cork, Ireland, raised $320 million at a value of  $1.1 billion. The funding was led by Arjun Infrastructure Partners.

Fintech

Berlin-based Raisin provides retail customers with higher interest rates for their savings, matching them with banks looking for depositors. It raised a $65 million Series E funding at a $1 billion value led by M&G Investments.

Unicorn queries

Unicorn leaderboard (1,452)
Unicorns in the U.S. (717)
Unicorns in Asia (460)
European unicorns (196)
Emerging unicorn leaderboard (364)
Exited unicorns (424)

Methodology
The Crunchbase Unicorn Board is a curated list that includes private unicorn companies with post-money valuations of $1 billion or more and is based on Crunchbase data. New companies are added to the Unicorn Board as they reach the $1 billion valuation mark as part of a funding round.
The unicorn board does not reflect internal company valuations — such as those set via a 409a process for employee stock options — as these differ from, and are more likely to be lower than, a priced funding round. We also do not adjust valuations based on investor writedowns, which change quarterly, as different investors will not value the same company consistently within the same quarter.
Funding to unicorn companies includes all private financings to companies that are tagged as unicorns, as well as those that have since graduated to The Exited Unicorn Board.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.

Latin American Startup Funding Fell Further In Q1,Joanna Glasner,2023/04/14,"

Funding to Latin American startups plunged in the first quarter of 2023, hitting the lowest point in over two years amid a continued sharp contraction in late-stage dealmaking.
Overall, investment in reported seed through growth stage financings in Q1 was down 84% from the year-ago quarter, per Crunchbase data. That puts Central and South America, which just over a year ago ranked as the fastest-growing startup investment region in the world, on the short list for the fastest shrinking.
For perspective, we chart out investment, color-coded by stage, for the past nine quarters below:


Particularly notable in 2023 is the extent to which previous active investors have cut back. SoftBank Latin America Ventures, which participated in 34 rounds in 2021 and 2022, has joined just two this year. Tiger Global Management, another formerly busy dealmaker, has done no deals in the region this year.  And Kaszek, the Brazilian firm that ranked as the most active 2021 investor, has also dramatically slowed its investment pace. 
Jumbo-sized rounds of $100 million and up are also apparently a thing of the past. In 2022, SoftBank Latin America Ventures alone participated in six such deals. In Q1 of this year, not a single venture round of $100 million or more closed, per Crunchbase data.
Table of Contents

Early stage and seed also take a hit

Methodology
Glossary of funding terms

Late stage down sharply
One can see investors’ recent distaste for big, late-stage financings reflected in funding totals, charted out below:


For Q1, late-stage and technology growth investment totaled just a couple hundred million, down 87% from a year ago. The drop-off is even more pronounced compared to the peak quarter — Q2 of 2021 — when a whopping $5 billion went to late-stage and growth financings.
The lackluster exit environment is likely a contributing factor to the slowdown. There were no acquisitions of venture-backed Latin American companies that exceeded $100 million in Q1 this year, per Crunchbase data. High-profile IPOs also weren’t happening.
Early stage and seed also take a hit
It’s not just late stage that investors are avoiding. Early-stage funding also dropped precipitously year over year, as the chart below illustrates:


For Q1, roughly a couple hundred million dollars went to early-stage deals, down from $1.5 billion in the year-ago quarter. 
Things were also down at the seed stage, albeit slightly less dramatically, as the chart below shows:


Per Crunchbase data, reported seed investment was down 73% year over year in Q1. We expect this decline will likely get a bit less pronounced over time, as it’s not uncommon for seed financings to get added to the dataset weeks or months after they close.
Deal volume drop is less pronounced
Deal volume is down too, but not as markedly as investment totals. For Q1 of 2023, Crunchbase tallied a total of 129 reported seed- through growth-stage rounds, down 71% year over year.
For a sense how deal volume compares across stages for the past nine quarters, we charted out round counts below:


Things are down from a very high peak
As we repeatedly note how far things have fallen from 2021 and early 2022, it’s wise to keep in mind that investment was reaching unprecedented heights at that time.
The latest year-over-year declines look a bit less distressing when we compare to earlier years, when venture investment in Latin America was much lower. While current funding levels still don’t look great against these earlier comps, at least they look a little less terrible, as the chart below illustrates: 


Looking forward
So what will it take for funding to go up again? For those bullish on the Latin American startup scene, there are some positive indicators that momentum could pick up again.
Most prominent among these is Kaszek Ventures announcement last week that it has raised $975 million across two new funds: a $540 million early-stage fund and a $435 million vehicle for later-stage investments. 
So certainly there’s dry powder to be deployed. It’s just a question of when, where and at what valuations.
Methodology
The data contained in this report comes directly from Crunchbase, and is based on reported data. Data reported is as of April 3, 2023.
Note that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarter/year.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.
Glossary of funding terms
We have made a change to how we include corporate funding rounds in our reporting as of January 2023. Corporate rounds are only included if a company has raised an equity funding at seed through a venture series funding round. 
Seed and angel consists of seed, pre-seed and angel rounds. Crunchbase also includes venture rounds of unknown series, equity crowdfunding and convertible notes at $3 million (USD or as-converted USD equivalent) or less.
Early-stage consists of Series A and Series B rounds, as well as other round types. Crunchbase includes venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $3 million, and those less than or equal to $15 million.
Late-stage consists of Series C, Series D, Series E and later-lettered venture rounds following the “Series [Letter]” naming convention. Also included are venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $15 million.
Technology growth is a private-equity round raised by a company that has previously raised a “venture” round. (So basically, any round from the previously defined stages.)

Cybersecurity Funding Drops 58% From Q1 2022,Chris Metinko,2023/04/13,"

Although venture funding struggled mightily in the first quarter, funding to cybersecurity startups specifically remained relatively even quarter to quarter — although well below the highs of the past few years.
Venture-backed startups in cybersecurity saw nearly $2.7 billion in the first quarter of the year, per Crunchbase data. That is a slight uptick from the $2.4 billion in the final quarter of last year, although it represents a 58% drop from the $6.5 billion such startups saw in Q1 2022.

Perhaps more alarming, however, was the drop in deal flow in the sector. The first quarter saw only 149 deals announced — the lowest total in years and a 45% drop year to year.


A slow slowdown
The deal number may be a harbinger that there really is a slowing down in cyber funding — which has seemed pretty resilient despite the venture capital pullback.
The first quarter of the year was propped up by AI and quantum computing startup SandboxAQ raising a $500 million round in February, as well as two other rounds of more than a quarter-billion dollars raised by Santa Clara, California-based Netskope and New York-based Wiz.
In comparison, the last two quarters of 2022 — which saw a similar total venture dollar value when compared to Q1 — saw only one such round (a $401 million convertible note raise by Arctic Wolf). Both quarters also saw a slightly higher number of deals when compared to Q1 2023.
The top rounds of the first quarter this year in cyber include:

SandboxAQ’s $500 million round was the largest. The startup is looking at how companies and the government can replace current public-key cryptography algorithms with algorithms that are resistant to quantum computer-based attacks.
Netskope received a $401 million convertible note investment led by Morgan Stanley Tactical Value.
Wiz raised $300 million in fresh capital led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and existing investors Greenoaks Capital Partners and Index Ventures at a valuation of $10 billion.
Tampa-based managed detection and response company Deepwatch closed a $180 million round from a handful of investors including Vista Credit Partners — Vista Equity Partners’ credit arm.
France-based crypto hardware maker Ledger added another $108 million to its previously announced $380 million Series C from June 2021. Investors for the new round include Molten Ventures, 10T, Cité Gestion Private Bank and Morgan Creek.

Some of those extremely large rounds likely helped keep last quarter’s dollar value high even as deal flow continued to drop.
In fact, deal flow has dropped for the past four consecutive quarters in cybersecurity.
Interestingly, the past quarter also failed to mint any new unicorns in the security space — per Crunchbase data — compared to eight being crowned in the first quarter last year.
Looking ahead
While the numbers may look down, it is important to remember that 2021 — and even to some extent 2022 — were anomalies when it comes to fundraising. While investors started to pull venture dollars back last year, the first half of the year still saw big numbers due to the delay in announcing rounds after they closed.
If this year continues the pace of the first quarter, it will surpass 2020 — which saw less than $10 billion go to cyber startups — in total dollars raised.
However, that is not to paint a bright picture of what is going on in cyber, which likely will face its fair share of headwinds.
First, companies have rolled back on spending, which even includes their cybersecurity spending in some cases. While ransomware attacks and hacks continue to be in the news — and companies spend on security — as the economy gets tighter it is logical that all IT budgets will start to get sliced.
The industry will also likely be impacted by geopolitical forces. Israel has proved to be an extremely fertile ground for cyber startups — spawning companies such as Check Point, Snyk, Wiz and countless others. The current political tensions there could hurt venture investment (as we talked about here) in the country, and that could disproportionately affect cybersecurity due to the robust security program in that country.
However, some large public cybersecurity companies have started to see their stock turn upward in the market, which could help out the startup ecosystem. Companies like Zscaler, Splunk and Okta — whose stock prices were down 30% or more in the last year — have seen their shares rise in the past six months. Cyber giant Palo Alto Networks also saw a nice pop in the last half year.
That could improve the quiet M&A scene, which usually excites investors. Those large companies may be more willing to do stock deals if their share prices continue to increase — as no company likes to offer shares when they are discounted.
Seeing successful exits of startups through M&A deals could cause VCs to again open up those checkbooks for more and larger rounds.
Methodology
Cybersecurity is defined by the industries of network security, cloud security and cybersecurity, according to Crunchbase data. Most announced rounds are represented in the database; however, there could be a small time lag for rounds reported late in the quarter.

"Post ‘SaaSacre,’ The Clouds Part For AI, According To The Bessemer Cloud Report",Gené Teare,2023/04/12,"

In the few short months since the launch of large language models by ChatGPT in November, artificial intelligence is set to revolutionize the tech sector according to the latest Bessemer Cloud report.
“Every single category of SaaS software is going to be changed in a meaningful way by this technology,” said Kent Bennett, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, in a conversation with Crunchbase News.
“In a survey of our entire Bessemer investment team, 96% of our investors see portfolio companies with AI-driven features on the roadmap,” according to the report. The team ranked tools for sales, HR, legal and infrastructure as areas impacted by AI as well as supply chain software.

The competition between centralized platforms like OpenAI and Anthropic, alongside decentralized or open-source models from the likes of Stability AI, make these technology models accessible and cheaper to deploy.

Public cloud
In the meantime, public cloud companies have not recovered from the downturn. “We’ve sort of bumped along,” said Bennett.
Kent Bennett, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners
A year ago the Bessemer Cloud report valued public cloud companies at $1.6 trillion, down 40% from the prior year. Public cloud companies are valued at $1.3 trillion as of this month, shaving a further $300 billion in market value in the past 12 months.
It has not helped that zero cloud companies went public in 2022, according to the report.
Private cloud
However, the number of private cloud companies with $100 million in revenue is expanding.
In 2019 that count was 35. It grew to 60 in 2021. For 2022, around 50 new companies reached $100 million in revenue, below the 70 projected a year earlier, but still the second-highest count in the past four years.
“The SaaS companies themselves have actually not stumbled in a huge way,” said Bennett on “Centaur” businesses that are scaling $100 million and beyond in ARR.

The firm’s guidance on startups fundraising is not to wait. Raise before it’s needed and test the waters. “As we often say, the best time to fundraise is when you do not need the money,” said BVP in the report.
A final note
And a final prediction from the report. Companies leading in AI will reach a billion in revenue 50% faster than cloud companies did.

"Y Combinator’s Most Recent Winter 2023 Batch Shows A Shift To AI, DevTools And B2B",Gené Teare,2023/04/12,"

In the current downturn, the most recent batch out of Y Combinator signals a shift to B2B and DevTools as AI dominates the conversation.
From the companies launched at demo day on April 5th and 6th we find smatterings of LLM, coding assistants, data entry help, data pipeline management, customer service automation, text to voice, video generation and more. Many of these tools are targeting businesses that would benefit from task automation.

Sectors that lost out are consumer, which is down from 13% to 5% of companies when comparing the winter 2022 batch to 2023; fintech from 24% to 12%; and health care from 11% to 7%.
Verticals below 5% are climate and energy, proptech, aerospace and education. These sectors were flat or down year over year, with education not even reaching 1% of startups in this past batch.


We tracked all the companies with funding here for Pro users to export. This list also includes the 70+ companies tagged with AI in Crunchbase.
Also worth noting is the geographic shift for the new cohort. For this batch, a higher proportion (80%) hailed from the U.S. and Canada. For winter 2022 around 50%  were based outside of the U.S.

Most Active US Investors: Andreessen Horowitz Leads The Way In Slow March,Chris Metinko,2023/04/12,"

This is a monthly feature that runs down the most active investors in U.S.-based companies, looks at some of their most interesting investments, and includes some odds and ends of who spent what. Check out February’s feature here.
The changes in venture from just 12 months ago are becoming more pronounced.
In March of last year, five different venture firms participated in 20 or more funding rounds.
Last month, only two venture firms took part in at least 10 rounds.

That is not necessarily surprising since it was March 2022 when many in venture were coming to the reality that a significant slowdown was well underway. Nevertheless, it is still interesting to look at some of the numbers from big-name investors.
In March 2022, Tiger Global participated in 19 rounds. New York-based Insight Partners participated in 17 rounds in that same month. Similarly, Lightspeed Venture Partners took part in 13 deals. However, last month each of those firms participated in only three rounds apiece.
But for now, let’s focus on those who invested in the most rounds for the month of March.
Andreessen Horowitz, 12 deals
Andreessen Horowitz is not new to the list. The Menlo Park, California-based investments giant makes the cut here more often than not. Its one dozen deals is good enough for third place in March.
While the firm’s investments always run the gamut from fintech to crypto to enterprise software, this month it’s a consumer-facing startup that caught our attention. Andreessen led a $5.7 million seed round for San Francisco-based Zarta.
Zarta is an ad-free, micro pay-per-view video platform for creator content. The platform allows creators to get paid for their videos, while users can pay as little as 10 cents to watch, with no subscription and no commitment.
Everyone is balancing a lot of subscription services nowadays. Maybe pay-as-you watch will catch on — although that plan does not appear to be on Netflix’s or Hulu’s radar.
Techstars, 10 deals
Techstars is the last firm to have at least made it to double-digit rounds last month.
Included in those deals was participating in a $120,000 seed round for Chicago-based LifeWeb 360. LifeWeb 360 creates digital spaces to honor a person’s late loved ones.
The idea is simple. A person can create a free LifeWeb for another person, then invite others to join and share special memories and remembrances of the person. The startup then gathers all the “Life Threads” together and creates a mosaic about the person’s life.
For all the bad on the internet, there is some good.
Also notable:

Gaingels came in next on the list with seven deals, while Y Combinator, SVA and Sequoia Capital followed with six deals each.
The top four firms on the above list also led or co-led the most rounds. Techstars, Sequoia Capital and Google Ventures tied for fourth place, as the trio led or co-led four rounds apiece.
All the firms that were credited with leading or co-leading Stripe’s huge $6.5 billion round — General Catalyst, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, MSD Partners, Founders Fund and Baille Gifford — came in at the top of the list for rounds led or co-led totaling the most dollar amounts for March.

Startup AlphaSense Snags $100M As AI Stays Hot; Alphabet’s CapitalG Invests,Chris Metinko,2023/04/11,"

At this point one needs an AI platform to keep track of all the big money AI startups have raised.
AlphaSense became the latest AI-enhanced startup to lock up big money, as it raised another $100 million from investors that included CapitalG — Alphabet’s independent growth fund. Other investors include the growth equity business within Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Viking Global Investors.

The new money values the company at $1.8 billion.
The cash is in addition to the $225 million Series D that valued the company at $1.7 billion last June.
The New York-based startup has created a market intelligence and search platform — powered by AI and natural language processing — to help clients form corporate and investment strategies.
Google and AI
Although CapitalG is an independent growth fund under Alphabet’s umbrella, Google and its parent have certainly shown significant interest in the AI space. In February, Google introduced its conversational AI tool Bard, which it plans to integrate into many of its products including its dominant search engine.
Earlier this year, Google also invested between $300 million and $400 million into San Francisco-based Anthropic, a ChatGPT rival.
AI frenzy
Of course, that is far from the only AI-powered company to raise big money, as VCs and large strategics including Microsoft, Google and Salesforce 1 all continue to show unabated interest in generative AI startups.
Just last month, Character.ai closed a $150 million Series A at a $1 billion valuation led by Andreessen Horowitz. The Palo Alto, California-based AI startup allows people to create their own personalized AI chatbot using language models and deep-learning algorithms.
Also in March, San Francisco-based Adept AI raised $350 million in a Series B — at a reported post-money valuation of at least $1 billion.
Anthropic was reported to be raising another $300 million round at a pre-investment valuation of $4.1 billion. Spark Capital is reportedly leading the round.
Of course the craze started in January with news of Microsoft’s massive $10 billion investment into OpenAI — creator of ChatGPT.
There are sure to be more.

"European VC Funding Drops 66% As Seed Takes A Hit, US Investors Pull Back",Keerthi Vedantam,2023/04/11,"

This year is off to a bleak start for the startup ecosystem in Europe.
Startups raised $10.6 billion in funding, down 18% quarter over quarter and a whopping 66% year over year, per Crunchbase data, as American investors pulled back.
Europe’s funding downturn is on par with most of the world. Global funding was down 53% year over year, per Crunchbase data, a sign that the tech industry is still reeling from 2022’s high interest rates and broader economic uncertainty.

But we’re starting to see the long-term effects of this uncertainty. European seed funding saw a dramatic 25% collapse last quarter — a signal that VCs aren’t confident in making long-term commitments right now. While late-stage startups experienced the worst funding pullback year over year, early-stage funding performed the best of the three stages (though funding was still down 7%).


Europe is still adjusting to a new funding ecosystem — one that will have to depend less on foreign investments. As a result, deal counts are the lowest they’ve ever been in a three-year period, and companies are incubating strategies to put themselves in the U.S. market.

American VC pullback
When venture funding peaked in 2021, many of the U.S.’ most prominent venture firms looked across the pond for deals.
Francois Veron, managing partner at the France-based venture firm Newfund, estimates around 40% of startup funding in France in 2022 was fueled by venture capital agencies in the U.S. In Q1 2023, that number is likely only 5%, he estimates.
“There is a sense of going back to normal, but actually that will pinch the industry very much,” Veron said. “When you invest in startups, that means that these startups will ask for more money two years after their funding.”
Indeed, European startup funding overall is approaching pre-pandemic levels. Not only are deal counts the lowest they’ve been in a three-year period, Europe’s $10.6 billion in funding is the lowest the continent has seen since Q1 2020, when the region garnered $9.9 billion.
Late-stage funding is no longer first priority
Europe’s early-stage startups have eclipsed late-stage companies in funding — the first time since Q4 2020 — by $600 million.


That’s an interesting point, since late-stage startups have long consumed the majority of venture dollars due to how capital intensive such large startups tend to be.
Late-stage funding has taken quite the beating these last few quarters. Funding in Q1 amounted to $4.3 billion, down 77% year over year in part because pandemic-era inflation put company valuations in a tough spot.
While several big startups such as Klarna and Stripe have incrementally slashed valuations dramatically, it’s still too hard to tell how much these companies are actually worth. That, coupled with fears of conducting a down round, has put funding in this space at a standstill.
Pullback hits seed stage
The seismic impact of the funding pullback has managed to ripple to seed-stage startups, which saw the biggest quarter-over-quarter hit. Funding dropped 25% quarter over quarter and deal count dropped 28% in the same time period.


The seed-stage hit could be read as a sign of worsening investor confidence, with venture firms prioritizing portfolio companies that may need new funding down the line over new investments (however small they may be).
Early-stage companies: the last beacon of stability
Early-stage startups have seen very little fluctuation quarter over quarter — between Q4 2022 and Q1 2023, funding dropped only 7%. That’s a good indication venture firms are heavily prioritizing investment in their existing companies that are perhaps too early stage to have made any revenue yet.


But as they grow, they’re likely to encounter some of the problems late-stage startups see in private market funding. Many are looking West to change that. Veron said VCs are advising their startups to accelerate go-to-market strategies in the U.S., where venture funding is more abundant.
“We’re not just advising [our startups],” Veron said. “We are also continuing our strategy of building a presence in the U.S. and building a network to help our companies scale.”
Methodology
The data contained in this report comes directly from Crunchbase, and is based on reported data. Data reported is as of April 3, 2023.
Note that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarter/year.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.
Glossary of funding terms
We have made a change to how we include corporate funding rounds in our reporting as of January 2023. Corporate rounds are only included if a company has raised an equity funding at seed through a venture series funding round.
Seed and angel consists of seed, pre-seed and angel rounds. Crunchbase also includes venture rounds of unknown series, equity crowdfunding and convertible notes at $3 million (USD or as-converted USD equivalent) or less.
Early-stage consists of Series A and Series B rounds, as well as other round types. Crunchbase includes venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $3 million, and those less than or equal to $15 million.
Late-stage consists of Series C, Series D, Series E and later-lettered venture rounds following the “Series [Letter]” naming convention. Also included are venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $15 million.
Technology growth is a private-equity round raised by a company that has previously raised a “venture” round. (So basically, any round from the previously defined stages.)

"
Mass Tech Layoffs Means Loss Of Diversity And Inclusivity In The Workforce,Guest Author,2023/04/11,"

By Kamales Lardi
The technology industry is facing a crossroads. Despite being one of the most innovative sectors in the world, technology companies are announcing plans for broad cost-cutting measures through layoffs.
Recently, tech giant Microsoft announced it will cut approximately 10,000 jobs. Microsoft is among a slew of tech companies that have announced mass layoffs since the end of 2022, including Salesforce 1, Amazon and Meta, among others. Tech layoffs represent an alarming trend in terms of their disproportionate impact on women and minorities who are already underrepresented in many tech firms’ workforces and could have far-reaching consequences, both now and in the future.

When staff layoffs are executed, considerations around diversity are often not prioritized. Essentially, the most affected by such layoffs tend to be the most vulnerable groups — women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ individuals — as they often lack seniority or other forms of job protection compared to their majority counterparts. This means that even if companies strive to make their workforces more diverse, they may end up backsliding when they have to make cuts due to economic downturns or other reasons.
Kamales Lardi, CEO of Lardi & Partner Consulting.
Technology solutions are more powerful and meaningful when developed by a variety of diverse individuals.
Without that diversity, the resulting solutions could be limited in their appeal or unwittingly biased toward one single uniform group. My reference to diversity goes beyond gender and includes a diversity of thought that is represented by different genders, cultures, upbringing, sexual orientations and educational backgrounds. Typically in tech companies, the people who struggle to move up or get recognized are these minority groups, and these are the people who typically get cut first.
Generational changes
There are several layers to this topic that create a systemic problem around diversity and inclusion in the tech industry. In my opinion, most of the barriers center around mindset and perception. Controversially, the perception that diversity is not critical for technology development or that men are better skilled in this space still seems prevalent. The next generation of people, the millennials, Gen Zs, and Alphas are prioritizing meaningful work, diversity and sustainable practices.
This is translating heavily into the tech community, as people are increasingly demanding that companies be responsible and represent the values that are important to them. This direction will play a role in holding a mirror up to tech companies, forcing them to not only improve their practices but also drive change across the industry.
Companies should take steps to minimize the impact of layoffs on their workforce’s diversity and inclusivity by engaging with vulnerable populations and providing resources to help them advance professionally. This will help them weather any storms and ensure a more equitable working environment for all employees.

Kamales Lardi is CEO of Lardi & Partner Consulting where she has advised many multinational companies across various industries in Europe, Asia and Africa for over a decade. She is also a Teaching Fellow at Durham University Business School, and is the chair of the Forbes Business Council Women Executives.

"Warren, AOC Seek Details About SVB’s Relationship With Clients, Investors",Chris Metinko,2023/04/10,"

Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York sent letters to a handful of depositors with Silicon Valley Bank seeking details about their relationship with the failed bank.
The letters — sent out Sunday — went to 14 of the bank’s biggest depositors. Among other issues, they seek answers on how long the firms banked with SVB, why they decided to keep their deposits there and what other “benefits” — such as low-interest mortgages — board members and executives may have received from the bank.

“In particular, we are interested in reports describing SVB’s ‘coddling’ and ‘white glove’ treatment of some of its largest venture capitalist (VC) depositors, their executives, and the founders of the tech startup companies they back, and the extent to which ‘SVB’s willingness to pull out ‘all sorts of bells and whistles’ for VCs and founders was one of the key ways it differentiated itself,’” the letter reads.
The letter also states that it is part of an effort “to understand the mutual backscratching dynamic that resulted in favorable treatment for VCs and startups, and massive, uninsured deposits into SVB,” and asks for answers to its questions by April 24.
The letters
The 14 firms that received letters are Circle, bill, BlockFi, Eiger, Ginkgo Bioworks, iRhythm Technologies, Lending Club, Oncorus, Payoneer Global, Protagonist Therapeutics, Roblox, Rocket Lab, Roku and Sangamo Therapeutics.
Both Warren and Ocasio-Cortez have been critical of the bank and its executives since the collapse.
Late last month, First Citizens BancShares agreed to buy $72 billion worth of assets of the failed Silicon Valley Bank.
SVB’s collapse was the biggest US bank failure in more than a decade. SVB was the dominant bank for tech startups and venture debt in the U.S., cultivating a reputation for close-knit relationships with the power brokers of venture and taking chances on young startups that most banks wouldn’t have the time of day for.

"A16Z, General Catalyst Top Ranks Of Active Lead Investors",Joanna Glasner,2023/04/10,"

The ranks of the most active global venture investors are getting shaken up in 2023.
For the first quarter of this year, Andreessen Horowitz and General Catalyst ranked at the top of our list of the most active and spendiest lead venture investors. However, their leading roles come at a time when the cast of deep-pocketed startup backers is shrinking some.
In particular, the investors who used to reliably top the list — Tiger Global Management and SoftBank Vision Fund — are taking a breather. The two didn’t even crack the Top 20 in Q1.
It’s the latest indication that times have changed in the VC world. We’re seeing muted activity at seed and early stage, and fewer big late-stage rounds amid a lackluster IPO market.
Even so, deal flow hasn’t dried up. While many of the busiest investors in Q1 are mostly backing fewer rounds than they did a year ago, several have actually picked up the pace. Below, we look at the 10 most active lead or co-lead venture investors in Q1:


Notably, about half the active lead investors have slowed dealmaking compared to bubblier days a year ago. This includes Andreessen, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Sequoia Capital India.
Others are actually leading more deals than they did a year ago. This group includes General Catalyst, Google Ventures and Altos Ventures.

Spendiest investors
Next, we tallied up the largest rounds and their lead backers to get a sense 1 of which investors put the most capital to work in the first quarter.
As it turns out, our findings were highly skewed because there were two unusual and enormous financings that dwarfed every other Q1 deal in size. These were the reported $10 billion investment into OpenAI — largely from Microsoft — and a $6.5 billion round for payments giant Stripe.
All of the seven top investors in our list of those who led or co-led the most capital-intensive batch of financings last quarter, shown below, were Microsoft or Stripe backers:


Co-lead investors for the $6.5 billion Stripe financing announced in March include Andreessen, General Catalyst, MSD Partners, Thrive Capital, Founders Fund and Baillie Gifford. Microsoft, meanwhile, is the only listed investor for OpenAI’s mega-financing.
As you can see from the chart above, there’s a huge gap between the Microsoft and Stripe backers and everyone else. The next-highest names on the priciest lead round list — Greenoaks and Spark Capital — led rounds valued in aggregate at less than a fifth that of the Stripe backers.
Most active seed investors
While we saw some dramatic shifts in the ranks of most active and highest-spending venture investors, seed stage was a bit more stable.
Last year’s two most prolific seed investors — Y Combinator and Techstars — still topped the list in Q1. We also saw mostly familiar names round out the ranks of the top eight most active seed-stage investors, shown below:


It’s not surprising to see seed investors staying active even as overall funding contracts. For investors at this stage, the state of the IPO market or public tech valuations aren’t an immediate concern, as their portfolio companies are likely a long way from exit.
Still, a majority of the most active seed investors for Q1 reported lower deal counts compared to a year ago. The pullback is part of a broader reduction in global seed-stage investment, which fell 44% year over year in Q1, per Crunchbase data.
Down, but not out
The broad takeaway from our latest most active investor data dive is that overall venture and seed firms are putting less capital to work in fewer deals.
It’s also probably prudent not to put an overly optimistic spin on the two giant rounds of the quarter for Stripe and OpenAI. The Stripe investment, after all, was at a down valuation, and OpenAI, a capped profit company governed by a nonprofit, was not a traditional venture round.
The more measured take on Q1 is that this looks like a continued pullback, but not a collapse. Big rounds are still closing, and while some big names have dropped from the ranks of high-spending investors, other startup backers are keeping active.

The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: HeartFlow And Cybereason Lead Another Down Week,Chris Metinko,2023/04/7,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.
For the third week in a row, rounds were down noticeably in the U.S. Only two rounds hit nine figures — one in the health care AI sector and one to a company that has been in the news recently for layoffs and a possible sale. We wondered last week if this may have been an effect of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse, but perhaps there are more forces at play.

1. HeartFlow, $215M, health care: The use of AI for health diagnostics is front and center in the largest funding this past week to a heart precision care technology startup. The Mountain View, California-based company raised a $215 million Series F led by Bain Capital Life Sciences. Its noninvasive technology provides a 3D model to analyze the risk of a heart attack. The technology has been used so far by 180,000 patients across 725 hospital systems globally. Founded in 2010, HeartFlow has raised about $793 million, according to Crunchbase data. 
2. Cybereason, $100M, cybersecurity: Times seem to have changed for Cybereason. The Boston-based startup raised a $100 million investment led by SoftBank, but also along with it announced a CEO change. Executive Vice President of SoftBank Eric Gan will now serve as the company’s CEO, with Lior Div, current CEO and co-founder, transitioning to the role of adviser. The news comes after reports in October that the company hired JPMorgan Chase & Co. to find a buyer for the company. It has been reported the company has had two rounds of layoffs, cutting 100 jobs in June and then another 200 in October. Just more than a year ago the company confidentially filed for an initial public offering that would have valued it at more than $5 billion, Reuters reported at the time. In July 2021, the startup announced it had raised $275 million in a financing led by Liberty Strategic Capital, the fund started by former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. No valuation was given by the company, but reports at the time in both the Globes newspaper in Israel and The Boston Globe said the round valued the company at about $3.1 billion. Cybereason is one of the best-funded startups in cybersecurity, with more than $800 million raised, per Crunchbase data. Now the question is: What will investors get for all that money?
3. Covariant, $75M, robotics: It’s one thing to have robots, it’s another thing to know how to train them or tell them exactly what to do. Emeryville, California-based Covariant added an additional $75 million to its Series C — previously $80 million — to do just that. The round was co-led by returning investors Radical Ventures and Index Ventures. The startup’s “Covariant Brain” is a robotics platform that enables robots to interact with and learn from their environments. The platform can be used by retailers and logistics providers for warehouse work. Founded in 2017, Covariant has now raised $222 million, per the company.
4. (tied) Everstream Analytics, $50M, logistics: Thanks to the pandemic and the snarled supply chain it caused, logistic startups saw a flood of funding in 2021, with over $21 billion invested into the space, according to Crunchbase data. That funding cooled last year, with around $11 billion invested, a 48% drop year over year. That, however, did not stop San Marcos, California-based supply chain startup Everstream Analytics from raising a $50 million Series B funding co-led by StepStone Group and Morgan Stanley Investment Management. The company, which was founded in 2012, provides risk performance insights in the world of logistics. It works with the various touchpoints of the supply chain system to improve efficiency. The startup has now raised $79 million, per Crunchbase.
4. (tied) Honeycomb, $50M, developer tools: Engineers depend more and more on observability tools to understand what goes wrong as the cloud environment gets more complex. That likely helped San Francisco-based Honeycomb lock up a $50 million Series D led by Headline this week. The startup has doubled its revenue — and headcount — in the past year, as engineering teams continuously seek data on how users are using applications in real time. Founded in 2016, Honeycomb says it has raised $150 million to date.
6. Mercy BioAnalytics, $41M, biotech: The promise of early diagnosis of cancer will always bring out investors, and this week Natick, Massachusetts-based Mercy BioAnalytics closed a $41 million Series A led by Novalis LifeSciences. The new cash will be used to further develop its Mercy Halo test for high-risk lung cancer screening. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death globally — and more than 350 Americans die from lung cancer daily, per the company’s release. The company also hopes to advance clinical programs to detect ovarian cancer. Founded in 2018, the company has raised more than $68 million, according to Crunchbase data.
7. Phlow, $35M, health care: Richmond, Virginia-based Phlow is a public benefit corporation that manufactures affordable medicines using advanced technology. It raised a Series B funding from strategic partners. The company partners with hospitals, industry and the government to provide needed medicines in the U.S. Founded in 2020, the company has raised a little over $80 million, per Crunchbase.
8. Richmond National Group, $30M, insurance: Richmond, Virginia-based Richmond National Group, a property, casualty and professional liability insurance company, raised more than $30 million from existing shareholders including HF Capital and Bonhill Capital. Founded in 2021, Richmond National has now raised  more than $100 million, per the company.
9. Oxos Medical, $23M, medical devices: Atlanta-based Oxos Medical, a developer of digital imaging devices, closed a $23 million Series A from Parkway Venture Capital and Intel Capital. Founded in 2016, Oxos has raised a total of $45 million, per the company.
10. (tied) Strivacity, $20M, cybersecurity: Herndon, Virginia-based cybersecurity startup Strivacity raised $20 million in a Series A2 led by SignalFire. Founded in 2019, the company has raised more than $30 million, according to Crunchbase.
10. (tied) Vytelle, $20M, agtech: Lenexa, Kansas-based Vytelle, a startup that helps cattle producers optimize their herds, raised a $20 million Series B led by Forage Capital Partners. Founded in 2015, the company has raised more than $33 million, per Crunchbase.
Big global deals
With rounds being down in the U.S., there were several larger raises abroad, including two large deals.

India-based DMI Finance, a nonbanking financial company that offers consumer loans, home loans and asset management, raised a $400 million venture round.
China-based SJ Semi, a foundry that implements front-end wafer manufacturing, closed a $340 million Series C.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of April 1 to 7. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

"Asia Venture Funding Drops 57% Year Over Year, With Late Stage Posting Largest Decline",Chris Metinko,2023/04/7,"

Venture funding in Asia got off to a brutal start in 2023, declining 33% from the previous quarter and a massive 57% from the first quarter of last year.

Total venture funding in the region fell to $15.2 billion — the lowest in at least the past three years, Crunchbase data shows. A year ago, first-quarter funding in Asia hit $35.5 billion and was $22.4 billion in Q4 2022.


Just as dollar figures plummeted, so did deal flow. The first quarter saw only 1,358 funding deals, a 5% drop from Q4, and a huge 42% dip from a year ago when 2,329 deals were announced.

Late stage and growth declines again
The biggest drop among all rounds year to year was in late-stage and growth rounds — both in terms of dollars and percentage.
Late-stage and growth rounds only saw $7 billion in investment — a 64% drop from Q1 2022, which saw $19.7 billion, Crunchbase data shows.


Those big rounds also declined quarter to quarter, dropping 29% from the $9.9 billion Q4 of last year realized.
The numbers of those big late rounds also dipped to 148 announced deals — dropping almost 50% from the 289 deals in Q1 2022 and 29% from Q4.
The drop is not unexpected. When investors started to pull back in the market early last year, late-stage growth rounds were the first affected, as VCs shied away from the high valuations.
It also is very likely that these late rounds will be the last to come back when the market strengthens again.
Despite the drop, the first quarter did see some large, noteworthy rounds:

China-based Zeekr, which develops and manufactures electric vehicles, raised a $750 million Series A.
Lenskart, an online shopping portal that sells eyewear, landed a $500 million venture round.
Hong Kong-based EcoCeres, which develops decarbonization solutions, raised a $400 million private equity round.
China-based JD Industry, an industrial maintenance, repair and operations firm, raised a $300 million Series B.

Early stage continues to soften
Early-stage rounds did not fare much better last quarter in terms of dollars. The first quarter saw $6.7 billion invested in 487 deals — the lowest dollar figure since Q3 2020.
The numbers also represent a steep decline from recent quarters, including a 50% drop from the $13.4 billion early-stage rounds raised in Q1 2022 and a 38% fall from the $10.8 billion such rounds saw in Q4 2022.


Early-stage deal flow, however, was pretty stagnant from Q4 2022 — meaning those early rounds in the last quarter were less valuable than early-stage Q4 rounds.
Seed and angel rounds weaken
While seed and angel rounds will not move the needle much in dollar amounts, even those extremely early rounds were down both quarter to quarter and year to year.
The first quarter this year saw only $1.4 billion raised in 723 rounds. That is a 41% drop from the $2.4 billion raised in Q1 2022 and a 30% decline in deal flow from that quarter.


Those first-quarter numbers also represent a 23% fall in total dollar amount from Q4 2022 and is the lowest dollar amount since Q2 2021.
What happened where?
No surprisingly, the biggest decrease in terms of dollars occurred in the region’s largest venture markets: China and India.
China saw venture funding drop to $8.1 billion — essentially, a 38% drop both year to year and quarter to quarter.


India, on the other hand, saw its venture funding drop 75% from first-quarter 2022. The country saw only $2.4 billion in venture dollars, down from $9.8 billion in Q1 2022 and down nearly 25% from $3.2 billion in Q4.
Other countries that saw notable declines year to year include Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea.
Israel, a tech hub in the region known for fintech and cybersecurity, saw a massive 65% drop from Q1 2022, drawing only about $1 billion in Q1 of this year.
What it means
Asia’s venture market is not as mature as North America’s, so it is unlikely the region would lead any type of recovery.
Add into that the fact tensions between the U.S. and China are at an all-time high — especially as China becomes closer with Russia after the invasion of Ukraine — and the region’s largest country still seems to be struggling to emerge from the pandemic, and it is not shocking Asia’s private market is reeling.
There also is political upheaval in Israel, which is unlikely to create more investor confidence.
That said, there have been positive signs for the economy in the region of late. Alibaba’s announcement of its split up and likely public float of its units seemed to please investors — as many saw it as a sign that the Chinese government could be relaxing its scrutiny of the technology sector that began in 2020 and erased more than a combined $1 trillion from the country’s largest companies.
Other Chinese companies such as JD.com also have shown interest in possibly going public.
If the Chinese tech market picks up — and foreign investors flock back — the region’s numbers could start to go in the other direction.
However, that is no sure thing.
Methodology
The data contained in this report comes directly from Crunchbase, and is based on reported data. Data reported is as of April 3, 2023.
Note that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarter/year.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.
Glossary of funding terms
We have made a change to how we include corporate funding rounds in our reporting as of January 2023. Corporate rounds are only included if a company has raised an equity funding at seed through a venture series funding round.
Seed and angel consists of seed, pre-seed and angel rounds. Crunchbase also includes venture rounds of unknown series, equity crowdfunding and convertible notes at $3 million (USD or as-converted USD equivalent) or less.
Early stage consists of Series A and Series B rounds, as well as other round types. Crunchbase includes venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $3 million, and those less than or equal to $15 million.
Late stage consists of Series C, Series D, Series E and later-lettered venture rounds following the “Series [Letter]” naming convention. Also included are venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $15 million.
Technology growth is a private-equity round raised by a company that has previously raised a “venture” round. (So basically, any round from the previously defined stages.)

"
Tiger Global Was Looking To Offload VC Fund Stakes,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/04/6,"

It looks like one of the most prolific investors in tech is feeling less confident about its pandemic-era investments. 
Tiger Global Management has been working with banks to sell off VC fund investments in the secondary market, The Information reported. It’s unclear what stakes the firm tried to sell, or if it was successful.
Tiger Global was an incredibly active investor in the tech ecosystem during the pandemic-era funding boom, and it also contributed investments to several VC firms during this time period. According to Crunchbase data, the firm invested in 139 startups in the first quarter of 2022 alone. 

But following a dramatic dip in the stock market in 2022, and its ripples in the private market, Tiger Global reported in fundraising documents that its portfolio companies slashed their valuations by billions. Tiger Global, one of the largest investors in tech at the time, quickly stopped its investment streak. Per Crunchbase data, the company only invested in 45 startups in the latter half of 2022. 
A bleak private market ahead?
It’s a clear sign that Tiger Global, and perhaps the venture community at large, isn’t confident in a market bounce back anytime soon. Tiger Global was one of the first wealth management companies to pull back from dealmaking back in February 2022. Indeed, global venture funding continues to slow down in Q1 2023, save for the tech world’s recent obsession with generative artificial intelligence.
But it looks like things are looking up for the company, albeit only slightly. Tiger Global’s hedge fund posted 7.3% gains in the first quarter of 2023, according to Bloomberg. The firm’s fund dropped 56% and its long-only fund dropped 67% between 2021 and 2022 (to recoup losses, each fund would need to see a gain of 144% and 216% respectively).

"
Why Do Health Care Startups Have The Same Names As My Human Friends?,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/04/6,"

In my notes app, sandwiched between a brainstorm of ice cream ideas and instructions from my physical therapist, is a list of names I began keeping since I started covering health care: Maven, Renee, Ruth, Alma, Lyra, Paige, Olive, Sami.
The original goal was to collect companies that share names with my friends. But it quickly grew beyond that.
It’s a peculiar pattern I’m seeing in health care startup names. Many of these companies share plenty of similarities: they started between 2014 and 2021. Many of them work in niche parts of the health care system, like fertility or postpartum care.

I almost wonder if this naming strategy by so many health care startups is aimed at making those companies seem more approachable to younger people trying to navigate the health system — people who want tech-enabled care, who have experience with bias or discrimination in the health care system, or who are tired of navigating disparate, siloed entities to be treated.
I talked to Oliver Ralph, who was part of the founding team at branding agency Character, which was later sold to Dentsu Aegis Network in 2018. In 12 years, Ralph worked with companies as big as Facebook, as well as health care companies such as One Medical, Carbon Health and Ōura. He was also involved in naming Care/of, a consumer health brand.
“Many health startups have human names because they’re often focused on providing personalized and human-centered health care solutions,” Ralph said. “They are establishing a more personal and relatable brand. I think with larger health care companies, the experience can often be so impersonal.”
‘Hey, Renee’
I’ve talked to a few startups about this. Postpartum care startup Ruth Health was named, in part, after the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg.
“On the eve of RBG’s death, Alison and I called each other in tears. She said to me, ‘We will now forever be Ruth-less,’” cofounder Audrey Wu said in an email. “That was the ‘aha’ moment where we decided to name our company Ruth — in her honor and to continue carrying out the incredible work she has done for women.”
Maven means “expert” — a nod to Maven Clinic’s telehealth platform niche in fertility care.
When I was a reporter at dot.LA, I talked to Dr. Renee Dua, cofounder of the elder care startup Renee (formerly known as HeyRenee). The company specializes in personal health care for older patients who want to remain independent.
“I want to really focus on that patient experience. And honestly, that’s why we didn’t call it Some-Complicated-Name Health,” Dua said back in 2021. “That’s why we called it HeyRenee, because it should be just that personable that you feel like your daughter is taking care of you.”
Then there’s Tia, which, no, is not a name, but means “aunt” in Spanish.
“[It] symbolizes the caring and trusting relationship we want women to have with their health — akin to the relationship you might have with your aunt or an important woman in your life you can always turn to without judgment,” a spokesperson for the company said in a statement.
What’s in a name?
But what’s the deal with the emotional appeal? Ralph said branding agencies spend a lot of time talking to founders about authenticity and the reason they started the company.
“If you focus the company around functional benefits, then another company will come along that is cheaper or faster and knock you off your post,” Ralph said. “But if you have this more emotional, sticky connection with consumers, then you can retain that No. 1 top spot.”
Agencies will often brainstorm hundreds of names before putting only a handful in front of a client. There are functional aspects to choosing a name — it has to be easy to brand on a mobile app and web banner. It has to be searchable. It has to, in a way, stand the test of time. And will the company name make sense in an Asian market or a South American market?
After working with a legal firm to screen through hundreds of options, agencies often only have a handful left to present the client.
“It’s actually one of the hardest deliverables,” Ralph said. “Doing a website, doing the brand system, all the other pieces are relatively easy compared to the name.”
But the hardest part is longevity. These companies, ideally, will be around for a long time. So the name they choose has to be unique in the moment as well as remain fresh even decades later.
“At the end of the day it is about differentiation,” Ralph said. “As soon as a human name is not differentiated, then it’s time to consider a different direction.”
If any startup out there wants to hop on the naming trend while staying original, I’ve got a few more friends you can choose from.

"
North American Startup Funding Weakens Further In Q1,Joanna Glasner,2023/04/6,"

After four consecutive down quarters, North American startup investors haven’t staged a definitive comeback yet. However, first-quarter numbers do show pockets of resilience, even as the general funding climate remains constrained.
North American funding in the first quarter reached $46.3 billion — a decline of 46% from the same period last year. That’s even including a reported $10 billion investment into OpenAI — largely from Microsoft — and a $6.5 billion round for payments giant Stripe. Without those two large deals, Q1 venture funding would have been down even more dramatically, with a more than 60% decline from the same period last year.

For a sense of how the just-ended quarter compares across all stages, we charted funding totals for the past nine quarters below:


As you can see above, early-stage and seed-stage investment were both down quarter over quarter, along with reported deal counts. A frozen IPO market and wilted public tech valuations also contributed to suppressing later-stage dealmaking.


For more detail, we break funding activity down by stage below, and also take a look at exit activity, which was also on the muted side.

Seed stage
Everything starts at seed stage, so we’ll begin there too.
For Q1, reported seed-stage startup investment totaled $3 billion, the lowest quarterly tally in over two years. Overall, investment was down 9% quarter over quarter and 48% year over year.
For perspective, we chart out investment for the past five quarters below:


Even though things were down overall, we did see some companies raise big seed rounds. Examples include Descope, a developer of authentication technology that pulled in $53 million,  Plai Labs, a social platform that picked up $32 million, and Type One Energy, a fusion startup that landed $29 million.
Early stage
Early-stage investment was down too. In total, investors put $13.3 billion into deals at this stage in Q1, down 10% from the prior quarter and 53% from one year ago. Deal counts also declined.
To add some context, we chart out deal counts and funding totals for the past five quarters below:


In analyses of Series A and Series B funding trends published last month, we noted that declines are more pronounced for some sectors than others. Fintech, consumer products and Web3, in particular, are seeing less investment at the early stage.
Even with fewer big checks being cut, we did still see some big rounds. The largest funding recipients included Adept AI, a machine learning startup that raised a $350 million Series B, Our Next Energy, an energy storage company that secured $300 million in Series B financing, and Paradigm, a clinical trials platform that pulled in a $203 million Series A.
Late stage
Next up is late stage, which accounted for the majority of investment in the first quarter.
Per Crunchbase data, $30 billion went to late-stage and technology growth rounds in Q1. That’s more than double Q4 totals, but still well below year-ago levels.
For perspective, we chart out deal counts and funding totals for the past five quarters below:


A cursory look at the chart above creates the impression that late stage is getting its groove back after a couple rough quarters. However, a closer analysis of the quarter’s biggest deals challenges that narrative.
Neither of the two biggest rounds of the quarter are traditional venture rounds for hot rising stars in the startup scene. OpenAI, which reportedly received a $10 billion investment backed by Microsoft, describes itself as a “capped profit company governed by a nonprofit.” Stripe, meanwhile, closed its massive $6.5 billion Series I in March at a valuation of $50 billion — far below its $95 billion peak value.
Beyond those two deals, there were no late-stage investments that came close to cracking the billion-dollar threshold. The next-biggest investments included a $500 million Series E for human resources platform Rippling, a $500 venture round for AI and quantum computing company SandboxAQ, and a $375 million Series C for kidney disease treatment provider Monogram Health.
Exits
Things were also comparatively muted on the exit front. With the IPO environment still sluggish, we didn’t see any debuts in Q1 from companies lauded a few months ago as potential 2023 IPO candidates.
However, a few venture-backed companies did make it to market during the quarter, including:

Nextracker, a developer of solar tracker technology that is a subsidiary of contract manufacturer Flex and counts TPG Rise Climate Fund among its backers, went public in February and had a recent market cap around $4.6 billion.
Apollomics, a developer of oncology therapies, listed on Nasdaq in late March after completing a SPAC merger and recently had a market cap around $2.8 billion.
LanzaTech, a developer of carbon recycling technology, went public in February after completing a SPAC merger. Since then, shares have shed more than half their value.

On the acquisition side, meanwhile, 2023 has not been a very active year for big-ticket startup deals so far. However, we did see some good-sized M&A exits in the first quarter, including:

Mint Mobile, a prepaid wireless brand backed by actor Ryan Reynolds, sold to T-Mobile in a deal valued at up to $1.35 billion.
MarkLogic, a data integration platform, sold to software firm Progress in February for $335 million.
Power, a credit card-issuing platform, sold to fintech Marqeta in a deal valued at up to $275 million.

The big picture
So what’s the broad takeaway from our Q1 numbers? For those hoping to see a big turnaround after several quarters of declining investment, that hasn’t panned out. However, it’s clear startup investors aren’t throwing in the towel either. Big rounds are getting done, hot areas like AI remain appealing, and some exits are still happening.
Will Q2 be the big turnaround? So far, markets are off to a rocky start in April. But who knows. We’ve still got months to go, and the startup funding scene is, if nothing else, reliably unpredictable.
Methodology
The data contained in this report comes directly from Crunchbase, and is based on reported data. Data reported is as of April 3, 2023.
Note that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarter/year.

Late-stage consists of Series C, Series D, Series E and later-lettered venture rounds following the “Series [Letter]” naming convention. Also included are venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $15 million.
Technology growth is a private-equity round raised by a company that has previously raised a “venture” round. (So basically, any round from the previously defined stages.)

Cyber Unicorn Cybereason Changes CEOs Along With $100M Raise,Chris Metinko,2023/04/5,"

There seems to be a lot going on at cybersecurity unicorn Cybereason.
The Boston-based startup announced a $100 million investment led by SoftBank, along with a CEO change.
Executive Vice President of SoftBank Eric Gan will now serve as the company’s CEO — pending board and regulatory approvals — with Lior Div, current CEO and co-founder, transitioning to  the role of adviser.

The news comes after reports in October that the company hired JPMorgan Chase & Co. to find a buyer for the company. 
It has been reported the company has had two rounds of layoffs, cutting 100 jobs in June and then another 200 in October.
Big money
It was just more than a year ago that the company confidentially filed for an initial public offering that would have valued it at more than $5 billion, Reuters reported at the time.
It was less than two years ago that Cybereason was raising big money at an even bigger valuation. In July 2021, the startup announced it had raised $275 million in a financing led by Liberty Strategic Capital, the fund started by former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
No valuation was given by the company, but reports at the time in both the Globes newspaper in Israel and The Boston Globe said the round valued the company at about $3.1 billion. 
Cybereason’s platform offers a full array for protection, including endpoint detection and response and extended detection and response. XDR platforms are highly scalable and offer companies better visibility in network and application communication. XDR solutions can read and group related alerts and build timelines concerning attacks by evaluating data found on activity logs.
Threat detection and response capabilities across endpoints and the network has become even more important with so many people working from home and expanding the attack surface available to bad actors.
Cybereason is one of the best-funded startups in cybersecurity, with more than $800 million raised, per Crunchbase data.
Now the question is: What will investors get for all that money?

"Bob Lee, Beloved Tech Exec And Founder, Stabbed To Death In San Francisco",Marlize van Romburgh,2023/04/5,"

Bob Lee, a well-known tech executive and the former CTO of payments company Square, was stabbed to death in downtown San Francisco on Tuesday morning, multiple media outlets reported.
Dozens of friends and people who had met Lee, known affectionately as “Crazy Bob,” over the years expressed their grief and shock at his killing.
“I first met him in summer 2006 — he didn’t care that I was only 14 and we talked tech/geeked out about programming,” Dylan Field, CEO of design software company Figma, tweeted. “We remained connected over the years and he was an early supporter of Figma. It’s so hard to believe he is gone.”
Tech investor Michael Arrington, founder of TechCrunch and Crunchbase, said that he’d known Lee for 15 years and that his friend “was one of the best humans I’ve ever met.”

I’ve been friends with @crazybob for 15 years. He was one of the best humans I’ve ever met. I’m so glad we were able to spend time together recently. RIP. I hate what San Francisco has become. https://t.co/UH171tyx4N
— Michael Arrington 🏴‍☠️ (@arrington) April 5, 2023

Lee had been serving as chief product officer of MobileCoin, a crypto payments company, since 2021.
MobileCoin founder Joshua Goldbard said on Twitter that Lee was larger than life: “​​One of the things that made him truly special was his capacity to dream big and to summon those big crazy dreams into our world. Bob summoned the future into the present.”

3/ the thing is, Bob was so much more than a technologist. Bob was an artist.
Everywhere he went Bob breathed love into this world. He had so much deep heartfelt love.
Traveling with Bob was like seeing the world for the first time.
— Joshua Goldbard (@ThePBXGuy) April 5, 2023

Lee was originally from the San Francisco Bay Area but had recently moved to Miami, according to reports. His stay in San Francisco was only part of a brief business trip.
Previously, he had worked as an engineer at Google’s Android division, and was then hired by Square (now called Block) to develop its Android app. He went on to create Cash App (then called Square Cash) at the company, and served as the first CTO of Square.
In recent years, Lee served as an adviser and angel investor to startups. His Crunchbase profile lists multiple personal investments, including in Tile and Gather Labs.
The 43-year-old had children, enjoyed live music and traveled frequently, according to an obituary in The San Francisco Standard.
Josh McFarland, a general partner at venture firm Greylock, described Lee’s “infectious energy” — a sentiment shared by many others who recalled the founder as gregarious and generous with his time.

Back in 2017 when I was engaged in a final pivot of my last company, @crazybob offered to grab coffee and think through all the options with me.
He was a great human. As others are saying, truly a generous man with a big heart. RIP.
— Zach Tratar (@zachtratar) April 5, 2023

San Francisco police said they responded to reports of a stabbing at approximately 2:35 a.m. on Tuesday morning on Main Street near Harrison Street in San Francisco’s South of Market neighborhood. Officers found a man, later identified as Lee, suffering from apparent stab wounds. He was transferred to a local hospital, where he died of his injuries.
Concerns about rampant crime in San Francisco helped spur a successful recall election of former District Attorney Chesa Boudin last year, with Brooke Jenkins, a progressive who vowed to take a tougher stance on prosecuting criminals, taking his place. Jenkins said Wednesday that her office was seeking further information about the assailant, and no arrests had been made.

I want to extend my sincerest condolences to Mr. Lee’s family members & loved ones for his loss. We do not tolerate these horrific acts of violence in San Francisco.
At this time no arrests have been made. Anyone w/ information is asked to call @SFPD Tip Line at 1-415-575-4444. https://t.co/J7V8N4gake

"Global VC Funding Falls Dramatically Across All Stages In Rocky Q1, Despite Massive OpenAI And Stripe Deals",Gené Teare,2023/04/5,"

Venture and growth investors in private companies continued to scale back their investment pace in the first quarter of 2023, Crunchbase data shows.
Global funding in the first quarter reached $76 billion — marking a 53% decline year over year from $162 billion in the first quarter of 2022. That’s even including a reported $10 billion investment into OpenAI — largely from Microsoft — and a $6.5 billion round for payments giant Stripe. Without those two large deals, Q1 venture funding would have been down even more dramatically, close to $60 billion.
Every funding stage last quarter was down 44%-54% year over year, a clear signal that the slowdown is not confined to late-stage funding. Investors across each stage scaled back as they took time to assess new investment opportunities while guiding existing portfolio companies.

The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10 was an added shock to a weakened funding environment. The bank had more than 20,000 startup depositors with $5 million or less in revenue.
The impact was not limited to U.S. startups, either: SVB was also the bank of choice for startups around the world, sourcing funding from U.S. venture firms. Investors and founders scrambled to secure funds to meet payroll as a swath of startups faced possible closure through lack of funds.

Deep pockets
Despite the slowdown, investors in private companies still hold record amounts of dry powder, with around $580 billion as of the end of 2022, according to an estimate by James Ephrati of Lightspeed Venture Partners. This is in line with the amount of dry powder available in 2021, but investors that year were plowing the money rapidly into startups.
Despite the record funds raised by investors, they continued to deploy capital at a slower pace in first-quarter 2023. Quarter-over-quarter funding was flat, despite two of the largest fundings in these recent peak years raised this past quarter. OpenAI’s $10 billion raise in January and  Stripe’s $6.5 billion round last month make up the largest fundings to private venture-backed companies since 2019 — before the pandemic.
Deal counts have shifted downward at each stage with a more dramatic shift as of Q3 2022.


Let’s look at the particular impact of the slowdown on each funding stage, which operate with different classes of investors.
Seed
In the first quarter of 2023, seed funding totaled $6.9 billion, down 44% year over year — a signal that even at the earliest funding stages, investors are pulling back.
That’s significant because seed funding was by far the least-impacted funding stage through the 2022 reset. In the first half of 2022, seed funding increased each quarter based on a year-over-year comparison. It was only in the fourth quarter of 2022 that global seed funding amounts trended down year over year by more than 25%.
Many multistage investors pivoted away from late-stage but kept their seed practices open, informed by the 2008 crisis when some of the most critical companies — including Square, Airbnb, Uber, WhatsApp and Slack — were started during that period. That downturn, after all, coincided with two major technology trends: the growth of cloud computing and the advent of smartphones.
This time around, the promises of artificial intelligence are capturing investor attention. This tech will impact many layers of the technology landscape, with opportunities for new and established companies. AI companies that raised at seed include large language models company Fixie.ai, code platform CodiumAI and biotech MoleculeMind.


Early
Early-stage funding totaled $25.6 billion in Q1, down 54% year over year.
The year-over-year pullback in early-stage quarterly funding in 2022 started in the third quarter and has continued to decline.
Of the two funding stages which make up the bulk of early-stage funding, Series B shows a larger decline compared to Series A year over year by amounts, medians and averages.


Late and large
Late-stage funding totaled $43 billion, a dramatic fall from $93 billion in Q1 2022, but up from $34 billion in Q4.
The billions of dollars raised by OpenAI and Stripe made up 22% of all venture capital raised this past quarter, and 38% of late-stage financings.


Slowdown deepens
The reset in 2022 has deepened across all funding stages quarter over quarter and year over year — outside of the blips from a few multibillion-dollar, late-stage financings. Sectors that were down in the first quarter include e-commerce, blockchain and cryptocurrency.
But artificial intelligence remains a bright spot, with large fundings in Q1 2023. Companies tagged with AI accounted for 19% of investment dollars last quarter, with the investments in OpenAI and hundreds of millions invested in the likes of Anthropic, SandboxAQ and Adept AI, according to Crunchbase data.
The slowdown is having a variable impact on different regions. More to come in the next week on how different geographies are impacted by the big reset in venture capital.
Methodology
The data contained in this report comes directly from Crunchbase, and is based on reported data. Data reported is as of April 3, 2023.
Note that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarter/year.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.
Glossary of funding terms
We have made a change to how we include corporate funding rounds in our reporting as of January 2023. Corporate rounds are only included if a company has raised an equity funding at seed through a venture series funding round.
Seed and angel consists of seed, pre-seed and angel rounds. Crunchbase also includes venture rounds of unknown series, equity crowdfunding and convertible notes at $3 million (USD or as-converted USD equivalent) or less.
Early-stage consists of Series A and Series B rounds, as well as other round types. Crunchbase includes venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $3 million, and those less than or equal to $15 million.
Late-stage consists of Series C, Series D, Series E and later-lettered venture rounds following the “Series [Letter]” naming convention. Also included are venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $15 million.
Technology growth is a private-equity round raised by a company that has previously raised a “venture” round. (So basically, any round from the previously defined stages.)

"5 Interesting Startup Deals You May Have Missed In March: Space Sweepers, Better Tattoo Care And More AI",Chris Metinko,2023/04/5,"

This is a monthly column that runs down five interesting deals every month that may have flown under the radar. Check out last month’s entry here.
Funding may continue to slow, but investors still find the somewhat unusual to invest in.
Last month saw investors give cash infusions to everything from a startup cleaning up space to skincare products for those with ink.
A more sustainable space
It seems no matter where you put the human race, we will trash it up.
That is where Tokyo-based Astroscale comes into play. The startup — which describes itself as “space sweepers” since 2013, per its website — is looking to build long-term sustainability for space.
Astroscale is looking to offer both life extension and end-of-life services for satellites — so they don’t just float out there forever as junk — as well as active debris removal and other solutions to help mitigate the growing buildup of debris in space we keep leaving as we launch more and more things into orbit.
To help build scale, Astroscale closed a $76 million Series G last month from new investors that included Mitsubishi Electric and the Development Bank of Japan. It has now raised more than $376 million since being founded.
It’s not unusual for a spacetech startup to raise cash, it just isn’t usually one that picks up trash.
Taking care of your ink
While deciding what tattoo to get can be hard, caring for that tattoo afterward can come with its own complications.
Los Angeles-based Mad Rabbit inked a $10 million Series A — led by Lucas Brand Equity, with participation from several other investors such as Mark Cuban — to help with exactly that.
Founded in 2019, the startup creates aftercare and daily tattoo skincare products made with natural ingredients that are designed to promote healing and prevent infections.
Both skincare products and tattoos are a booming industry. Mad Rabbit’s release states 44% of the U.S. population now has at least one tattoo — doubling the rate in less than a decade.
In addition, earlier this year L’Oreal made a minority investment in digital temporary tattoo device maker Prinker Korea.
There seems to be significant investor interest in all things ink.
Telehealth goes to the dogs
Telemedicine was taking off even before the pandemic hit, as providers looked to offer all types of health services over video at home.
Issaquah, Washington-based Felix&Fido is taking that a step further with technology-enabled veterinary services. The startup is a  spinout of Pioneer Square Labs, and closed a $4 million pre-seed funding round led by PSL Ventures last month.
The company offers membership-based pet care plans, and delivers personalized pet health care through in-clinic, at-home and telemedicine services.
No more chasing your cat around the house with a carrier when it’s time to go to the vet — although good luck getting it to stay in the Zoom frame long enough for a check up.
AI is everywhere
AI is so popular, even this list can’t avoid it entirely.
Last month Perplexity AI, a conversational AI-powered search engine, raised a $25.6 million Series A led by New Enterprise Associates.
The San Francisco-based AI startup is looking to solve a problem everyone deals with — the inadequacies of searching the web. Dominated by basically one large player, when you search for something you get inundated with ads, paid spots and SEO-enhanced results.
Perplexity is looking to change that game, allowing users to type straightforward queries on its website and responds with answers generated by its own AI.
Taking on Google is a hard row to hoe — and the search giant also is in the AI game — but an AI-powered alternative could be something worth trying.
More streaming
We stream everything nowadays, so why not art?
Atlanta-based Loupe is a streaming art platform, and the startup locked up a $3 million “seed+” round led by Aliavia Ventures.
Loupe streams artists’ work to TVs, commercial offices, digital billboards and other signage while offering the artists royalties.
The company works with more than 700 artists, 50-plus channels, and has streaming relationships with all the large platforms like Amazon Fire and Apple TV.
When we think of streaming, it’s usually more “The Last Of Us,” not a contemporary art piece, but investors are clearly intrigued.

Logistics Firm Everstream Raises $50M As Funding To Sector Slows,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/04/4,"

Everstream Analytics, a supply chain analytics startup, announced on Tuesday it raised $50 million in Series B funding. The round was co-led by StepStone Group and Morgan Stanley Investment Management, with participation from existing investor Columbia Capital.
The company, which was founded in 2012, provides risk performance insights in the world of logistics. It works with the various touchpoints of the supply chain system such as shipping, weather and freight routes to improve efficiency and mitigate climate issues. 

Using predictive analytics, Everstream says it tries to help companies make game-time decisions on how to reroute its supply chains to lower its carbon footprint and operational costs while delivering goods faster. 
The California-based startup says it has helped companies achieve a maximum 30% reduction in revenue losses and 70% less time invested in managing risks. 
Logistics are losing love
Logistics were largely neglected in the venture world until the pandemic.
The rise in e-commerce habits jammed supply chains during the first two years of the pandemic, forcing investors to pay attention to new opportunities that could leverage existing technologies — the cloud, predictive analytics and AI — to improve the space. Logistics saw a flood of funding in 2021, with over $21 billion invested into the space, according to Crunchbase data. 
Then funding to logistics startups fell again in 2022 with around $11 billion invested, a 48% drop year over year. 
Project44, another logistics startup, raised $80 million in November. But it’s one of the rare raises in the space as the sector sees new entrants. 


Compliance is becoming an increasingly sticky issue in the world of logistics. Various countries have supply chain regulations that tax or ban companies that use logistics services involved in forced labor (like the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act). The European Union also expects any imports or exports to meet its carbon reporting requirements under the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive.

A16z-Backed LayerZero Labs Hits $3B Valuation After $120M Round,Chris Metinko,2023/04/4,"

Blockchain messaging protocol developer LayerZero Labs tripled its valuation to $3 billion after a $120 million Series B raise.
The round saw participation from nearly three dozen investors, including a16z crypto, Circle Ventures, OKX Ventures, OpenSea Ventures, Samsung Next and Sequoia Capital.
The Vancouver-based startup raised a $135 million Series A at a $1 billion valuation in March 2022 in a round co-led by a16z, Sequoia and the now-defunct venture arm of FTX — FTX Ventures.

LayerZero Labs is tackling the problem of interoperability among different blockchains. The company’s protocol allows for cross-chain messaging across countless blockchains.
“Imagine a future where a single user-facing application can harness the speed of Solana, the security of Ethereum, and the cheap file storage of Arweave,” said Ryan Zarick, co-founder and CTO, in a release. “This is our vision, made possible by the LayerZero protocol that seamlessly connects all blockchains and enables chain-agnostic applications to be built across various blockchains to create a best-in-class user experience.
“The days of choosing one chain to build on are over; the future is omnichain applications,” he added.
Big cash
LayerZero plans on using the new money to increase its headcount, push growth initiatives and grow its presence in the Asia-Pacific region. 
The round is one of the largest in the crypto and blockchain sector since FTX’s implosion in November. 
According to Crunchbase data, only Singapore-based Amber Group — which raised a $300 million Series C — and Germany-based Matter Labs — which closed a $200 million Series C — have seen bigger deals in the space since FTX collapsed, sending shockwaves through the crypto and blockchain ecosystem.

"The 10 Biggest Rounds Of March: Stripe Raises Huge $6.5B Round, HR-tech Startup Rippling Lands $500M",Chris Metinko,2023/04/4,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a monthly feature that runs down the month’s top 10 funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last month’s top rounds here.

Last month saw some big deals roll in, including the second-biggest of the year to date. However, the month significantly slowed — especially in terms of monster deals — as it wore on. That could well be due to Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse having at least some short-term effects on fundraising. That will be an interesting story to watch as the second quarter dawns.
1. Stripe, $6.5B, fintech: The biggest round of the month went to payments giant Stripe, but it is not the typical huge, late-stage growth round. The South San Francisco-based company raised a $6.5 billion Series I at a $50 billion valuation. The valuation is a significant drop, as the company was valued at $95 billion in March 2021, and earlier this year it was reported this round would be at a $60 billion valuation. The company will use the new cash to provide liquidity to current and former employees, and help offset a tax bill that will come due when it modifies employees’ stock grants that are set to expire (which we’ve talked about before). No lead investor was announced, but firms including Andreessen Horowitz, Founders Fund and General Catalyst participated.
2. Rippling, $500M, human resources: San Francisco-based HR management company Rippling was caught up in the collapse of SVB, its primary banking partner. It faced 50,000 employees across its customer base at risk of not getting paid as the bank fell into receivership. The company stepped in with $130 million of its own capital to support those customers. To meet payroll the following week, Parker Conrad, Rippling’s CEO, reached out to existing investor Neil Mehta at Greenoaks, to lead and close a $500 million Series E funding that valued the company at $11.25 billion, the same valuation as its May 2022 Series D funding.
3. Adept AI, $350M, artificial intelligence: Adept AI announced its $350 million raise, even in the midst of the Silicon Valley Bank news. It was reported the new financing — led by General Catalyst and Spark Capital — gives the startup a post-money valuation of at least $1 billion. Spark Capital also reportedly led Anthropic’s round the week before. Adept is developing AI models that don’t just respond to text commands — like a chatbot — but actually turn that command into action. In theory, the company’s generative AI could help users do tasks from browsing the internet to navigating enterprise software tools. The company had previously raised a $65 million Series A. Nothing seems to be able to stop generative AI startups from raising large amounts of cash.
4. Anthropic, $300M, artificial intelligence: Few companies have been busier this year than San Francisco-based AI startup and rival to ChatGPT, Anthropic. Just weeks after raising hundreds of millions of dollars from Google, it was reported the company is raising another $300 million round at a pre-investment valuation of $4.1 billion. Spark Capital is reportedly leading the round. In February,  it was reported Google had invested between $300 million and $400 million in the startup. The deal came just two weeks after news broke of Microsoft’s massive $10 billion investment into OpenAI. Anthropic’s AI chatbot, Claude, is in closed beta mode, but in a paper detailing its goals, it is expected to combat harmful prompts by explaining why they are dangerous or misguided. Before the massive fundraising this year, Anthropic — which has reportedly made limited revenue — had raised $704 million across Series A and B funding rounds in 2022, according to Crunchbase data. The Series B was led by disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.
5. Cargo Therapeutics, $200M, biotech: Biotech startups saw some big deals last month, including Cargo Therapeutics, which closed a $200 million Series A co-led by Third Rock Ventures, RTW Investments and Perceptive Xontogeny Venture Fund. The San Mateo, California-based company is developing CAR T-cell therapies for cancer. The startup is in phase 2 clinical trials for its treatment of large B-cell lymphoma. Founded in 2021, this is the biotech firm’s first outside funding, per Crunchbase.
6. Element8, $200M, telecommunications: About a quarter of the U.S. does not have home broadband internet connections — with rural and minority communities seeing even lower rates of adoption, according to the latest Pew Research Center data. Dallas-based Element8, an internet service provider, is looking to change that and raised a $200 million strategic investment from Digital Alpha to help with that effort. E8 also announced it has acquired Oklahoma City-based high-speed internet provider AtLink Services for an undisclosed sum to make it a pretty busy month. Founded in 2015, this is the company’s first outside funding, per Crunchbase.
7. Gravie, $179M, insurance: Offering good health care benefits can be tough, even for large companies, as medical and health costs continue to spiral out of control. For small and medium-sized businesses, it can be even harder since they have more limited buying power. Employer health benefits startup Gravie is looking to help that market and raised a $179 million equity investment led by General Atlantic to do just that. The Minneapolis-based company plans to use the cash infusion to grow its flagship health plan for SMBs — called Comfort — among other expansion plans. Gravie currently works with more than 1,200 companies nationwide. Founded in 2013, Gravie has raised more than $340 million, according to Crunchbase data.
8. Character.ai, $150M, artificial intelligence: Again, AI is really, really big right now. Palo Alto, California-based Character.ai is the newest unicorn in the space after closing a $150 million Series A at a $1 billion valuation led by Andreessen Horowitz. The round had been reported earlier last month. The startup allows people to create their own personalized AI chatbot using language models and deep-learning algorithms. The AI-created companions can help users draft emails, serve as a study buddy, brainstorm ideas or a variety of other activities. Character.ai joins the likes of OpenAI, Anthropic and Adept AI as startups in the AI space that have raised large rounds this year.
9. Palmetto, $150M, cleantech: Cleantech and climate tech remain big among investors. Charleston, South Carolina-based Palmetto raised $150 million from TPG Rise Climate as it looks to take advantage of the growing consumer demand for solar energy. The company’s platform helps to manage the entire residential solar process for providers — handling sales, design, engineering, permitting and fulfillment. According to the Energy Information Administration, solar capacity is expected to grow 84% through the next two years — meaning a lot more houses will be looking toward solar to help combat rising electricity bills. Founded in 2009, the company has now raised nearly $630 million, according to Crunchbase data.
10. Amogy, $139M, cleantech: Another cleantech firm ends the list for last month. Emission-free ammonia power startup Amogy closed a $139 million Series B-1 fundraising led by SK Innovation. The new money will allow the Brooklyn-based startup to begin manufacturing its ammonia-to-power tech and bring its first product to market. In January, the company presented an ammonia-powered semitruck and later this year plans to show off a new ammonia-powered, zero-emission tugboat. If all goes right with that sail, the company expects its first commercial offering next year. Founded in 2020, the company has raised more than $200 million, per Crunchbase.
Big global deals
One round outside the U.S. cracked the global top five in March, and there was another big raise in China last month.

Lenskart, an online shopping portal that sells eyewear, landed a $500 million venture round.
China-based JD Industry, an industrial maintenance, repair and operations firm, raised a $300 million Series B.

Methodology
We tracked the largest rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies in March. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late.

"Boxabl, Aptera Get Big Bucks Through Crowdfunding As VC For Consumer Startups Dwindles",Joanna Glasner,2023/04/4,"

When first raising funding for solar car startup Aptera in 2007 and 2008, founders took the traditional venture route, securing more than $50 million from Google and other prominent investors. But things didn’t work out as hoped, and the company eventually shuttered.
More than a decade later, after repurchasing liquidated assets of the old Aptera and relaunching the brand, co-founder and CEO Chris Anthony was intent on going in a different direction.

“This time we recognized early on that our business plan would probably have great consumer appeal,” Anthony said — a notion supported by the prototype photos of the futuristic-looking three-wheeled vehicle.
Prototype photo of Aptera’s Launch Edition. Photo courtesy of Aptera.
So he turned to crowdfunding. It’s turned out favorably so far, with a series of campaigns on investment platform Republic.
To date, per Anthony, the Carlsbad, California-based company has pulled in about $70 million in total from crowdfunding initiatives and another $20 million from private investors. Many backers are signing up to reserve vehicles as well.
While few companies have landed such large sums, aptera isn’t alone among consumer-facing upstarts raising capital from crowdfunding of late. Rising interest comes as consumer products companies have fallen out of favor with venture investors. That may be prompting more founders in the space to try their luck at fundraising from a different demographic: actual consumers.
A future of solar cars and tiny homes
Of course, it helps to have the right product to sell. The most popular equity crowdfunding  campaigns often share common elements, including an ambitious vision, affordable entry prices and a cool-looking prototype.
These attributes apply well to Boxabl, the largest crowdfunding fundraiser of the past year. The Las Vegas-based company has raised more than $140 million from 40,000-plus investors 1 to manufacture tiny homes that unfold from a compact box shape, complete with bathroom, kitchen and living area.
Like Aptera, Boxabl is collecting reservations along with investments, with a target price of $50,000 for its flagship Casita offering. Buzz amplified around the company last year after it was reported that Elon Musk owned a unit. To date, Boxabl says, more than 160,000 people have reserved Casitas, representing over $9 billion in potential revenue.
Other intriguing crowdfunding campaigns have also pulled in  funding in recent months, albeit on a smaller scale, including:

Geoship, a startup building geodesic dome dwellings out of bioceramic composites, pulled in more than a million dollars in its crowdfunding campaign.
Blendid, a developer of robot-operated smoothie kiosks, says it has raised over $8 million from crowdfunding to date, and it is still raising.
AEssenseGrows, a developer of automated aeroponic vertical farming systems, seeks to raise $5 million in its latest crowdfunding effort.

It should be noted that equity crowdfunding differs fundamentally from its better-known cousin, project crowdfunding, popularized on sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo. Rather than getting a product or other perk, funders get some form of financial stake in the company.
Offerings can be open to accredited investors, who must meet worth guidelines or, to a more limited degree, nonaccredited investors. Per Securities and Exchane Commission guidelines, a nonaccredited investor can invest up to a maximum of 10% of annual income or net worth.
A different value proposition for founders and investors
For founders, per Anthony, an added appeal of crowdfunding investments is that one can sell nonvoting stock. Since investors have minuscule stakes in the company, voting rights don’t move the needle on whether they choose to invest. Founders, meanwhile, can maintain tighter control of company decision-making.
The bigger draw for consumer-facing companies taking the crowdfunding route, however, is the ability to get a built-in fan base along with financial backing. In aptera’s case, for example, having thousands of investors provides an army of evangelists talking up the coolness and energy efficiency of its vehicles, which will reportedly have the ability to travel up to 40 miles a day on free power from its integrated solar panels and up to 1,000 miles on a single charge.
Backers seem to hew to particular demographic profiles, per Anthony, with most hailing from big metro areas in California, Texas, Florida and New York. The average early investment was around $330, and over 85% of investors were male.
Crowdfunding equity investors are also likely to be glass-half-full types, willing to bank on a futuristic vision in spite of high risks.
For pessimists in the crowd, however, it’s worth noting that buzzy campaigns do have a history of fizzling out, including a number of well-known product crowdfunding ventures. The EV space is also a notoriously tough one to crack, with a long history of flameouts.
Still, technological breakthroughs and startup success stories do happen against long odds. To make it, it helps to have believers. Having thousands of believers — each with a vested financial interest in seeing the vision come true — also probably doesn’t hurt.

E-Commerce Company Boxed Files For Bankruptcy As Online Grocery Struggles,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/04/3,"

Another pandemic hit bites the dust.
Boxed, an online bulk grocery company that saw favor with consumers during the pandemic, announced on Sunday it will file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
The New York-based company thrived during the pandemic as online grocery delivery grew. In 2021, funding to the sector reached its peak with almost $8 billion worth of venture deals. Boxed went public in 2021 via a SPAC deal along with a spate of startups.

In its Chapter 11 filings, Boxed listed around $102 million in assets and $190 million in liabilities. The company said the purpose of filing is to sell Spresso, its software-as-a-service business, as it wound down operations.
Boxed said in Securities and Exchange Commission filings during the Silicon Valley Bank debacle that the bank held a majority of its deposits and liquid assets.
Online grocery takes a hit
Grocery delivery services like Boxed, Instacart and Amazon Fresh exploded during the pandemic as those who could afford those services elected for delivery. Social distancing mandates originally made it difficult to grocery shop, but many venture firms assumed it would be one of the pandemic-era behaviors that would last.
Indeed, a 2021 survey from Coresight Research found that 59% of people were using grocery delivery services, compared to 52% in 2020 and around 40% in 2019.
Boxed particularly found its niche by delivering bulk items without the need for a membership, making it a more accessible option than Costco or Sam’s Club.
But the sector was flooded with new companies without a quick path to profitability. In 2021, the grocery delivery industry saw almost $8 billion in funding, according to Crunchbase data. The number of entrants in the space was the highest it had ever been, with nearly 200 deals conducted that year.


In 2022, funding to grocery delivery startups dwindled 51%, down to less than $4 billion. The last time funding was lower than that was in 2019.

Accel-KKR Raises Two Buyout Funds Totaling $5.3B,Chris Metinko,2023/04/3,"

Private equity firms continue to bulk up as many think current trends in the market may create buyout opportunities in the second half of the year.
Technology-focused Accel-KKR is the latest, announcing it has closed on $5.3 billion of new capital commitments for both its Capital Partners VII LP and Emerging Buyout Partners II LP funds.
The Menlo Park, California-based private equity firm has made more than 350 investments in its two-decade-plus history. It invests in tech companies through a series of different funds and strategies including buyout, emerging buyout, growth capital and credit. It now has $19 billion in cumulative capital commitments. 

Some of the firm’s most recent investments include: Australia-based workforce management software developer Humanforce; Waltham, Massachusetts-based compensation data provider Salary.com; and U.K-.based processor of rental payments PayProp.
The new funds
The Capital Partners VII LP closed with $4.4 billion of equity capital commitments and will continue the firm’s strategy of making majority buyout investments in lower-middle market and middle-market tech companies.
The Emerging Buyout Partners II closed with $920 million of equity capital commitments. That will enable Accel-KKR to invest in software and tech-enabled services companies — with a special focus on small-cap companies.
“In raising these two new funds, we will continue our long-term strategy of working in partnership with management teams of the companies in which we invest, aggressively supporting their growth objectives by providing capital and operational support to fuel accelerated organic and inorganic growth,” said Tom Barnds, co-managing partner at Accel-KKR, in a release.
As financing options decline for startups and share prices of publicly traded companies drop, many think the M&A market will heat up later in the year. That likely is especially true for private equity firms, as many have raised huge funds recently that could take advantage of bargains in the market.

"Analysis: Layoffs At Big Tech Companies, Brutal As They Are, Have Walked Back Only 8% Of Pandemic Growth",Keerthi Vedantam,2023/04/3,"

Nearly 200,000 people have been laid off from the U.S.-based tech workforce in the last 14 months.
That number, which comes from The Crunchbase News Layoffs Tracker, is shocking. It’s even more shocking to see large tech companies announce subsequent rounds of mass layoffs mere months after they first cut thousands of employees.
But it’s also worth keeping in perspective: While large tech companies have collectively laid off hundreds of thousands of workers in just over a year, those job cuts follow three years of unbridled hiring during the boom times.

To get a better sense of how their workforces now compare to just a few years ago, we looked at the biggest culprits when it comes to recent mass job cuts: Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Salesforce 1. Together, those five companies have laid off 42% of all the tech roles since we began tracking the numbers in 2022.
Even so, the combined layoffs at these companies represent only 8% of the number of new hires they made during the pandemic.
“There is a sense of returning to pre-pandemic levels, but I don’t think it’s necessarily going to be its exact number,” said Hakki Ozdenoren, an economist with Revelio Labs, a workforce analytics company. “The world has changed since then.”
Employment growth by the numbers
Between 2019 and 2022, some companies nearly doubled their employee headcount.
In the span of three years, Amazon, for example, increased its headcount by 93%, according to Securities and Exchange Commission documents.
Meta increased its workforce by 92%, while Alphabet and Microsoft upped theirs by 60% and 53%, respectively. We didn’t include Amazon in the chart below, which only tallies full-time employees, because Amazon counts include both full- and part-time employees.


By these numbers, the hundreds of thousands of employees these five companies laid off aren’t even a drop in the bucket — collectively, they have only laid off 8% of the total roles they hired during the pandemic.
Despite laying off 27,000 employees, Amazon’s cuts only accounted for 3.6% of the company’s new hires. Meta made the largest dent in its hiring spree, slashing half as many of the roles it added between 2019 and 2022  by laying off 21,000 people over the span of four months (between November 2022 and March 2023).


Big tech is targeting managers
When companies overhire, it can create layers upon layers of middle managers to wrangle teams, which in turn creates inefficiencies and slows down projects.
In what Mark Zuckerberg described as “The Year Of Efficiency,” Facebook will flatten its org charts in 2023 and remove several managers from the chain of command.
“Looking from the perspective of 2020-2021, I think the companies were still trying to do what was optimal for them,” said Ozdenoren. “They had money, they faced some demand, and they needed people. I’m not going to go out and say hiring was fully planned out, but it was definitely the optimal strategy.”
During the pandemic, e-commerce and work-from-home technology demand soared, and big companies — flush with cash — experimented with new projects while interest rates were low.
Without hindsight, tech companies were simply operating the way they always had.
Now we’re seeing that the time for experimentation is over, profitability is center stage, and resources are being put back into core businesses. It seems even if Big Tech tries to return to its core operations, and tries to “flatten” its org charts so there are less managers, it will be doing so with far more people than it had three years ago.
“I think, going forward, we are going to see much better workforce planning and a need for better people analytics in tech firms,” Ozdenoren said.

Tech Jobs: Want To Save The World? These Agtech Startups Want To Help Farmers Grow More Food Without Destroying The Planet,Marlize van Romburgh,2023/04/3,"

If you’re passionate about working on real-world problems, you’d be hard-pressed to find something more real than agtech, which aims to better feed the world’s growing population. Many startups working in the agtech space — which received $4.5 billion from venture investors last year — are specifically working to grow more food for more people, without destroying the planet.
In this week’s edition of Who’s Hiring In Tech, we highlight open positions at three funded agtech startups in our Crunchbase database. All three of these companies make technology aimed at helping farmers produce food more sustainably and efficiently, whether that’s using less water or creating fewer emissions.

The roles highlighted below are pulled from our broader list of 385 Actively Hiring Startups, which includes funded companies currently hiring for multiple roles that have not conducted reported layoffs in the past year.


3 agtech roles that caught our eye
Company: Regrow

Position: Senior product manager, sustainability insights
Salary: N/A
Location: Remote; the company is based in Durham, New Hampshire.
What it does: Regrow’s software connects farmers with carbon trading markets so they can be rewarded for employing farming practices that reduce emissions, preserve soil quality and minimize chemicals. The company then uses satellite imaging and remote sensing to verify that environmental impact has been reduced — it says its technology currently monitors 150 million acres of land in more than 45 countries. Regrow has some heavy hitters investors, including billionaire Tom Steyer and Salesforce 1founder Marc Benioff‘s Time Ventures.
Why it’s cool: Producing food for humans takes a heavy toll on the environment: Regrow estimates some 26% of the world’s carbon emissions are due to food production and agriculture. As a senior product manager at Regrow, you’d get to work at the intersection of agtech and climate tech and “lead the development of new cutting-edge platforms that will help to shape the future of food,” according to the job description. The company is also hiring for multiple other roles, including in sales, engineering and marketing.
Funding history: Regrow has raised a total of $63.6 million, including a Series B in May 2022, according to its Crunchbase profile. Besides Steyer and Time, its other backers include Microsoft‘s M12 and Cargill.

Company: GroGuru

Position: Director of software and systems
Salary: N/A
Location: The company is based in San Diego, but it’s not clear if the job is in-office or remote.
What it does: GroGuru helps farmers manage water more efficiently, a problem that has only become more acute as persistent droughts plague many parts of the world. Its technology uses soil sensors to measure soil moisture, temperature, salinity and other variables, and then transmits that data wirelessly to the cloud where its software uses AI to make recommendations to farmers about when and how much to irrigate their crops.
Why it’s cool: This looks like a great opportunity for an experienced software leader to take a high-profile role at a funded seed startup that’s working on a very real-world problem. The company is looking for someone with a master’s degree or Ph.D. in engineering or a related field, with more than 15 years of experience. And if you’re not quite ready for a director-level role, GroGuru is also hiring for a senior software engineer and a senior data scientist.
Funding history: GroGuru is still in early innings: It has raised a total of $4 million, according to its Crunchbase profile, from investors including SVG Ventures. Its most recent funding was its seed round in December.

….
Company: Cropin

Position: Data engineer
Salary: N/A
Location: Bengaluru, India
What it does: This Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation– and Google-backed company makes software to help farmers increase their per-acre yields. Like the others on this list, it relies heavily on gathering large troves of data from farms that it then feeds into software that helps farmers make AI-assisted decisions.
Why it’s cool: This role in particular will have a hand in product development across the company’s platform. The company is looking for someone with a bachelor’s or master’s degree in computer science, plus four to six years of relevant experience.
Funding history: Cropin has raised a total of $46.4 million, according to its Crunchbase profile, including its Series D in December. Along with the Gates Foundation and Google, its backers include Beenext.

"As Virgin Orbit Woes Mount, Spacetech Funding Hasn’t Crashed",Joanna Glasner,2023/03/31,"

A couple years ago, it seemed like funding was skyrocketing for every startup sector on Earth — and some looking beyond our planet, too.
Investment in spacetech, spanning satellite networks, launch technologies and even space travel offerings, was running high. That coincided with some closely watched public market exits, including SPAC offerings from commercial spaceflight provider Virgin Galactic and launch services provider Virgin Orbit in 2019 and 2021.
Unfortunately for public investors, things haven’t worked out as hoped. On Thursday, Virgin Orbit announced it is cutting 85% of its workforce, or about 675 employees, after failing to secure new funding to support continued operations. Shares plunged to around 23 cents on Friday, down about 98% from their post-offering peak.

Other spacetech companies that took the SPAC route to market have also seen their share prices beaten down. This includes launch services provider Astra, rocket system developer Rocket Lab, space infrastructure developer Redwire, and Virgin Galactic, which are all trading well below their initial offer prices.
To date, public market woes haven’t translated into a shutoff in venture funding to the space. So far this year, spacetech-related companies have pulled in over $480 million in venture funding, per Crunchbase data. The year’s largest funding recipient, Munich-based satellite launch service Isar Aerospace, announced just this week that it secured $165 million in Series C investment.
To get a broader sense of where spacetech funding is going, we pulled together a list of 64 companies in the industry that have raised venture or seed funding in the past two years:


Overall, companies on our list have raised $21.7 billion in equity funding to date, no small sum. Of course, the total would be much lower if one took out SpaceX, which alone has landed over $8 billion in equity financing since its inception in 2002.
After SpaceX, the next-highest funding recipient is OneWeb, which has secured $4.7 billion to build a global space-based communications system, and Sierra Space, which raised $1.4 billion to develop technology to enable more people to live and work in space. Per Crunchbase, both companies last raised funding in 2021.

The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Coursedog And Graphiant Lead In Down Week,Chris Metinko,2023/03/31,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.

Last week we speculated if we were seeing the immediate effects of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse with so few large rounds. This week, it seems almost impossible to deny the bank’s failure is having at least some short-term effects on fundraising. Again, this may only be temporary — as the bank helped facilitate closing deals by providing credit facilities before VCs would actually collect money from LPs — but there certainly seems to be an effect as there were no nine-figure rounds this week in the U.S.
1. Coursedog, $90M, edtech: Ever not get into a class you really wanted to take when you were in college? Sure, everyone who went to school has confronted that problem. Cousersedog raised $90 million from JMI Equity to help solve that exact issue. The New York-based startup has created an “academic operations platform” for higher-education institutions, helping in curriculum planning, course scheduling, event management and catalog management. In total, it helps colleges schedule classes better. More than 170 institutions use the platform, including Columbia University — the alma mater of Coursedog’s founders. Founded in 2018, the company has raised nearly $113 million, per Crunchbase.
2. Graphiant, $62M, information technology: Connecting a company’s data centers, clouds and other tech services can be difficult. San Jose-based Graphiant, an edge services provider, is looking to make that simpler and faster. The startup raised a $62 million Series B led by Two Bear Capital. Its founder and CEO — Khalid Raza — knows the tech space well. He previously founded networking startup Viptela, which was bought by Cisco Systems in 2017 for $610 million. Founded in 2020, Graphiant has raised $96 million to date, per the company.
3. DataDome, $42M, cybersecurity: Bad bots are everywhere, but that doesn’t mean companies are defenseless. New York-based DataDome helps companies fight against AI-powered online fraud and bot attacks. Just last year, the startup says, it stopped more than 250 billion online fraud attempts. That track record likely helped it raise a $42 million Series C this week led by InfraVia Growth. Founded in 2015, the company has raised more than $80 million, according to Crunchbase.
4. P97 Networks, $40M, fintech: Everyone pays at the pump these days (assuming you don’t have an EV). Houston-based P97 Networks, one of the companies that makes that possible, raised a $40 million equity financing led by Portage this week. P97 provides mobile commerce and digital marketing to the convenience retail, auto industry and fuel markets. The company’s platform is used in more than 65,000 convenience stores and gas stations. It also is used at over 240,000 EV chargers — if you do have an EV. Founded in 2012, the company has raised nearly $110 million, according to Crunchbase.
5. Modern Electron, $33M, energy: Bellevue, Washington-based Modern Electron, a hydrogen heating company, raised a $32.8 million round, per a report. The cleantech startup has a solution that decarbonizes gas use by converting it to clean hydrogen onsite without CO2 emissions, and another that converts heat to power. Its investors include Bill Gates and At One Ventures. Founded in 2015, the company has raised nearly $74 million, per Crunchbase.
6. Sonoma Biotherapeutics, $30M, biotech: South San Francisco-based biotech firm Sonoma Biotherapeutics received a $30 million equity investment from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Founded in 2020, the company has raised $365 million, per Crunchbase.
7. Type One Energy, $29M, energy: Madison, Wisconsin-based fusion power startup Type One Energy closed a $29 million round co-led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, TDK Ventures and Doral Energy-Tech Ventures. The funding is the company’s first.
8. Spiral, $28M, fintech: New York-based social impact fintech startup Spiral closed a $28 million Series A led by Team8. Founded in 2019, Spiral has raised $42 million, per the company.
9. Perplexity AI, $26M, artificial intelligence: San Francisco-based Perplexity AI, a conversational AI-powered search engine, raised a $25.6 million Series A led by New Enterprise Associates. Founded in 2022, the company has raised nearly $29 million, according to Crunchbase.
10. LeapXpert, $22M, enterprise software: New York-based business communication platform LeapXpert locked up a $22 million Series A+ round led by Rockefeller Asset Management through its Technology Ventures Group. Founded in 2017, the company has now raised $36 million, per Crunchbase.
Big global deals
The top three rounds all happened outside the U.S. this week.

Columbia-based Isar Aerospace, a satellite startup, closed a Series C worth approximately $169 million.
China-based DeepWay, a maker and developer of electric commercial vehicles, raised a Series A of approximately $112 million.
The France-based crypto hardware maker Ledger added another $108 million to its previously announced Series C. The firm raised its initial Series C of $380 million in June 2021.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of March 25 to 31. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

"VCs Plow Money Into Indoor Farming, But Open Fields Might Be More Ripe For Innovation",Keerthi Vedantam,2023/03/31,"

When a hurricane in Florida and a virus in California killed a promising lettuce bounty late in 2022 and earlier this year, some hobbyists turned to indoor farms to supply their winter fuel of hearty salads.
Indoor farming is something venture firms have deemed the future of agriculture. Armed with temperature control, hydroponics and controlled environments, indoor farms can better shield crops from weather disturbances and pests.
With its potential to disrupt one of the oldest of human endeavors, indoor farming has emerged as a venture capital cash crop in recent years. Indoor farming startups alone captured around 20% of the total $4.5 billion venture investors plowed into agtech startups in 2022, Crunchbase data shows.

But the limitations of indoor farms — which often confine themselves to growing leafy greens in small quantities — hamper their potential to grow. The vast majority of food is still grown on open farms (52% of the U.S. is open farmland), and most investors continue to concentrate their efforts on applying cutting-edge technology to these famously low-tech and tech-resistant operations.
The potential — and problems — of indoor farming
Of the top five raises to agtech startups in 2022, according to Crunchbase data, four were dedicated to indoor farms — we covered Gotham Greens’ $310 million raise in September and Soli Organic’s $125 million raise in October.
The five largest fundings for indoor farming startups last year went to:

Plenty, which raised $400 million led by JS Capital Management  and One Madison Group for its indoor vertical farming tech.
Gotham Greens’ $310 million Series E led by Ares Management and BMO Capital Markets for its urban agriculture technology.
Soli Organic’s $125 million Series D led by CDPQ Infra for its indoor soil farming technique.
Source.ag raised $10 million led by Acre Venture Partners for its greenhouse predictive analytics software.
ioCrops, which raised $6.9 million for its autonomous greenhouse technology.

Indoor farming saw its best venture funding year ever in 2022, per Crunchbase data, while most industries suffered.


But there’s a slight problem: Indoor farms currently can’t produce much more than lettuce, spinach, salad greens and (some) tender herbs. Any produce that isn’t a tender green is typically still grown in vast fields open to the elements. That means wheat, corn, soy and other staple crops that provide the vast majority of the world’s sustenance don’t currently stand to benefit from indoor farming’s innovations.
“The issue, of course, is that very few crops can successfully be grown indoors yet,” said Matt Ryan, CEO of Soli Organic. “For the most part, things are grown much more expensive indoors than outdoors. There is a future for many, many crops to continue to be grown outdoors.”


But indoor farms have taken well to some of Silicon Valley’s greatest hits, like cloud technology, automation and AI. In the open environment, this kind of technology has a harder time scaling to battle the elements. No farm is a one-size-fits-all data point — different vegetables and different farm sizes require unique solutions to fix the myriad of problems that exist in the open field.
“Most VCs spend their time chasing small problems, or fake problems, or potential …” said Jason Pontin, an agtech-focused partner at DCVC. “We face these huge global problems, right? We are running out of runway to fix them.”
Indoor farming has long been heralded as the future of food. It uses less water and fewer resources than traditional farming. The indoor, closed environment allows for greater control on how to care for plants for healthy growth. And indoor farms are sometimes known as vertical farms or urban farms because many of them can be housed in cities (or even grocery stores), reducing shipping costs and preserving freshness.
However, vertical farms inherently grow smaller-batch yields compared to expansive open farms. Their uniform layouts don’t always account for growing other vegetables such as peppers that could, theoretically, grow in a hydroponics environment.
High tech and open farms don’t always mix
Corn and soy farms, which have the most acres, have often been quick to adopt new technology around automation and efficiency. But smaller crop farms have been left behind.
“Some of the best [crop] breeding organizations don’t even put time or effort into some of the minor crops. They just focus on corn and soy because they can make a lot of money on it,” said Jacqueline Heard, CEO of pesticide startup Enko Chem. “They tend to be a little more traditional, but they’ve never been given access to a lot of technologies that can really be transformational to them.”
There’s also the issue with technology itself. Around 20% of farms in the U.S. have poor or no access to broadband internet — and farms in the rest of the world have even less. That makes certain technologies heavily dependent on the cloud — like robotics and AI — a hard sell for many of the world’s farmers.
“I think there’s a social justice element to it as well. We need to make these calories cheaper and more broadly available, and we need to do so in techniques that all farmers in India have access to in a meaningful way,” Pontin said. “You can’t be selling really poor people incredibly expensive agricultural products and expect them to be broadly used.”
Nevertheless, AI and predictive analytics will be crucial to the future of open farms, even if current infrastructure doesn’t allow for it. There was once a time farmers could use The Old Farmer’s Almanac to get weather predictions. But historical averages are no longer an accurate assessment of growth, and climate change has all but thrown that playbook out the window.
For companies such as ClimateAI, which, in part makes weather predictions to help users unlock better yield potentials, that means making inroads in the industry.
“We have found that one of the biggest challenges in the agtech space is trust-building,” said Himanshu Gupta, CEO of ClimateAI. “Silicon Valley has often tried to solve problems by coming in and overriding those with on-the-ground experience, especially farmers. As a result, farmers are often distrustful of agtech companies’ promises.”
Startups tapping into open farms
Some of the promising startups that cater to open farms come from the biotechnology side. Enko Chem, a Connecticut-based crop protection startup, creates pesticides and weed killers that don’t harm the crop or water supply. The company raised $80 million in Series C funding in January, per Crunchbase data.
There’s also Inari, a seed gene-editing startup that aims to make crops more resilient and improve yield while also reducing water usage. The company says it can increase soybean yield by 20% and corn yield by 10% while using 40% less water.
“We are not going to be able to feed the world fairly and healthily and sustainably without addressing the large crops and the large sources of protein,” Pontin said. “So I guess my answer is: I’m all for vertical farming. Knock yourself out. But for me I want to get rice, wheat, soy, corn and protein.”

Greenlabs Nabs $38.4M As The Farming Sector Grapples With Climate Change,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/03/30,"

In January, Greenlabs CEO Sang-Hoon Shin told the World Economic Forum that the effects of climate change were reaching the fast-food sector: drought issues in Idaho, a major exporter of potatoes to South Korea, had killed crops. As a result, McDonald’s in South Korea, his home country, announced it would swap out french fries with chicken nuggets and cheese sticks.
The incident illustrates how the effects of climate change on crops are already hitting major food corporations such as McDonalds and KFC, which has also had trouble providing fast food staples in various parts of the world.

Shin, whose agtech startup works with farmers and produce buyers in South Korea, announced on Thursday it raised $38.4 million in debt financing, TechCrunch reported. The company has a suite of software and hardware applications that work to ensure bountiful growing seasons for farmers. Funding came from existing investors BRV Capital Management and SkyLake Incuvest.
Agtech funding to startups that leverage data and predictive analytics saw significant growth during the pandemic, when supply chain and logistics issues created grocery shortages across the world. This sort of technology uses data to predict weather changes, to advise how much water or nutrients a crop will need, and to understand how much farmers’ yield will sell for.


The company’s tools work alongside the entire agriculture chain to help manage crops and yield, sell that produce, and other tasks. The company says it can even help farmers find new distribution methods.
Greenlabs’ Farm Morning app, used by 900,000 farmers in South Korea, uses AI to help growers manage their crops to create better outcomes. It also allows farmers to connect with each other and ask for advice or share results.
Greenlabs also manages Sinsun Market, a business-to-business marketplace where farmers can connect with fresh produce buyers.

Ledger Locks In $108M To Lock Up Crypto,Chris Metinko,2023/03/30,"

Ledger has added another $108 million to its previously announced Series C to help people keep their crypto safe.
The France-based crypto hardware maker raised its initial Series C of $380 million in June 2021. The extension was done at the same valuation — about $1.4 billion — when taking into account currency conversion.
The round includes existing investors Molten Ventures, 10T, Cité Gestion Private Bank, Cap Horn, Morgan Creek, Cathay Innovation, Korelya Capital and new investors with True Global Ventures, Digital Finance Group and VaynerFund.

Ledger’s main products are cold hardware wallets for digital assets, allowing the owner to have full custody and security over their assets.
The company currently says it secures more than 20% of the world’s cryptocurrencies and more than 30% of NFTs.
Founded in 2014, Ledger has raised $468 million, per Crunchbase.
“These funds will accelerate our mission to bring a new generation of secure consumer devices to hundreds of millions exploring critical digital assets and blockchain-enabled technology,” said Pascal Gauthier, CEO and chairman, in a blog.
“As you know, 2022 was a trying year for the crypto industry, including the collapse of significant crypto exchanges and shifting macroeconomic conditions,” he added.
Crypto funding
Ledger was able to raise despite a very unfavorable funding environment in crypto currently.
While crypto prices are on the rise, the dramatic collapse of FTX still hangs over the entire sector with several other lenders and exchanges having their own problems and issues.
Crypto funding for the current — almost over — first quarter is at a low ebb. So far, the quarter has seen less than $1 billion invested into VC-backed crypto startups in only 174 deals, per Crunchbase data.
Compare that to last year at the same time when $6 billion of venture capital rolled to crypto startups in 426 deals.
It seems unlikely any quarter this year will match that.

Startups Turn To New Metrics To Measure Traction,Joanna Glasner,2023/03/30,"

Every money-making company describes its bottom line in the same way: profitable.
Every unprofitable company, however, seems to have its own metrics for putting the most positive spin on financial results.
A perusal of recent earnings reports reveals some of the standby favorites. There’s adjusted EBITDA profitability, dollar-based net retention rates, non-GAAP gross margins, non-GAAP net earnings … and the list goes on.

Not everyone’s a fan. Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chair Charlie Munger once famously advised: “Every time you see the word EBITDA, you should substitute the words “bullshit earnings.”
Luckily for startups, he’s not a venture capitalist. And for investors who really do focus on startups, some of the more unusual metrics do play a role in vetting companies that may be a ways from profitability.
These days, as startup backers shy away from high cash-burn, high-growth models, favored metrics are in flux. Companies are under more pressure to show they can get to break-even on comparatively modest capital infusions.
Retention at a reasonable price
“There’s a huge push to sustainable growth,” said Justin Bauer, chief product officer at Amplitude, a digital analytics platform that counts startups among its power users. Whereas a few quarters ago, investors might have prized fast growth above all, they’re now more sensitive to how much a startup is spending to acquire new users.
One of the metrics startups are tracking more assiduously now, per Bauer, is payback period for acquisition. This measures how long it takes to make enough money from a user to cover the marketing cost of getting them on the platform. Ideal time frames vary by industry, he said, but broadly it should be well below a year.
Having acquired a customer, startups are also increasingly expected to prove that a user is likely to stay, even in the face of budget cuts. To do that, startups need to show that users prefer them to rivals, based on metrics like frequency of visits and time spent on the platform. With both enterprise and consumer customers juggling more subscriptions than they need these days, it’s crucial to have a sense which will survive a culling.
Revenue per employee
Unprofitable companies also need to do more to instill confidence that they’re operating lean. Battery Ventures made this point in September, with a blog post noting how “the market has shifted to valuing cloud companies’ profitability, even when that comes at the expense of growth.”
For the current environment, Battery notes one of the increasingly popular metrics to track is  net burn/net new annual recurring revenue. The idea here is to get a sense of how efficient a company is at funding growth.
Taking things a step further, Battery also advises SaaS companies to employ a metric called APE, or ARR per employee, which offers a more detailed sense of productivity. Since costs for a cloud company are mostly driven by workers, the firm argues, tracking these costs specifically gives investors a sense of operating efficiency.
The most important metric: not needing the money
At the end of the day, the metric that arguably matters most for startups seeking to raise capital and negotiate terms is the one that is hardest to reach: Demonstrating that you don’t need the money.
Sure, it would be nice to grow faster, and to build out the core product. But if you can get by for a while with what you’ve got, it certainly aids the negotiating leverage.

"
Little Evidence Of Frozen IPO Market Thawing Out,Chris Metinko,2023/03/30,"

It’s been more than a year since the IPO pipeline’s shutoff valve was turned on, and so far the market has shown few drops of a comeback.
While in the last half year or so huge private companies like Instacart, Navan (formerly TripActions) and Stripe have made overtures they would go public, none seem very close — and those who watch IPOs don’t expect much action for at least the next several months and maybe much longer.

“For 15 months there has been no ability to bring a company to market,” said Jerry Serowik, managing director and head of capital markets at investment bank Cohen & Company Capital Markets. “Right now there is no ability to price a traditional IPO.”
Looking back
In market downturns, IPO numbers obviously also are going to take a tumble as investors’ confidence and stomach for risk become lower. However, in past downturns such as the dotcom bust and the global financial crisis in 2008-09, the IPO market came back within two years.
Even with the banking and market turbulence in 2008-09 — which went well beyond the tech sector — IPOs bounced back by 2010.
The current down market already has lasted more than a year and shows few signs of lightening. While more than 330 U.S.-based, VC-backed companies valued at $1 billion or more went public in 2021, that number plummeted to just over 80 last year and is not even on that pace for this year, per Crunchbase data.
While big-name, VC-backed companies like Rivian and Robinhood went public in the second half of 2021, the market has been relatively quiet since, with many companies going the SPAC route to the public markets.
“I wasn’t anticipating a lot of activity until at least the second half of the year,” said Ran Ben-Tzur, a partner at law firm Fenwick & West.
That estimate may now be pushed back to 2024, Ben-Tzur said.
While the year started off pretty good with investors beginning to have constructive conversations with late-stage companies, the environment has died down, he said.
“With Silicon Valley Bank and the overall banking situation, the overall market is currently not conducive to capital market transactions,” said Ben-Tzur, adding there have been other “black swan” or black swan-like moments in the last year that have stifled the market.
Serowik adds while the window was open briefly in January, it quickly shut again — and now when it opens again likely depends on when the negativity surrounding the equity markets dissipates.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange‘s Volatility Index — or VIX — is a popular tool used to measure the stock market’s expectation of volatility. From about mid-Janaury to mid-February the index fell below 20 — the accepted threshold for new entries into the IPO market.
For most of March, it has been well above 20.
“Above 20, it’s a no-go for IPOs,” Serowik said.
Lasting freeze
Of course, one reason many companies have been able to push back IPO plans is the immense amount of capital now available on the public markets.
For example, Meta (formerly Facebook) had raised about $2.4 billion before its IPO in 2012, which included a huge $1.5 billion round in the secondary market, per Crunchbase data. On the other hand, Stripe has raised $8.7 billion to date — which includes the massive $6.5 billion Series I it just raised to help provide liquidity to current and former employees and help offset a tax bill that will come due when it modifies employees’ stock grants that are set to expire.
Many VC-backed startups fattened up during venture’s high-spending days of years past and still have money left in their coffers — especially after many enacted cost-cutting moves in the past year or so to preserve cash.
“IPO candidates raised a lot in 2021, and in the last six to nine months are in hunker-down mode,” Ben-Tzur said.
The one sign there has been for the IPO market possibly coming back could be there was more movement in follow-on offerings late last year and even in the first few months of this year, he said.
“We’ll see if that continues after companies announce first-quarter earnings,” Ben-Tzur said.
Don Butler, managing director at Thomvest Ventures, said many companies are still waiting for valuations to settle after the past year of upheaval on the private markets — and can do so because they are better capitalized than ever.
However, in addition to having cash in the bank, it also has gotten pricier to go public, Butler said. Part of that is the fact that director and officer insurance has gotten more costly due to many SPACs imploding and the lawsuits that followed, he added.
There also is the added variable that many of these startups have slowed growth through the last year-plus — now putting them behind the eight ball if they are eyeing the public market.
“You don’t want to have those numbers,” Butler said. “Now you are valued less (when you go public) and have different comparables. These companies may have to raise fresh capital to get their growth numbers back up before they can IPO.”
That may not happen until 2025, Butler said.
“It all depends on when (investor) confidence comes back,” he said.

"Private Credit Funds, Banks Will Aggressively Push To Fill SVB’s Role — Likely At Higher Rates",Chris Metinko,2023/03/29,"

With much of what once was Silicon Valley Bank falling into the hands of Raleigh, North Carolina-based First Citizens BancShares, it is fair to wonder what the future of lending and credit may look like for venture-backed startups.
SVB’s outsized role in venture debt and lending will be taken over not just by a few smaller banks, but also likely will raise interest in many private credit funds — or shadow banks — and others that have eyed the industry for a while, say those in the venture world.
With those players having an expanded role in the market, startups also can expect the cost of capital — which just more than a year ago wasn’t even a concern — to increase noticeably, they added.

“That gap will be filled, but expect money to be more expensive,” said Jerry Serowik, managing director and head of capital markets at investment bank Cohen & Company Capital Markets.
The shifting banking scene
SVB’s fall didn’t just affect startups’ ability to secure debt or a credit facility from the bank itself, it also helped create great uncertainty in the banking system in general.
Banks such as Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and smaller regional bank First Republic Bank all have been shaken by the sense of unease that has drifted into the banking sector.
That sense of instability will hurt banks’ ability to fill the lending shoes of SVB — which was the dominant bank for tech startups and venture debt in the U.S. — according to those in the venture world.
Large banks cannot fill most of the loss due to regulations that dissuade them from lending to companies that are not within a year of profitability.
On the other hand, the recent woes of smaller banks such as First Republic likely will tighten regulations and put more scrutiny on who they lend money to, Serowik said.
Ran Ben-Tzur, a partner at tech-focused law firm Fenwick & West, said while there are a number of other banks — such as Bridge Bank — that provide venture debt, it remains to be seen who may take SVB’s market share, especially in the current environment.
“A number of regional banks, and in certain cases some of the larger banks, are under some sort of distress,” he said.
That doesn’t mean some banks will not possibly look at stepping into the vacuum SVB’s collapse created. Just last week, St. Louis-based Stifel Financial hired three former SVB employees in what the firm called a “significant expansion of venture banking business.”
Others that may look to move into the space could be newer fintechs such as Brex and Mercury, which have expressed an interest in lending to startups.
What’s in the shadows?
Most people are in agreement that as banks look for solid footing, private credit funds — also called shadow banks, or credit intermediaries which do not fall in the category of traditional regulated banking — could step into the opening created by SVB.
Such firms — which include players of all sizes like BlackRock, Ares Management and Atalaya Capital — have been around for decades and have shown increasing interest in venture.
“Private credit will get bigger, even if it is costlier,” said Don Butler, managing director at Thomvest Ventures and someone who has been in venture for more than two decades.
Private credit often is pricier since those funds’ LPs expect higher rates.
Butler said he already has met with a few credit providers and two things are certain — the cost of capital will go up and the facility sizes will get smaller, as these lenders look to spread their risk around more.
“This will go on for at least a few quarters,” he said.
Effects on startups
Of course, the cost of credit increasing couldn’t happen at a worse time for startups. With equity financings getting harder and harder to come by for many startups, the lending and debt space has become more critical.
Companies are staying away from equity raises as valuations are still settling, and the uncertainty of the SVB situation will not benefit the current fundraising environment, Ben-Tzur said.
“I don’t think it’ll help,” he added.
Butler said the full effect of SVB’s collapse is just starting to be felt by startups and those looking to raise capital.
“This isn’t just a blip,” he said.
He added that he expects a higher-than-normal mortality rate among seed and pre-seed startups.
Many of these companies already faced a crucible moment when SVB failed weeks ago and their access to cash was in doubt. Investors at that point had to make a call on whether to support these young companies in their moment of need, and many decided they no longer would in this market, said Butler.
That decision is unlikely to change in the next several quarters, he added.
Now, the one bank that was sometimes willing to take a chance on young, unproven companies is under different ownership.
There is a chance the tighter credit market could jumpstart equity financing, or at least make them more appealing to startups, Serowik said.
Only time will tell that, but one thing is certain now that SVB is gone.
“Access to capital will deteriorate,” said Serowik. “And the cost of capital will increase.”

Him For Her And Crunchbase 2022 Study Of Gender Diversity On Private Company Boards,Ann Shepherd,2023/03/29,"

This is the fourth annual tracking report produced through a collaboration between Him For Her and Crunchbase. Contributors include Laura Gluhanich, Riya Hariharan and Sierra Scanlan of Him For Her, Cynthia Overton of Kapor Center, and Gené Teare of Crunchbase. Lauren Rivera, professor at Kellogg School of Management, co-authored the original 2019 benchmark study, upon which subsequent research has been based.
Executive summary
As investors and other stakeholders put increasing pressure on public companies to build boards that better reflect society, the root cause that inhibits board diversity has become clearer. It’s not a pipeline problem. It’s a network problem. Boards have been over-reliant on their personal networks to source candidates. 
For high-growth private companies — the subject of our research — this problem is compounded by two structural issues.
First, the lack of diversity among investors and the entrepreneurs they back shapes the demographics of the boardroom. Our study found that men hold 88% of investor-director board seats and 91% of executive board seats.

Second, independent director seats — which provide companies with the opportunity to round out the board with directors who bring relevant operating experience and new perspectives — remain unfilled. Even though the organizational documents for venture-backed companies typically specify a number of independent board seats, nearly a fifth of the heavily funded, high-growth companies we studied don’t have a single independent director. Another quarter of the companies have only one. 
Encouragingly, the number of companies with independent directors is on the rise. Additionally, companies are adding independent directors at an earlier stage. Among the venture-backed companies to which Him For Her has introduced their newest board members, 69% of those were Series C or earlier. The expertise and fresh perspective these independent directors can provide should better position the companies to capitalize on the opportunities before them.
Why this study?
You can’t change what you can’t measure. Early in our work to accelerate gender diversity on corporate boards, we at Him For Her sought out benchmarks against which to measure progress. We found several studies tracking board diversity among public companies, but little data on the demographic composition of the boards of high-growth private companies.
Board diversity is important for public companies, but it’s equally important for the boards of these private companies. In fact, nearly half of public companies founded since 1979 began as venture-backed startups. Before they hit the public markets, private companies create the products and services, and define the business models that will shape society for decades to come. They surpass public companies in number and employ millions of people. And yet these future public companies have been largely overlooked when it comes to the composition of their boards.
In 2019, Him For Her teamed up with Crunchbase to benchmark private-company boards. Through our annual research and reporting, we examine board diversity among the most heavily funded private companies and explore the unique dynamics that shape their boardrooms.
This fourth annual study encompasses the boards of 667 companies, which represent nearly $200 billion in funding and employ more than 265,000 people. These boards include 4,035 individuals who hold 4,610 board seats.
Key findings

Between 2019 and 2022, women gained an average of just over half a board seat (0.6); women now represent roughly 1 out of 7 board members.
Women hold 16% of board seats among the companies studied, up from 14% in 2021 and 7% in our original study in 2019.
Nearly a third (32%) of companies don’t have any women on their boards, an improvement from 39% in the prior year. The companies with all-male boards represent $56 billion in funding and employ more than 78,000 people.
Only 4% of all directors are women of color,1 reflecting a slight improvement from 3% in the prior year. For the first time, the number of women of color surpassed the number of board members named “Dave.”
More than three quarters of company boards (76%) do not include a single woman of color.
Women are most likely to occupy an independent director seat (54%), as compared with an investor director (34%) or executive director (13%) seat.
Investor directors hold fewer than half of board seats (47%, down from 56% in 2019), as independent directors command a larger board footprint (31%, up from 20% in 2019). 
Companies with at least one woman on the board have raised an average of 16% more in cumulative funding than companies without any women board members.
Life sciences companies outperform technology companies on board-diversity metrics. 

When we began our study in 2019, 60% of the company boards we examined were all men. Four years later, that has dropped to 32%. Despite this notable improvement, women still hold an average of only one seat on every seven-member board, and the pace of change is slowing. When life sciences companies, which tend to perform better on board-diversity measurements, are excluded, the diversity picture for technology companies looks even worse.
Women hold an average of one seat per seven-person board
For the first time since we launched our study in 2019, women averaged one full board seat per company. Men hold an average of six seats per board.

Over the last four years, women have gained just over half a seat (0.6) in the boardrooms of these high-growth companies. They now hold 16% of all board seats, up from 7% in 2019. Among public companies, women hold 32% of the director seats on the boards of S&P 500 companies and 28% on the boards of Russell 3000 companies.
Nearly a third of the companies studied (32%) don’t have any women on their boards. By comparison, among public companies, there are no all-male boards within the S&P 500 and only 2% within the Russell 3000.
In our study, the companies being governed by all-male boards represent more than $56 billion in funding and employ more than 78,000 people.
One-third of women directors are the only women in the boardroom. While research suggests that boards need at least three women to capture the full economic benefits of diversity, only 31% of companies studied have more than one, and just 9% have more than two.

Women of color now outnumber “Daves” in the boardroom
In our last study, we reported that there were roughly as many people named “Dave” or “David” (107) in the boardrooms we examined as there were women of color (110). In 2022, women of color gained nearly one percentage point among board directors, surpassing the number of Daves. 
Of the 4,610 board seats included in the study, an estimated 20% are held by men of color and only 4% by women of color, up from 3% the prior year. By comparison, within the S&P 500, 8% of directors are women of color. More than two-thirds (69%) of the private companies studied have at least one man of color on the board, while fewer than a quarter (24%) include a woman of color on their boards. The number of men of color (936) among the board directors studied exceeds the total number of women of all races and ethnicities (668).
Percentage of investor directors continues slow decline
When we began our study in 2019, investors held 56% of all board seats. Over the past four years, that share has decreased to 47%. During this period, the average board size has remained virtually unchanged at 6.9 members. 
Directors on private-company boards can be classified in three groups: executive directors, investor directors and independent directors. CEOs, co-founders and any members of the company’s management team who hold board seats are considered executive directors. These make up 23% of the board seats within the companies studied, consistent with our findings last year.
As venture-backed companies raise outside funding, investors often take seats on the board. Within the study data, investor directors make up the largest pool of board members for venture-backed companies.
Independent directors are typically the last to be added to the board, as they are neither tied to the company’s founding management team nor early investors. Private companies are not required to have independent directors; however, public companies must have at least one independent director, depending on the size of the board. 
As the percentage of investor directors has declined, the percentage of independent directors has increased to 31%, up from 20% in 2019. However, 17% of companies don’t have a single independent director on their board (down from 29% in 2019).
Boardroom gains have largely been driven through independent director appointments
Men hold the majority of board seats, regardless of type. The percentage of women holding executive director and investor director seats has increased modestly over the past four years. However, the greatest gains have been among independent directors, where women now hold 28% of seats, up from 19% in 2019. Since the study’s inception, women have gained an average of 0.6 board seats. More than half of this increase is due to the appointment of women as independent directors.


Combined, executive and investor directors hold 70% of board seats, of which only 11% are occupied by women. This gender imbalance reflects the downstream effect of the underrepresentation of women among both startup funders and founders.
Data reveal correlation between funding and women in the boardroom
Companies with at least one woman on the board raised an average of 16% more funding ($302 million) than companies without any women on the board ($261 million). They also have larger boards, with an average of 7.4 directors, compared with companies without women board members (6.0 directors).
This data suggests that, even among companies with a minimal cumulative raise of $100 million, those which have raised more funding have made more progress in building out their boards, appointing one or more independent directors by which they have brought more diversity into the boardroom.
Data also revealed a correlation between women on boards and IPOs. Among the companies examined in our 2021 study, those with at least one woman on the board were 10 times more likely to have gone public the following year than those with all-male boards. Of the 151 companies with at least one woman board member in 2021, 30 (20%) had gone public within the succeeding 12 months. Of the 101 companies with no women on the board, only 2 (2%) had gone public during the same time period.
The board diversity picture dims when life sciences companies are excluded
Among the 667 companies we studied, 46% (306) operate within computer technology-related industries and 40% (269) within the life sciences. Roughly half of the remaining 92 companies are in energy-related industries (45) and the remainder reflect a mix of other fields. 
Our research indicates that life sciences companies tend to have more diverse boards than technology companies. Life sciences companies have more women directors (19%, compared with 13%). Three out of four life sciences companies have at least one woman in the boardroom, compared with 61% of tech companies.
Women of color hold 5% of the seats on life science boards and 3% on tech boards. Nearly a third (30%) of life sciences companies have at least one woman of color on the board, compared with fewer than a fifth (19%) of tech companies.
These differences cannot be explained by board size. The average number of board members for life science and tech companies is similar (7.0 compared with 6.8, respectively). 
Summary
Among public companies, the all-male boardroom is becoming a thing of the past. Yet nearly a third of the private companies we studied remain governed entirely by men. Four years ago, that percentage of all-male boards was nearly twice as high. So clearly the trend toward more inclusive board recruitment that has been reshaping public boards is extending to younger companies. However, women remain dramatically underrepresented in these private company boardrooms, and the rate of change is slowing.
Our research points to two factors that inhibit board diversity among high-growth private companies:

Lack of gender diversity among investors and the entrepreneurs they fund
Lack of urgency in appointing independent board members

Additionally, the fact that only 28% of independent directors in place are women reflects an overreliance on existing networks to source candidates.
While gender diversity among investors and the founders they fund continues to slowly improve, independent board seats provide a more immediate way to introduce diversity of experience and perspective to the boardroom. Most CEOs and their boards recognize the value of independent directors, but the competing demands on a startup CEO can relegate this “important-but-not-urgent” opportunity to the back burner. 
Him For Her, a social impact venture, was created to remove the friction for CEOs looking to build their boards and extend their networks by connecting them with outstanding candidates who bring expertise and perspectives critical to companies’ success. 
The good news is that once boards include a critical mass of women and people of color, the challenge of board diversity will be solved in perpetuity as the board network expands to include people with a wider variety of life experiences.
Methodology
This tracking update largely reproduced the methodology employed with our prior studies published in December 2019, March 2021 and March 2022. For this update, we analyzed 667 of the most heavily funded private U.S.-based companies to understand the composition of their boards as of Q4 2022 — one year after the prior study and three years after the original.
Leveraging the Crunchbase database, we identified 2,626 U.S.-based private companies founded since 2003 with cumulative funding of at least $100 million as of June 30, 2022. To ensure that each company’s board profile was current, we included only companies that publish their board of directors on their website.
We then referenced company website data, Crunchbase profiles and other publicly available information to characterize the board members. The study included only board directors; board observers and/or advisers were excluded from the data set. For each company, we segmented board members according to type: executive, investor or independent. In the few cases in which founders and past executives remained on the board despite no longer having an operating role at the company, we classified them as “executive directors” in recognition of their original relationship to the company. We identified gender by referencing the professional profiles on Crunchbase. For racial/ethnic identity, we leveraged self-identification information where available, and supplemented with contextual information and visual identification. As reflected by U.S. Census data collection, people of color include Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Hispanic or Latino.

"
E-Commerce Giant Alibaba Will Become 6 Different Entities,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/03/28,"

After operating as one company for 25 years, Alibaba Group, one of the world’s largest tech companies, announced on Tuesday it will split into six different business groups.

Each group  will be managed by its own CEO who will run different parts of the former China-based e-commerce giant: cloud computing, local e-commerce, global e-commerce, logistics, food delivery and media. Each will report to their own board and may seek out funding or individual IPOs, while Alibaba Group becomes a holding company.
Hoping for a faster and more nimble future
The move is not unlike what we saw in 2021, when Facebook became a subsidiary of Meta along with Whatsapp and Instagram. But Alibaba’s move is still a stunning shift for a company that spent more than two decades billing itself as one of China’s greatest tech companies with a global reach.
According to The Wall Street Journal, CEO Daniel Zhang said the breakup will improve organizational efficiency and make each new business more agile and able to compete with rivals. The move will also allow each unit to shed regulatory burdens another department has to follow. For example, the cloud unit has to follow stricter data privacy regulations than, say, logistics.
It will be interesting to see how these different businesses perform. A conglomerate like Alibaba is hard to value because it has its hand in several different industries. Lag in one affects the others. As standalone companies, each business may have a better grip on navigating its respective sector during these uncertain economic times.
As for all the resources that run under Alibaba’s different groups, such as human resources and data management, Zhang said they will be split among each new company and become more siloed as they grow.

Sam Bankman-Fried Faces New Charge Involving Conspiracy To Bribe Chinese Officials,Chris Metinko,2023/03/28,"

Disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried faces yet another charge as his legal troubles mount.
U.S. prosecutors on Tuesday disclosed an indictment against Bankman-Fried accusing him of paying approximately $40 million in a bribe to Chinese officials so they would unfreeze accounts related to his crypto hedge fund Alameda Research. The action is a violation of U.S. anti-bribery law.

Bankman-Fried already faced a dozen charges from federal prosecutors — including conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud, individual charges of securities fraud and wire fraud, money laundering and conspiracy to avoid campaign finance regulations.
A hearing has been set for Thursday on the new bribery charge.
The story so far
FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in November after it was unable to repay customers who had deposited funds on its exchange.
The exchange is one of the most spectacular failures ever in the venture capital world. FTX was the fourth-largest crypto exchange by volume when it failed, and Bankman-Fried was one of crypto’s biggest evangelists and financial backers. Through FTX Ventures and his other trading firm Alameda Research, the crypto whiz kid made hundreds of bets on the industry and the future of digital finance.
Investors in FTX included big names like Sequoia Capital, NEA, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Insight Partners, Temasek, SoftBank Vision Fund, Thoma Bravo, SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Coinbase Ventures.
At its peak, FTX and FTX US — its U.S.-based exchange — were valued at $32 billion and $8 billion valuations, respectively.
Just last week, FTX’s new managers said Sam Bankman-Fried and other related executives received $3.2 billion in payments and loans, mainly from Alameda Research. About $2.2 billion of that total went to Bankman-Fried himself.
Bankman-Fried has denied any wrongdoing and is out on bail. His fraud trial is to start in October.

"Survey Says: Readers Less Pessimistic About Recession Odds, Split On Potential Of AI",Marlize van Romburgh,2023/03/28,"

One quarter into 2023, and Crunchbase News readers are feeling slightly more upbeat compared to the end of last year. But plenty are also “confused,” “pessimistic” and even “scattered” when it comes to the outlook for their businesses and the economy, and almost half expect cost-cutting to continue.
There’s also plenty of interest — and skepticism — about the potential for AI to disrupt the workplace and boost productivity.

That’s all from our latest survey of readers. Let’s dive in.
Recession fears abate … slightly
More than 65% of readers who responded to the latest survey still think the odds of a recession are more likely than not this year — these readers rated the chances of a global economic downturn in 2023 at 6 or above, with 10 being “most likely.”
Still, that’s down from 82% at the end of 2022.
The percentage of readers who are extremely pessimistic is down, too: While 33.7% rated the chances of a recession at a 9 or 10 out of 10 in December 2022, just 16.6% of readers surveyed most recently placed those odds on a downturn.


‘Confused,’ ‘optimistic,’ a bit ‘curious’
Still, uncertainty reigns about where, exactly, the global economy is headed, especially given the dichotomy between the tech sector and the rest of the market.
That probably explains why 31.3% of respondents said “confused” is the word that best describes their outlook for 2023. Another 30.3% picked “optimistic” and 22.7% said they’re “pessimistic.”
Other words that readers said sum up their thoughts on 2023 ranged from “dire” and “concerned” to “hopeful” and “curious.”
One reader noted: “There is a big difference between profitable bootstrapped companies and tech companies that rely on funding — let’s not conclude that the economy is in dire straits because tech companies that rely on funding and that over-hired in 2022 are now laying people off.”
All told, almost 38% of respondents said they’re more optimistic now than they were even just a few months ago.


AI: Hype or gamechanger?
Many readers said they expect AI will eventually drastically change the way they work, especially when it can reliably automate mundane tasks such as sending cold sales pitches, writing first drafts of marketing copy, and basic research.
Readers who were most excited about AI in the workplace said:

“I’m in content marketing. We already use AI for idea generation, drafting and editing.”
“It’s already making some writing faster or at least better focused.”
“AI will automate the more routine decisions just as software automates routine processes.”
“Generative AI will help a ton with content planning and ideation — but not creating it for us. We’re able to generate ideas and outlines at a rapid pace, and that makes refinement and production much more efficient.”
“I’m in design — I predict it will change dramatically even by the end of 2023, and it will completely transform over the next two years.”
AI has made it “faster to draft tailored sales pitches.”
“Tedious tasks will soon be pushed off on AI, freeing up more time to focus on the big picture. Basic level 1 research and writing will be done with AI. I currently use it to create a draft of basic email outreach but I, like most, will spend less time editing it than writing it from scratch.”

Those who were more pessimistic voiced concerns ranging from their role being replaced by AI, to the technology’s limitations.
“Sales AI is limited to lead-generation and sending cold emails, and that’s about it,” one reader noted.
Another said the technology could be beneficial in the near term, but longer term could also be a threat to their livelihood. “I will be able to use it to expedite some of my sales outreach, but also do feel concerned that this technology might replace my position in the coming years (but that will likely not impact my job security directly).”
And of course, many readers said it was “too early to tell” if or how AI would change how they work and that they’re waiting for time to “sort out the true gems from the AI-generated junk.”
As one respondent noted: “There is a lot of hype at present. It is not clear whether the trivial use cases will decline in favor of business enabling ones this year or whether hype will continue into 2024 before we see more realistic use cases.”
Cost-cutting, layoffs continue
Two-thirds of readers surveyed rated their optimism about their company’s financial prospects at a 6 or higher, with 10 being most optimistic and 1 least — roughly the same percentage who said so back in December.


Still, about 45% of survey respondents said their company or employer plans to cut costs in 2023. That compares with 40.5% a few months ago, indicating that despite more general optimism, companies may continue to trim their budgets.
One person with a design consulting firm pointed to a notable slowdown in 2022 and 2023: “Our pipeline last year and this year has been very weak vs. any previous year. We are still landing work, but our close rate is way down and we are needing to hustle a lot more,” the person wrote. “Typically, recessions are good for us because companies are more likely to outsource after they reduce headcount, but I think there is still so much uncertainty that it’s hard for companies to get decision makers to actually sign a contract.”


Half of respondents said their company has conducted layoffs either in 2022 or this year.
Given that, it’s not surprising that headcount remains the No. 1 item on the chopping block for companies that are cutting costs.
After payroll, employee travel is the next most likely line item to be axed.


Even so, many companies continue to actively hire, our survey shows. More than 56% of respondents said their companies or employers have multiple open roles.


Companies preserve runway
Cost-cutting is designed to help companies retain as much runway as possible. While one-third of survey respondents didn’t provide information about the health of their companies’ runways, most of those that did indicated their companies are poised to be able to survive at least a year and a half without additional capital.


Death of WFH is greatly exaggerated
More than half of respondents said their companies currently operate on a hybrid office model, while only 6.1% said they are in-office full time.
Two-thirds also said their company’s remote-work policies are not changing in 2023 compared to last year.
Geopolitics cloud outlook
One strong theme that emerged from reader responses: Global crises and government responses to them make it difficult to see too far into the future.
“The Russian invasion of Ukraine and geopolitics with China are causing a lot of instability, which could get worse or better quickly so it is difficult to predict into the future that much,” one reader lamented.
Another said: “The picture of the global economy just got blurrier in the past couple of years, driven by factors such as: EU countries being vocal about their involvement in the war against Russia, mixed interest rate movement by some key central banks, the diminishing of the Fed ‘pivot’ expectations, and the re-opening of China, which is yet to show its impact on the world economy. All of this requires us to move slowly and ensure every risk taken is well-calculated.”
Methodology
Results are from a survey of Crunchbase News readers conducted between Feb. 27 and March 27 in which 132 readers responded. Readers self-identified their industries and roles and were not required to answer all questions to complete the survey.

Austin Tech Conference SXSW Adapts To Fast Changing Ecosystem,Guest Author,2023/03/28,"

By Jonathan ‘Yoni’ Frenkel 
South By Southwest, which takes place in Austin every March, is still a leading technology and cultural experience.
Although the festival has grown over the years to include new tracks, many of the participants who attend SXSW Interactive (with or without a festival badge), do so to network, reconnect with colleagues, and sometimes listen to a panel or two.

With marketing budgets being cut due to economic conditions, this year’s festival was not as busy as years prior, and many of the organizations attending scaled down their activity. Less, and lower key, along with a smaller number of attendees was noticeable during the week.
Many of the conversations at Interactive (the tech track of the festival), revolved around the bewilderment due to the sudden collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, and what the immediate future will hold for investors and startups, some of whom were attending the festival.
Celebrating diversity
At SXSW there was a focus on, and celebration of, founders of color, female founders and diverse groups at the forefront of changing the tech industry. Regarding her SXSW experience, Elisa Sepulveda, partner at Angel Ventures US, (of Mexico City-based Angel Ventures) stated via email that:
“This is my 12th SXSW, second as an investor, first as an emerging fund manager raising a venture capital fund. I spent time during the festival running from event to event to speak and gain exposure to founders, other fund managers, LPs, and ecosystem leaders. There are always many competing events and many of them are invite only so it’s important to be flexible in your schedule in order to make room for the serendipity of the experience. SXSW is an excellent place to meet founders, other VCs, and ecosystem leaders.”
Attending SXSW helped her develop relationships for her fund. The fund is expanding its footprint to target Latinos in the United States as a result of the market opportunity due to Latinx entrepreneurs receiving only 2% of available venture capital, and  being 2x less likely to secure venture funding.
Brand experiences and networking
Local organizers showed up with a strong presence to support the ecosystem.
Austin-based connector Marc Nathan of  law firm Egan Nelson, and one of the organizers of Funded House, a curated setting which helped startup leaders navigate growth by facilitating conversations with investors, remarked via email that:
“SXSW offers an opportunity for early-stage founders, investors, and ecosystem partners to connect in a pressure-free setting, which is a recipe for serendipity. Despite everything that is happening with the economy these days, everyone attending made the best of the situation, and used it as an opportunity to build authentic connections, which are the bedrock of any solid business collaboration.”

The festival still presents the best economic development opportunity for countries, cities and regions to present their flavor to an engaged audience as well as promote their startup ecosystems. Experiences like Midwest House and Tulsa House (which was particularly busy) on Rainy Street, as well as Canada House and German Haus provided an authentic regional experience for festival attendees.
Others chose to collaborate for exposure such as Montenegro-based Digital Den Hub and Innovation Bridge Europe which is headquartered out of Germany, with local organizers such as Funded House.
SXSW’s future
SXSW will evolve as a festival as technology continues to shape culture. The festival is still relevant, but with Gen Z’s habits around in-person experiences, changing attitudes toward alcohol consumption, and the next generation’s preference for newer and different experiences, the question is how this conference will continue to draw attendees.
Ultimately, with a SXSW festival badge or not, professionals in tech, creative industries and corporate America come to Austin to network, serendipitously connect and experience this festival.

"
North Carolina’s Research Triangle Could See A Boost From SVB Deal,Joanna Glasner,2023/03/27,"

Among American startup hubs, North Carolina’s Research Triangle region has long ranked as a solid producer of tech and life sciences companies. Silicon Valley, however, it’s not.
But now, with Raleigh-based First Citizens BancShares acquiring much of the remains of Silicon Valley Bank, the North Carolina region is positioned for a higher profile. That could boost expansion of what was already one of the nation’s fastest-growing metros for venture investment.

In announcing the purchase agreement Monday, First Citizens relayed its intention to leverage some of SVB’s connections and expertise in its own hometown. It touted the deal as a way “to support growth in the innovation and technology sectors in both Silicon Valley Bank’s markets and in the Research Triangle.”
For now, we don’t have a lot of detail on what that might mean in practice. Research Triangle was already a region on most venture investors’ radar, home t0 both to Fortnite publisher Epic Games and a well-funded cluster of life sciences companies.
It’s also home to two universities — Duke University and The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill — which rank in the top 15 nationally for R&D spending. Plus, per Crunchbase data, there are at least 40 venture firms, banks and other institutions based in the state that have made one or more startup investments since last year.
North Carolina was also one of a few states that saw an increase in funding last year, even as global and U.S. venture investment levels declined markedly. Overall, North Carolina saw nearly a $1 billion increase in venture capital going to the startups in its borders.
For perspective, we chart out venture funding for the past six years below:


The Research Triangle Region, anchored by the cities of Raleigh, Durham, Carey and Chapel Hill, draws the majority of venture funding that goes to North Carolina. The Charlotte area, a major financial hub that’s home to Bank of America, is a somewhat distant second.
For a sense of how Research Triangle specifically is performing on the startup funding front, we charted out investment to companies in the 15 largest towns and cities that make up the region:


To make sense of the numbers, it’s essential to take note of the dominant role Epic Games alone plays in the funding tallies. The Carey, North Carolina-based company has pulled in $4.5 billion in venture investment from VC and corporate backers since 2020, per Crunchbase data. That’s nearly half of all funding to the region. And while Epic remains a private company and several of its more recent rounds are classified by Crunchbase as venture investments, it was founded in 1991, so it’s no freshly minted startup.
Beyond Epic, other prominent local companies that have raised big rounds in the past couple years include:

Pathalys Pharma, a Raleigh-based developer of therapeutics for late-stage chronic kidney disease, raised $150 million in a January Series A.
FlexGen, a Durham-based developer of energy storage management software, pulled in $100 million in a July Series C. The fundraise came less than a year after its $150 million Series B.
Pendo, a Raleigh-based product analytics platform, has raised more than $350 million in venture funding to date, including $150 million in Series F investment in July 2021.

The Four Developments Propelling AI Forward: A Conversation With General Catalyst’s Deep Nishar,Gené Teare,2023/03/27,"

There are four distinct developments that propel artificial intelligence forward today, said Deep Nishar, a managing director at venture capital firm General Catalyst.
And Nishar would know.
The investor co-led the firm’s recent $350 million funding in Adept AI, a year-old company with a founding team that hails from OpenAI and Google Brain. The firm has also led investments in AI talent platform Eightfold AI and AI health care company Aidoc.

While the promise of AI has percolated for decades,  the sector has only heated up fairly recently with the launch of ChatGPT-3 in November and the fast iteration of GPT-4 last week.
Deep Nishar, managing director at General Catalyst
“ChatGPT is a meaningful step forward,” said Nishar. More important than the technology, “it has fired up the imaginations of nontechnical people. It’s probably the fastest thing that ever got 100 million users using it all at once.”
Nishar has been investing for the better part of eight years, and began his investing career at the SoftBank Vision Fund in 2015 where he led funding in AI hardware company SambaNova, and AI therapies company Deep Genomics. His career spanned across major technology companies. He joined Google in 2003 before it reached 200 employees and worked on advertising infrastructure, then the early mobile research which became Android. When storied investor Reid Hoffman reached out, he jumped to lead product and user experience at LinkedIn.
The AI evolution
Nishar sees four distinct developments that propel artificial intelligence forward today.
The first is the proliferation of really good algorithms. The seminal paper on the transformer models which underlie GPT came out of Google in 2017. Today, Nishar said, Google and OpenAI account for close to 50% of these algorithms.
Vast amounts of data is needed to train these models, which the internet provides — from text to speech to image and video.
The third part is computational power, which is getting better and better.
And finally, previously there were only a few hundred individuals from companies like DeepMind in the U.K., Google Brain, Facebook AI research and Apple who understood these models.
Now there are thousands of people who understand the math in these algorithms from both companies and universities.
Hundreds of millions
“One view is that any area that requires a lot of compute, and as a result of a lot of capital, becomes a harder venture investment,” said Nishar.
Investors have thrown hundreds of millions at the leading companies building AI models which include OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Adept AI, Inflection AI and Character.ai. These teams have come out of Google Brain and OpenAI, and have either launched or will be launching products in months to come, he said.


The stack
The technology stack that artificial intelligence developments impact is broad and mimics non AI companies, said Nishar.
They start with hardware chip companies like Nvidia, Cerebras, Graphcore and SambaNova to name a few. In the infrastructure software sector, companies like Anyscale compile the content and orchestrate the AI pipeline. This is followed by tools that help with training the data, from  companies including Snorkel and Weights & Biases. And then come the algorithms and apps at the top of the stack.
And there are a whole host of investment opportunities up and down the entire stack.
“We are trying to predict a surface area that has not been traversed before,” Nishar said.

First Citizens Buys Silicon Valley Bank’s Deposits And Loans,Chris Metinko,2023/03/26,"

First Citizens BancShares has agreed to buy the loans and deposits of the failed Silicon Valley Bank — the preeminent bank for tech startups.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. announced the deal late Sunday night.

The Silicon Valley Bridge Bank — which SVB became after it fell into receivership — had approximately $167 billion in total assets as of March 10, the FDIC said in a statement.
First Citizens BancShares’ deal includes the purchase of about $72 billion of the bank’s loans and other assets at a discount of $16.5 billion and $56 billion worth of the bank’s deposits. Approximately $90 billion in securities and other assets still remain in the receivership.
The 17 branches of Silicon Valley Bridge Bank will open as First–Citizens Bank & Trust Co. today, the FDIC said.
The Raleigh, North Carolina-based bank had earlier been reported as a suitor, along with Valley National.
The sale will bring some closure to one of the most dramatic bank collapses in U.S. history.
A timeline
On March 9, Silicon Valley Bank saw its stock price plunge after announcing it would sell $2.25 billion worth of stock — including $500 million worth of shares to private equity firm General Atlantic — to shore up its balance sheet.
The announcement led to deep concern around the venture world — SVB has relationships with more than 50% of all venture-backed companies in the U.S. and countless VC firms — about the bank’s liquidity and balance sheet strength and led to a run on withdrawals.
The bank unsuccessfully tried to sell itself and was shut down by banking regulators the following morning.
The bank takeover spread fear in the startup realm as many were left to wonder what would happen to their deposits and if they could do simple things such as meet payroll. However, about 48 hours later, regulators announced a plan to ensure depositors at the bank.
SVB’s collapse was due to both bad decisions and bad timing. During the recent venture capital boom, the bank was flush with cash as private companies raised huge sums of fresh capital at sky-high valuations. That cash was stuffed into the bank.
However, as the market has slowed with rising interest rates, that cash has dried up as deposits by startups dipped.
At the same time, SVB had decided to invest in long-term, higher-yield bonds. That decision proved disastrous, as when customers started to withdraw cash, the bank had to sell its $21 billion bond portfolio at a $1.8 billion loss.
The bank had hoped its proposed financing would fill that gap, but instead just spooked many of its customers.
A history
SVB was the dominant bank for tech startups and venture debt in the U.S., cultivating a reputation for close-knit relationships with the power brokers of venture and taking chances on young startups that most banks wouldn’t have the time of day for.
The bank was founded in 1983 by Bill Biggerstaff and Robert Medearis with an eye toward backing VC-backed companies — a still relatively new phenomenon at the time. From there it grew, even surviving the California real estate crash in the early 1990s. It provided banking services for up-and-coming tech companies such as Cisco Systems and Bay Networks.
Now, after 40 years, startups will have to look somewhere else for their financial needs — if such a place exists.
SVB wasn’t just a bank for VC-backed startups — it was “the” bank for such companies. One of the reasons SVB became the bank of choice was its venture lending practice. The bank had about $74 billion worth of loans on its books, with about 20% of that being from venture debt, according to those in the industry.
SVB also had a large private wealth management division that had significant synergies with its commercial banking operations — helping the same VCs and entrepreneurs with home mortgages and personal loans after it just helped their startup close a big financing round.
The SVB failure is the second-largest bank collapse in U.S. history. The largest collapse of a financial institution was Washington Mutual, which fell in 2008.

The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Benefits Startup Gravie And Character.ai Lock Up Huge Rounds,Chris Metinko,2023/03/24,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.

Rounds were small this week, with no round crossing the $200 million barrier. One has to wonder if we may be seeing some Silicon Valley Bank fallout, as the bank would help facilitate closing deals by providing a credit facility before VCs would actually collect money from LPs. It is important to remember that a lot of banks will provide that bridge — it’s very low risk for them — but in the immediate aftermath of SVB’s collapse, there could be some deals held up.
1. Gravie, $179M, insurance: Offering good health care benefits can be tough, even for large companies, as medical and health costs continue to spiral out of control. For small and medium-sized businesses, it can be even harder since they have more limited buying power. Employer health benefits startup Gravie is looking to help that market and raised a $179 million equity investment led by General Atlantic to do just that. The Minneapolis-based company plans to use the cash infusion to grow its flagship health plan for SMBs — called Comfort — among other expansion plans. Gravie currently works with more than 1,200 companies nationwide. Founded in 2013, Gravie has raised more than $340 million, according to Crunchbase data.
2. Character.ai, $150M, artificial intelligence: It isn’t a surprise another AI-startup raised a huge sum of cash — it is a surprise an AI startup didn’t lead this week’s list. Nevertheless, Palo Alto, California-based Character.ai is the newest unicorn in the space after closing a $150 million Series A at a $1 billion valuation led by Andreessen Horowitz. The round had been reported earlier this month. The startup allows people to create their own personalized AI chatbot using language models and deep-learning algorithms. The AI-created companions can help users draft emails, serve as a study buddy, brainstorm ideas or a variety of other activities. Character.ai joins the likes of OpenAI, Anthropic and Adept AI as startups in the AI space that have raised large rounds this year.
3. Amogy, $139M, cleantech: Cleantech and climate tech remain big among investors, who this week turned their attention to emission-free ammonia power. Amogy, which is developing just that, closed a $139 million Series B-1 fundraising led by SK Innovation. The new money will allow the Brooklyn-based startup to begin manufacturing its ammonia-to-power tech and bring its first product to market. In January, the company presented an ammonia-powered semitruck and later this year plans to show off a new ammonia-powered, zero-emission tugboat. If all goes right with that sail, the company expects its first commercial offering next year. Founded in 2020, the company has raised more than $200 million, per Crunchbase.
4. Flare Therapeutics, $123M, biotech: If you read Crunchbase News (and why wouldn’t you?), you know about how the “omics,” — genomics, metabolomics, proteomics and transcriptomics — are big right now in drug discovery. In 2021, funding in the area hit $2.5 billion. Last year, even in a  downturn, omics startups still raised nearly $2.4 billion, per Crunchbase data. Flare Therapeutics will help push those numbers up this year, as the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based startup raised a $123 million Series B co-led by GordonMD Global Investments and Pfizer Venture Investments. The funding will go to push its clinical trial expected to take place later this year.
5. Artera, $90M, health care: Prostate cancer is a common cancer, especially for men as they get older. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about 13 American men out of 100 will get prostate cancer during their lifetime, and about two to three of them will die. San Francisco-based Artera is looking to fight that. The startup uses artificial intelligence for cancer testing and personalized care. It raised a $90 million round to support the distribution of its flagship test for prostate cancer from investors that included Coatue, Johnson & Johnson Innovation, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Walden Catalyst Ventures, Time Ventures, Breyer Capital and The Factory, as well as several angel investors, including Marc Benioff. Founded in 2021, this is Artera’s first outside funding round, per Crunchbase data.
6. Cognito Therapeutics, $73M, biotech: Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Cognito Therapeutics, which is developing therapies to treat central nervous system diseases, closed a $73 million Series B led by FoundersX Ventures. Founded in 2016, Cognito has now raised $93 million, per the company.
7. Rain, $66M, fintech: Los Angeles-based financial wellness tools developer Rain locked up $116 million in funding this week — $66 million in equity and $50 million in debt — led by QED Investors and Invus Opportunities. Founded in 2019, the company has raised nearly $130 million, per Crunchbase.
8. (tied) Adeptia, $65M, data: Chicago-based data integration platform Adeptia raised a $65 million strategic growth investment round led by PSG. Founded in 2000, the company has raised just more than $70 million, per Crunchbase.
8. (tied) Apprentice.io, $65M, biotech: Jersey City, New Jersey-based Apprentice.io, creator of a drug development platform, closed a $65 million investment led by new investor Iconiq Growth. Founded in 2014, Apprentice.io has now raised $207 million, according to the company.
8. (tied) Placemakr, $65M, hospitality: Washington, D.C.-based hospitality startup Placemakr raised a $65 million round of funding from a number of VC investors including Highland Capital Partners. Founded in 2017, Placemakr says it has raised more than $350 million.
Big global deals
With big rounds being light in the U.S. this week, the biggest raises happened abroad.

China-based JD MRO, an industrial maintenance, repair and operations firm, raised a $300 million Series B.
Singapore-based fintech startup Kredivo Holdings closed a $270 million Series D.
Israel-based social trading and investment network eToro closed a $250 million venture round.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of March 18 to 24. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

Why Do So Few Biotech Startups Want To Be The Next Big Pharma Company?,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/03/24,"

After a decade in the pharmaceutical industry where she had a hand in developing prominent drugs including the immunosuppressive drug Humira, Shao-Lee Lin started her own biopharma company.
She founded Acelyrin in 2020, armed with $8 million in Series A funding. It was one of 165 Series A funding rounds in the space that year. In 2021, Lin said Acelyrin had the potential to become “the next Amgen,” a pharma company that has been around since the ’80s.
“We really are after building a long-term sustainable biopharma company that ultimately has fully integrated R&D as well as commercialization,” Lin told me when I was a reporter at dot.LA.

That reality is rare for up-and-coming biotechs. Of the top six pharmaceutical companies in the world ranked by 2021 revenue, four were founded in the 1800s. They’re names you know well: Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Pfizer and Roche.
But it has often been difficult for new entrants to join their ranks. More than $664 million in seed and pre-seed venture funding flowed to biotech startups in 2022, with more than $90 million raised so far in 2023. Yet none of these millions are likely to help build the next large pharma company on the scale of Merck and Pfizer. The steep costs of R&D and commercialization, as well as VC expectations for returns on their investments, are too complex for these often one-molecule startups, which can’t scale fast enough to compete.
“You rarely, these days, find aspirations of becoming a fully integrated pharmaceutical company,” said David Crean, a biotech investor who sits on the board of startups including Histogen and Amydis. “You very rarely will find somebody who says, ‘Hey, I want to be the next Amgen.’ ”
In 2022, pharma seeded 228 rounds that amounted to more than $664 million in funding, per Crunchbase data. History tells us that almost all of the funded startups will ultimately sell to a big pharma company.
An expensive venture
First, a quick primer on the typical lifecycle of a drug startup: Research begins at the university level, powered by grants. If a group of scientists finds a promising molecule that could develop into a drug, they will start a company. That startup is now on the hunt for funding that will power further research and development, as well as preclinical and clinical trials. The trials are meant to prove the drug is safe and efficacious, which is when the startup will usually try to sell to a bigger company.
“The reason they target that time to sell is because [trials] are expensive, but relatively inexpensive [compared to the rest of the process],” said Todd Thomson, COO and CFO of Kairos Ventures. “And now you’ve proven you’ve taken some of the big risks away and you can get a decent price.”
The later trials are often far more expensive and risky — the entire drugmaking process takes around 10 years and costs billions of dollars. In the process, 90% of drugs will fail.
The commercialization issue
Perhaps the biggest differentiator between small biotech startups and the huge pharma companies are in commercialization. Startups generally direct all their funding toward R&D in the lab, tinkering away at one or two promising molecules. But large pharma companies like Amgen have entire departments working on marketing strategies, intellectual property management, and sales pitches for several drugs. That is why so many startups are discouraged from forming commercialization departments.
“As an adviser, I tell startups all the time ‘don’t pursue it, it’s very, very expensive,’ ” Crean said. “To build a commercial infrastructure is incredibly expensive, and I think stupid, in terms of utilizing your capital.”
A good example of the intense commercialization process is Novo Nordisk and its push to commercialize the extremely popular weight-loss drug Ozempic, which was originally designed to lower blood sugar. The company sent fleets of pharmaceutical sales representatives knocking on doctors’ doors. It began a marketing campaign called “It’s Bigger Than Me” and nabbed Queen Latifah as a spokesperson. It even funded new coursework materials around obesity that would eventually be taught in medical schools.
Funding that kind of endeavor is near impossible for most startups, which usually have one or two molecules to their name.
“The only thing you have is that one other molecule, and now you have to stand up a sales force to try to sell this to all these doctors and hospitals across the U.S. and then across the world?” Thomson said. “It’s a very expensive proposition.”
New players
Acelyrin isn’t the only company trying to become a fully realized pharmaceutical company complete with R&D and commercialization departments. Kairos Ventures, which primarily invests in seed-stage biotech startups, has seen several founders of nascent companies who had hopes of competing in the big leagues.
“I think if you ask them directly what they really feel, they want to become the next Pfizer. That’s their ambition,” Thomson said. “If they really are going to go in that direction, then they’re going to need a lot more capital that we can provide.”
Combined, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Pfizer and Roche netted a healthy $2.9 trillion in revenue in 2021. That explains why new entrants have ambitions to get to the top.
And some new investors are looking to support exactly that. Time BioVentures is a new venture firm started in 2022 by biotech veteran Timothy Wright and rock star D.A. Wallach.
“The investment community [in biotech] tends to be very ‘asset centric.’ So when they look at a company that’s developing a portfolio of drugs, they’re thinking about it in terms of what each asset is worth and how likely each asset is something that a big pharmaceutical company would want to come and buy,” Wallach said. “They sometimes miss the broader picture, which is that an entrepreneur is trying to build a long-lasting company.
“A company is like a living organism, right?” Wallach added. “It’s a group of people who bring their talents together and bring capital together to do something innovative for a long time.”
But investing in lasting companies, especially in a sector as slow-moving as biotech, means investors are less likely to see a return on investment anytime soon. The current model of innovate-and-exit isn’t bound to phase itself out anytime soon.
“It’s a quick return to the market, to give money back to the shareholders on their growth in the equity,” Crean said. “And that, to me, is a more efficient model.”

Here’s What Every Founder Should Be Asking Their VCs Right Now,Guest Author,2023/03/24,"

By Matt Cohen
During times of economic uncertainty like those we currently face, founders must overcome numerous challenges in managing their businesses, teams and investor relations.
Cash flow becomes critical, sales may be declining, and fundraising can be more difficult. In such situations, founders need support from their VCs to survive and thrive in the long run.
However, this support is not automatic, and founders need to know what questions to ask their VCs to ensure they are getting the support they need.
Here’s what every founder should be asking their VCs right now (if they haven’t already):
Can you help us assess our cash runway?
During a downturn, cash is king and startups need to manage their cash flow carefully to survive. Founders need to ask their VCs for help in assessing their cash runway, which is the amount of time the startup can survive with the cash it has on hand. VCs can provide valuable guidance on how to extend the runway by reducing expenses or generating additional revenue. These conversations can also be essential building blocks for bridge-round deals.
What can we do to boost our revenue?
In a downturn, sales can be challenging, and startups need to find ways to boost their revenue. Founders should ask their VCs for advice on how to generate more revenue, whether it is by pivoting the business model, exploring new markets, improving the product offering, or even merging with other companies. Investors can also leverage their networks to provide introductions to potential customers or partners.
How can we cut costs without damaging the business?
During a downturn, startups need to be efficient with their spending to preserve their cash. However, cutting costs can be a delicate balancing act, as startups need to maintain their competitive advantage and not damage the business in the long run. Investor advice can be extremely impactful here — whether it’s helping to negotiate contracts, eliminating nonessential expenses, leveraging investor resources or sharing costs with other startups within their portfolio.
Matt Cohen of Ripple Ventures
What is the status of our funding round?
Fundraising can be more challenging during a downturn, and startups need to know where they stand with their next funding round. Founders should ask their VCs for updates on how their next funding round could be shaping up, including the status of negotiations, the amount of interest from investors, and any potential roadblocks. VCs can provide valuable guidance on how to position the startup for success during the fundraising process while leveraging their networks to gain more investor interest.
What other resources or connections can you provide?
During a downturn, startups may need additional resources or connections to survive and thrive. Founders should ask their investors for introductions to potential partners, customers or investors who may be interested in the startup’s product or service. VCs can also provide guidance on how to access government grants or loans, or how to leverage the resources of the startup ecosystem to boost the startup’s chances of success. Additionally, many VCs offer support for legal, accounting, marketing, design and more, as a means of differentiating their funds from the competition. Take advantage of these resources wherever available.
In conclusion
Founders need to be proactive in seeking support from their VCs during times of uncertainty. Investors want to do everything they can to support their portfolio, and by asking the right questions, founders can get the guidance and resources they need to survive. Founders should not be afraid to ask for help, as VCs are invested in the success of the startup and want to see it succeed. By working together, founders and VCs can weather the storm of a downturn and emerge stronger on the other side.

Kream Raises $168M As Secondhand Retail Sees Its Best Funding Year Yet,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/03/23,"

The secondhand retail market is getting bigger.
Kream, a secondhand clothing marketplace, announced on Thursday it raised $168 million in Series C funding, according to TechCrunch. The fresh funding put its valuation at $742 million and was led by Altos Ventures, a longtime investor in the company. SoftBank Ventures Asia, Samsung Securities, Naver and Mirae Asset Capital participated in the round. 

The company allows users to buy and sell secondhand luxury goods such as vintage clothing and designer bags. 
While the biggest tech companies have reported disappointing quarterly earnings, Kream has been doing pretty well. The company doubled its monthly active users between last October and March.
The circular economy revolution
Secondhand retail platforms have seen some action since the pandemic. While most industries saw a funding drop between 2021 and 2022, 2022 was the secondhand retail startup sector’s best year ever, garnering over $2 billion in venture funding according to Crunchbase data.
Online shopping became widely adopted as people were stuck indoors. Poshmark (acquired by Naver in January), started in 2011 and quickly became one of the most popular apps for reselling clothing, going public in 2021. Rent the Runway, a popular fashion rental marketplace, also went public in 2021. Tradesy, a peer-to-peer luxury resale platform similar to Kream, was acquired by Paris-based Vestiaire Collective in 2022. 
Kream and companies like it are part of a budding genre in fashion invested in the “circular economy,” the idea that fashion should revolve around repairs, resale and rentals. According to the United Nations, fast-fashion is responsible for around 8% to 10% of global emissions — more than aviation and shipping combined.
The secondhand reselling industry is growing too. Many platforms are adopting AI and automation tools to make the process of selling clothing as frictionless as possible. Software programs aimed at suggesting price points and descriptions, as well as tools that authenticate designer goods, have also come onto the scene.

Character.AI Hits Unicorn Status With $150M Raise As AI Craze Continues,Chris Metinko,2023/03/23,"

At this point, you can almost set your clock by it — every week there is a huge raise by an AI startup.
This week — like the last — the big round created a new unicorn as Character.AI closed a $150 million Series A at a $1 billion valuation led by Andreessen Horowitz. The round had been reported earlier this month.
The round also included participation from previous investors, including Nat Friedman — former GitHub CEO — Elad Gil, SV Angel and A Capital. 

The Palo Alto, California-based AI startup allows people to create their own personalized AI chatbot using language models and deep-learning algorithms. The AI-created companions can help users draft emails, serve as a study buddy, brainstorm ideas or a variety of other activities.
Investors just can’t get enough
Of course, Character.AI is far from the only AI startup this year to raise cash. Despite strong headwinds — like  a drop in venture financing and the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank — VCs and large strategics including Microsoft, Google and Salesforce1 all continue to show unabated interest in generative AI startups.
The craze started in January with news of Microsoft’s massive $10 billion investment into OpenAI — creator of ChatGPT.
Earlier this month, San Francisco-based AI startup and rival to ChatGPT, Anthropic, was reported to be raising another $300 million round at a pre-investment valuation of $4.1 billion. Spark Capital is reportedly leading the round.
That came just about a month after Anthropic raised between $300 million and $400 million from Google.
Finally, just last week, Adept AI raised $350 million in a Series B. It was reported the new money gives the San Francisco-based startup a post-money valuation of at least $1 billion.
Who will it be next week?

Getting To Series A Has Gotten Harder,Joanna Glasner,2023/03/23,"

For seed-funded startups, the odds of graduating to a Series A round have never been particularly favorable. But as venture funding contracts, the chances have gotten even slimmer.
That’s the broad finding from our latest perusal of U.S. Series A funding, which shows that investment is on track to hit the lowest quarterly total in over two years.

Things have been heading lower for a while now. Per Crunchbase data, Series A investment has fallen for five consecutive quarters, since peaking in late 2021. For perspective, we chart out funding totals and round counts for the past nine quarters below:


Biotech dominates for big rounds
Even though funding is down, there’s still an enormous chunk of change going into Series A. So far this year, investors have poured close to $4.5 billion into the deals at this stage nationwide.
They’re writing some big checks as well. At least five startups secured Series A investments of $100 million and up, and about 35 rounds exceeded $30 million.
As usual, life sciences companies captured most of the largest rounds in recent months. Top fundraisers include:

Paradigm, a New York-based startup developing technology aimed at simplifying clinical trials for doctors, researchers and pharmaceutical companies, raised a $203 million Series A round led by Arch Venture Partners and General Catalyst.
Cargo Therapeutics, a San Mateo, California-based biotech working on a next generation of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies for cancer, raised $200 million in a March Series A round led by Third Rock Ventures and RTW.
Rapport Therapeutics, a Boston-based developer of precision neuromedicines, raised $100 million in a March Series A, also led by Third Rock Ventures.

It’s common to see biotechs top the Series A ranking, which is a function of the fact that they’re expensive to scale. Biotechs also often tap public markets for capital in lieu of late-stage rounds, so early stage is a venture investor’s best chance to get in while a company is still private.
What we’re not seeing
While biotech is alive and well at Series A, the same can’t be said for other sectors that were hot several quarters ago.
Fintech and Web3 have been particularly out of favor at Series A, which is a finding we also noted for Series B. It’s an especially striking shift for fintech, which was the leading sector for venture investment in 2022 across stages.
So far this year, there have been just 30 disclosed-size Series A rounds totaling $598 million across all financial services categories, which includes such areas as cryptocurrency, consumer lending and digital banking. In the same period last year, $2.15 billion went to financial services.
Oddly, even funding to AI categories — one of 2023’s buzziest sectors — was down at Series A. Per Crunchbase data, $371 million in Series A funding went to companies applying or developing AI technology so far this year, down from $1.08 billion in the same period last year.
Not everything is down
While fewer seed-funded companies are closing Series A rounds, the good news is that for those who do, the typical check size is bigger.
So far this year, the median size of a Series A round was $12 million, per Crunchbase data, compared to $7.5 million in the same period last year. That’s not entirely a bullish signal — while rounds are sizable, there are fewer of them. Still, it’s something.
It also looks like the decline in peak to trough investment totals for Series A is less pronounced than for Series B. That said, Series A quarterly investment is still down about two-thirds from the highs hit in late 2021.
Will we reverse course and see things pick up again? That’s certainly the hope, and venture investors still have plenty of dry powder to make that happen. Even so, there’s little expectation we’ll be retracing previous highs anytime soon.

"
Spark Capital May Be Igniting Again,Chris Metinko,2023/03/23,"

Spark Capital certainly came in like a lion this March.
The San Francisco-based firm — whose previous investments include Twitter, Oculus and Slack — made headlines earlier this month as the lead investor in San Francisco-based AI startup Anthropic’s $300 million round at a valuation of more than $4 billion.

Less than a week after that news broke, Spark co-led another San Francisco company’s big round — this time Adept AI’s $350 million Series B that reportedly gave the startup a post-money valuation of at least $1 billion.
The two big rounds were a change of pace for Spark, which had significantly decreased its investment pace last year as the market cooled down and venture capital dramatically slowed — especially for big growth rounds.
Looking at the numbers
Like many firms, Spark Capital hit a high in dealmaking in 2021, per Crunchbase data. The company made 66 announced investments in deals that totaled $6.4 billion. It’smportant to note the amount any investor — including Spark Capital — invests as a specific stake in a round is not usually divulged.
Spark’s dealmaking pace hit a high in the second quarter that year, but has significantly slowed since.


Last year, Spark took part in 45 — a  more than 30% drop — rounds that totaled about $2 billion.
Both the Anthropic and Adept AI deals were large rounds to lead, which also is a recent change for the firm. Spark took a more hands-off approach to leading or co-leading big rounds last year when compared to 2021 — according to Crunchbase numbers.
In 2021, Spark led or co-led four rounds of more than $100 million:

Spark co-led New York-based blockchain security firm Fireblocks’ $310 million Series D and its $550 million Series E.
It led Toronto-based chatbot startup Ada’s $130 million Series C.
Co-led San Francisco-based Clarify Health Solutions’ $115 million Series C.

However, in 2022, the two biggest rounds Spark led or co-led were a $115 million Series B for San Francisco-based Afresh and a $40 million Series B for Serbia-based Tenderly.
In fact, Spark led or co-led only 15 rounds last year, but already has done four in 2023.
Only time will tell if Spark keeps up leading big rounds — nothing is hotter than all things AI at the moment — or if this month will prove an outlier and it goes into the rest of the year like a lamb.
Spark Capital did not return a request to comment.

"Bird Gets Cash, Now Worth Slightly More Than Founder’s Mansion",Joanna Glasner,2023/03/23,"

Bird, the scooter startup that once blazed the fastest trail ever to a unicorn valuation, is now worth a little more than the asking price of its founder’s Miami mansion.
While that doesn’t sound good, it’s actually an improvement from a few days ago. The scooter-sharing platform got a boost when it announced Tuesday that it has secured new funding.
That news sent shares skyrocketing about 25%, which sounds like a more momentous development than it really was. Bird shares were only selling for around 11 cents each on Monday, and the big lift took them to a whopping 13 cents. By Wednesday they were back around 12 cents.

So, investors may like Bird a little more than they did a few days ago. But they’re still treating it as a company likely going belly-up. Bird’s market capitalization — down 98% from its peak — is around $39 million. That is roughly the sum its founder was originally seeking for the South Florida mansion he bought in flusher times.
Scooting into oblivion?
It’s a sharp comedown for a one-time venture capital darling. Launched in 2017, Bird orchestrated one of the splashiest debuts in startup history with the fast rollout of its branded, standup scooter rentals in city after city.
Funding followed. The company pulled in over $600 million in VC funding over roughly two years. In 2021, it inked a deal to go public through a SPAC merger at a target valuation of $2.3 billion.
After listing on NYSE, money-losing Bird has been scooting downhill ever since. Founding CEO Travis VanderZanden stepped down in September, after seeing the value of his stake shrink along with the share price. The current CEO, Shane Torchiana, has been pushing the company on a cost-cutting path, touting goals such as a “rightsized footprint, focus on asset efficiency,” and “new cost discipline.”
It’s an uphill scoot. Bird bolstered the case for its imminent demise in its quarterly earnings report this month, disclosing that without fresh cash there won’t be enough money to meet obligations this year. This, it said, was one of multiple factors that “raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.”
Things looked a bit more encouraging this week, when Bird put out a press release announcing it secured additional funding, bringing total new capital to almost $33 million this year. The company said it is also expecting another $10 million. It may also help that while Bird does burn cash, it also generates sizable revenue, bringing in $245 million in 2022.
A losing bet
Still, even if Bird survives, the verdict on it as a venture investment is already clear: It was a losing bet.
For startup backers, the damage isn’t limited to Bird either. In total, well over $5 billion in venture funding went into assorted startups engaged in the renting, charging and making of scooters in roughly the past six years. Crunchbase identified at least 34 such companies, with Lime, Bird and Gogoro ranking as the most heavily funded.
Unlike most rivals, however, Bird is seeing its faltering fortunes play out very publicly on the public market.
Meanwhile, on the real estate front, things also aren’t working out as hoped for founder VanderZanden. After spending $22 million on a mansion formerly owned by a Venezuelan drug trafficker on the ICE most wanted list, the one-time scooter mogul hasn’t had much luck finding a new buyer. The asking price for the house, originally $40 million, has been cut to $33 million. Right now, that’s just a little bit less than Bird’s market cap.

Flare Therapeutics Raises $123M To Update Drug Discovery Targets,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/03/22,"

Flare Therapeutics, a drug discovery startup, announced on Wednesday it raised $123 million in Series B funding. The round was co-led by GordonMD Global Investments and Pfizer Venture Investments.
Funding will go toward powering its clinical trial, which is expected to take place later this year to delve into its oncology program.
The 2-year-old company, based in Massachusetts, is working in drug discovery, a recently revived startup sector that has been powered by the “omics,” — genomics, metabolomics, proteomics and transcriptomics — to find new drug targets.

“Transcription factors have long been viewed as prime therapeutic targets playing a key role in a broad range of diseases, particularly cancers, where they represent one-third of all oncogenes,” Rob Sims, co-founder and chief scientific officer at Flare, said in a statement. “While targeting transcription factors has the potential for incredible impact, their complex structure makes them notoriously difficult to drug, requiring a new approach and new thinking.”
The omics are a fast-growing sector in the private market and have quickly become a darling among biotech venture firms. In 2021, funding in the area peaked at around $2.49 billion. In 2022, despite the economic downturn, omics startups still nabbed around $2.4 billion, per Crunchbase data.
Drug discovery gets an update
Flare Therapeutics targets transcription factors and looks for something the drug can “stick” to once it is inside the body. This has been perhaps the biggest problem plaguing drug discovery. Scientists have spent decades using the same targets to create drugs instead of finding new ones. This is important: As a disease morphs and changes, it will look different inside the body and drugs need to be able to locate it in its new form or in its infant form before it severely affects the body.
Between 2017 and 2018, funding in drug discovery increased by 190%, according to Crunchbase data. This was in part thanks to the data collection tools that became popularized during that time.

"Even As Funding Dips, Top Web3 Investors Remain Active",Chris Metinko,2023/03/22,"

A year ago, Web3 was one of the buzziest words in the tech ecosystem.
Much of that hype has died down a year later, but the biggest investors in the space have remained very active.
While overall funding in Web3 was down last year from 2021, several top investors in the space such as Shima Capital, Animoca Brands and Y Combinator saw their numbers tick up in 2022, according to Crunchbase data.
In fact, about a dozen investors made 40 or more deals in the Web3 space last year — and for most that was an increase from 2021.


Leading the way
Those numbers are similar when also looking at firms that led or co-led the most rounds last year. Polychain led the way last year with 30 rounds led or co-led — per Crunchbase — just a slight drop from the 32 rounds the firm did in 2021. Others such Pantera Capital and Animoca Brands actually upped their numbers from 2021, both leading or co-leading more than 20 rounds.
In terms of dollars, Andreessen Horowitz led the way. The firm — with a heavy interest in crypto — led or co-led more than two dozen rounds worth nearly $1.6 billion, according to Crunchbase. That topped the 29 rounds it led or co-led worth about $1.4 billion in 2021.
Other firms including Tiger Global, Temasek Holdings, Paradigm and SoftBank Vision Fund all led or co-led rounds that totaled more than $1 billion last year. Out of that group, only Tiger saw the value of the rounds it led or co-led drop from 2021.
Of course, not everyone saw their numbers jump in a space where funding dipped. Coatue led or co-led nine rounds in 2021 that totaled $2 billion. Its numbers fell to only three rounds worth $469 million last year.
Similarly, Sequoia Capital saw its numbers dip from leading or co-leading seven rounds worth $2.8 billion in 2021 to only one round worth $135 million last year.
A slow decline
While those numbers do paint a rather robust picture of the Web3 industry, it is important to note almost all those firms saw their investment cadence tick down as last year progressed.
That is not surprising, as Web3 as a whole saw its numbers decline throughout 2022.


Through the first 10 weeks of this year, no firm had yet announced 10 deals in the space and the current quarter is on pace to be the sector’s worst in years.
However, the sector has proven somewhat resilient as investors seem fearful of missing out on the promise of Web3 and decentralized financing. 
That is especially true for crypto. While Web3 has sputtered at times, Bitcoin just had its best week since 2019 in terms of price gain — increasing more than 25%. That’s despite massive bank-related upheaval, including crypto-focused Signature Bank being taken over by the FDIC.
With funding down across almost all sectors and the fallout from the Silicon Valley Bank failure still being sorted out, it’ll be interesting to see if Web3’s top investors continue their pace from previous years — or if the current gradual slowdown becomes a full stop.
Methodology
For Web3 funding numbers we analyze investments made into VC-backed startups in both cryptocurrency and blockchain.

eToro Hooks $250M After SPAC Deal Fails,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/03/21,"

It looks like companies are still grappling with the frozen IPO market and dwindling valuations.
eToro, an Israel-based trading platform, announced on Tuesday it raised $250 million after its plan to go public via SPAC fell through.

Among participants of the round, which valued the company at $3.5 billion, included SoftBank Vision Fund 2, ION Group and Velvet Sea Ventures. 
eToro is another casualty of the financial whiplash in the private markets, where valuations soared in 2021 and was met in 2022 with a far stingier funding market. 
Same story, different startup
The company would have been valued at around $8.8 billion had it gone public, but the startup’s plan to IPO with the blank-check company FinTech Acquisition Corp V officially dissolved in July. 
The plan was pushed back multiple times. When it was first announced in March 2021, the deal was valued at $10.4 billion. Like Stripe, Klarna and several other startups, eToro’s valuation dropped in 2022 before the SPAC deal shuttered. 
There seems to be a pattern forming with late-stage companies. eToro, which was founded in 2007, isn’t the only startup pivoting after a failed attempt at going public. Fast-fashion retailer Shein attempted twice to IPO but was met with a frosty market. 
Perhaps going public is not completely off the books. Late-stage companies as old as eToro, Shein and Stripe have reportedly looked into taking their startups public to address expiring shares.
eToro allows users to trade stocks, crypto and other assets. The company was founded in 2007 and raised $582.7 million, according to Crunchbase data. The last traditional funding round eToro raised was in 2018, when it raised $100 million in Series E funds. Its most recent $250 million arrived via Advanced Investment Agreement, according to TechCrunch.

Cancer-Testing Startup Artera Raises $90M,Chris Metinko,2023/03/21,"

Artera, which uses artificial intelligence for cancer testing and personalized care, raised a $90 million round to support the distribution of its flagship test in prostate cancer.
Investors in the round included Coatue, Johnson & Johnson Innovation, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Walden Catalyst Ventures, TIME Ventures, Breyer Capital and The Factory, as well as several angel investors, including Marc Benioff.

The San Francisco-based startup’s prostate cancer test — ArteraAI Prostate Test — predicts therapy benefits in localized prostate cancer. The cash infusion will help distribute the test in the U.S. and internationally, and also be used in the development of tests to support therapy personalization in other cancers.
Artera just recently released data on its prognostic biomarker through six Phase III randomized trials. The study showed the startup’s multimodal AI prognostic biomarker’s ability to help enable personalized treatments.
Prostate cancer numbers
Prostate cancer is a common cancer, especially for men as they get older. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about 13 American men out of 100 will get prostate cancer during their lifetime, and about two to three men will die. The most common risk factor is age.
“The American Cancer Society estimates that more than 288,000 new cases of prostate cancer will arise in 2023, with more than 34,000 deaths,” said co-founder and CEO Andre Esteva, in a release. “AI has given clinicians and patients a powerful weapon in the fight against this disease. Clinicians can now leverage Artera’s unique test to prognosticate patient outcomes and personalize treatment decisions.”
Those numbers are substantially larger worldwide. In 2020, there were a total of more than 1.4 million new cases of prostate cancer and more than 375,000 related deaths.
Artera was founded in 2021.

Credit Suisse Also Played An Active Role In Startup Financing,Joanna Glasner,2023/03/20,"

When it came to startup funding, Credit Suisse was no Silicon Valley Bank. 
That said, the troubled Swiss banking behemoth, which was just acquired by rival UBS,  was no slouch in the venture investment and debt arena either.

Per Crunchbase data, Credit Suisse participated in at least seven venture or debt financing rounds for startups in the past year, including six that it led. Four of the financings were for U.S. companies, while three were for European startups.
Some of the Credit Suisse-led financings were pretty large ones, for companies including:

Curve, a London-based credit card and digital wallet platform offering cash and crypto rewards, closed on $1 billion in loans in December with a facility provided by Credit Suisse.
Sunbit, a Los Angeles-based buy now, pay later provider focused on unexpected everyday expenses like health care and repair bills, announced in December it had closed a $250 million revolving debt facility with an affiliate of Credit Suisse.
Wayflyer, a Dublin- and Atlanta-based provider of funding and marketing analytics for e-commerce companies, picked up $253 million in debt financing from Credit Suisse in September.
Wander, an Austin-based provider of short-term luxury rentals, secured a $100 million credit facility with Credit Suisse in November.

Over the past six years, Credit Suisse led over $3.4 billion worth of debt financings for at least 17 companies that have raised venture or seed funding, according to Crunchbase data. Fintech appears to be the biggest area of focus, with the majority of debt-funded companies coming from that industry, including well-known names like corporate card platform Brex and business lender Kabbage.
To a lesser extent, Credit Suisse was also a participant in equity funding rounds. Most recently, for instance, the bank took part alongside a long list of investors in a $24 million Series B round for Brooklyn-based energy technology startup BlocPower.
Beyond investments, Credit Suisse also has a history offering services, support and sponsored events for startups, with a particular interest in Swiss entrepreneurship. It offers startups tailored packages of banking services alongside potential access to its Credit Suisse investors’ platform to connect to capital providers.

"With 9,000 New Cuts, Amazon Leads With Most Tech Layoffs",Keerthi Vedantam,2023/03/20,"

Amazon announced on Monday it will lay off another 9,000 employees.
This round of cuts will largely impact Amazon’s darling AWS team, which works on cloud-related initiatives, PXT (Experience and Technology solutions), the advertising department and streaming service site Twitch.
Layoffs will likely take place no later than late April, since teams are still deciding which employees will be let go.

This is Amazon’s third round of layoffs since we began tracking these numbers in 2021. The company reportedly laid off 10,000 in November and another 8,000 in January, according to the Crunchbase Layoffs Tracker.
CEO Andy Jassy said these layoff-taking measures are part of Amazon’s plan to be “lean” — reduce headcount, shift resources away from low-priority projects, and improve customer experience.
“The overriding tenet of our annual planning this year was to be leaner while doing so in a way that enables us to still invest robustly in the key long-term customer experiences that we believe can meaningfully improve customers’ lives and Amazon as a whole,” Jassy wrote.
Strike three
Amazon’s most recent announcement means the company has laid off around 27,000 workers in less than a year. By comparison, Meta has laid off 21,000 employees in the same time period.
Both companies top the charts for cutting the largest number of tech workers since we began tracking layoffs.
It’s becoming obvious that even the big tech players are seemingly flying blind when it comes to layoff strategy
Previously we reported that large tech companies conducting several rounds of layoffs is pretty uncommon, given how multiple cuts can impact company culture and productivity.
But Amazon isn’t alone —Salesforce 1, Microsoft and Twitter have all announced several rounds of sweeping layoffs.
These companies grew like crazy in the golden age of 2021, hiring workers at unprecedented rates. It looks like there’s no consequence to these companies for hiring rapidly in the first place.

"The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Stripe Lands $6.5B, AI Craze Continues",Chris Metinko,2023/03/17,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.
Not many big rounds were announced this week, likely because everyone knew Silicon Valley Bank would dominate the headlines. Nevertheless, AI remained big.

Ever since January’s news of Microsoft’s massive $10 billion investment into OpenAI — creator of ChatGPT — the AI craze has been on among investors. Even SVB’s collapse couldn’t stop it this week. Last week, San Francisco-based AI startup Anthropic led the way with a $300 million round. This week it’s another San Francisco-based AI company coming in near the top. Investors seem to have blinders on for AI startups right now, so don’t bet against another big raise next week.
1. Stripe, $6.5B, fintech: The biggest round of the week went to payments giant Stripe, but it is not the typical huge, late-stage growth round. The South San Francisco-based company raised a $6.5 billion Series I at a $50 billion valuation. The valuation is a significant drop, as the company was valued at $95 billion in March 2021, and earlier this year it was reported this round would be at a $60 billion valuation. The company will use the new cash to provide liquidity to current and former employees and help offset a tax bill that will come due when it modifies employees’ stock grants that are set to expire (which we’ve talked about before). No lead investor was announced, but firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Founders Fund and General Catalyst participated.
2. Rippling, $500M, human resources: San Francisco-based HR management company Rippling was caught up in the collapse of SVB, its primary banking partner. It faced 50,000 employees across its customer base at risk of not getting paid in its Friday pay run. The company stepped in with $130 million of its own capital to support those customers. To meet payroll the following week, Parker Conrad, Rippling’s CEO, reached out to existing investor Neil Mehta at  Greenoaks, which led and closed a $500 million Series E funding that valued the company at $11.25 billion, the same valuation as its May 2022 Series D funding. 
3. Adept AI, $350M, artificial intelligence: Adept AI announced its $350 million raise even in the midst of the Silicon Valley Bank news. It was reported the new financing — led by General Catalyst and Spark Capital — gives the startup a post-money valuation of at least $1 billion. Spark Capital also reportedly led Anthropic’s round last week. Adept is developing AI models that don’t just respond to text commands — like a chatbot — but actually turn that command into actions. In theory, the company’s generative AI could help users do tasks from browsing the internet to navigating enterprise software tools. The company had previously raised a $65 million Series A. Nothing seems to be able to stop generative AI startups from raising large amounts of cash.
4. Element8, $200M, telecommunications: About a quarter of the U.S. does not have home broadband internet connections — with rural and minority communities seeing even lower rates of adoption, according to the latest Pew Research Center data. Dallas-based Element8, an internet service provider, is looking to change that and raised a $200 million strategic investment from Digital Alpha to help with that effort. E8 also announced it has acquired Oklahoma City-based high-speed internet provider AtLink Services for an undisclosed sum to make it a pretty busy week. Founded in 2015, this is the company’s first outside funding, per Crunchbase.
5. Mediar Therapeutics, $85M, biotech: Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Mediar Therapeutics closed a $105 million financing, including a recent $85 million Series A round co-led by Novartis Venture Fund and Sofinnova Partners. What was especially noticeable, however, was it also involved a lot of big names in the pharmaceutical world — including Pfizer Ventures, Bristol Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly. The startup is developing therapies for fibrotic disease, which is caused by chronic inflammatory disease and can lead to the shutdown of organs. Founded in 2019, the company has now raised nearly $117 million, per Crunchbase.
6. Nimble Robotics, $65M, robotics: Everybody orders things online, and everyone wants that important order for a stuffed animal, candlesticks or mango slicer fulfilled as quickly as possible. If it’s by a human or robot, it really doesn’t matter. San Francisco-based startup Nimble has created a fully autonomous logistics and robotics platform that helps warehouses deliver everything as fast as possible. This week Nimble locked up a $65 million Series B led by Cedar Pine, bringing its total capital raised to $115 million, per the company. According to the company, its robotic fulfillment systems will pick, pack and ship orders while also shrinking warehouse size by up to 75%. At least until we start ordering more stuff.
7. Switch Therapeutics, $52M, biotech: South San Francisco-based Switch Therapeutics, which is developing new ways to use RNA science to treat diseases, launched this week with a $52 million Series A co-led by Insight Partners and UCB Ventures.
8. Fairmatic, $46M, insurance: New York-based commercial auto insurance provider Fairmatic raised $46 million in new funding led by Battery Ventures. Founded in 2019, Fairmatic has raised $88 million to date, according to the company.
9. Clever Care, $42M, health care: Westminster, California-based health care company Clever Care closed a $42 million Series C led by GV. Founded in 2019, the company has raised nearly $140 million, per Crunchbase.
10. Zus Health, $40M, health care: Boston-based Zus Health, a shared health data platform closed a $40 million round from investors that  included Maverick Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz Founded in 2020, the company has raised $74 million, according to Cruchbase.
Big global deals
The largest round outside the U.S. came from India this week.

Lenskart, an online shopping portal that sells eyewear, landed a $500 million venture round.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of March 11 to 17. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.











Clarification: This story has changed since its original publication to include a late-breaking funding round.

"
Here Are 3 Big Areas Where AI Is Cropping Up In Agtech,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/03/17,"

While Silicon Valley has transformed every industry from health care to banking, agriculture has remained largely untouched — until now.
Ever since OpenAI’s breakthrough with ChatGPT, the term AI has been thrown around so many times it’s starting to lose its meaning. Nevertheless, artificial intelligence has seeped into every industry from enterprise software to autonomous vehicles, taking around 10% of global venture dollars in 2022.

Agriculture has not been immune to the AI revolution that has gripped the tech world. It’s perhaps one of the most interesting use-cases for AI. While ethicists lament racism and bias embedded into algorithms — and ChatGPT gets weirdly perverse — AI in agtech is playing a much more consequential role in furthering two goals for agtech: making lots of food, and doing it sustainably.


“AI in agriculture is much less about disrupting the grower. It’s not,” said Rien Kamman, CEO and co-founder of Netherlands-based greenhouse startup Source.ag. “These growers and farmers, they’re truly amazing. They’re craftsmen. They’re really good at what they do. But we need to give them all the tools they need to be successful.”
Here are some of the most promising applications of AI in the agriculture section.
Indoor farming
Indoor farming, either by way of greenhouses or hydroponics-driven vertical farming, has been the apple of Silicon Valley’s eye when it comes to agtech. Around 20% of funding in the sector was dedicated to indoor farming in 2022, Crunchbase data shows.


For example, Source.ag uses AI to make granular adjustments to water, electricity and heat within indoor farming setups. The process allows growers to cut down on energy usage while almost guaranteeing how much produce they will yield at the end of the season.
“It’s kind of bizarre,” Kamman said. “A pilot has a lot of support systems, like an autopilot and a way to help chart the right route. But a lot of farmers and growers do not have such advanced support systems.”
The largest funding rounds for agtech in 2022 came from startups using AI in indoor farms to control humidity, airflow and water. Plenty, a vertical farming startup that sells lettuces, raised $400 million in January. Gotham Greens, its competitor, raised $310 million in September.
Soli Organic, which raised $125 million in October, uses a combination of proprietary fertilizer and AI to grow its produce indoors.
“We also do this multivariate analysis of climate where you can look at the relationships among humidity and airflow and carbon dioxide and the fertilization and the lighting,” said Matt Ryan, CEO of Soli Organic. “What combination of factors gives you the best recipes for growing each crop? So we are used to that AI-driven technology just like everybody else is.”
Crop protection
Crop protection is one of the farmers’ biggest issues. In order to grow more plants, farmers need to shower pesticides and other treatments over acres of land that can be fatal to nearby crops and bees, and contribute to water pollution.


But new technologies aim to target plant-killing agents with precision. Enko Chem, a Connecticut-based crop protection startup, functions almost exactly like AI-driven drug development platforms in the pharmaceutical industry. AI, after scanning through a database of plant and disease compounds, targets the unique compounds found in a specific disease or insect while sparing crops and the rest of the ecosystem.
“If you can target a very specific pest instead of saying, ‘Well, we’re an herbicide, so we will annihilate all plants,’ and if you can be very selective for the pests that you’re going after, not only do you get better efficacy, but you’re better for the environment,” said Jacqueline Heard, CEO of Enko Chem.
Other companies, such as Canada-based Precision AI, use drones and AI to map out exactly which parts of a farm need to be sprayed with crop protection products. It also measures how far the product will be sprayed.
Weather forecasting
Weather forecasting startups have quickly found favor in insurtech, proptech, travel and defense. But they’re also quickly making their way into agtech.
Since the majority of agriculture happens in open fields, farmers are adopting technologies that not only predict the weather, but also offer insights on how it will impact crops.


Startups such as California-based Jupiter Intelligence warn agriculture workers of potential droughts, wildfires and floods in their area so they can prepare for sudden weather changes.
“AI-based systems can give much more predictive insight to what the likely risk ranges are for farmers,” said Jason Pontin, a partner at DCVC and investor in Jupiter. “You can buy better financial products, like insurance products, since you’re literally betting the entire farm.”
Another, California-based startup, ClimateAI, allows growers to not only anticipate weather changes, but take advantage of them. If a specific area is expected to see more rainfall, growers can plant crops that rely on more rain.
The promise and pitfalls of AI
While AI is promising, the majority of the farming world doesn’t have access to the kind of cloud technology or internet access that allows AI to make acute real-time predictions or automate certain processes.
Nevertheless, startups are heralding it as a quickly adopted nascent technology.
“AI is being used across so much of agriculture today and that adoption was faster [than what we’ve seen before],” said Heard. “A lot of progress will be made because it accelerates everything. It makes drug discovery faster, it accelerates breeding. It allows farmers to predict where and when they need to add inputs to their farm.”
There may come a time when, like crypto and web3, the AI bubble bursts. But for now, it’s plowing forward.

"
Survey Shows Startup Trust Damaged By Silicon Valley Bank Fallout Despite FDIC Involvement,Guest Author,2023/03/17,"

By Yael Benjamin
Trust is a key pillar of the banking system, a pillar that has been shocked to its core over the past few days with the fall of Silicon Valley Bank.
Despite the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. stepping in, has trust actually been restored within the wider startup community? At Startup Snapshot, we collected data from over 100 startup founders globally over the past several days in order to assess founder sentiment.
The data was collected in partnership with Intel Ignite, Consiglieri and the Zell Program at Reichman University.

The data highlights one clear fact: The broken trust in the startup community is far from repaired as founders question the regional banks and the bankers who run them.
Broken trust with the regional banking players
The dominant too-big-to-fail banking players are the clear winners coming out of the past few days. Even though these larger banks, such as JP Morgan Chase or Citibank, do not specialize in startups, the majority of founders stated that they will move or consider moving their funds there. The shift in preference to larger dominant banks can be seen both by startups that have been affected by the SVB collapse and those that have not, according to survey results.
Yael Benjamin, founder of Startup Snapshot
Naturally, those that have been personally affected by the SVB fallout are more likely to move their funds, with 53% reporting they will definitely move their banking relationship to a more dominant player, and 32% reporting they will potentially move.
Despite not having been personally affected, 61% of founders who have not been touched by the SVB crisis will move or consider moving their banking relationship to those they view as more “stable” players.
The startup survival dilemma
In a conversation about the results, Nimrod Vromen, CEO of Consiglieri, likened the situation to the prisoner’s dilemma in game theory, in which two individuals (in this case startups) acting in their own self-interests do not produce the optimal outcome.
The highest reward for all startups would be to cooperate and leave their funds in SVB, instead of moving to larger banks that do not specialize in high-tech investments and do not offer venture loans with the same competitive terms.
Yet, when faced with the panic of the situation, each startup tried to optimize their personal outcome, withdrawing their cash from SVB.
All the startups acted in the same way, withdrawing their funds in droves, a move that led to the eventual downfall of the bank. According to Vromen, “strategically speaking, this shift will cause startups to have less favorable venture debt terms in the future, as the large dominant banks, which don’t specialize in venture, will be the ones that control the avenue of startup funding.”
Broken trust with the bankers themselves
Startup founders are also questioning whether the collapse was actually such a big surprise for those on the inside. When asked whether they think SVB bankers knew the risk that they were facing, the majority think they might have.
Of the founders surveyed, 31% reported that they think SVB bankers knew the risk they faced, and an additional 40% believed they might have known about the risk. Only 14% said the bankers did not know.
The data highlights the glaring lack of trust of the startup community in the regional banks and the bankers who run them, raising questions as to whether they are actually more vulnerable than we think or whether stability has actually been restored.

Andes Raises $30M To Turn Farmland Into Carbon-Sucking Machines,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/03/16,"

Some of the largest tech companies in the world have pledged to go carbon-negative within the next few years by purchasing carbon offsets — credits for funding wind farms or other sustainable energy projects. 
But there may be a way to turn acres of rolling fields in the U.S. into carbon capture mills without building energy systems.
Andes, a climate tech startup from California, announced on Thursday it raised $30 million in Series A funding, bringing total funding to $38 million, per the company. Investors such as Leaps by Bayer, Cavallo Ventures and Germin8 participated in the raise.

The company leverages microorganisms that live in large patches of farmland to capture carbon dioxide and convert it into minerals, which reduces greenhouse gasses. 
“Catastrophic climate disasters that jeopardize human life and natural resources are inevitable without high-permanence, scalable carbon sequestration,” said CEO and founder Gonzalo Fuenzalida in a statement.
One of the most popular seed-stage funding categories
Around 52% of the land in the U.S. is dedicated to agriculture. This kind of technology has the ability to turn swathes of land into carbon-sucking ecosystems. 
And investors are taking note. At the beginning of the year, Crunchbase News identified carbon capturing companies as among the most popular categories for seed-stage funding. Lithos Carbon, which raised $6.3 million in 2022 to help farmers reduce greenhouse gasses, raised $6.3 million in 2022. 
What’s perhaps most fascinating about companies like Andes is how they integrate pretty seamlessly with agriculture practices. Farmers simply mix these organisms into soil along with plant seeds.
As the plant grows, those microorganisms shelter with its roots to suck carbon dioxide out of the air and convert them into minerals. When rainfall occurs, those minerals sink deeper and deeper into the soil which improves soil nutrient content, helps with water drainage, and decreases the likelihood of plant diseases.
For a long time, this kind of technology was only available to soybean farmers. They would use Bradyrhizobium, a nitrogen-fixing bacteria, that improved yield while acting as a natural fertilizer. But it wasn’t easy for other crops to live peacefully with Bradyrhizobium.

Boxed Teeters On Brink Of Bankruptcy,Joanna Glasner,2023/03/16,"

Another day, another high-valuation venture-funded company teeters on the cusp of closure.
Today, it’s Boxed, a one-time startup investor darling that set out to remake the warehouse bulk-buying experience for the online age.

The New York-based company, which raised over $240 million in venture funding before going public via a SPAC merger 15 months ago, told investors this week that it is contemplating a bankruptcy filing.
In a securities filing, Boxed said it is still pursuing several potential avenues, including an agreement to restructure outstanding debt, a merger or acquisition by another entity, or the dissolution of the company. The company also said it laid off staff and cut operating expenses to reduce overhead.
The news follows steep stock declines for 10-year-old Boxed, which was recently trading for under 20 cents a share, valuing the company below $15 million. Shares have remained below $1 each for over six months.
Times have changed
It’s a sharp contrast to December 2021, when Boxed made its market debut after completing a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company, Seven Oaks Acquisition Corp. The deal initially set a $900 million valuation for Boxed, and included $334 million in cash for the company.
Boxed shares were trading for over $13 each at their peak in late December 2021, weeks after the SPAC merger’s completion. The stock price plummeted in spring of 2022, amid widening net losses for Boxed and a broader selloff in the tech and e-commerce sectors. For Q3 of 2022, net revenue declined as well, contributing to stock price woes.
It’s not looking like a happy ending for a startup once considered a rival for the likes of Costco. For now, however, the Boxed site remains operational, with top products including paper goods and bulk snacks. However, per an article in The Wall Street Journal, the company is actively soliciting proposals for the sale of all or most of its assets to improve its liquidity position.
Prior to going public, Boxed raised funding from a host of well-known venture firms, including Greycroft, Founders Fund, DST Global and GGV Capital.

Sam Bankman-Fried Received Billions From FTX-Related Entities,Chris Metinko,2023/03/16,"

Disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and other related executives received $3.2 billion in payments and loans, mainly from FTX-related crypto hedge fund Alameda Research, according to FTX’s new managers.
About $2.2 billion of that total went to Bankman-Fried himself, according to a release. Ex-FTX director of engineering Nishad Singh received the second-highest amount — $587 million. Singh already has pleaded guilty to charges including fraud and conspiracy.
The $3.2 billion does not include more than $240 million spent to purchase luxury property in the Bahamas, and make political and charitable donations as well as “substantial transfers” to subsidiaries in the Bahamas and other jurisdictions.

“The FTX debtors are investigating causes of action against the recipients of these transfers and their subsequent transferees,” the release said.
The story so far
FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in November after it was not able to repay customers who had deposited funds on its exchange. 
FTX was the fourth-largest crypto exchange by volume when it failed, and Bankman-Fried was one of crypto’s biggest evangelists and financial backers. Through FTX Ventures and his other trading firm Alameda Research, the crypto whiz kid made hundreds of bets on the industry and the future of digital finance.
Investors in FTX included big names like Sequoia Capital, NEA, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Insight Partners, Temasek, SoftBank Vision Fund, Thoma Bravo, SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Coinbase Ventures.
At its peak, FTX and FTX US — its U.S.-based exchange — were valued at $32 billion and $8 billion valuations, respectively.
In December, federal prosecutors charged Bankman-Fried with a slew of criminal counts after his arrest in the Bahamas — including conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud, individual charges of securities fraud and wire fraud, money laundering and conspiracy to avoid campaign finance regulations.
Bankman-Fried has denied any wrongdoing and is out on bail. His fraud trial is to start in October.

Pooptech Startups Are Passing The Smell Test,Joanna Glasner,2023/03/16,"

Pooping, burping and farting might sound like subjects more likely to elicit excitement from a gathering of toddlers than a group of venture capitalists.
But in reality, technologies tied to these most basic of bodily functions are drawing some large investments, with both agtech and cleantech venture firms leading the way.
Per an analysis of Crunchbase funding data, startups addressing ways to manage livestock and human waste have collectively pulled in hundreds of millions to date, with much of that piling up in the past couple of years. Several companies that had raised seed or early-stage funding when we last tackled this subject in 2021 have since closed larger follow-on rounds.

Startups in what we are affectionately calling the pooptech (and farttech) space make for an ambitious cohort. Below, we curated a list of 14 that raised funding in recent years for everything from methane-reducing seaweed supplements to technology for converting waste to fertilizer.


Where investment is piling up
The largest funding recipient on our list — Oslo-based N2 Applied — has raised over $50 million in venture investment and grants for technology that enables farmers to make fertilizer using slurry (livestock feces and urine), nitrogen from the air, and renewable energy.
In a similar vein, Sistema.bio, with offices in Mexico, Colombia, Kenya and India, has raised over $38 million to scale-up its offering of “biodigesters” that turn organic wastes into fertilizer and biogas for thermal energy.
Australian startup Rumin8, meanwhile, has pulled in nearly $18 million for a feed supplement that reduces methane emissions in livestock. The company says it is “on a mission to decarbonise 100 million cattle by 2030.”
Overall, most funded companies on our list are focused on solutions for livestock waste. We did, however, also identify a couple recently funded companies working on human waste technologies: Epic Cleantec, which makes wastewater reuse systems for buildings, and Wasted, which turns human waste into fertilizer.
Investment and partnerships are increasing
On the animal waste front, one might ask why a sizable influx of money is going to the space now. A more apt question, per agtech investors, may be why so little was going into it previously.
“We see animal agriculture as underfunded and underinvested from a venture capital perspective. I think it’s an enormous opportunity” said Brandon Day, chief operating officer of The Yield Lab Institute, an organization tied to agtech investor The Yield Lab that focuses on agriculture innovation.
This isn’t a new perspective for St. Louis-based The Yield Lab. The seed-stage investor instigated interest in the space back in 2019 with its “Manure Challenge,” an accelerator program for entrepreneurs with new approaches to managing animal waste.
Several Manure Challenge finalists have since raised venture funding. Given the infrastructure expenditures required in scaling many proposed technologies, mentors and backers have also focused on corporate partnerships along with funding.
That’s part of the strategy for N2 Applied, for instance, which recently entered a strategic partnership with GEA, an $8 billion German industrial conglomerate with a farm technologies division. Per the agreement, GEA is manufacturing machines using N2’s technology for installation on dairy farms.
Another challenge alum, North Carolina-based Phinite, has worked with pork producer Smithfield to scale its waste drying system, which can transform pig excrement into renewable fertilizer, Day said.
Ecological impacts
In addition to agtech and strategic investors, featured companies are drawing backing from sustainability-focused investors.
Rumin8, for instance, counts Bill Gates-backed Breakthrough Energy Ventures as a lead investor for a $12 million round it closed in January. For a fund founded around the mission to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero, it’s a logical fit.
Why? As Rumin8 rival Volta Greentech puts it: “There are around 1 billion cows on the planet. Together they produce over 4% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions just by farting and burping 1 methane gas. That’s 2x more emissions than the world’s fleet of airplanes.”

The Billion-Dollar Exits Board: Track Large IPOs And M&A Deals From Boom Times To Downturn,Gené Teare,2023/03/16,"

Editor’s Note: Crunchbase News has launched The Crunchbase Billion-Dollar Exits Board, a curated list of U.S. startup exits — IPOs, SPACS, mergers and acquisitions, and other deals — valued at $1 billion or more, powered by Crunchbase’s comprehensive data.
It’s somewhat difficult to imagine today, but just two short years ago the IPO markets were booming, and startup founders, investors and employees enjoyed liquidity like they’d never experienced before.
In fact, just in the U.S., 182 companies valued at $1 billion or more went public in 2021. Their collective value at their public debuts was $906 billion.

But since then, billion-dollar exits have slowed dramatically. There were just 29 U.S. companies that exited in 2022 and counts have slowed to single digits per quarter. As IPOs and large M&A deals have waned, SPAC deals have dominated among startup exits.
That’s all from an analysis of the The Crunchbase Billion-Dollar Exits Board, our new list of large IPOs, mergers, acquisitions and other exit deals by U.S.-based startups.
Unprecedented year for startup exits
In 2021, we saw three of the largest seven U.S.-based exits by value since 2000: Coinbase, valued at $86 billion; Rivian at $66.5 billion; and UiPath at $35 billion. The values of the three companies have all fallen more than 75% since then.
The number of U.S. companies that went public in 2021 more than tripled year over year from 51 companies, and the aggregate value more than doubled from 2020’s $350 billion.


IPOs fall, SPACs rise
But as the markets turned, special-purpose acquisition company listings came to dominate in 2022. In 2021’s peak market, 83 SPAC mergers were listed, representing 46% of U.S.-based billion-dollar debuts.
In 2022, as the public markets slowed, SPAC listings numbered just 25 — but that marked 86% of all 29 public debuts.


So far in 2023, just two companies have gone public above $1 billion in value, both via SPACs: Chicago-based carbon capture company LanzaTech and Houston-based Intuitive Machines, a space exploration company.
Large M&A deals drop off
In line with IPO trends, the number of billion-dollar M&A deals were high in 2020 and in 2021, but fell in 2022.
Figma, acquired by Adobe in September 2022, was the largest venture-backed acquisition of all time. The second largest in the past three years was Mailchimp acquired by Intuit in 2021.


In the market downturn, the gap between IPO exits and M&A narrowed in 2022.
In 2022, seven U.S. companies were acquired for more than $1 billion, compared to 28 companies in 2021 and 26 in 2020.


Will the IPO market rebound this year? If not, will SPACs continue their small resurgence? Will M&A play a bigger role in 2023? Follow along as we track the answers to these questions and more on the Billion-Dollar Exits Board.
If we are missing any companies, please reach out to me at gene@crunchbase.com.
Methodology
The Crunchbase Billion-Dollar Exits Board includes exits by U.S. venture-backed companies valued at $1 billion or more, starting in 2020.
This is distinct from The Crunchbase Unicorn Board, which tracks companies with private financing at a billion-dollar valuation. Many companies exit at over $1 billion without reaching unicorn status as a private company.
Companies are included on this list based on their IPO value or M&A deal price. After exiting, a company’s value could fall below $1 billion or could be delisted. We still keep the company on this list based on its date and value upon going public. Should a planned merger be canceled, the deal will be removed from this list.
We only include a company’s first exit. For example, Qualtrics was acquired in 2018 by SAP for $8 billion. Its subsequent IPO in January 2021 is not included on this list as the company had already exited.
All funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.

In Their Own Words: What Silicon Valley Bank Meant To The Valley,Gené Teare,2023/03/14,"

Uncork Capital, one of the earliest seed-stage funds in Silicon Valley, banked exclusively with Silicon Valley Bank. On Friday, it had its 11 bank accounts frozen as news came out that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. had taken over the bank.

It was the end of a 15-plus year banking relationship with SVB for Uncork Capital.
Jeff Clavier, founder and managing partner of Uncork Capital
“For the last 30 years, they have been a prime facilitator and supporter of the innovation ecosystem,” said Jeff Clavier, founder and managing partner of Uncork Capital, which was previously called Soft TechVC, via email.
“Of course, there are other banks,” said Clavier. “But no one has the deep connections that the SVB community had created over the years.”
Clavier worked to convince SVB to lend to seed-stage startups, something other banks were unlikely to do based on the risk profile of startups.
Miriam Rivera, CEO, co-founder and managing director at Ulu Ventures
“That is one of the big reasons that a lot of tech startups were so concentrated with Silicon Valley Bank,” said Miriam Rivera, CEO and co-founder at Ulu Ventures. “They really understood a lot of this market, understand the level of risk, and are willing to make available credit to small businesses,” she said.
Before SVB’s founding in 1983, “it was difficult, if not impossible, for a start-up to secure a relationship with a large, established bank,” Sequoia Capital partner Michael Moritz wrote in the Financial Times on Sunday. “Small west coast technology companies were incomprehensible or insignificant to the large east coast banks whose customers included international airlines, heavy industry and nationwide retailers. Our companies, often started by people in their twenties, were bypassed or ignored.”
Rivera is now guiding her portfolio to engage in strong cash management and retain more than one banking partner. With less liquidity in the market, customers will become more conservative with their spend, she said.
Ulu Ventures banks with First Republic, another regional bank with strong ties to Silicon Valley whose stock was down 60% on Monday. Still, Rivera worked with SVB because 44% of Ulu’s 150 portfolio companies banked there.
‘A critical supporter’
One of the biggest concerns for startups is access to credit, which SVB supplied, Rivera said.
However, early-stage startups with less than $5 million in revenue represented a small portion, only 3%, of SVB’s loan business.
A larger proportion of SVB’s loan business — around 56% — catered to private equity and venture firms to support their capital commitments to startups, a business that was very low risk for the bank, but played a role in facilitating capital deployment for funds.
Venture firms could deploy capital quickly once they made investments in startups by using loan financing from SVB. Firms would then follow up to get that capital from their limited partners over time.
That helped to streamline the funding process, Rivera said. “We don’t necessarily have to make sure that dozens of LP checks have come in the door before we can actually wire money to a startup company,” she said.
Jenny Fielding, managing partner at The Fund
Jenny Fielding worked with SVB as the managing director of Techstars, and more recently as a managing partner at The Fund. “SVB was a critical supporter of so many founders and investors in the ecosystem,” she said via email.
Fielding was recently a host to a women’s angel breakfast that SVB sponsored and was due to co-host an upcoming pre-seed event with SVB.
The international angle
SVB also played an important role in providing U.S. banking services to international startups looking to set up in the U.S.
SVB helped one of The Fund’s Brazilian portfolio companies open an account in the U.S. as it is not easy to set up banking without a Social Security number. The startup has since raised Series A funding, something that likely wouldn’t have happened otherwise.
Around 30% of The Fund’s portfolio companies banked with SVB. The firm also held funds with SVB for its management company that were covered by the FDIC, but not for its funds for investments.
For Clavier it was personal as well. “They were banking a lot of us personally at the SVB Private Bank, and offered essential tools like capital call lines, mortgages, etc.” he said. “Their services facilitated our professional and personal lives, and it will be hard to replace those — and the people behind them who had become dear friends after so many years of working together.”

"SVB, Signature Shutdowns Not Chilling Crypto",Chris Metinko,2023/03/14,"

Regulators shutting down both Silicon Valley Bank and New York-based Signature Bank this week — not to mention the liquidation of Silvergate Capital just last week — seemed like it would cause serious trepidations in the crypto market.
However, if crypto has proven anything through the years, it’s that it will do the unexpected.
Bitcoin prices are up nearly 25% since SVB’s troubles came to light, while ether prices have jumped more than 20% in that same time period.
To be sure, SVB is the bank dominating headlines right now and is not nearly as intertwined into the crypto marketplace as Signature and Silvergate. Both those banks had heavy crypto ties, with two of the biggest 24-hour payment systems available to investors.
Nevertheless, SVB had both crypto startups and investors as depositors — with their money in limbo until bank regulators announced a plan Sunday to make them whole. 
SVB played a role in perhaps the largest crypto scare over the past weekend, when Circle — an issuer of the stablecoin popular USD Coin — announced it had $3.3 billion stuck at SVB. 
A slight panic overtook the industry, as USD Coin is a popular stablecoin for investors to park and store money in. The stablecoin — which is supposed to be pegged to the U.S. dollar at a one-to-one rate — dropped several cents below $1. 
However, even that fright lasted only briefly — like other depositors, Circle had access to its funds Monday — and crypto prices have remained robust.
The fall of SVB and the other banks may actually have brought in some small increase in confidence from investors in decentralized finance. Bitcoin was created due to the global financial crisis of 2008 and people’s distrust of structured financial systems after all.
That confidence is not at an all-time high right now.
That does not mean crypto is set to take off to November 2021 highs. Significant issues remain, like large exchanges such as Coinbase likely need to find some new banking partners. 
The SVB bank run also illustrated what a liquidity crisis can look like — something to which crypto is still susceptible.
The current crypto gains also seem to be bucking the trend of prices being correlated to the broader market — something that seems unsustainable with so many large financial institutions being active in crypto.
Nevertheless, at least for a moment decentralized finance may be showing some of the promise that it has.

SVB’s Demise Cools An Already Chilly Climate For Startup Funding,Joanna Glasner,2023/03/14,"

For the U.S. startup funding ecosystem, Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse looks like the equivalent of adding ice to an already cold bath.
Already, venture funding has contracted sharply from its peak. In the fourth quarter of 2022, North American startup investment was down 63% year over year, driven largely by plummeting later stage financings.

We expect the first quarter of this year to come in far lower than Q4. Contributing factors include an absence of pre-IPO rounds, diminishing Series B volume, and waning enthusiasm for formerly hot sectors, including fintech, Web3 and consumer products.
The SVB situation also appeared to put a pause on large funding announcements. In the three business days following the bank’s share price meltdown on Thursday, we’ve seen just $135 million in new seed through stage U.S. funding announcements, far below average.
A preliminary query 1 of seed through later stage financings shows $13.7 billion invested so far in Q1. Even with a couple weeks to go, we’re on track to come in well below the prior quarter, which saw over $24 billion in invested capital by this metric.
Since funding was falling well before SVB’s implosion, we can’t say its closure is the driver. However, for those looking for reasons to stay pessimistic about the funding environment, it’s certainly good fodder.
Lux Research, a deeptech-focused research and advisory firm, predicts that VC funding will be harder to come by going forward.
“Some of the tightening will restore some much-needed discipline — the days of VCs flinging offer sheets at buzzy startups with minimal due diligence are clearly over — but many worthy companies will also likely struggle to raise funds,” the firm wrote on its website.
Beyond equity funding, investors and entrepreneurs tell Crunchbase News that SVB’s demise has created a huge hole in the market for venture debt. Few banks have the expertise and willingness to extend loans to far-from-profitable tech startups and biotech ventures.
For now, we’re still expecting to see a bit of a pickup in funding announcements given that the SVB situation has stabilized somewhat with deposits guaranteed. Companies with already-completed rounds might delay a public announcement for a couple days, but likely not weeks.
However, for the coming months, it’s likely SVB will contribute to a chillier funding environment.

"Meta Cuts 10,000 Workers In Largest Layoff This Month (So Far)",Keerthi Vedantam,2023/03/14,"

On Tuesday, Meta announced it would lay off 10,000 workers over the course of the next three months, marking the largest layoff plan announced by a tech company in March.

The recruiting team has been immediately downsized this month, according to the announcement. In April, the tech departments are expected to announce layoffs, and business teams will face cutbacks in May.
Along with its 10,000-person layoff, Meta will also slash 5,000 roles it was previously hiring for.
This is part of Meta’s dubbed “Year of Efficiency”, one that involves flattening org charts, cutting back on funding low-priority projects and slowing down on hiring.
“It’s well-understood that every layer of a hierarchy adds latency and risk aversion in information flow and decision-making. Every manager typically reviews work and polishes off some rough edges before sending it further up the chain,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said. “In our Year of Efficiency, we will make our organization flatter by removing multiple layers of management.”
Meta tops list of biggest layoffs
Meta’s recent announcement means that around 21,000 people have been laid off from the company since we began tracking tech layoffs in 2022. Its last mass layoff was announced in November, when the company laid off 11,000 workers.
This puts Meta at the top of our list of companies who have let go of the most people. The only company that comes close is Amazon, which has laid off 18,000 people over the course of two announcements. In November, the company slashed its workforce by 10,000. In January, it laid off an additional 8,000 people.
In 2022, more than 140,000 people were laid off from the U.S.-based tech sector. The first half of 2023 is expected to be worse — the industry cut around 94,000 employees in the span of two months, which is already more than half of last year’s total number.

Adept Latest AI Startup To Raise Big — Nabs $350M,Chris Metinko,2023/03/14,"

Another week, another huge raise for a generative AI startup.
This week it’s Adept AI, which raised $350 million in what the company called “part of our Series B.” It was reported the new money gives the San Francisco-based startup a post-money valuation of at least $1 billion.

General Catalyst and Spark Capital led the financing. The company had previously raised a $65 million Series A.
Adept is developing AI models that cannot just respond to text commands — like a chatbot — but actually turn that command into actions. In theory, the company’s generative AI could help users do tasks from browsing the internet to navigating enterprise software tools.
“Since announcing our Series A about a year ago, we introduced ACT-1, our first large model for actions, and it’s already demonstrating cutting-edge capabilities,” a post from the company read. “It can take complex user requests across a range of software tools and execute them, even coordinating across multiple tools when needed.”
No slowing down the AI craze
The round comes despite strong headwinds, such as a drop in venture financing and the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.
However, nothing seems to be able to stop generative AI startups from raising large amounts of cash.
The craze started in January, with news of Microsoft’s massive $10 billion investment into OpenAI — creator of ChatGPT.
The tidal wave of funding to AI has not subsided since. Just a week ago, San Francisco-based AI startup and rival to ChatGPT, Anthropic, was reported to be raising another $300 million round at a pre-investment valuation of $4.1 billion. Spark Capital is reportedly leading the round.
That came just about a month after Anthropic raised between $300 million and $400 million from Google.
Also last week, Salesforce’s venture arm — Salesforce Ventures 1 — launched a new $250 million generative AI fund that will look at promising generative AI startups.
Despite a rocky venture market, bet on more news next week.

SVB Kept Up With Fast-Paced Health Startups. The New Normal May Be Slower,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/03/14,"

It is often difficult to explain why Silicon Valley Bank, which does business with about half of all venture-backed startups in the U.S., was the bank of choice for many. It was only the 16th-largest financial institution in the country, but easily the largest piece of infrastructure for the startup ecosystem.
Companies in the life sciences and health care space relied heavily on SVB, with about 12% of the bank’s $173 billion in deposits belonging to companies in that sector. 
That’s because Silicon Valley Bank didn’t operate like traditional banks — it matched the fast-paced startup network by being fast and nimble itself. It swiftly supplied startups with loans during periods of high growth. It took on companies that were so novel and innovative they didn’t have traditional product market fit. Traditional banks were more risk-averse and didn’t understand emerging tech the way SVB did. 

With the loss of SVB, investors worry the startup innovation system may have to slow down to meet its new, slower lenders. 
“I think lenders will be more conservative in their banking approach with clients, especially ones that are in emerging tech, biotech and life sciences,” said David Crean, a biotech investor and managing general partner at Cardiff Advisory.
When COVID hit, SVB moved fast
In 2020, when California issued a stay-at-home order to everyone except essential workers as a result of the pandemic, the private sector took action.
Medtech companies quickly pivoted to meet the surge in demand for testing. Some popped up testing sites on city curbs while others developed easy-to-use scheduling apps. Other companies helped physicians bring their practice into the telehealth age.
Companies in the life sciences moved in to fill gaps in creating therapeutics, vaccine support products and real-time diagnostics. 
“Those companies expanded,” said Matt Ocko, co-managing partner at DCVC. “In the middle of the pandemic, SVB moved to support these companies at lightning speed in a way that larger institutions simply could not.”
By contrast, traditional banks moved more slowly, taking longer to approve loans for startups. They turned away young founders who didn’t have a robust credit history. U.S. immigrants, who weren’t citizens, would have a much harder time banking their company at the larger firms.  
“I think it’s difficult for people to remember how unbelievably conservative mainstream banking was,” Ocko said. 
Biggest losers: emerging technologies
SVB was also a safe haven for startups that were so novel, they didn’t meet traditional risk assessments that bigger banks used. 
Big banks have a fiduciary responsibility to be conservative about their investments. Many nascent companies, especially in their infancy, don’t have product market fit as a result of being so new. This was especially crucial for companies in niche and risky industries like biotech, which often take 10 years or more before ever turning a profit. 
“They were good at lending in one form or another to two startups pursuing what, to the rest of the world including big banks, would be very arcane, difficult to understand technology,” Ocko said of SVB. 
This is how SVB became the bank of choice for the startup world. With decades of expertise in the tech industry, SVB was better able to understand the risks of these companies. When Naveen Jain founded the gut microbiome and at-home diagnostics startup Viome in 2016, he chose SVB as his sole bank at the behest of his investors.
“In the early days of SVB, they were willing to grant the startup companies that were not profitable,” Jain said. “Most traditional banks would only give you a loan when you had assets, or you had profit, whereas SVB was willing to give loans to companies that they thought [were viable].”
Without it, it may become harder for startups in emerging markets to grow.
“I think there may be an impact on innovation as many companies will have a harder time getting financing, and as a result [may] have to declare insolvency due to a lack of capital,” said Crean. “Overall, investors will be even more cautious about the sector.”
A drag on innovation
Without SVB, many companies are migrating towards traditional banks.
It’s hard to tell, materially, how this will impact innovation in the tech sector. SVB quickly provided loans to startups that won defense contracts, or startups that signed partnerships with other companies. SVB quickly allowed companies to open research and development labs, start a manufacturing facility for a new product, or start new projects.
Since other banks move more slowly, companies may have to forgo contract offers if they can’t get a loan. That will quickly impact when a company will be able to raise its next round of funding, and how much it will get. 
Overall, SVB’s demise could force Silicon Valley to adjust to a new normal — one that is slower-paced, matched with that of most banks.
“One of the knock-on effects of SVB not being around as an institution is all of that accumulated expertise lived in the people of SVB,” Ocko said. “There aren’t binders that a giant bank inherits that tell you step-by-step how to support a radical lifesaving biotech company.”

Silicon Valley Bank’s Collapse Will Leave A Big Hole In The Startup World,Chris Metinko,2023/03/13,"

Any bank collapse can cause jitters in an economy or industry, but Silicon Valley Bank’s dramatic fall in just a handful of days likely will leave a lasting impact on the tech and startup ecosystem it tried so hard to foster.
SVB was the dominant bank for tech startups and venture debt in the U.S., cultivating a reputation for close-knit relationships with the power brokers of venture and taking chances on young startups that most banks wouldn’t have the time of day for.

The bank was founded in 1983 by Bill Biggerstaff and Robert Medearis with an eye toward backing VC-backed companies — a still relatively new phenomenon at the time. From there it grew, even surviving the California real estate crash in the early 1990s. It provided banking services for up-and-coming tech companies such as Cisco Systems and Bay Networks.
Now, after 40 years, startups will have to look somewhere else for their financial needs — if such a place exists.
Where deals gets done
SVB wasn’t just a bank for VC-backed startups — it was “the” bank for such companies. It had relationships with more than 50% of all venture-backed companies in the U.S. and countless VC firms.
Those relationships foster a sense of togetherness in what became a very tight-kit tech industry.
“Everybody wants to talk about venture debt when it comes to SVB,” said one VC whose portfolio companies bank with SVB and had access to their accounts as of Monday. “The hole that is left is a lot bigger than just venture debt. The biggest hole is where they really tried to foster a sense of community in tech.”
SVB had a large private wealth management division that had significant synergies with its commercial banking operations — helping the same VCs and entrepreneurs with home mortgages and personal loans after it just helped their startup close a big financing round.
“It really connected LPs and GPs and startups all together,” said the VC, adding SVB specifically had a large presence in both Sonoma and Napa as VCs and founders would look for personal getaway retreats from their weekday Silicon Valley jobs.
“I think you can honestly say SVB was integral to some of the biggest deals in the Valley getting closed,” he continued. “It was amazing how much they understood. Sometimes it’s all about relationships.”
Venture debt
All of that is not to say venture debt did not play a big roll at SVB. One of the reasons SVB became the bank of choice was its venture lending practice. The bank had about $74 billion worth of loans on its books which includes its venture debt.
Venture debt is a type of debt VC-backed companies raise to elongate their cash runways and cut down on dilution — usually in unison with raising equity.
However, the debt is often less structured and requires fewer financial covenants than other forms of debt.
This became what SVB was known for among startups, and the bank’s relationships with VCs was pivotal in that venture debt business. SVB did business with a who’s who of money in the valley, including Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins and Accel. 
It was those relationships that allowed the bank to take chances on young startups — knowing the firms it worked with would make it whole again if something went awry, one VC said.
Who steps up?
Now the question is who will replace SVB in the venture debt ecosystem.
Zack Ellison, founder of Applied Real Intelligence’s Venture Debt Opportunity Fund, said he expects nonbank lenders to step into the lending space in general — which happened after the financial crisis of 2008 with firms like Apollo Management and Blackstone.
Other banks, such as JPMorgan, Citi or Wells Fargo, have shown increasing interest in venture and mezzanine debt, but cannot do it the same way SVB was able to due to their size.
SVB took a chance lending to very young seed and Series A startups, something the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a banking regulator that oversees large banks in the U.S.,  does not approve of since those companies are not within a year of profitability, said a source.
Other smaller banks also could look to fill the void, but regional banks have taken a pounding after SVB’s fall. First Republic Bank has a growing venture lending business, but it also has been hit hard. It recently took in fresh funding from the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan to increase its liquidity.
Other firms like Orrick and Hercules also could be options for startups looking for debt, but those in the industry say regardless, that form of financing will see a drop off after SVB’s fall.
“I think you are going to see venture debt frozen for a while,” said one VC. “Especially when you look at where interest rates are now — think there will be a slowdown.”
Coping
While questions remain about who may step into SVB’s shoes — if anyone — startups continue to deal with the fallout of the last several days and what it means for their business.
Seed-funded health care startup Pair Team has banked with SVB for four years and was one of many startups left scrambling after the bank’s fall. The company’s investors include NTT VC, 8VC 1 and Kleiner Perkins.
Like most startups, its biggest risk once SVB fell was meeting payroll for its 43 team members.
“We aren’t tech elite or the technologists with salaries greater than Pair Team’s entire payroll; we are single moms, grandparents, students, sole breadwinners for their family. Even one day without a paycheck is devastating,” said Cassie Choi, co-founder and COO of Pair Team, via email to Crunchbase News.
Pair Team has since opened two new bank accounts and has to provide new banking details to all of its vendors and customers to ensure payments.
“The failure of SVB should be a warning sign to other banks, politicians, investors, businesses, and even consumers to understand the financial viability of a system we all rely on,” said Choi. “When SVB started crashing on Thursday, it created a significant impact on the startup/tech industry as a whole, but on the other side of bank statements, there are real people,” she said.

SVB Puts Subsidiaries Up For Sale As HSBC Buys UK Unit,Chris Metinko,2023/03/13,"

The slow dismantling of Silicon Valley Bank Financial continued Monday, as it announced it was seeking “strategic alternatives” for its capital and securities subsidiaries.
SVB Capital — a venture capital and private credit fund platform — and SVB Securities — an investment bank — are separate divisions of the parent holding company and are not part of Silicon Valley Bank itself, which is currently under the jurisdiction of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve.

It also was announced Monday that the bank’s U.K. unit — Silicon Valley Bank UK Limited — was being bought by HSBC UK Bank for a single British pound. SVB UK recorded a profit before tax of about $107 million last year.
The news comes less than a day after banking regulators announced a plan to ensure depositors at Silicon Valley Bank. SVB — the dominant financial institution for much of the venture-backed startup world — was shut down by banking regulators on Friday morning following a dramatic decline in the company’s stock price and reports of a run on its deposits.
Finding a buyer
Before the shutdown, the bank sought a sale, but that has proven to be a tough slog thus far for the financial giant.
On Monday, Axios reported JPMorgan Chase was in talks to acquire SVB Financial Group in a deal that would exclude commercial banking unit Silicon Valley Bank. PMC Financial Services Group, Apollo Management and Morgan Stanley also are in talks, per the report.
While some expected a big bank to step up as a buyer for SVB, its venture debt business may have been a hindrance, said a board member at an unaffiliated bank.
SVB took a chance lending to very young seed and Series A startups, something the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency does not approve of since those companies are not within a year of profitability.

Guaranteeing SVB’s Deposits Was The Right Thing To Do,Joanna Glasner,2023/03/13,"

The startup world has never been a warm, fuzzy place for underperformers. Businesses spend all their money, fail to show hoped-for traction, and fail. 
Sometimes it happens noisily. Sometimes it happens quietly. Either way, it happens very regularly. Most seed-funded companies won’t graduate to Series A.  

That’s as it should be. No one ever said launching a transformative company would be easy or result in success.
But of all the risks startup founders face, one thing previously assumed was that at least you’d be able to spend the money you did have. And since founders aren’t in the habit of stuffing pillowcases with wads of cash, you could access your money through a bank. 
While the bank about half of funded U.S. startups chose — Silicon Valley Bank — failed to appropriately hedge for the combination of higher-interest rates and increased withdrawals, it’s errant to blame this misstep on depositors. They weren’t involved in the financial planning, and, like most of us, base decisions on where to put their money on an institution’s reputation, track record, service, and product offerings. 
Pointing the finger at SVB makes more sense. The bank wasn’t well positioned for changing market circumstances and put out an opaque and poorly timed press release about plans to shore up finances that then precipitated a bank run. California regulators closed the bank on Friday and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as receiver. The move effectively wiped out shareholder equity in the company.
Fortunately, depositors won’t be eating losses. Early today, the regulator announced that it had transferred all deposits —both insured and uninsured — and substantially all assets of the former SVB to a newly created bridge bank, Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, N.A.
Depositors will have full access to their money beginning this morning, when the bridge bank opens, including online banking. Depositors and borrowers will automatically become customers of Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, N.A. and will have access to their funds by ATM, debit cards and writing checks in the same manner as before, per the FDIC.
Of course, this move won’t fill the hole in the startup and venture capital spheres that comes from losing its most well-known and enduring banking partner. But as everyone in this space is keenly aware, failures do happen. 
With access to deposits, we’ll hopefully ward off what loomed as some of the most damaging potential ripple effects of SVB’s closure. Employees can still get paid. Founders can keep the lights on. And startups, once again, will be free to fail or succeed on their own merits.

5 roles that caught our eye
Company: Skydio

Position: Director of product management – federal
Salary: N/A
Location: San Mateo, California

Regulators Announce Plan To Ensure SVB Depositors,Chris Metinko,2023/03/12,"

Banking regulators announced a plan Sunday to ensure depositors at Silicon Valley Bank.
The move may alleviate some fear that has hovered over the tech and venture industries the last two days after SVB — the dominant financial institution for much of the venture-backed startup world — was shut down by banking regulators on Friday morning following a dramatic decline in the company’s stock price and reports of a run on its deposits.

However, banking regulators also announced Sunday they are shutting down a second bank with venture lending and crypto ties — New York-based Signature Bank — due to “systemic risk.” Depositors at the bank will have access to their funds.
Despite the Signature announcement, the news concerning SVB may ease some worries — at least temporarily.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said Sunday all insured depositors will have full access to their insured deposits no later than Monday morning, and the FDIC will pay uninsured depositors an advance dividend within the next week.
Uninsured depositors also will receive a receivership certificate for the remaining amount of their uninsured funds.
The Federal Bank announced that it will make financing available to eligible financial institutions through a new Bank Term Funding Program — offering loans of up to one year in length to banks, savings associations and credit unions pledging high quality collateral like U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.
The U.S Department of the Treasury will make available up to $25 billion from the Exchange Stabilization Fund as a backstop for the program — although it is not expected to be used.
The joint statement by the Treasury, the Fed and the FDIC on Sunday afternoon said there would be no bailouts and no taxpayer costs with these new plans. It also said shareholders and some unsecured creditors are not protected.
The news came after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” Sunday  there would be no SVB bailout.
“We’re not going to do that again,” Yellen said. “But we are concerned about depositors and are focused on trying to meet their needs.”
The SVB failure is the second largest bank collapse in U.S. history. The  largest collapse of a financial institution was Washington Mutual, which fell in 2008.
On Saturday, accelerator giant Y Combinator unveiled a petition — with more than 5,000 CEOs and founders signatures — asking for regulators’ assistance in the SVB crisis.

Silicon Valley Bank Bet Big On Biotech. And Now It’s Gone.,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/03/10,"

Silicon Valley Bank, the prominent startup and venture capital bank that was abruptly taken over by regulators Friday, had made big bets on the biotech space in recent years, and its sudden downfall leaves life sciences companies particularly vulnerable. 
The main concern is whether or not early-stage biotech companies that banked with SVB will be able to access their cash. With no cash flow, nascent pharmaceutical startups rely on their cash reserves to fund drug development. 
SVB was an active pillar in the biotech community — a regulation-laden industry where companies often spend years and billions of dollars before ever seeing profitability. Per its Q4 2022 earnings report, 12% of the bank’s $173 billion in deposits belong to the health care and biotech sector. 

The bank’s failure could have wide-reaching impacts in biotech. Life sciences is already a risky industry to fund — a drug company can easily spend around a decade and billions of dollars to develop a single product, and many drugs fail. 
Still, as recently as January, SVB was interested in expanding its life sciences business. The bank pointed out in its Q4 earnings presentation that the life sciences and health care space was a robust market and worth digging into further.
Biotech spending spree
The bank, in large part thanks to biotech, had already enjoyed a boom in 2020 and 2021 when funding to health care-related sectors flourished. Not only did it provide financial services to nearly half of all tech and life sciences companies in 2022, it boasted large clients that invested in the health care space such as Bain Capital and Polaris Partners. 
A few years earlier in 2019, SVB said it would acquire Leerink Partners, an investment bank that invested exclusively in the life sciences sector. The acquisition was a huge get for SVB, which had already been investing in the space but now was able to unlock a wealth of regulatory and advisory expertise it had not been privy to.
It was also big news for biotech and health care. Early-stage health care startups had a new avenue to raise money from an investor enthusiastic to grow its footprint in the space. And early-stage biotech companies, as they were nose deep in research and development, had a place to house their reserves. 
SVB spent its next few years leaning further into the life sciences. Per a Q4 2021 earnings report, the financial institution hired another 50 investment bankers in the life sciences space. It called health care a “robust market” with a lot of opportunity.  
One investor told me the news felt like hearing about a death in the family. “We’re all just trying to figure it out because SVB was such a great company,” the investor said in a text message. “They are a huge lender in the tech, biotech and venture community.”

Silicon Valley Bank Collapse Leaves Tech Industry Scrambling For Answers,Chris Metinko,2023/03/10,"

The stunning move by the FDIC to take over Silicon Valley Bank on Friday left venture firms and their portfolio companies staring at a great unknown many never thought possible.
SVB works with more than half of all U.S.-based startups and is the preeminent provider of venture debt in the industry. Its collapse leaves open gaping questions among startups about cash flow and access as bank regulators moved in.

The bank held $175.4 billion in deposits as of Dec. 31, and 93% of those are uninsured, according to regulatory filings. That leaves unresolved how thousands of companies in Silicon Valley’s intricately connected tech sector who banked at SVB and were unable to access their deposits will make payroll or pay vendors and rent, if those funds remain inaccessible.
Ryan Bloomer, founder and managing partner at New York-based early-stage investment firm K50 Ventures, said some portfolio companies have already expressed concerns — not about meeting payroll, but about access to cash for other expenses after the FDIC’s takeover.
Insured deposits of up to $250,000 held at SVB are protected, regulators said Friday. Uninsured depositors will receive a “dividend” of an unspecified amount next week, the FDIC said, and a “receivership certificate for the remaining amount of their uninsured funds.”
As the bank’s assets are sold, “future dividend payments may be made to uninsured depositors,” the FDIC said.
Many VC firms have stepped up to assure startups they will be provided bridge loans if necessary as the SVB drama plays out, Bloomer said.
Even as early as Thursday, some VCs were already preparing for the worst, telling portfolio companies to diversify where they keep their cash and ensure no more than $250,000 is in one bank.
Some also were telling their portfolio companies to make sure they had easy access to at least six months of cash burn in case the unthinkable happened.
Looking for a buyer?
SVB’s client roster includes some of the most prominent venture firms in Silicon Valley, from Sequoia Capital to Kleiner Perkins and Accel. According to data pulled from Crunchbase, the bank participated in 75 founding rounds last year — mainly involving venture debt — that totaled $5.7 billion. That included leading a $200 million venture debt round for San Jose-based Automation Anywhere.
That deal number is likely low, as many private companies do not publicly divulge debt financings — but nevertheless shows how intertwined the bank has become with the tech startup ecosystem.
SVB has about $209 billion in total assets. In 2021, the bank took part in 73 rounds that totaled $3.1 billion, per Crunchbase. Thus far this year, the bank has participated in eight announced rounds, whch includes leading a $30 million debt round for San Francisco-based InfluxData.
Despite Friday’s shocking turn, many were already looking to what’s ahead for the 40-year-old bank, with most thinking a buyer is lurking somewhere.
“They have a great business,” Bloomer said. “This was just a traditional bank run. This wasn’t like the meltdown in 2008. There were really no toxic assets.”
Zack Ellison, founder of Applied Real Intelligence Venture Debt Opportunity Fund, agreed that a buyer is likely out there and something could happen quickly due to SVB’s prominence in the tech world.
JP Morgan would be a logical buyer due to its balance sheet and known desire to get more into venture lending, Ellison said. Other bidders could include Citi or Wells Fargo, as both also have tried to increase their venture debt presence, he added.
“Someone will buy it,” he said. “They have access and relationships in the valley that many banks see as crown jewels.”
Ellison called the fall of SVB “monumental,” and added he already has been contacted by founders, VCs and lenders as concern has spread.
“It’s already had a ripple effect,” Ellison said. “It’s created a gap in the innovation funding market.”
How SVB unraveled
SVB’s descent into receivership follows a dramatic decline in its stock price on Thursday after the bank said it had taken a $1.8 billion loss on bond sales in Q1 and was seeking to sell shares to raise additional capital to shore up its balance sheet. The share slide in turn prompted a bank run by depositors as panic spread about companies’ ability to get their money out.
SVB has said its balance sheet came under pressure after its startup clients began to draw down deposits. “We are taking these actions because we expect continued higher interest rates, pressured public and private markets, and elevated cash burn levels from our clients as they invest in their businesses,” the bank wrote in a letter to shareholders.
In an earlier presentation to investors, SVB said client cash burn “remains about 2x higher than pre-2021 levels and has not adjusted to the slower fundraising environment,” seemingly illustrating that startups have not reversed their previous patterns of spending.

"The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Anthropic Goes Big Again, Palmetto Raises Big For Solar",Chris Metinko,2023/03/10,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.

The big news of the week in venture obviously is not who raised what but rather where will they put that money? Nevertheless, there were some big rounds this week. It feels like it was just about a month ago we were here talking about Anthropic — and that’s likely because it was only a month ago. AI continues to seduce investors and the public in general. Maybe AI can create a bank for startups to store all that cash.
1. Anthropic, $300M, artificial intelligence: Few companies have been busier this year than San Francisco-based AI startup and rival to ChatGPT, Anthropic. Just weeks after raising hundreds of millions of dollars from Google, it was reported the company is raising another $300 million round at a pre-investment valuation of $4.1 billion. Spark Capital is reportedly leading the round. Just last month it was reported Google had invested between $300 million and $400 million in the startup. The deal came just two weeks after news broke of Microsoft’s massive $10 billion investment into OpenAI. Anthropic’s AI chatbot, Claude, is in closed beta mode, but in a paper detailing its goals, it is expected to combat harmful prompts by explaining why they are dangerous or misguided. Before the massive fundraising this year, Anthropic — which has reportedly made limited revenue — had raised $704 million across Series A and Series B funding rounds in 2022, according to Crunchbase data. The Series B was led by disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.
2. Palmetto, $150M, cleantech: Every week some cleantech startup makes it high on this list, and this week it’s Palmetto. The Charleston, South Carolina-based startup raised $150 million from TPG Rise Climate as it looks to take advantage of the growing consumer demand for solar energy. The company’s platform helps to manage the entire residential solar process for providers — handling sales, design, engineering, permitting and fulfillment. According to the Energy Information Administration, solar capacity is expected to grow 84% through the next two years — meaning a lot more houses will be looking toward solar to help combat rising electricity bills. Founded in 2009, the company has now raised nearly $630 million, according to Crunchbase data.
3. Soci, $120M, marketing: Big national brands still need localized digital marketing strategies to drive growth and expansion into new markets. San Diego-based Soci does just that, and this week picked up $120 million in a round led by JMI Equity. The startup helps companies such as Ace Hardware and Jersey Mike’s Subs scale localized marketing efforts — helping push their digital presence in local search and social pages, while also protecting their online reputation. Founded in 2012, the company has now raised nearly $240 million, according to Crunchbase data.
4. Consensus, $110M, SaaS: Like most sectors, SaaS startups saw their funding cut significantly last year compared to 2021. However, that doesn’t mean some startups aren’t getting funded. Demo automation firm Consensus locked up a fresh $110 million round led by Sumeru Equity Partners — the largest round raised by any VC-backed startup in Utah to date. The Lehi, Utah-based company has an interactive video demo platform that helps presale and technical sales teams automate repetitive product demos and reallocate their time more wisely. After a monster year in 2021 — in which U.S.-based, VC-backed SaaS startups raised nearly $33 billion — SaaS companies saw funding nearly halved, dropping to $16.5 billion. So far this year, such startups have raised less than $2 billion to date. Founded in 2013, the company has now raised nearly $140 million, per Crunchbase data.
5. Bicara Therapeutics, $108M, biotech: Biotech dominates this list as we move along, and Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Bicara Therapeutics is the first to pop up. The startup raised a $108 million Series B co-led by Red Tree Venture Capital and RA Capital Management. The company is developing biologics to fight tumors and is already in clinical trials for a head and neck cancer treatment. Founded in 2020, the company has raised $148 million, per Crunchbase.
6. (tied) Humane, $100M, artificial intelligence: New York-based Humane, which plans to launch a product that incorporates artificial intelligence into a consumer device, and partners with OpenAI, raised a $100 million Series C led by Kindred Ventures. Founded in 2017, the company has raised $230 million, according to Crunchbase.
6. (tied) Rapport Therapeutics, $100M, biotech: Boston-based Rapport Therapeutics, a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing precision medicines for neurological disorders, launched this week with a $100 million Series A financing from Third Rock Ventures, Arch Venture Partners and Johnson & Johnson Innovation.
8. Macro, $90M, media: The Los Angeles-based media company raised more than $90 million from investors including BlackRock and Goldman Sachs. Founded in 2015, the company — which was behind the making of the film “Fences” by August Wilson — has raised $240 million, according to Crunchbase.
9. QurAlis, $88M, biotech: Cambridge, Massachusetts-based QurAlis, a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing medicines for ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), closed an $88 million Series B led by EQT Life Sciences, Sanofi Ventures and Droia Ventures. Founded in 2016, QurAlis has raised $143.5 million, per the company.
10. Ring Therapeutics, $87M, biotech: Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Ring Therapeutics, a developer of a gene therapy platform, raised an $86.5 million Series C funding. The round involved a handful of investors, including funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates. Founded in 2017, Ring has now raised $230 million in total, per the company.
Big global deals
Despite another big round by a U.S.-based AI startup, the largest round came from overseas.

Abound, a consumer lending startup based in the U.K., raised a $601 million debt and equity round.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of March 4 to 10. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

"Silicon Valley Bank Fails, Is Taken Over By Banking Regulators",Crunchbase News,2023/03/10,"

Silicon Valley Bank, the de facto financial institution for much of the venture-backed startup world, was shut down by banking regulators on Friday morning following a dramatic decline in the company’s stock price and reports of a run on its deposits.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. issued a statement on Friday that said it had been appointed receiver for the bank. Insured deposits of up to $250,000 were protected, regulators said. Further detail on what would happen to deposits over the insured amount weren’t available. The FDIC urged those depositers to call a hotline at 1-866-799-0959.
The fallout of the bank failure in Silicon Valley is sure to be dramatic. SVB is vastly interconnected with the rest of the venture-backed ecosystem and alone banks about half of all venture-backed startups in the U.S., as well as many of those companies’ investors.
The Santa Clara, California-based bank has 17 branches in the Golden State and Massachusetts. Those branches will reopen on Monday for business, the FDIC said. As of Dec. 31, SVB had about $209 billion in total assets and about $175.4 billion in total deposits, according to the regulator.
“At the time of closing, the amount of deposits in excess of the insurance limits was undetermined,” the FDIC said. “The amount of uninsured deposits will be determined once the FDIC obtains additional information from the bank and customers.”
— This is a developing story. Check back for more.
Rapid decline
The dramatic sequence of events kicked off Thursday when SVB announced it had taken a $1.8 billion loss in Q1 by selling $21 billion in bonds — essentially its entire portfolio of securities available to sell — in order to shore up its balance sheet. It would seek to raise $2.25 billion by selling stock, it said. Shares of SVB fell another 68% in pre-market trading Friday morning before they were halted.
CNBC and other publications had reported earlier that SVB had been in talks to sell itself after the attempt to raise capital failed, and that larger financial institutions had been looking at the Santa Clara-based bank. Those deals apparently did not come to fruition fast enough to stave off a bank failure.
SVB is the first failure of an FDIC-insured institution this year. Its share price decline on Thursday had already prompted a broader bank stock sell-off and sent jitters through the stock market.
The bank has said its balance sheet came under pressure after its startup clients began to draw down deposits. “We are taking these actions because we expect continued higher interest rates, pressured public and private markets, and elevated cash burn levels from our clients as they invest in their businesses,” the bank wrote in a letter to shareholders.
In an earlier presentation to investors, SVB said client cash burn “remains about 2x higher than pre-2021 levels and has not adjusted to the slower fundraising environment,” seemingly illustrating that startups have not reversed their previous patterns of spending.
SVB connections run through Silicon Valley
SVB’s Rolodex of venture firms it does business with is a who’s who of money in the valley — with names such as Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins and Accel among the most prominent.
According to data pulled from Crunchbase, the bank participated in 75 founding rounds last year — mainly involving venture debt — that totaled $5.7 billion. That included leading a $200 million venture debt round for San Jose-based Automation Anywhere. That deal number is likely low, as many private companies do not publicly divulge debt financings — but nevertheless shows how intertwined the bank has become to the tech startup ecosystem.
In 2021, SVB took part in 73 rounds that totaled $3.1 billion, per Crunchbase. Thus far this year, the bank has participated in eight announced rounds, including leading a $30 million debt round for San Francisco-based InfluxData.

"Yes, Startup SPAC Deals Are Still Happening. They’re Just Smaller And Rarer",Joanna Glasner,2023/03/10,"

Given the notoriously awful performance of so many SPAC mergers, you’d think new deals wouldn’t be happening.
But you would be wrong.
SPACs, or shell companies formed to bring private companies to public markets, are still rolling out merger announcements. New SPACs are also making Nasdaq debuts.

“It’s not the frenzy that it was. … But we are still seeing deal flow,” said Julian Klymochko, a hedge fund pro who runs the Accelerate Arbitrage Fund, which invests in special-purpose acqusition companies. Typical deal size, unsurprisingly, has shrunk since the market peak in 2021.
Although investor preferences have shifted, we are still seeing some deals involving venture-backed technology and biotech companies. A few recent examples include:

Sustainable Living Innovations, a maker of panelized building systems for apartment construction, announced this week it has entered into an agreement with the SPAC Churchill Capital Corp. V, for a potential merger of undisclosed size. Seattle-based Sustainable Living previously raised over $80 million in venture funding.
Sakuu, a developer of lithium solid-state batteries, announced last week that it plans to go public through a merger with shell company Plum Acquisition Corp. I at a targeted enterprise value around $705 million. San Jose-based Sakuu previously raised over $16 million in known venture funding.
Oculis, a Swiss biopharmaceutical developer focused on eye care, completed a SPAC merger last week and is currently trading under the ticker symbol OCS. The company previously raised over $90 million in known venture funding and currently has a market cap over $300 million.

Older SPAC deals still sputtering
These new deals are getting done as carnage continues at many companies that completed SPAC mergers in 2021 and early 2022. This week, for instance, we reported on autonomous trucking software developer Embark, which is winding down operations just 16 months after debuting at a valuation around $5 billion.
A couple weeks before that, Boston-based internet service provider Starry, which went public via SPAC less than a year ago, filed for bankruptcy protection. Around the same time, Quanergy, a provider of LiDAR sensors that completed a SPAC merger in early 2022, completed an asset sale following its bankruptcy filing.
At this point, there’s a pretty long list of SPAC mergers from 2021 and 2022 that have concluded in bankruptcies. Others include mobile retail startup Enjoy Technology, microchip-maker Rockley Photonics, and 3D printing company Fast Radius.
Companies that are still listed, meanwhile, have also been poor performers, including some of the biggest names that took the SPAC express to market. WeWork, for instance, is currently trading for a little over a buck a share, and Grab is down over 80% from its 2021 peak. Though there were signs of recovery earlier this year, that has not translated broadly into lasting gains.
Blank-check companies are winding down too
We’re also seeing more of the blank-check companies launched during the SPAC boom times quietly going away.
Largely, this is because they’re hitting their expiration date. When a SPAC makes its market debut, it usually has two years to identify an acquisition target and complete a combination.
Since the peak period for blank-check company launches was Q1 of 2021, many SPACs are hitting that two-year deadline this quarter. Those that haven’t completed a transaction are liquidating and returning invested cash to shareholders. This includes tech vehicles, such as Build Acquisition Corp. and Independence Holdings Corp. The two software-focused SPACs announced plans to liquidate in the past couple weeks.
SPACs that have identified a merger target are also seeing high redemptions. Shareholders, seeing the current share prices of so many completed deals, are choosing to swap their stakes for cash, which they are able to do after an acquisition is identified and before it closes.
Still a place for SPACs?
Even with all the steep share price declines and closures for companies that completed SPAC mergers in the past couple years, Klymochko still sees a viable role for blank-check vehicles.
New SPACs that are coming to market now, he said, may benefit from a less crowded marketplace. For private companies, they can still offer a faster, simpler mechanism to access public markets than a traditional IPO.
And while the average SPAC merger has fared poorly, there are a few that have done OK, like bowling chain Bowlero and coffee purveyor Westrock Coffee. But for certain types of companies — in particular, pre-revenue venture-backed tech companies looking to go public at multibillion-dollar valuations — the heyday of the SPAC era looks long gone.

How Can We Empower The Next Generation Of Women In STEM?,Guest Author,2023/03/10,"

By Athina Kanioura, Ph.D.
As a child, I always wanted to be a scientist. I was inspired by women like Marie Curie throughout my years in academia. Without their research we wouldn’t have the resources and tools we have today. Women have made countless contributions to scientific advancement throughout history, yet we continue to be underrepresented.

According to the National Girls Collaborative Project, women make up half of the overall workforce, but just 34% of STEM positions. Women of color especially face some of the biggest hurdles in the industry. In 2022, BIPOC women made up less than 10% of the STEM U.S. workforce.
Athina Kanioura, Ph.D., chief strategy and transformation officer at PepsiCo.
To close this gap, we need to do a better job of giving women the opportunity to lead so they can bring others along with them. There needs to be a shift and I’m calling on all leaders to take action.
In December, the United Nations announced a new theme for 2023 “DigitALL: Innovation and Technology for Gender Equality.” Achieving gender equality cannot be done overnight, but it starts at the top and we have a responsibility to be agents of change.
Here are three ways leaders within an organization can help the next generation of STEM talent:
Promote positive and diverse role models
To encourage more women to pursue STEM careers, we need to usher more women into STEM leadership positions. Women are more likely to major in STEM if they are assigned a female professor. The more women see female leaders, the more likely they are to apply for leadership roles and advocate for themselves.
Unconscious bias still exists, and there are still some leaders who believe that men have a greater chance of succeeding than women with the same qualifications. As leaders, we have the responsibility to remove unconscious biases in our hiring and talent decisions, especially in STEM roles. I’m proud to share that my leadership team consists of almost 50% women and I’m not stopping there.
Encourage women to embrace their whole selves at work and at home
We shouldn’t expect women to hide their personal lives in order to rise to leadership positions. When we embrace our authentic selves we can get the support we need to thrive at work, which unlocks our full potential.
To foster an inclusive workplace, try holding “Ask Me Anything” sessions where leaders are open to addressing topics ranging from business challenges to career development to world issues.These AMA sessions foster authenticity throughout all levels of an organization.
Provide educational resources and mentorship programs
PepsiCo partnered with Million Women Mentors, a program that leverages mentorship to inspire and develop women in STEM. If we want to make an impact we need to provide educational resources to help the next generation thrive. Two additional options to consider are Girls Who Code and STEM Careers Coalition.
Globally, there is still a lot of work to be done, but we are on the right path. We must help other women discover the many career options available in STEM. As a mother and mentor, I’m committed to empowering more women and helping them reach their full potential. As we move forward, I envision every woman having an equal voice in the workplace.

Silicon Valley Bank Stock Plunge Sends Jitters Through The Startup World,Chris Metinko,2023/03/9,"

Silicon Valley Bank — the preeminent bank for tech startups and venture debt in the valley — saw its shares plummet Thursday after announcing it would sell billions of dollars in stock to shore up its balance sheet and cut its outlook for the year.
The bank’s shares fell more than 60% Thursday, closing around $106 — well off its 52-week high of $597. That led to a broader decline among bank stocks, with the Nasdaq Bank Index falling 8%.
The significant drop led to deep concern around the venture world — SVB has relationships with more than 50% of all venture-backed companies in the U.S. and countless VC firms — around the bank’s liquidity and balance sheet strength. 

On a call with venture capitalists, Silicon Valley Bank CEO Greg Becker told them to “stay calm” and that the bank has “ample liquidity to support our clients with one exception: If everyone is telling each other SVB is in trouble, that would be a challenge,” according to a report from The Information.
That same report said New York-based venture firm USV sent an email to its founders advising them to “only keep minimal funds in cash accounts at SVB,” that is, funds of up to $250,000” and that “SVB is in a severe cash crisis.”
Thursday’s dramatic turn came after SVB said it would sell $2.25 billion worth of stock — including $500 million worth of shares to private equity firm General Atlantic — to shore up its balance sheet.
“We are taking these actions because we expect continued higher interest rates, pressured public and private markets, and elevated cash burn levels from our clients as they invest in their businesses,” the bank said in a letter to shareholders.
Dealing with a changing market
Silicon Valley Bank’s issues are certainly related to the rocky economy that is being especially felt by the tech and startup sectors. 
During the recent venture capital boom, the bank was flush with cash as private companies raised huge sums of fresh capital at sky-high valuations. That cash was stuffed into banks such as SVB — a leading institution in the startup and venture world.
However, as the market has slowed with rising interest rates, that cash has dried up as deposits by startups have dipped amidst a drop in venture funding even they continue to burn cash.
In a presentation to investors, SVB said client cash burn “remains about 2x higher than pre-2021 levels and has not adjusted to the slower fundraising environment,” seemingly illustrating that startups have not reversed their previous patterns of spending.
The bank said it expects cash burn to remain elevated for the first half of the year and expects venture investment in the U.S. to be down about $120 billion to $140 billion this year.
That issue is coupled with the fact that during the high times in venture, SVB made the decision to invest in low-yield securities — which produce little return, especially when viewed in unison with rising interest rates.
The bank has now sold $21 billion of its securities portfolio, which produced an after-tax loss of $1.8 billion in Q1.
Too big to fail?
The 40-year-old banking titan has become synonymous with tech startups and the valley over the decades.
SVB held $212 billion in assets and $342 billion in total client assets as of the end of last year. 
The bank’s venture capital/debt-focused arm — SVB Capital — has worked with more than 760 unicorns over the years and as of mid-2022 had $8.8 billion assets under management.
SVB’s rolodex of venture firms it does business with is a who’s who of money in the valley — with names such as Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins and Accel among the most prominent.
According to data pulled from Crunchbase, the bank participated in 75 founding rounds last year — mainly involving venture debt — that totaled $5.7 billion. That included leading a $200 million venture debt round for San Jose-based Automation Anywhere.
That deal number is likely low, as many private companies do not publicly divulge debt financings — but nevertheless shows how intertwined the bank has become to the tech startup ecosystem.
In 2021, SVB took part in 73 rounds that totaled $3.1 billion, per Crunchbase. 
Thus far this year, the bank has participated in eight announced rounds, including leading a $30 million debt round for San Francisco-based InfluxData.

"
Founders Fund’s Investment Pace Slowed Ahead Of Fund Cut,Chris Metinko,2023/03/9,"

The venture world took note late last week as news broke that San Francisco-based Founders Fund will cut the size of its $1.9 billion venture fund raised last year by about half.
However, the highly recognized firm — whose investments over the years include Airbnb, Palantir and Stripe — has been significantly slowing the pace of its dealmaking as the venture market cooled and valuations dropped, according to an analysis of Crunchbase data.

At the height of the market in 2021, Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund took part in 121 rounds that totaled more than $10 billion (it’s Important to note the amount any investor — including Founders Fund — invests as a specific stake in a round is not usually divulged).


That includes leading or co-leading huge rounds such as Mexico-based online car buying platform Kavak’s $485 million Series D, Cayman Islands-based crypto exchange Bullish Global’s $300 million venture round, and New York-based fintech Ramp’s $300 million Series C.
Changing market
Those numbers dropped precipitously in 2022 as venture capital numbers tumbled under a variety of economic pressures still being applied to the industry.
Last year, Founders Fund took part in only 80 rounds — a 33% drop from the heyday of 2021. Those rounds totaled only $6.6 billion — again a drop of more than one-third. However, that number is slightly elevated, since it includes the huge $1.5 billion Series E for Costa Mesa, California-based defense and security firm Anduril, which was led by Valor Equity Partners.
The numbers also continuously dropped as the year went on, with the firm only making 32 deals in the last two quarters of 2022, according to Crunchbase data.
Some of the largest rounds it led or co-led, including another $200 million for Ramp and a $100 million Series C for Redwood City, California-based cybersecurity firm Material Security, occurred in the first half of the year — when the venture market was just catching up to the changing economic winds.
Continued slowing
The firm’s investment pace has not picked up through the first two-plus months of this year. It’staken part in only three announced rounds thus far that totaled less than $200 million.
Founders Fund has led only one announced round this calendar year — a $15 million seed funding for Brooklyn-based Zellerfeld Shoe, a 3D-printed shoemaker.
It was almost exactly a year ago when Bloomberg first reported Founders Fund had closed more than $5 billion in two new funds dedicated to both early- and late-stage investing — including a $1.9 billion venture fund and a $3.4 billion growth fund.
With the news last week that roughly half of that $1.9 billion fund will be rolled into a future fund, it goes to show just how much can change in venture in 12 months.
Founders Fund did not return a request for comment.

AI Startup Anthropic Raising Another $300M At $4.1B Valuation — Report,Chris Metinko,2023/03/8,"

Just weeks after raising hundreds of millions of dollars from Google, San Francisco-based AI startup and rival to ChatGPT, Anthropic, is raising another $300 million round at a pre-investment valuation of $4.1 billion.
The news was first reported by The Information. 

Spark Capital is reportedly leading the round.
Just last month it was reported Google had invested between $300 million and $400 million in the startup. The Financial Times reported the deal gave Google a 10% stake in the company, and came just two weeks after news broke of Microsoft’s massive $10 billion investment into OpenAI.
Anthropic’s AI chatbot, Claude, is in closed beta mode, but in a paper detailing its goals, it is expected to combat harmful prompts by explaining why they are dangerous or misguided.
Before the massive fundraising this year, Anthropic — which has reportedly made limited revenue — had raised $704 million across Series A and Series B funding rounds in 2022, according to Crunchbase data. 
The Series B was led by disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.
AI craze
The new funding further illustrates investors’ insatiable appetite for all things AI. This week alone has seen hundreds of millions of investment dollars dedicated to AI startups. 
On Tuesday Salesforce’s venture arm — Salesforce Ventures1 — launched a new $250 million generative AI fund that will look at promising generative AI startups. The firm announced at TrailblazerDX it will initially invest in four AI companies — Anthropic, Cohere, Hearth.AI and You.com.
That same day, New York-based conversation AI startup Amelia raised a $175 million investment ​​led by BuildGroup and Monroe Capital.
New York-based Humane, which plans to launch a product that incorporates artificial intelligence into a consumer device and partners with OpenAI, raised $100 million.

"
Israeli Startups Could Face ‘Frozen’ Funding Environment Amid Political Turmoil,Gené Teare,2023/03/8,"

Over the last seven years, fintech Papaya Global has become one of Israel’s most successful startups, raising hundreds of millions of dollars to build out its HR and payroll platform.
But in late January, Papaya CEO Eynat Guez moved the company’s funds out of Israel, citing the country’s risky business climate amid political turmoil. She joins a growing group of tech leaders alarmed about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu‘s plans to give parliament veto powers over the Supreme Court.
Eynat Guez, co-founder and CEO of Papaya Global
Such reforms have not only triggered widespread protests the scale of which Israel hasn’t seen in decades, but also raise questions about the future of the country’s technology industry. The Israeli government is moving to allow the Knesset, its parliament, to appoint justices, override Supreme Court decisions, and remove the high court’s power to judge government legislation. 
“There is so much at stake here, if this reform passes,” said Shuly Galili, a founding partner at UpWest, a seed investor based in Silicon Valley that invests in Israeli founders. This will impact “investments coming into the country, founders staying or not staying in the country.” 
Since the first vote on such reforms passed in January, the response has been swift from both tech investors and startups. Dozens of public and private tech companies have publicly announced they are taking funds out of the country. Guez, however, estimates that many more have done so quietly, amounting to what could be $7 billion to $10 billion in funds moved out of the country.
“It’s a new thing for the tech community to step outside the comfort zone of not being political and jumping into it and showing their force,” said Galili. 
Shuly Galili, UpWest founding partner
Since the first vote was passed in January, Galili said, this issue has dominated her calls with startup founders. 
These judicial reforms were not discussed in advance of Netanyahu’s recent election in November 2022. “You can argue whether or not the majority chose these reforms,” said Guez. “It wasn’t even discussed. It’s a surprise for us, and it seems like the majority are saying, this is not what we are after.” 
‘Significant concerns’
U.S.-based Bessemer Venture Partners, an active investor in Israel for three decades, has had a local office there since 2007 and estimates it has invested more than $1 billion in Israeli startups including Axonius, Fiverr, Habana and HiBob in the past 10 years. But in February the firm advised its portfolio of startups in a private memo to hold only six months worth of shekels.
“We are confident in the resilience of Israeli high-tech given its limited exposure to the local economy, but have significant concerns that the current climate may result in a chilling effect on non-tech foreign investment and domestic consumption in Israel that goes beyond the challenging macro environment,” the firm wrote in the memo obtained by Israeli newspaper Calcalist last month. “Our primary business concern is the continued weakening of the shekel and the smaller risk of foreign currency controls as the outflow of funds from Israeli banks continues to gather steam. While both concerns may feel exaggerated at this moment, investor and public perception can abruptly make both risks a reality.”
Moving funds
Last week, Wiz, an Israeli unicorn, announced $300 million in funding at a $10 billion valuation, but said the new funding will not be moved to Israel amid the ongoing political conflicts.
Guez, too, acted quickly after that first vote, moving Papaya Global’s funds out of Israel to Europe and the U.S. As a CEO it’s always necessary to assess business risks. But Guez went further and was public in her criticism, seeing it as her responsibility to be vocal.
The Israeli government is starting to “demolish everything that we’ve built around here,” she said. It’s almost impossible to raise a round in Israel currently, she said, because the risk level is so high. The funding environment is “completely frozen,” she said. 
In a country with internal conflicts, the Supreme Court is one of the most important institutions, she said. “Eliminating the Supreme Court — this is the end of democracy.”
Nascent industry
Crunchbase data shows startups headquartered in Israel raised close to $8.9 billion in 2022 — down from $9.8 billion in 2021, a 10% decline year over year. That contrasts with overall global funding, which fell 35% year over year in 2022. 
The billions invested in Israeli startups is a testament to its lead in cybersecurity, health, energy, agriculture and foodtech. 
In the first two months of 2023, Israel-based startups have raised more than $500 million, down 72% from funding raised in January through February 2022. 


However, the amount invested in Israeli startups is much higher if you take into account that many Israeli companies have dual headquarters or are headquartered outside of Israel.
The growth in large Israeli technology companies is a fairly recent phenomenon. Five to six years ago, when Guez started fundraising for Papaya, the overriding notion was that you could not build big companies in Israel, and that founders would have good ideas and then sell. 
In the past five years, more than $50 billion was invested in Israeli tech companies, Crunchbase data shows. And more than 30 or 40 companies went public, Guez said.
The significance of the technology industry for the Israeli economy was highlighted in a report in 2022 from the Israel Innovation Authority. High-tech exports represented over 50% of exports for the first time in 2021 — with the majority of that in high-tech services. More than 10% of Israelis work for technology companies. 
Global outlook
The Israeli technology community is international in its outlook. 
“Israel doesn’t have a local market. Israeli founders have to be global from day one,” according to Galili, who works with Israeli startups on their strategy to go to market in the U.S. Israeli startups will build their R&D in Israel but also incorporate and set up banking in the U.S. and other parts of the globe.
Israeli startups are also dependent on global investors, many of whom have set up local investment arms in Israel due to the strength of the technology industry. Galili predicts that as much as 85% of dollars invested in Israeli startups come from outside of Israel.  
What is the impact?
Founders are looking at what their alternatives are. Technology industry startups have options to relocate to almost anywhere in the world. “Everyone is discussing this,” Guez said.
For now, Galili says the talent in Israel remains a draw to keep startups in the country despite the turmoil. “Most of the impact is the uncertainty we have right now,” said Galili. 
Going forward, Israeli startups who in the past incorporated their company in Israel might decide to do so in Delaware or elsewhere to protect their intellectual capital in a country where the judicial system is not compromised. 
The current political tensions might be misunderstood as being about the political right versus the political left, Guez said, but “it’s really about the right to live in a democracy.”
Protests against Netanyahu’s plans have even spread to Israel’s military. “As time goes by you see more and more people from the right are joining and saying, ‘This does not reflect our opinion. This is not what we voted for,’ ” Guez said.
“The general environment is that we understand that we need to unite and to fight for things that matter in this country,” she said.

Fast-Fashion Giant Shein May Go Public This Year,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/03/8,"

During the IPO gold rush of 2021, lofty unicorns like Shein and Stripe raised fresh rounds of funding. Bursting at the seams with money, they resisted going public.

It looks like that’s starting to change. According to Reuters, Shein is in talks to raise $2 billion in funding while it makes a game plan for going public in the second half of this year.
Shein has been one of the most-anticipated IPOs for a while now. The fast-fashion online retailer reportedly planned on going public in 2020, but postponed those plans in the wake of rising U.S.-China tensions. IPO talks resumed in 2022, but Shein had to navigate a complex web of regulatory barriers imposed by the China Securities Regulatory Commission in 2021 that made it harder to list on a U.S. stock exchange.
China said earlier this year it will revise its rules to guide companies toward listing offshore, potentially making it easier for Shein to go public in the U.S.
IPO hopes for large, late-stage startups
The private markets took a dive in 2022. Of the companies on The Crunchbase Unicorn Board, 78% set their valuations within the past two years.
And companies are already starting to slash those valuations — Stripe cut its valuation 40% in the span of six months. Klarna’s valuation fell 85%. Shein’s own valuation dwindled by more than 30% when it was, at one point, tied for the third most valuable private company in the world.
Payments platform Stripe is reportedly also considering going public to address employees’ expiring shares in the company, after co-founder John Collison insisted he had no plans to take the company public. Delivery company Gopuff was reportedly planning on going public in the latter half of 2022, but that plan never materialized.

SaaS Startup Consensus Nabs Utah’s Largest Round This Year,Chris Metinko,2023/03/8,"

Demo automation firm Consensus locked up a fresh $110 million round led by Sumeru Equity Partners — the largest round raised by any VC-backed startup in Utah this year to date.
The Lehi-based company has an interactive video demo platform that helps presale and technical sales teams automate repetitive product demos and reallocate their time more wisely.
Founded in 2013, the company has now raised nearly $140 million, per Crunchbase data.

“We are excited to move forward in the next phase of our growth with the help of a unique partner in Sumeru, who brings an impressive track record of success in helping companies aggressively pursue and achieve category leadership,” said Garin Hess, founder and CEO, in a release.
Consensus will use the new cash infusion to accelerate growth after seeing a 60% increase in revenue last year.
Utah and SaaS
The $110 million round is the largest raised by any startup in Utah so far this year — just beating out Salt Lake City-based biosafety technology startup R-Zero’s $105 million funding round led by CDPQ last month.
It is the largest round in the state since Salt Lake City-based MasterControl raised a $150 million Series A in December, according to Crunchbase.
The round is also one of the larger in the lagging SaaS sector.
After a monster year in 2021 — where U.S.-based, VC-backed SaaS startups raised nearly $33 billion — SaaS companies saw funding nearly halved, dropping to $16.5 billion.
So far this year, such startups have raised less than $2 billion to date.
Those declining numbers may be the byproduct of many public SaaS companies seeing their share value drop as companies rein in spending on software tools in an attempt to cut expenses and increase profitability in the uncertain economy.

"Most Active US Investors In January, Y Combinator And Gaingels, Lead February Pack",Chris Metinko,2023/03/8,"

This is a monthly feature that runs down the most active investors in U.S.-based companies, looks at some of their most interesting investments, and includes some odds and ends of who spent what. Check out last month’s feature here.
It has been very interesting to watch how firms have responded to the changing market.
In February of last year, more than a dozen firms announced 10 or more deals, with several participating in 20 or more. Last month, just two firms took part in more than 10 announced rounds — Y Combinator and Gaingels.

Andreessen Horowitz and Alumni Ventures participated in a combined total of 46 rounds in February 2022, per Crunchbase data.
Last month, those two firms combined to take part in only 13.
Tiger Global participated in two dozen rounds in February 2022 — last month’s total was zero announced rounds.
Despite the numbers being down, let’s take a look at those firms that played a role in the most investment rounds in the U.S.
Y Combinator, 12 deals
Y Combinator led the way last month, but even its numbers dropped from just last year. In February 2022, the accelerator giant took part in 21 announced deals that involved U.S.-based startups.
Included in those dozen deals was an $8 million seed round for New York-based telenutrition startup Nourish. The telehealth provider connects users with registered dietitians covered by their insurance.
The round is interesting because some stats say more than half of Americans have a chronic condition related to what they eat. Those conditions can include diabetes and cardiovascular disease — which continue to drive up health care costs.
Better access to help with eating and diet can help eliminate not just heath issues, but also a big element of the health care crisis.
Y Combinator actually went big on telehealth last month, also investing in a $2 million round for New York-based Wyndly, a telehealth allergy startup focused on improving access to allergy drops.
Gaingels, 10 deals
Similar to Y Combinator, Gaingels comes up high on the list, but with a pretty substantial dropoff from last year. While the Vermont-based firm took part in 10 deals last month, in February 2022 it participated in 25 — a 150% decline in volume.
That’s not to say Gaingels didn’t have interesting startup deals last month — including participating in a big $30 million Series C for North Carolina-based Get Spiffy.
While many companies usually mentioned here solve new problems with emerging technology, Get Spiffy solves the age-old issue of finding time to get your car washed. The startup is an on-demand car washing service that comes to you and cleans and details your ride.
Get Spiffy performs about 3,000 to 4,000 mobile automotive services daily nationwide across its 45-plus markets. It also has raised more than $90 million to date.
That’s a lot of car washes.
Andreessen Horowitz, 9 deals
We often look at crypto or gaming when we look at rounds done by Andreessen Horowitz, but this time around we look at something much more serious.
We talked about telehealth earlier, and Marker Learning — which raised a $15 million Series A last month — falls under that broad banner. The New York-based startup has created a telepsychology platform that makes learning disability assessments and action plans.
That’s a big deal when considering that one in five students has a learning disability, but only 5% actually get diagnosed. That can lead to a variety of other issues such as anxiety, depression and more.
Lightspeed Venture Partners, 8 deals
It’s hard to make any list of startup funding without mentioning AI — and we certainly can’t do it here.
Lightspeed Venture Partners took part in the $65 million round for San Francisco-based startup Typeface, an AI platform tailored specifically for “enterprise content creation.”
Companies can create product shots, blogs, social media ads and other posts that meet brand specifications and tailor marketing to niche audiences.
Per Crunchbase, funding to generative AI startups peaked in 2021 with over $3.9 billion. We’ll see if 2023 can give it a run for its money.
The Talent x Opportunity, 8 deals
Accelerator The Talent x Opportunity does not usually make our list — but market changes lead to other changes.
The firm took part in eight deals last month, including one that tries to help solve the very real problem of teaching kids the value of money.
It seems logical to think it is harder than ever to teach kids about cash — especially since it is now so rarely seen in its physical form and can be spent with a simple click.
Louisville, Kentucky-based Kidvestors raised a seed round of an undisclosed amount to help.
The startup offers an animated, investment and finance curriculum that uses games to help teach kids K-12 about money management.
With that help, maybe one day those kids can get into venture.
Also notable:

Both Missouri Technology Corp. and One Mind Accelerator came in next on the list with seven deals each.
The Talent x Opportunity led or co-led the most rounds, with eight, followed by One Mind Accelerator with seven.
Lightspeed Venture Partners led or co-led a half dozen rounds totaling the most dollars for the month — $470 million — which included a $300 million round for New York-based Wiz.

New Low: Monthly Funding Dips Below $20B As Funds Continue Record Raises,Gené Teare,2023/03/8,"

Global monthly funding fell to $18 billion in February 2023. Not since February 2020 has global funding dipped below $20 billion in a single month.
Funding for the past month was down 63% from $48.8 billion a year earlier. And month-over-month funding was down 43%. January funding was up in large part due to a $10 billion round raised by OpenAI.

Late-stage funding fell the most, by 73%, while early-stage funding was down 52% year over year, based on an analysis of Crunchbase data.


This drop in late-stage funding takes place in a climate in which venture funds are closing on billion-dollar funds. This past month, San Francisco-based Bain Capital closed on $1.9 billion in funds, its largest to date. And data-driven investor SignalFire, also based in San Francisco, raised $900 million across its seed, breakout and opportunity funds, larger than prior funds.
A reckoning
More than a year after tech stocks plunged, have we hit the market bottom yet?
In a recent interview with TechCrunch, Social Capital founder and “SPAC king” Chamath Palihapitiya said his firm has cut back on late-stage funding due to lack of opportunity. He assesses it will take three years to price late-stage fundings accurately as investors resist downgrades in portfolio valuations.
Money deployed at Series B, Series C and Series D in the past two years will struggle to raise follow-on funding. In this funding environment, we have reported on an increase in round extensions as companies struggle to raise the next funding at an increased valuation.
Pay to play will become more common. Sequoia Capital stepped away from backing Citizen in a new round of funding that would dilute existing investors by a ratio of 10 to 1, reported the Financial Times. Sequoia was a large backer of Citizen and led its Series A. Sequoia partner Mike Vernal resigned from Citizen’s board earlier this month.
Elad Gil, an investor and co-founder of Color, said in a recent post analyzing the downturn, “many companies are likely about to meet a hard reckoning.”
He went on to say that he believed this reckoning would likely start toward the end of 2023 and accelerate through the end of 2024 or so.
However, in our most recent unicorn report, a few late-stage companies did raise at increased valuations from their 2021 funding.
Methodology
Funding rounds included in this report are seed, angel, venture, corporate-venture and private-equity rounds in venture-backed companies. This reflects data in Crunchbase as of  March 6, 2023.
Note that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarter.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.
Glossary of funding terms
We have made a change to how we include corporate funding rounds in our reporting as of January 2023. Corporate rounds are only included if a company has raised an equity funding at seed through a venture series funding round.
Seed and angel consists of seed, pre-seed and angel rounds. Crunchbase also includes venture rounds of unknown series, equity crowdfunding and convertible notes at $3 million (USD or as-converted USD equivalent) or less.
Early-stage consists of Series A and Series B rounds, as well as other round types. Crunchbase includes venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $3 million, and those less than or equal to $15 million.
Late-stage consists of Series C, Series D, Series E and later-lettered venture rounds following the “Series [Letter]” naming convention. Also included are venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $15 million.
Technology growth is a private-equity round raised by a company that has previously raised a “venture” round. (So basically, any round from the previously defined stages.)

Salesforce And Its Venture Arm Latest To Join AI Craze,Chris Metinko,2023/03/7,"

It may not be Microsoft’s $10 billion investment into OpenAI, but Salesforce let it be known it will not be left behind in the current AI blitz.
The CRM’s giant venture arm — Salesforce Ventures1 — has launched a new $250 million generative AI fund that will look at promising generative AI startups. The firm announced at TrailblazerDX it will initially invest in four AI companies — Anthropic, Cohere, Hearth.AI and You.com.

In late January, news broke that San Francisco-based AI startup and rival to ChatGPT Anthropic is raising a $300 million round from Google — bringing the company’s total valuation to $5 billion, The New York Times reported.
“Salesforce Ventures has been investing in high-potential enterprise technology businesses for more than a decade, and these initial investments from the fund in generative AI companies fit squarely into that strategy,” said John Somorjai, executive vice president of corporate development and Salesforce Ventures at Salesforce, in a release about the new fund.
Of course, venture capital has been pouring into the AI space as both consumers and companies have become enamored with artificial intelligence tools ChatGPT and DALL-E. Just last week, San Francisco-based AI startup Typeface raised a $65 million round. Typeface’s platform is tailored specifically for “enterprise content creation,” as it can create product shots, blogs, social media ads and other posts that meet brand specifications and tailor marketing to niche audiences.
Salesforce steps up AI game
Salesforce also announced Tuesday it will be adding some AI tools to its platforms. The company — which has been under shareholder pressure as of late — unveiled new generative AI tools for customer service responses and sales emails called Einstein GPT.
In addition, Salesforce announced a new ChatGPT app for Slack.
The new tools are integrated with OpenAI’s generative models.

Series B Funding Has Also Fallen Sharply,Joanna Glasner,2023/03/7,"

When technology and biotech valuations began to tumble last year, U.S. Series B funding held up at first, offering one of the brighter areas in a more bearish investment environment.
That’s no longer the case.
In recent months, Series B funding to U.S. startups has fallen sharply. So far in 2023, investment is on track to come in at the lowest quarterly level in more than three years.

The continuing slowdown this year comes after dealmaking had already been contracting for a couple quarters. Per Crunchbase data, Series B investment in the second half of 2022 was down over 60% from the year-ago period.
For a sense of how far things have fallen, we chart out Series B deal counts and funding for the past nine quarters below.


Why Series B?
So why single out Series B for scrutiny?
We periodically look at Series B trends because this stage functions as a sort of proxy for the broader venture funding ecosystem: It’s typically the point in a startup’s lifecycle when it has proven technology or market traction and is on the cusp of major scaling.
So far in 2023, Crunchbase data shows investors are backing fewer big rounds. There were just six Series B deals of $100 million or more to date this year, an average of fewer than one per week. In 2022, by comparison, there were 90 such rounds, or almost two per week.
Some big deals getting done, led by biotech
Still, we are seeing some mega-sized Series B deals this year. Standouts include:

Our Next Energy, a Michigan-based battery startup, closed a $300 million round in February led by Fifth Wall and Franklin Templeton that takes the 3-year-old company’s valuation to $1.2 billion.
Aera Therapeutics, a Boston startup focused on genetic medicines, raised $193 million in a financing led by Arch Venture Partners, Google Ventures and Lux Capital.
Asimov, a Boston genetic design and engineering company, pulled in $175 million in a round led by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.

Notably, nine of the 10 largest Series B rounds this year have been for biotech companies. It’s not uncommon to see this sector lead the ranks, as scaling a biotech is an expensive undertaking.
Fintech, Web3, consumer see less traction
Also noteworthy is what we’re not seeing.
In particular, Series B investors are avoiding fintech. None of the 20 largest funding recipients this year were categorized as fintech companies by Crunchbase. This is striking considering it was the leading sector for venture investment in 2022.
It’s a difficult climate for setting fintech valuations, so this could be holding things up. Some of the highest valuation late-stage fintechs, including Stripe and Klarna, have sharply cut valuations. And FTX’s collapse has also played a role in quashing crypto dealmaking.
Web3 is also mostly absent from the top rankings. One exception was Miami-based blockchain development platform QuickNode, which closed a $60 million Series B funding led by 10T Holdings. Things have certainly slowed since Q1 of 2022, when there were multiple Web3 Series B rounds of $100 million and up.
Investment in consumer products has also nosedived in the past few quarters, and this is reflected in the Series B tallies. We didn’t see any consumer-facing deals among the largest rounds.
The implications
Funding totals at Series B are arguably a more telling measure of startup investor confidence than seed or late-stage financings.
At seed, investors often give little weight to market cycles, as they’re wagering smallish sums on longshots with far-off exit horizons. Late stage, meanwhile, tends to be influenced heavily by  public market conditions, with big rounds piling up when large exits are prevalent.
Series B, by contrast, typically offers neither a moonshot multiple nor a fast path to IPO. With a median 2023 round size around $25 million, investors are putting significant capital to work at valuations well above where earlier rounds priced.
If funding is down at this stage, it likely means investors are wary of investing in today’s crop of mid-stage startups at prevailing valuations. Perhaps they’re taking a break to see how values settle in the coming months. Or perhaps it’s indicative of a deeper pessimism. Either way, we’ll keep watching these tallies to see in which direction we’re headed.

AI-Driven Lender Abound Scores $601M To Drive Open Banking Forward,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/03/6,"

Abound, a consumer lending startup based in the U.K., announced on Monday it raised a whopping $601 million in both debt and equity to fuel the “open banking” industry, according to TechCrunch. Funding will go towards expanding access to consumer credit and reaching more potential customers.
The platform, like other open banking startups, uses banking data siphoned from big banks’ APIs and builds new avenues for credit lending. Abound underwrites personal loans without the use of credit scores. Instead, it sifts through bank transactions and uses artificial intelligence to create risk profiles of each customer. By doing so, it can offer customers a lower interest rate than conventional loan lenders.

Startups like these have the ability to help consumers access credit despite a bad credit score, or could even help them improve their credit scores.
The open banking revolution
Open banking had been around for quite a while in the form of budgeting apps and spending trackers like Mint, which would aggregate your banking data via APIs. But the world of open banking has grown to take on a larger role in the fintech world.
In 2018, the European Union established the European Union’s Payment Services Directive, an initiative that would require banks to make customer data more accessible to said customers via APIs.
Open banking platforms are heralded as usually being more intuitive to navigate than traditional banks. Without relying on credit scores, consumer lending platforms can offer a more personalized loan and loan repayment program.
As a result of the EU’s decision, consumer lending programs utilizing open banking technology have popped onto the scene. Tink, an open banking company based in Sweden, gives financial institutions access to data from payment apps like PayPal. Finicity, another platform based in Utah, connects disparate fintech platforms together to allow users better interoperability between each.

Autonomous Trucking Upstart Embark Goes From $5B Valuation To Kaput In 16 Months,Joanna Glasner,2023/03/6,"

Autonomous trucking startup Embark Trucks capped off one of the faster riches-to-rags stories of the SPAC era, announcing that it is laying off most employees and winding down operations.
In a Friday email to employees, CEO and co-founder Alex Rodrigues wrote that “after thoroughly evaluating all alternatives, we have been unable to identify a path forward for the business in its current form.”
The planned closure comes just 16 months after San Francisco-based Embark went public through a SPAC merger at a target initial market capitalization of $5.16 billion. Even by the bubblier market conditions of the time, the deal set an astounding valuation for a pre-revenue company, with backers touting its “sophisticated self-driving software,” built to navigate trucks on long-distance freight trips.

SPAC sponsors put up plenty of money too. The merger plan included approximately $614 million for the company: $414 million from SPAC sponsor Northern Genesis Acquisition Corp. II and $200 million from backers including CPP Investments, trucking firm Knight-Swift Transportation, Mubadala Capital, Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global Management.
When Embark made its Nasdaq debut on November 11, 2021, tech stocks were at their peak and shares traded at close to the target valuation for a couple months. But as markets chilled, so did investors’ attitude toward Embark. Shares shed more than half their value in January 2022, and six months later were down more than 90% from the initial offer price.
As we observed in a November story on Embark’s tortuous public market path, its protracted decline was not due to missing financial projections. The 7-year-old company never had revenue to begin with, let alone earnings or a path to profitability. The entirety of its one time multibillion-dollar valuation rested, instead, on optimism about the potential of its technology.
Times changed. Or, as Rodrigues put it in his Friday message: “The capital markets have turned their backs on pre-revenue companies, just as slipping manufacturer timelines have delayed the prospect of scaled commercial deployment.”
Having “exhausted all alternatives,” Embark said it is laying off approximately 70% of its employees and shuttering its Southern California and Houston offices. The remaining 30% of staff will focus on winding down day-to-day operations and “respectfully supporting our colleagues who have been let go,” Rodrigues wrote.
Embark’s co-founders Rodrigues and Brandon Moak formed the venture when neither was old enough to buy a beer. The company joined the Y Combinator accelerator’s 2016 batch with the  initial intent of building self-driving shuttles for use on college campuses.
Shortly after, the team pivoted to self-driving trucks, focusing on highway driving. It was an enormous market and, although still fabulously difficult, presented a  seemingly more tractable problem to solve.
As with many Y Combinator founding teams, venture funding followed. Between 2016 and 2019, Embark raised a $2 million seed round led by Maven Ventures, a $15 million Series A led by DCVC, a $30 million Series B led by Sequoia Capital, and a $70 million Series C led by Tiger Global.
Ambitions were high, to say the least. An article in The Wall Street Journal a few years back cited CEO Rodrigues projecting initial deployment of a fully autonomous truck in fewer than five years. The company’s long-term vision included human truckers behind the wheel in city driving, with computers in control on the highway.
Embark is one of multiple startups in the autonomous trucking space that have since shuttered or fallen on hard times. Others include:

San Francisco-based Otto, one of the earlier startups focused on self-driving trucks, sold to Uber for $680 million in 2016. About two years later, Uber shuttered its self-driving truck division and said it would focus its autonomous driving efforts on cars.
Starsky Robotics, a venture-backed San Francisco-based autonomous trucking upstart, shut down in 2020 after its Series B fell through. Starsky had raised just over $20 million in funding since being founded in 2015.
Peloton Technology, a Silicon Valley-based autonomous and connected driving technology startup, raised over $78 million in known funding before shuttering in 2021.
TuSimple, a San Diego-headquartered developer of robotic truck technology, carried out an IPO in April 2022. After going public at an initial valuation around $8.5 billion, the company now has a market cap around $460 million.
Aurora, based in Pittsburgh, announced in the summer of 2021 that it would go public via a merger with a SPAC at an initial market capitalization of around $13 billion (including about $2.5 billion in cash). Shares are now down more than 90% from their post-debut peak.

Chaos Industries Lands $70M As Defense Tech Heats Up,Chris Metinko,2023/03/6,"

Defense and critical industry technologies company Chaos Industries closed a $70 million Series A led by 8VC1 — becoming the latest startup with a focus on defense tech to close a significant round.
Alpha Wave Global, Lerner Enterprises, Liquid 2 Ventures, Tamarack Global and Valar Ventures also participated in the round.
Chaos, a relatively new startup founded last year, has multiple products in development, including COHERENCE, a sensor, detection and radar solution “with broad defense and commercial applications.” 

The Los Angeles-based company has entered into agreements with governments and commercial customers to ensure its products have strong market fit, Chaos said in a release.
“The United States risks falling behind our adversaries,” said John Tenet, co-founder and executive chairman. “As a result, America is more vulnerable today against rising competition in key technology fields such as AI, machine learning, and advanced manufacturing. Chaos is our response to the urgent call to turn our most forward thinking engineers towards mission critical technologies.”
Spotlight on defense industry
Investors seem to be eyeing the defense space more right now. Just last week, drone startup Skydio locked up a $230 million Series E at a $2.2 billion valuation led by Linse Capital — more than double its valuation from just two years ago.
Skydio produces drones for the consumer, enterprise and government sectors. Its drones are used by every branch of the U.S. Department of Defense.
However, the largest round raised in the last several months was by Costa Mesa, California-based defense and security firm Anduril. Last December, the startup locked up a Series E worth nearly $1.5 billion that values the company at $8.5 billion.
Anduril builds software and hardware enhanced with artificial intelligence and machine learning for the military and defense industry. It works with the U.S. and its allies to create drones, underwater vehicles, and different operating and control systems.
The focus on defense is notable. Many big tech firms have shied away from doing business  with the U.S. Department of Defense over the years due to employee and public pressures. In addition, the military and defense sectors can be hard to navigate for startups, with long sales cycles that can crush a company’s cash flow.
Nevertheless, investors are seeing a path to big returns in the industry right now, possibly since the government continues to spend even as the economy slows.

First Unicorn From Egypt Joins The Board In February,Gené Teare,2023/03/6,"

Five companies joined The Crunchbase Unicorn Board in February — the fourth month in a row for new unicorns to number in the single digits.
Among these new unicorns is the first company from Egypt to join the board: Cairo-based fintech MNT-Halan, which provides digital wallets as well as buy now, pay later offerings and business loans. The service has 1.3 million monthly active users with more than 5 million customers in Egypt. With this strong foothold, MNT-Halan plans to expand to surrounding countries in the region.

A further three companies joined from the U.S. and one company from China.
A year ago, in February 2022, 56 companies joined the Unicorn Board, before new unicorn numbers progressively dropped throughout the year.


Funding to current unicorn companies was also down in February, tracking at $2.9 billion raised by 27 companies, including the new unicorns.
Current unicorns total 1,439 companies on a global basis that are collectively valued at $4.9 trillion with $852 billion raised in funding, per the Crunchbase Unicorn Board.


Up valuations
Contrary to assessments that many unicorn valuations would not hold up in the current funding environment, four companies raised funding in February at increased valuations since 2021, with two companies reaching decacorn status for the first time.
San Francisco-based AI research company Anthropic’s valuation was up by 200% in less than a year through a corporate funding led by Google that valued the company at $3 billion.
Cybersecurity company Wiz, an Israeli- and New York-headquartered company, attained decacorn status this past month. Its Series D funding valued the company at $10 billion — up 67% from its Series C funding valuation of $6 billion.
Beijing-based manufacturer of electric vehicles Zeekr, was newly valued at $13 billion, up 46% from its $9 billion valuation in 2021.
Silicon Valley-based drone company Skydio saw its valuation increase 120% to $2.2 billion in a funding led by Linse Capital. Skydio was last valued at $1 billion in its 2021 Series D funding led by Andreessen Horowitz.
Here are the companies that joined the board in February 2023:
Fintech

New York-based Liquidity Group, which provides nondilutive loans to SaaS companies, raised $40 million from Tokyo-based MUFG Bank, valuing the company at $1.4 billion.
Lending and payments company MNT-Halan raised $260 million in equity led by Chimera Investment. It also raised $140 million in debt. MNMT-Halan was valued at $1 billion.

Energy

Michigan-based Our Next Energy engineers batteries for electric vehicles. It raised a $300 million Series B funding led by Fifth Wall and Franklin Templeton that valued the company at $1.3 billion. The company also raised $220 million in funding via a grant from the State of Michigan. The funding will help Our Next Energy outfit its first battery cell factory.

Media

Streaming TV platform Atmosphere, based in Austin, raised a $65 million Series D funding, which valued the company at $1 billion. The service provides bundled TV for restaurants, bars, gyms and doctors’ offices.  The funding was led by Sageview Capital.

Biomanufacturing

Beijing-based Bluepha, a bio materials manufacturer, raised $58 million in a Series B extension which valued the company at $1 billion. The company is developing materials to reduce the use of plastics for packaging.

Methodology
The Crunchbase Unicorn Board is a curated list that includes private unicorn companies with post-money valuations of $1 billion or more and is based on Crunchbase data. New companies are added to the Unicorn Board as they reach the $1 billion valuation mark as part of a funding round.
The unicorn board does not reflect internal company valuations — such as those set via a 409a process for employee stock options — as these differ from, and are more likely to be lower than, a priced funding round. We also do not adjust valuations based on investor writedowns, which change quarterly, as different investors will not value the same company consistently within the same quarter.
Funding to unicorn companies includes all private financings to companies that are tagged as unicorns, as well as those that have since graduated to The Exited Unicorn Board.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.

"The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Wiz Wraps Up $300M Raise, Skydio Lands $230M For Drones",Chris Metinko,2023/03/3,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.
March did come in like a lion — at least compared to last week. Startups in cyber, defense and biotech all saw some large rounds in a week that for once was not dominated by artificial intelligence. Five VC-backed companies all saw nine-figure rounds this week, a strong start to the last month of the quarter.

1. Wiz, $300M, cybersecurity: Cybersecurity startup Wiz graduated to decacorn just this week, as the company based in the U.S. and Israel raised $300 million in fresh capital at a valuation of $10 billion. The Series D funding was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. Founded in 2020, Wiz has now raised a total of $900 million, according to Crunchbase data. The funding for the cloud security startup came with other news; Wiz announced it won’t move any of that money to Israel due to ongoing unrest about proposed reforms to the country’s judicial system. Some fear the proposed judicial system reforms would undermine Israel’s democratic foundations and grant unchecked power to the government.
2. Skydio, $230M, drone: Drone startup Skydio locked up a $230 million Series E at a $2.2 billion valuation led by Linse Capital — more than double its valuation from just a couple of years ago. The new round comes almost exactly two years after the company raised a $170 million Series D at a valuation of more than $1 billion. Skydio produces drones for the consumer, enterprise and government sectors. Its drones are used by every branch of the U.S. Department of Defense, by over half of all U.S. State Departments of Transportation, and it now has more than 1,200 enterprise customers. Founded in 2014, Skydio has raised $562 million in total, according to the company.
3. Cargo Therapeutics, $200M, biotech: A couple of biotech startups rank pretty high on the list this week. The first is Cargo Therapeutics, which closed a $200 million Series A co-led by Third Rock Ventures, RTW Investments and Perceptive Xontogeny Venture Fund. The San Mateo, California-based company is developing CAR T-cell therapies for cancer. The startup is in phase 2 clinical trials for its treatment of large B-cell lymphoma. Founded in 2021, this is the biotech firm’s first outside funding, per Crunchbase.
4. Chroma Medicine, $135M, biotech: The second biotech firm with a nine-figure raise this week is on the opposite coast. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Chroma Medicine locked up a $135 million Series B led by GV (formerly Google Ventures). The startup’s gene editing platform does not rely on cutting or nicking DNA — which introduces risks — to regulate gene expression like most other therapeutic programs. Founded in 2021, the company has now raised $260 million, according to Crunchbase.
5. (tied) Kindbody, $100M, health care: Companies offering fertility health care benefits are becoming more commonplace in the U.S. Kindbody is one of those startups that partner with companies to offer employees family-building benefits, and this week the New York-based firm raised $100 million in capital from Perceptive Advisors. The new cash values Kindbody — founded in 2018 — at $1.8 billion. Kindbody, which owns and operates fertility clinics, has now raised more than $290 million in debt and equity, per the company.
5. (tied) Paratus Sciences, $100M, biotech: Bats have kind of been put through the ringer the past few years, what with the pandemic and all (although the new DOE report may dispute that). However, maybe they can also help human health. New York-based Paratus Sciences launched with a $100 million Series A co-led by Polaris Partners, ARCH Venture Partners, ClavystBio, EcoR1 Capital and Leaps by Bayer. The startup is looking at what bats and other animals can tell researchers about human health. Paratus is focusing on developing human therapeutics in areas like inflammation.
7. Bitwise Industries, $80M, education: Fresno, California-based Bitwise Industries, which attempts to bring coding skills to historically underrepresented minorities, closed an $80 million round led by existing investors Kapor Center and Motley Fool. Founded in 2013, the company has now raised approximately $158 million, per Crunchbase.
8. Wunderkind, $76M, marketing: New York-based marketing tech startup Wunderkind raised a $76 million Series C led by Neuberger Berman, TechCrunch reported. Founded in 2012, the company has raised nearly $152 million, per Crunchbase data.
9. Temporal, $75M, software: Seattle-based Temporal, whose platform helps in application development, raised $75 million in a Series “B-Prime.” Greenoaks joined existing investors in the round. Founded in 2019, Temporal has raised more than $200 million, per the company.
10. Shef, $67M, retail: San Francisco-based Shef, a chef-to-consumer marketplace, closed a Series B led by CRV that included $66.5 million in equity and $7 million in debt. Founded in 2019, Shef has raised more than $100 million, according to the company.
Big global deals
Very surprisingly, the top nine rounds all occurred in the U.S. this week. The only large raise this week to crack the top 10 was:

Tokyo-based space tech startup Astroscale raised a $76 million Series G.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of Feb. 25 to March 3. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

Tech Layoffs: February Marks Third-Worst Month,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/03/3,"

Good news: February layoff numbers for the U.S. tech sector were lower than those in January. Bad news: That’s not actually saying much.
Tech companies aren’t breaking up with their employees at the scale we saw in January, which was the biggest layoff month since we began tracking job cuts data in 2022 with over 65,000 layoffs.

So February, by comparison to the brutal month before, seems relatively tame. But February still saw around 28,000 U.S. tech employees lose their jobs, making it the third-largest layoff month since the start of 2022.
While public companies have spent the last few months zig-zagging in layoffs numbers, startups are still cutting employees at a pretty steady cadence. In fact, for U.S.-focused startups, February was the second-largest layoff month after November 2022.


Public company layoffs cooled off after earnings
Where’s this change coming from? January’s layoffs were primarily driven by public companies, which were responsible for a record 93% of laid-off U.S. tech workers that month. Google parent company Alphabet slashed its workforce by 12,000 people, while Microsoft and Amazon let go of 10,000 and 8,000 employees, respectively.


Several of these cuts came ahead of, or during, disappointing Q4 earnings reports. Fintech platform Affirm announced during its earnings call that it would slash 19% of its workforce following missed revenue expectations. Three days before its Q4 earnings call, Twilio announced it would lay off 15,000 people.
Fast-forward to February: Large tech companies only made up about 82% of layoffs — still the majority by a long shot, but we saw worse in November, when 88% of workforce cuts were driven by public tech firms. In February, Ericsson laid off around 8,500 workers, while Dell cut 6,650 roles.
It’s also worth noting that, since 2022, about a quarter of public companies that announced layoffs announced additional cuts in the following months. Some, such ase Netflix, Twitter and Peloton, conducted three rounds of layoffs over the course of 14 months.


Startup layoffs remain consistent
For U.S.-focused private companies, February was the second-largest layoff month after November. Over 5,000 employees were let go last month, including those from companies such as Pico Interactive, which laid off 400, and Cerebral, which cut 285 employees.
That’s because the startup situation hasn’t really changed much. Venture funding is still down year over year, and most companies are still struggling to find capital (unless you’re OpenAI, in which case, you’re probably not in our layoffs database anyway).
Venture folks tell me investments will start picking up once valuations come down, which we’re already starting to see. The number of companies anointed unicorn status skyrocketed in 2021, but some of those are beginning to reset their valuation to make peace with the changing venture landscape.
“I think that camp is in really big trouble until they can actually justify their valuation,” Nolan Church, CEO of consulting firm Continuum and former people’s executive at stock option management platform Carta, told me. “I don’t think we’ve seen those companies being put through the crucible yet. Doing a layoff is not resetting your valuation.”

Wunderkind Raises $76M As Marketing Faces A Reckoning,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/03/2,"

Technology has gotten so good at targeting ads that people regularly think their phones are listening in on them.
Wunderkind, the New York-based marketing startup, announced on Thursday it raised $76 million in Series C funding, TechCrunch reported. Neuberger Berman led the round, bringing total funding to the company to $151.9 million per Crunchbase data.

Formerly known as BounceX, Wunderkind started in 2010 to better find niche consumers and market to them at scale. The company promises customers it can increase page views, convert readers into subscribers and generate more e-commerce revenue through its data-capturing and analytics services. The company knows when a viewer has stopped reading, watching or otherwise engaging with an ad. 
Wunderkind has worked with brands like fast-fashion retailer Forever 21, media group Refinery29 and cosmetics company Clarins.
A changing world
Behavioral marketing strategies like the ones Wunderkind employs — triangulating customers based on a spat of information about people’s interests, age and location (among other things) — is a popular strategy for brands. If you’ve ever been inundated with pet food ads after befriending your new cat-owning roommate, you’ve certainly been the unintended victim of behavioral marketing. (No? Just me?)
But behavioral marketing, however popular, has been scrambling lately. Meta and other social media platforms have significantly increased the cost of advertising after the direct-to-consumer marketing boom. Apple has made it easier for users to opt out of data tracking on apps. 
In addition, the European Union’s data privacy and protection law, known as GDPR, enforces sizable fees to companies that use “invasive” data mining. A lot of behavioral marketing tactics commonly deployed in the U.S. won’t fly in Europe. 
Marketing tactics will have to involve getting active consent from users to mine their data, as well as relying less on automation. Perhaps the future will move away from behavioral marketing and more toward contextual marketing — if you’re watching a video about cooking, you may be served cookware-related ads. 
That means brands are often stuck paying more money to target potential customers while being less informed about who those customers actually are. And companies like Wunderkind will have to adapt to being just as effective without being able to rely on cookies or automation.

Crypto Prices Spike As VC Funding In Web3 Continues To Plunge,Chris Metinko,2023/03/2,"

Even as negative headlines around FTX, Silvergate, Genesis and other crypto-related businesses continue to swirl, something funny has happened to crypto prices.
They’ve soared.
Bitcoin — the largest cryptocurrency by market cap — is up 40% since the year began, and ether — the second largest — is up 35%. While still substantially off their highs from November 2021, the rally is one of the best either has seen in the last year-plus.

However, venture capitalists and investors still seem tepid as ever on the market.
Thus far for the year, only $1.3 billion has come to VC-backed Web3 startups in 233 deals, per Crunchbase data. At that pace, final numbers for the quarter would even be lower than Q4 of last year, when Web3 funding cratered to $2.7 billion in 373 deals.
The first two quarters of 2022 saw $17.5 billion invested in Web3 startups, according to Crunchbase.
The largest round so far this calendar year includes a $125 million convertible round for Canada-based Blockstream, a blockchain technology solution for financial markets, and a $70 million Series C for Israel-based Chain Reaction, a blockchain startup focusing on privacy.
It takes a while
The venture numbers are not surprising, as it was always going to take more than just several weeks of an upswing on crypto prices for investors to migrate back to the sector — especially when you consider the lag time in announcing deals.
Venture capitalists and investors did not run away immediately from the space when crypto prices started to fall in early 2022, so they likely will not quickly flock back to all things Web3 even if this rally continues for the next few months.
With what we have seen in crypto — who knows where we will be in a couple months?

"5 Interesting Startup Deals You May Have Missed In February: AI Pollination, Seeing The Future And 3D-Printed Shoes",Chris Metinko,2023/03/2,"

This is a monthly column that runs down five interesting deals every month that may have flown under the radar. Check out last month’s entry here.
February flies by pretty fast, so it’s easy to miss some of the more under-the-radar startups that are doing curious things and raising cash.

Some of the companies that received funding last month include a predictive news platform, a crypto search engine and of course lots of AI — so let’s get into it.
AI is replacing bees
Artificial intelligence is coming for all of our jobs, so why not the bees?
That may not be happening, but we have written before about startups trying to solve the problem of the declining bee population and what that would mean for our ecosystem.
However, Israel-based BloomX is taking a very different route than many of those. The AI-driven bio-mimicking pollination company launched from stealth last month with an $8 million seed round led by Ahern Agribusiness.
The company uses its AI platform to figure out the peak times for pollination, then sends hardware out to the fields to perform the process — since honey bees can actually be inefficient at doing it.
The startup already is working with blueberry and avocado growers worldwide, and the company hopes to develop additional bio-mimicking solutions to cater to more crops.
And you thought AI was just good at creating a new sales pitch.
Predicting the news
It’s common to wonder what may be making headlines when you wake up in the morning. What if there was a platform that actually could help predict that?
Ireland-based NewsWhip is trying to do just that and closed a $13 million round from London-based AshGrove Capital last month.
The startup’s platform is designed for communication professionals and journalists, and aims to give “clarity on the chaos of digital and social media.”  The company tracks stories and narratives, figures which are gaining momentum and popularity, and predicts which ones will matter in the hours ahead.
It does that all in real-time, giving those in the communications industry a heads-up on what to pay attention to and what they may be able to ignore.
There is a lot of noise out there, and anything that can quiet some of it is greatly appreciated.
Searching for crypto
Crypto certainly is not in the same place it was a year ago, but that does not mean people don’t care about it and search out info about it.
That’s where Seattle-based Kaito comes in. The startup, which raised $5.3 million in a seed round led by Dragonfly Capital, has created an AI-powered search engine specifically for crypto.
While traditional financial markets have several tech-enabled platforms to help investors, information on crypto has been rather fragmented, especially since it is on platforms not normally aggregated by search giants.
Kaito aims to take unstructured information and make it into actionable insights for crypto investors, researchers and others.
Crypto may not be at the height of its popularity, but it also is not going anywhere.
Telling a better story
One may hope artificial intelligence doesn’t invade too much into real, genuine creativity, but that seems unlikely.
San Francisco-based Tome uses AI to help turn users’ ideas into a more compelling visual narrative. In a sense, it can replace something like a more stagnant PowerPoint presentation.
The company raised a $43 million Series B led by Lightspeed Venture Partners at a reported $300 million valuation.
The startup’s generative storytelling features allow users to create visual narratives with layouts and images.
Launched just about six months ago, Tome already has more than 1 million users, ranging from students and teachers to go-to-market teams, and it’s being used to do anything from closing new business to even raising venture capital, according to the company.
Perhaps it used it to close this round.
Printing shoes
3D printing is not new, but there occasionally is a company that springs up that uses it to do something new.
New York-based Zellerfeld is one of those — closing a $15 million seed round led by Founders Fund to further its 3D printing of footwear.
That’s right, with the new cash the company is launching its open beta and 3D-printed footwear platform with 15 exclusive designs, and new ones will be added weekly, according to the startup.
3D printing isn’t often used for things we wear, but footwear is a $500 billion industry with huge brands, D2C companies and old-time brick-and-mortar businesses, so it seems like something primed for 3D printing to disrupt.

"With IPOs Frozen, Startups Need To Worry About Ticking Options Clock",Chris Metinko,2023/03/2,"

As the IPO pipeline remains frozen solid, more noise is being made concerning employees options expiring or being extended.
On the day it was reported that payment titan Stripe put a tentative timeline on a long-awaited IPO, news also broke that the company would look to raise billions from private investors. The funds will be used, in part, to help offset a tax bill that will come due when it modifies employees’ stock grants that are set to expire.
Geolocation startup Foursquare won’t have to face a similar tax bill, as it was reported the company is letting some employees’ options expire.

Startup employees’ options typically expire in 10 years. Not long ago, that seemed far from a problem as companies typically would have some type of exit to give employees the liquidity they earned well before that time period ends.
Now, with companies staying private longer, startups need to keep an eye on not just their runway, but also the option clock.
Staying private longer
While some point to changes to the regulation regarding the number of investors a startup can have as playing a significant role in companies remaining private longer, those in the industry say basic economics is at work.
Before the JOBS Act was passed in 2012, private companies could only have 500 investors on their cap table. After the act was passed, that number jumped to 2,000 and excluded employees who held options.
Before passage, companies like Google (which went public in 2004), Facebook (which went public in 2012) and others were basically forced to go public as they were falling out of compliance with the rule. Startup employees would sell shares to interested investors on the secondary market and the company’s ownership numbers would explode.
However, Andrew Thorpe, a partner at Gunderson Dettmer’s San Francisco office, said the rule change likely is not why startups are staying private longer — but rather it’s the incredible amount of money available on the private market.
“Basically, large unicorns just raise capital the old-fashioned way,” said Thorpe, who advises management teams on securities regulation and public offerings among other things. “They are really in demand and companies with the most demand do not have a problem finding investors. And there’s just more money in the private markets.”
Restricting transfers
However, around the same time as Facebook’s IPO and the investors rule change, some companies started to introduce transfer restrictions into their option plans, which limits an employee’s ability to sell their shares unless approved by the company.
“We never really saw transfer restrictions, but around the time Facebook went public we started to see it more,” said Elizabeth Webb, a partner at Gunderson Dettmer’s Silicon Valley office and co-head of the executive compensation practice.
Such restrictions are now the most common among later-stage private companies, said Yokum Taku, a corporate and securities partner at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati and a co-leader of the firm’s emerging companies practice.
While the restrictions help keep a company’s cap table cleaner and more in control of who owns shares, it also can keep the clock ticking on employees’ options as companies remain private.
Webb said she is seeing the issue creep up more on private companies as they navigate the private sector longer.
“It’s a problem that has plagued the industry for a while,” she said. “With companies staying private longer, we will see more of it. We’ve seen more of it in the last several years.”
Changing rules?
With the massive amount of money available on the private markets, it’s also an issue not likely to go away soon.
However, one way to solve the issue would be if companies resumed going public earlier. Thorpe, who served for six years at the Securities and Exchange Commission, said since the JOBS Act the SEC has tried to streamline the process to go public to make it more attractive to companies.
There also are a couple of proposed changes the SEC may look at that might affect the pace at which VC-backed companies look to the public markets.
One proposed change would amend the “held of record” definition, which could alter how investors are counted. Instead of a special purpose vehicle being counted as one investor, the proposed change would instead count each individual investor in the SPV — significantly pumping up the number of investors in any company.
The other change — which has received more attention — would require more financial disclosure from private companies raising cash. It’s possible such a change would make going public more palatable to companies if they have to disclose guarded financial info regardless of whether they were going public or staying private.
Both issues are on the SEC’s Regulatory Flexibility Agenda for further investigation.
“Some stay on the agenda for a long time, so we’ll see where it goes,” Thorpe said.
If private companies start looking to the public market earlier, perhaps employees can stop watching the clock.

"
Startups Opt For Microcap Mergers To Tap Public Markets,Joanna Glasner,2023/03/2,"

Most years, at least a few buzzy startups manage to carry out high-profile IPOs. But lately, with the window for large new offerings frozen shut, those debuts aren’t happening.
Instead, what we do see are smaller deals in which venture-backed startups are tapping public markets through combinations with Nasdaq-traded microcap companies. Transactions, which take the shape of mergers, reverse mergers and M&A deals, involve companies in similar industries as well as disparate ones.

A few recent examples:

Molekule, a maker of air purifiers that raised over $95 million in venture funding between 2016 and 2020, went public in January through a merger with AeroClean Technologies, a publicly traded, South Florida-based air hygiene company valued at the time around $50 million.
Urgently, a roadside assistance provider that raised nearly $40 million in venture funding from 2014 to 2019, is merging with Otonomo, a connected auto company that has seen its share price plummet since going public via SPAC in 2021.
Gryphon Digital Mining, a startup aiming to be a carbon-negative bitcoin miner, announced plans a month ago to merge with Akerna, a Nasdaq-traded cannabis company. Under terms of the agreement, Akerna is selling its cannabis software assets, and the company will change its name to Gryphon Digital Mining.
Soylent, a maker of meal replacement shakes that raised over $130 million in venture funding between 2013 and 2017, became a unit of Nasdaq-traded consumer brands company Starco Brands last week. Though this was an acquisition, not a merger, it does have the effect of adding the Soylent brand to a publicly traded platform.
Kineta, a venture-funded developer of cancer immunotherapies, made its market debut in December through a reverse merger with Yumanity Therapeutics, a developer of therapies for neurodegenerative disease that had itself gone public through a reverse merger two years before.

Synergies for stocks without a lot to lose
Why are many of these deals happening? Looking at press releases touting these combinations, there’s often talk about synergies.
Urgently and Otonomo tout that their tie-up will provide “meaningful cross-selling revenue opportunities and cost savings.” Molekule and AeroClean boast that their deal “establishes an industry-leading provider of premium, FDA-cleared air purification products.”
Starco CEO Ross Sklar, meanwhile, pitched the Soylent purchase as a way to “get our products to everyone on Earth who needs and deserves affordable, complete nutrition.”
Synergies, of course, are a good thing. But looking at stock market performance prior to these transactions, however, one sees another narrative as well. By and large the public companies involved in these transactions have market caps and share prices beaten down to levels so low they have comparatively little to lose.
Starco, for instance, with a market cap around $50 million, is worth about what Soylent raised in just its Series B round nearly six years ago. AeroClean was below $3 a share before the announced Molekule merger. Otonomo was trading close to 50 cents a share.
Among deals classified as reverse mergers, the transactions also typically offer a way for a private company to get a Nasdaq listing at a lower price than launching an offering from scratch. The math works best when the former public company was already trading at a low valuation.
Brands get a public market following
For venture-backed startups, these smallish mergers and reverse mergers offer a way to access public markets in a pretty low-key manner. There’s usually no road show, no ringing of the opening bell, and limited media coverage.
Unlike a breakout IPO, there are also usually no big gains when a combination closes, although markets do react when it’s first announced. AeroClean shares, for instance, surged after disclosing its Molekule merger plan in October. (Shares of the combined company, which now goes by Molekule, are now back around where they were before the deal news.)
At the end of the day, however, brands going public even at a microcap valuation do get the higher profile and potential capital-raising options that come with a ticker symbol. If their businesses show growth and a path to profitability over coming quarters, we should also expect to see valuations rise sharply.

Chicago’s Varied Startup Scene Takes A Breather After 2 High-Flying Years,Joanna Glasner,2023/03/1,"

If there’s no particular industry that comes to mind when you think of Chicago startups, then you’ve probably got it right.
The Midwestern metropolis is known for having one of the most varied economies of any major U.S. city, with a heavy dose of health care, education, finance, manufacturing, retail and tech. That breadth of expertise seeps into the entrepreneurial culture as well.
“Chicago’s startup scene is super diversified,” said Allison Weil Lechnir, a partner at Hyde Park Venture Partners, a Chicago-based seed and early-stage software investor with a local portfolio that spans industries including health care, logistics, legaltech and landscaping.

A look at top venture-funded Windy City companies underscores this point. To illustrate, we put together a list below of nine of the most heavily funded private companies that raised financing in the past year:


As you can see, it’s a diverse bunch. The two most heavily funded hail from the biotech and logistics spaces: Precision medicine developer Tempus and supply chain software unicorn project44. The list also includes a couple of fintechs, Avant and Amount, and even a mini golf startup, Puttshack.
Funding peaked a year ago
Across North America, startup funding to most sectors peaked in 2021 and early 2022, and has been declining ever since. Chicago did not buck this trend, Crunchbase data shows, with record-setting investment a few quarters ago giving way to a much more sluggish environment today.
For perspective, we charted out annual funding to companies headquartered in Chicago city limits from 2018 until today:


For funding from 2021 until now, we expanded the dataset to look at the broader Chicago metro area, which includes Evanston, Schaumburg and other towns and cities known for tech talent. Here, as illustrated below, funding follows a similar pattern:


As shown above, funding to Chicago-area startups was on fire in 2021 and the first half of 2022. Investors poured over $5 billion into the metro area in 2021, a record-setting year for U.S. venture funding. In 2022, funding slowed but remained robust, with $4.4 billion invested.
Chicago churned out multiple newly minted unicorns during that peak funding period. This includes 12 new unicorns in 2021 alone.
Lately, however, investors have been hitting the brakes. For 2023, just over $200 million had gone to local startups as of late February, on track for the lowest annual total in years. The slowdown reflects national trends, with U.S. startup investment falling especially hard at late-stage and pre-IPO funding.
Poised for growth, when it returns
Given the national trends, Weil Lechnir doesn’t believe the recent local funding slowdown has anything to do with Chicago’s desirability as a startup hub. And while many late-stage investors have taken a pause, she said, seed and early stage remain pretty active.
There’s also stepped-up activity by local investors and institutions to bolster infrastructure and support for startups, which could help boost funding down the road. This includes life sciences, a field in which Chicago has long been a contender but not a leading hub.
John Flavin, CEO of Portal Innovations, a Chicago life sciences investor, is banking that one key element to boosting the region’s muscle is providing startups with local access to wet lab space and advanced equipment.
“This is work you can’t do in your garage at home,” Flavin said, noting that in the past, Chicago was more of an exporter of biotech talent, much of it going to more established hubs like San Francisco, San Diego and Boston. That’s shifting, with Chicago life sciences funding sharply on the rise up until just a few months ago.
Universities are also working to play a bigger role in building startups. This year, for instance, the University of Chicago’s Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship announced Transform, a new accelerator for startups focused on data science and artificial intelligence. A couple years earlier, Polsky launched Duality, dedicated to quantum science and technology companies.
Startup momentum is particularly concentrated downtown, said Weil Lechnir, with most workers either living in the city or commuting from the suburbs via transit. That’s where the networking happens too, including 1871, a downtown nonprofit that bills itself as an innovation hub.
Chicago also benefits by being the major metropolis of the Midwest, which helps draw talent from neighboring cities and states, per Weil Lechnir, who noted: “Everyone young and ambitious living in the Midwest, there’s a very good chance they’re going to make a stop in Chicago professionally at some point in time.”

February’s 10 Top Rounds: Real Estate And AI Startups Score Big,Chris Metinko,2023/03/1,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a monthly feature that runs down the month’s top 10 funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last month’s top rounds here.

February may be the shortest month of the year, but there were still some large rounds in that short time period. Six rounds raised by U.S.-based startups were of a quarter-billion or more, with artificial intelligence helping push some big numbers.
1. Dreamscape, $850M, real estate: Sometimes it can be difficult to figure out what is debt and what is actually growth equity in many of these larger rounds — and this is a good example. New York-based Dreamscape, a real estate development and investment firm, completed an $850 million capital raise this week. However, it’s unclear what was debt and what was equity. We do know Wells Fargo led the debt syndicate and Raymond James led the equity private placement, but that’s about it. We don’t know how much of that $850 million was equity. Regardless, it is a big raise. The firm will use the proceeds to create two new platforms: Dreamscape Entertainment Properties and Dreamscape Entertainment Integrated Resorts, both involving gaming, hospitality and entertainment.
2. SandboxAQ, $500M, AI: Nearly a year after spinning out of tech giant Alphabet, AI and quantum computing startup SandboxAQ finally announced more funding details this month, saying it had raised a $500 million round. SandboxAQ is examining the related effects of both AI and quantum — which is where the company gets “AQ” — to develop commercial products for telecom, financial services, health care, security and other computationally intensive sectors. One aspect of security the startup is looking at is how companies and the government can replace current public-key cryptography algorithms with algorithms that are resistant to quantum computer-based attacks. Quantum computing is a level of compute much faster and at a level superior to classical computers that examines quantum states to perform computation. Investors named included Breyer Capital, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, Thomas Tull, First Light Capital Group, funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Guggenheim Investments, Time Ventures, Section 32, Parkway Venture Capital and other funds and investors.
3. (tied) Anthropic, $300M, AI: San Francisco-based startup, and rival to ChatGPT, Anthropic is the latest AI company to raise big from a tech giant. The AI startup locked up a $300 million round from Google in February. Anthropic’s new round could bring the company’s total valuation to $5 billion, The New York Times reported. The Financial Times first reported Google as the investor.  The new year is shaping up to be an all-out AI war. Late last month, Microsoft finally confirmed it has agreed to a “multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment” into OpenAI, the startup behind the artificial intelligence tools ChatGPT and DALL-E, for a reported $10 billion.
3. (tied) Our Next Energy, $300M, energy: While the EV market has taken off, it’s important to remember those vehicles need batteries. Novi, Michigan-based Our Next Energy raised a huge $300 million Series B to develop those batteries. The round values the startup at $1.2 billion and was led by Franklin Templeton Investments and real estate-focused Fifth Wall. The raise comes just as supply chain issues and the rising cost of battery and metal material are bottlenecking U.S.-based electric car manufacturers. The latest raise will help fund the operations of its battery cell factory that completed construction in December and will formally launch in 2024. Our Next Energy has now raised $390 million, according to Crunchbase data.
3. (tied) Wiz, $300M, cybersecurity: Cybersecurity startup Wiz graduated to decacorn just this week, as the company — based in the U.S. and Israel raised $300 million in fresh capital at a valuation of $10 billion. The Series D funding was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. Founded in 2020, Wiz has now raised a total of $900 million, according to Crunchbase data. The funding for the cloud security startup came with other news, as Wiz announced it won’t move any of that money to Israel due to ongoing unrest about proposed reforms to the country’s judicial system. Some fear the proposed judicial system reforms would undermine Israel’s democratic foundations and grant unchecked power to the government.
6. Pristine Sun, $250M, renewable energy: To kick off this year, renewable energy firm Silicon Ranch announced it had closed $375 million of what could be a $600 million raise. In February, another renewable energy company wrapped up a huge private quarter-billion-dollar round. Richmond, California-based Pristine Sun locked up the huge round from what it called “strategic private equity and family office investors.” The company plans to use the new cash infusion to develop and finance up to 5 gigawatts of its solar projects in Texas, California and Louisiana. The round is the company’s first from outside investors, according to Crunchbase data. Since 1996, Pristine Sun and its affiliates have developed solar and wind projects totaling over 25 GW.
7. Skydio, $230M, drone: Drone startup Skydio locked up a $230 million Series E at a $2.2 billion valuation led by Linse Capital — more than double its valuation from just a couple of years ago. The new round comes almost exactly two years after the company raised a $170 million Series D at a valuation of more than $1 billion. Skydio produces drones for the consumer, enterprise and government sectors. Its drones are used by every branch of the U.S. Department of Defense, by over half of all U.S. State Departments of Transportation and it now has more than 1,200 enterprise customers. Founded in 2014, Skydio has raised $562 million in total, according to the company.
8. Spreetail, $208M, retail: It’s rare a Nebraska-based company is this high on the list, but not unheard of. Last July, Lincoln-based Monolith — which produces clean hydrogen, carbon black and ammonia — closed a $300 million round, and in February it was Lincoln-based e-commerce logistics firm Spreetail’s turn, after a $208 million funding round. The company said the round “was supported by McCarthy Capital, internal management, and other investors.” Founded in 2006, the fresh round is the company’s first outside investment, per Crunchbase data. Spreetail serves more than 500 brands, helping them push e-commerce sales — through analytics, insights and logistics — onto large platforms such as  Amazon, Walmart.com and other sites. Funding to so-called “Amazon aggregator startups” has dropped since the highs of 2020-21, when online retail was hitting new levels due to pandemic lockdowns and consumers relying more on delivered goods.
9. ShiftMed, $200M, health care: The pandemic exposed many issues affecting hospital workers — from burnout to scheduling problems. Virginia-based ShiftMed, a health care workforce marketplace, raised a $200 million round led by health care-focused Panoramic Ventures to tackle some of those issues. Through an automated scheduling platform, the startup connects 35,000 full-time nurses with hospitals and at-home care companies that need last-minute extra support. Founded in 2019, the company has raised $245 million, per Crunchbase.
10. Aera Therapeutics, $193M, biotech: This is also a hard one to know whether or not it should be on the list. Boston-based biotech firm Aera Therapeutics announced its launch with $193 million in financing — but it was in a combined Series A and B led by Arch Venture Partners, GV and Lux Capital. So it was in two rounds, not one. Regardless, Aera makes the list as it looks to develop its proprietary platform for the delivery of genetic medicines.
Big global deals
Only one round outside the U.S. cracked the global top five in February.

China-based Zeekr, which develops and manufactures electric vehicles, raised a $750 million Series A.

Bitwise Industries Announces $80M To Train Tech Workers,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/02/28,"

Despite layoffs rocking the tech industry, some companies are still dutifully training the next generation of talent.
Bitwise Industries, announced on Tuesday it raised $80 million in fresh funding led by existing investors Kapor Center and Motley Fool. Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Citibank also participated in the round. 
The company is a network that helps users learn code and get real-world experience in using it through apprenticeship programs. With hubs in 10 cities, Bitwise recently expanded to Chicago’s South Side as part of its attempt to bring coding skills to historically underrepresented minorities. Bitwise said its hubs have skilled over 10,000 people, 80% of whom received employment after graduating from the program. 

“This latest raise … acknowledges the role technology plays in driving economic impact in previously underserved communities, validates our model and makes it possible for us to roll out our proven approach into other parts of the country,” said Jake Soberal, the co-CEO and co-founder of Bitwise.
Most workers from the program go on to work in industries — companies in agriculture or civic services that still require tech talent — rather than tech giants such as Microsoft and Amazon. 
Contrary to layoff headlines, the United States is facing a labor shortage in the tech space. According to a recent jobs report by career insights firm Dice, tech job postings between June 2021 and 2022 spiked by 60%. 
Some of the largest tech employers such as Disney and Deloitte aren’t considered traditional tech companies — but in the 21st century, what company isn’t using tech? Many are hiring roles related to cybersecurity, cloud operations and data analytics, per Dice.
“The real issue in the United States is that we’re not creating [tech workers] fast enough,” Art Zeile, CEO at Dice, told me last year.

Bain Capital Ventures Closes $1.9B Worth Of Funds,Chris Metinko,2023/02/28,"

Venture funding may be slowing, but venture fundraising sure isn’t.
San Francisco-based Bain Capital Ventures — known for its investments in companies such as LinkedIn, DocuSign and Twilio — announced the close of two funds totaling $1.9 billion. 
The firm will use the new funds to invest in startups from seed to growth rounds within fintech, infrastructure, apps and commerce.

The fundraise announcement is larger than the one BCV made in May 2021 — a $1.3 billion fund to invest in earlier-stage companies. In addition, last year Bain Capital Crypto was unveiled, with $500 million under management.
Investing in VC
Much has been made about the large funds being announced even amid a venture capital pullback in funding. VC firms have been raising larger funds more frequently, reaching out to LPs for new allotments of cash as often as every 18 months even as valuations on many startups are being slashed.
In a blog post, Kevin Zhang, a partner at BCV, seemed to recognize the changing, uneven environment.
“There is immense responsibility in managing dollars entrusted to us by our limited partners,” wrote Zhang. “In a difficult market where their commitment to venture overall may be shrinking, we are especially grateful for their confidence in sustaining and expanding their partnerships with us.”
Like many in the venture world, BCV has pulled back in the market slightly through the last year.
In the first and second quarters of 2022, BCV took part in 39 deals, according to Crunchbase data. However, in the last two quarters of the year — as the venture market started to cool off significantly, especially for startups looking to raise large late growth rounds — BCV only took part in 20 rounds total, per Crunchbase.
Thus far in 2023, BCV only has taken part in four announced deals, including a $45 million Series B for Iowa-based financial services tools developer Moov.

"Not Quite Soda, Not Quite Alcohol: A New Boozeless Booze Is Finding Its Fit",Keerthi Vedantam,2023/02/28,"

On Sunset Boulevard, scattered among Parachute Home, Dr. Martens and a slew of other Instagram-able boutiques and coffee shops is Soft Spirits, Los Angeles’s first nonalcoholic bottle shop.
You wouldn’t know it doesn’t sell alcohol by entering the store. Rows of whiskeys, gins and wines in apothecary-like glass bottles line the walls. If you didn’t bother to peer at the labels, which often say “zero-proof” or “non-alcoholic” in small font, none of these bottles would seem out of place at a liquor store.
The store is tapping into a new kind of 21-and-up consumer: often young, these “sober curious” or “mindful drinking” customers are experimenting less with the hard stuff.

Venture firms have taken notice: In 2022, budding nonalcoholic beverage startups received a record of over $414 million in venture funding as a crowd of millennials and Gen-Z folks are spending less on alcohol.
Celebrities Katy Perry, Blake Lively and Bella Hadid have all founded companies that create low-sugar, botanical-packed nonalcoholic aperitifs.


“We get a lot of people asking, ‘Who is this for?’” said Jillian Barkley, founder of Soft Spirits. “That’s a really interesting question because our demographic so far is a little bit undefinable.”
Pandemic-era buzz around nonalcoholic booze
There was once a time when rejecting a glass of wine or nursing a cup of water came with certain assumptions: Either you were pregnant, recovering from addiction or just  staunchly sober. Options for those nonimbibing adults ranged from water to sugar-packed mocktails.
That began to change during the pandemic. As bars and clubs shuttered, online purchases of nonalcoholic beverages spiked.
From nonalcoholic to cannabis infused
After years of drinking, friends Jake Bullock and Luke Anderson decided they were tired of alcohol — the morning hangovers, the regret and the overall toll on their livers were enough.
“What was hard was that so much of our social world was built around alcohol,” Bullock said. “So it often meant that the choice was either stay and be sober or go out and drink too much and feel terrible the next day.”
The pair founded Cann in 2018, promising a low-dose cannabis-infused drink that could be bought in a six-pack and have the same bubbly, light taste as a canned cocktail (but without the booze). At the time, THC beverages existed in 10-milligram cans that, Bullock said, “is too much for a regular person having a social experience.”
The startup’s two-milligram THC drinks rolled out in California, and slowly moved into other states that allowed the sale of cannabis drinks. The company raised $32 million in funding over the course of two rounds, but still had to work around different state laws carefully as it created distribution strategies. Cann also couldn’t rely on social media marketing due to the nature of the product.
Then, something changed. During the pandemic, online sales for Cann drinks picked up. The company tripled the size of its business, deliveries shot up to 10x more than pre-pandemic numbers, and, in 2022, it sold its 10 millionth can.
“That’s a very small scale compared to alcohol,” Bullock said. “But also alcohol has hundreds of thousands of places where it can sell, and we have a few thousand.”
‘It’s its own thing.’
Cann’s not the only startup to see a shift. Athletic Brewing, perhaps the most well-known nonalcoholic craft beer startup in the U.S., saw massive adoption during the pandemic that stuck even after social distancing norms ended.
“Some of our best weeks of the year are around Memorial Day, July 4th holiday, Labor Day,” said Chris Furnari, communications lead at Athletic Brewing. “So we follow beer trends generally. Just because we’re nonalcoholic, it doesn’t really matter.”
Indeed, Athletic Brewing says 80% of its customers aren’t sober, something NielsenIQ data follows: Around 78% of soft spirit consumers also purchase traditional alcohol.
But companies like Athletic Brewing and Cann aren’t trying to replace alcohol — instead, they’re trying to integrate with other beverages you might see at a cookout or dinner party, like soda and tea.
Companies are making whiskeys that have the alcohol by volume level of a kombucha. Others are making distilled botanical spirits out of herbs and plants that taste nothing like gin or other traditional liquors. As Soft Spirits’ Barkley said, “they’re their own thing.”
“That’s the area that I find exciting because I used to drink alcohol and I know what gin tastes like, I know what whiskey tastes like,” Barkley said. “So this gives you a new avenue to explore [for] a different, unique experience.”

Generative AI Startup Typeface Emerges From Stealth With $65M,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/02/27,"

What if you could use AI to create a [blog post] launching your [apple fruit drink] to [young parents]?
That’s the exact example given by Typeface, a San Francisco-based generative AI startup that announced its launch on Monday with $65 million in its arsenal. Funding came from Lightspeed Venture Partners, Menlo Ventures, M12 (Microsoft’s venture fund) and Google Ventures.
The company’s AI platform is tailored specifically for “enterprise content creation” — companies can create product shots, blog posts, social media ads and job posts that meet brand specifications and tailor marketing to niche audiences.  

The company is working with a handful of companies including Sequoia Benefits Group to create optimal headlines, test different media assets, and even brainstorm content ideas. 
“By adding brand affinity to generative AI, Typeface allows enterprises to harness their collective creative power for unique expression of their stories and imagination,” said Typeface CEO and former Adobe CTO Abhay Parasnis. “Now, any company can transform content into a value multiplier.”
Marketing reimagined
Funding to generative AI startups reached its peak in 2021 with over $3.9 billion. But 2022 wasn’t much different — while funding dried up in many other sectors, the industry garnered over $3.7 billion in venture funding.


Typeface joins an ever-growing list of generative AI companies tailored for enterprise-grade marketing. Jasper, a Texas-based AI startup, can churn out blog posts, email ads, Facebook posts and video scripts “10 times faster” (than humans, I assume). San Francisco-based Writer works with huge brands like Spotify, L’Oreal and UiPath to increase content output and traffic searches.
Which begs the question: What will the future of marketing jobs look like in an AI-laced industry?

Drone-Maker Skydio Raises $230M At $2.2B Valuation,Chris Metinko,2023/02/27,"

Drone startup Skydio locked up a $230 million Series E at a $2.2 billion valuation — more than double its valuation from just two years ago.
The new round was led by Linse Capital and included participation from Andreessen Horowitz, Next47, IVP, DoCoMo, Nvidia, the Walton Family Foundation, UP Partners, Hercules Capital and Axon.
The new round comes almost exactly two years after the company raised a $170 million Series D at a valuation of more than $1 billion. Founded in 2014, Skydio has raised $562 million in total, according to the company.

Skydio produces drones for the consumer, enterprise and government sectors. Its drones are used by every branch of the U.S. Department of Defense, by over half of all U.S. State Departments of Transportation and it now has more than 1,200 enterprise customers.
The company, whose autonomous drones are mainly used for surveillance and public safety operations, has realized 30x growth over the past three years.
“Drones enable the core industries that our civilization runs on — transportation, public safety, energy, construction, communications, defense and more — to operate more safely and more efficiently by putting sensors wherever they’re needed, whenever they’re needed, while keeping people safely on the ground,” said co-founder and CEO Adam Bry in a release.
Drones, defense and money
Funding to drone startups was down last year compared to 2021 — which was typical in most industries as venture capitalists pulled back on spending. In 2021, drone startups saw $2.2 billion invested, according to Crunchbase data. That number dropped to $1.4 billion last year.
Skydio’s new round is by far the largest raised by a drone manufacturer this calendar year.
It is not, however, the largest round raised in the last several months by a startup that works closely with the government and the defense industry. Late last year, Costa Mesa, California-based defense and security firm Anduril locked up a Series E worth nearly $1.5 billion that values the company at $8.5 billion. 
Anduril builds software and hardware enhanced with artificial intelligence and machine learning for the military and defense industry. It works with the U.S. and its allies to create drones, underwater vehicles and different operating and control systems.

Wiz Becomes $10B Cybersecurity Unicorn But Says New Money Won’t Go To Israel Amid Turmoil Over Judicial Reform,Marlize van Romburgh,2023/02/27,"

Wiz, a cybersecurity startup based in the U.S. and Israel, said Monday that it has raised $300 million in fresh capital at a valuation of $10 billion. It won’t move any of that money to Israel, however, amid ongoing unrest about proposed reforms to the country’s judicial system.
The Series D funding was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and existing investors Greenoaks Capital Partners and Index Ventures. Crunchbase data shows Wiz has now raised a total of $900 million from investors including Sequoia Capital and Salesforce Ventures 1, just three years after it was founded. The latest funding makes Wiz the most highly valued cybersecurity unicorn on The Crunchbase Unicorn Board. 

Wiz was founded in March 2020 by CEO Assaf Rappaport, CTO Ami Luttwak, Vice President of Product Yinon Costica, and Vice President of R&D Roy Reznik. The team had previously worked together at Microsoft’s cloud security group and co-founded Adallom, which was acquired by Microsoft in 2015 for $320 million.
Tech companies question future in Israel amid turmoil
Wiz, headquartered in New York and Tel Aviv, said it plans to use the new funding to expand its workforce, which currently includes about 650 employees. It also plans to open new offices in Austin and Dallas, Texas, and Washington, D.C.
None of the new money will go to Israel, however, the company said, while the country is mired in uncertainty and division about a proposed overhaul of its judiciary by the right-wing government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Critics say the proposed judicial system reforms would undermine Israel’s democratic foundations and grant unchecked power to the government led by Netanyahu, who faces corruption charges. Netanyahu and his allies have said the overhaul is needed to curb the power of an unelected judiciary.
The prime minister’s plans have sparked widespread protest and prompted some leaders of Israel’s thriving tech sector to question future investment in the country. Among the tech companies eyeing the exits are Papaya Global, a payroll startup valued at $4 billion.
“Unfortunately, due to the legal coup the money raised will not enter Israel,” Wiz co-founder and CEO Assaf Rappaport said in a statement given to Reuters. “Our big concern about Israeli high tech is not only about money leaving Israel but also the large amount of money that will no longer enter Israel.”
Cybersecurity funding by the numbers
Wiz’s latest funding follows a pullback in cybersecurity funding last year amid an overall decline in VC spending in 2022. Funding to the sector in the first few months of 2023, however, has held up relatively strong: Cyber startups received a total of about $1.7 billion in the first six weeks of 2023, per Crunchbase data — down from the same period last year but ahead of 2021 and 2020’s figures.

"
What Makes A Great Startup Name? We Look At The Latest Trends,Joanna Glasner,2023/02/27,"

Founders selecting a company name would prefer one that has it all: Cool, catchy, original, evocative and legally unencumbered.
But at the end of the day, a single attribute often determines success or failure, said Michael Carr, co-founder and self-described chief naming officer of Austin-based brand consultancy NameStormers.
“There is only one thing that matters when it comes to a name: Can people remember it?” he said.

While not everyone may agree on this point, it is inarguably a widespread mindset. Among startups in surveyed countries that raised sizable seed funding rounds in the past year, Crunchbase data shows that simple names composed of recognizable words have gotten super popular.
Increasingly, founders appear to be prioritizing recognizability over uniqueness. True, we do still see names composed of made-up words, like Boopos or Stonks. However, they’re conspicuously less prevalent these days than names consisting of common nouns and verbs like Tumble or Power.
New naming preferences are largely a reflection of established success stories, observed David Placek, founder of Lexicon Branding, the naming consultancy behind startup monikers like Impossible Foods, Turo and Lucid Motors.
“In our experience, the only trend in naming is imitation,” he said, as newer startups seek, either consciously or not, to capture the magic of an existing transformative brand.
So what are the predominant trends in this more staid startup naming era? Based on a Crunchbase survey of hundreds of recently funded startups, we’ve highlighted four hip naming strategies.
A single dictionary word (especially for fintechs)
Who needs a singularly unique brand? Certainly not fintech startups, which seem to be copious adopters of short, punchy dictionary words as names.
Among startups seed-funded in the past year, for instance, you can track your crypto transactions with Context, issue credit cards with Power, plan your estate with Wealth, and manage your investments with Fierce. You can even run business accounting with Decimal or build automated investment strategies with Composer — the list goes on.
Imitation may go a long way toward explaining what’s going on here. Placek postulates that the success of Stripe, Block (formerly Square) and Plaid in the fintech space may have influenced newer companies in the sector to pick simple word names.
Upstarts in other industries are also favoring common word names. Examples include Aware, a mobile app for health data, Roam, a cloud headquarters for scattered remote businesses, and Earth, a developer of an environmentally friendly alternative to burial and cremation.
Notably, the vast majority of these simple names were shared by a number of other companies, often including other recently funded startups.
Branded biotechs
It used to be that biotech companies had names reminiscent of some kind of prescription drug. Typically, even the first word in their names sounded like a life science company and not a tech startup.
This looks to be the case from a perusal of recently public biotechs, which includes names like Cadrenal Therapeutics, Mineralys Therapeutics and Lipella Pharmaceuticals. But trends appear to be changing.
When looking at recently seed-funded biotech companies, their names (or at least the first word in their names) could easily be tech startup monikers as well. Examples include Replay, Nested Therapeutics, Surf Bio, Nest Genomics and Systemic Bio.
Here, imitation may also play a role, given the breakout success of Moderna, a company whose name, per Placek, could work in myriad sectors beyond biotech.
Cute misspellings
For some startups, the creative misspelling serves to create a name that’s both familiar and unique. Swap out a z for an s or y for an i, and suddenly you’ve got a brand that’s pronounced like a familiar word, but has a spelling all its own.
This approach has been a perennial featured trend in prior startup naming stories. The latest survey shows it remains quite popular, as evidenced by startups like Gynger, Wispr, Rezonate, transferz and Qobra.
One more twist on this theme is to sub a number for a group of letters. This is the case, for example, with Rumin8, developer of a feed supplement that reduces methane emissions in livestock.
Carr sees both pros and cons to the creative misspelling approach to naming.
“If the primary initial exposure is visual or in print, then a misspelling can draw the eye,” he said. The problem is there are always some people who will just hear the name and won’t know to look for the unusual spelling.
Some random word followed by AI
Given how much money investors are pouring into AI startups, it makes sense that a company would choose to come across as one. Thus, it’s not surprising that many newish startups continue to tack “AI” to the end of their names.
Among the latest crop of seed-funded companies, a common approach was to pick a common dictionary word and then add “AI.” Our list includes cybersecurity provider Protect AI, data infrastructure technology company Spice AI, search app Rewind AI, and business lending exchange Lama AI, to name a few.
Among naming experts interviewed, opinions on this approach were mixed.
“That to me is a very short sighted strategy,” said Carr, regarding companies adding AI to their names. He compares it to the dot-com bubble, when companies routinely put .com in their names, only to remove the suffix later on.
With AI, one particular risk factor, per Carr, is that the technology isn’t always perceived as a force for good. This presents the danger that it will carry negative connotations for a company that brands itself with AI.
Placek, meanwhile, is more accepting of this approach. It has the benefit of signaling what a startup does. And, if the company decides it doesn’t want AI at the end of the name, there is the option of dropping it.
Methodology
The survey looked at startups founded in the past three years that have raised $500,000 or more in seed or pre-seed funding in roughly the past year. The survey focused primarily, but not exclusively, on English-speaking countries and on names based on English words or words that are similar in English and other languages.

Tech Jobs: These Recently Funded Robotics Startups Are Hiring Humans,Jenna D'Illard,2023/02/27,"

Last week brought some sad (and strange) news for robotics lovers as mega corporation and Google parent company Alphabet reportedly shuttered its Everyday Robots department.

"Reader Survey: Two Months In, How Are You Feeling About 2023?",Marlize van Romburgh,2023/02/27,"

Crunchbase News readers started 2023 feeling gloomy. Most readers who responded to our survey at the beginning of the year predicted we’d head into a global recession. 
Just over 40% said their companies were slashing costs as a result — and headcount is the No. 1 expense on the chopping block. Indeed, as many U.S. tech workers have been laid off in the first two months of 2023 as in all of 2022, by our tally.

But as we head toward the end of the first quarter, it’s not entirely clear that we are, in fact, headed toward a recession. Outside of the tech sector and housing market, the economy seems to be humming along OK, albeit with frustratingly high inflation. 
While tech workers have lost their jobs in droves, other sectors are still struggling to get enough workers — and companies in industries ranging from farm equipment manufacturers to defense tech are snatching up talent from Silicon Valley while they can.
In our earlier survey, one reader noted that there’s a gulf between the VCs on Sand Hill Road and everyone else: “There’s a big disconnect between where investors think the economy is going and where everyone else thinks it’s going,” said the reader, who identified as an owner or executive in the tech industry. “Investors are running for the hills. Everyone else is being cautious.”
So, how’re you feeling now, with a couple months of 2023 under your belt? Take the Crunchbase News Q1 2023 reader survey and let us know.

The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Nebraska’s Spreetail Leads The Way In Slow Week,Chris Metinko,2023/02/24,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.

Big rounds dominated last week, but this week were hard to come by. Only two companies raised nine-figure rounds after a half-dozen startups raised such rounds last week. Oddly, neither company that raised those large rounds hail from California or other big states known for venture — but rather Nebraska and New Jersey. Weird to say the least.
1. Spreetail, $208M, retail: It’s rare a Nebraska-based company is this high on the list, but not unheard of. Last July, Lincoln-based Monolith — which produces clean hydrogen, carbon black and ammonia — closed a $300 million round and topped this list. This week it’s Lincoln-based e-commerce logistics firm Spreetail’s turn, after a $208 million funding round. The company said the round “was supported by McCarthy Capital, internal management, and other investors.” Founded in 2006, the fresh round is the company’s first outside investment, per Crunchbase data. Spreetail serves more than 500 brands, helping them to push their e-commerce sales — through analytics, insights and logistics — onto large platforms such as  Amazon, Walmart.com and other sites. Funding to so-called “Amazon aggregator startups” has dropped since the highs of 2020-21, when online retail was hitting new all-time levels due to pandemic lockdowns and consumers relying more on delivered goods.
2. Vytalize Health, $100M, health care: Value-based care provider Vytalize Health closed a $100 million funding round led by Enhanced Healthcare Partners and Monroe Capital this week to further advance its virtual and in-home primary care offerings for seniors. Vytalize Health partners primary care practices with more than 250,000 patients to help with point of care recommendations based on data. The company tries to fill in the gaps around necessary and regular medical visits for seniors to avoid unnecessary trips to the emergency room. Founded in 2014, the Hoboken, New Jersey-based startup has raised nearly $176 million, per Crunchbase data.
3. ProsperOps, $72M, cloud: Most companies are using the cloud, and unfortunately — for them — paying more and more to do it. Those firms are using more cloud services while prices are increasing. So how do they manage costs? Maybe with a startup like Austin-based ProsperOps. The company just received a $72 million investment led by H.I.G. Growth Partners and other strategic investors. The firm offers a cloud cost optimization platform, so customers can watch their usage, unlock savings and maximize their dollars. Speaking of maximizing dollars, this marks the startup’s first outside funding round since being founded in 2018, according to Crunchbase data.
4. Tome, $43M, artificial intelligence: It’s hard to get too far down this list these days without getting to a company that uses the term “AI-powered,” and this week we have Tome. The San Francisco-based startup uses AI to help turn users’ ideas into a more compelling visual narrative. In a sense, it can replace something like a more stagnant powerpoint presentation. The company raised a $43 million Series B led by Lightspeed Venture Partners at a reported $300 million valuation. Founded in 2020, Tome has now raised $81 million, according to the company.
5. (tied) Finch, $40M, human resources: San Francisco-based Finch, a provider of  APIs for employment systems, raised a $40 million Series B led by existing investors General Catalyst and Menlo Ventures. In an environment where it is getting harder to raise money, it’s worth noting Finch raised a $15 million Series A in June. The company will use the new cash to extend coverage to more payroll, HR and benefits systems, and move into new employment data verticals. Founded in 2020, Finch has raised $58.6 million, according to the company.
5. (tied) Transcend Therapeutics, $40M, biotech: More than 50 million Americans suffer from neuropsychiatric diseases, including post-traumatic stress disorder. New York-based biotech firm Transcend Therapeutics is looking to help some of those unfortunately affected. The company closed a $40 million Series A led by Alpha Wave Global and integrated Investment Partners to help in those efforts. The firm plans to use the cash infusion to launch multiple clinical trials, including a phase II study, with its next-generation psychoactive compound. Founded in 2021, Transcend has raised nearly $42 million to date, per the company.
7. (tied) Aeroseal, $30M, climate tech: Ohio-based Aeroseal raised a $30 million Series B led by OGCI Climate Investments. Founded in 2010, the company has raised $52 million, per Crunchbase.
7. (tied) Vitally, $30M, SaaS: New York-based customer success platform Vitally closed a $30 million Series B led by Next47. Founded in 2017, the company has raised nearly $40 million, according to Crunchbase data.
9. Here Not There Labs, $26M, Web3: San Francisco-based Web3 startup Here Not There Labs closed a $25.5 million Series A round led by a16z crypto. It is the startup’s first raise — per Crunchbase — and will be used to build Towns, a web-based chat app.
10. Electra Vehicles, $21M, EVs: Boston-based startup Electra Vehicles, a maker of electric vehicle software, raised a $21 million round led by United Ventures. Founded in 2015, the company has raised more than $25 million, according to Crunchbase.
Big global deals
Just like the largest round in the U.S. went to a company located in an area not known for big funding, something similar happened for the second-largest round globally.

Denmark-based Hemab, a clinical-stage biotech company, closed a $135 million Series B.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of Feb. 18 to 24. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

Special Series: Black-Founded Startups Attract Funding By Filling Gaps In Health Care Equity,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/02/24,"




Editor’s note: This article is the last of our three-part series on the state of venture investment to Black-founded startups in 2022. Driving these reports are data from Crunchbase’s Diversity Spotlight feature, which helps indicate diversity in startups’ and investment firms’ leadership teams. Part One introduced the funding landscape for Black-founded startups in 2022, and Part Two checked out the largest rounds raised by Black-founded startups. — Special Projects Editor Christine Kilpatrick
Dr. Iman Abuzeid and Rome Portlock are part of a rare club.
The pair founded Incredible Health, a career marketplace that connects nurses with medical organizations to combat an ongoing massive worker shortage in health care. The company raised $80 million in 2022, making it one of the 52 Black-founded health care companies to receive funding that year (according to Crunchbase data). 

Between 2016 and 2022, Black-founded companies made up around 1.7% of all venture-backed deals in the health care space, Crunchbase data shows. In 2022, as health care startups overall raised more than $555 billion, Black-founded startups saw only 1.3% of that money.


“You can acknowledge that the bias exists because the data proves it, but you actually have to compartmentalize it mentally and not dwell on it,” said Abuzeid. “It doesn’t actually help you as an individual CEO.”
It’s a tough reality to ignore when Black people have historically been abused by the health care system, leading to poor health outcomes. The infant mortality rate for Black babies born to rich families is 22% higher than that of white babies born to poor families. Clinical trials meant to test the safety and efficacy of drugs and vaccines overrepresent white people — one study found that in 10 years of cancer drug clinical trials, only 3.1% of participants were Black.
You may wonder why founder diversity in health care is important when vaccines and drugs work inside the body.
“If, every time someone got into a particular car and they were fine, and then a Black person drove that car and had a 1 in 4 chance of crashing every single time, would you be comfortable with people driving that car at all?” said Jumpstart Nova partner Kathryne Cooper, who focuses on Black-founded health care companies. “If it’s not safe for one group, it’s not actually safe for any of us.”
Filling the gaps in health care equity
Most Americans are really unsatisfied with the health care system, which is littered with friction points that range from inconvenient to medically dangerous.
For example, Incredible Health, a 6-year-old startup, is focusing on a problem that has long plagued the health care industry: low nursing staffing rates. Lack of adequate staffing makes it harder for all patients to find timely care. A shortage of staff also means health professionals spend less time with each patient. 
But it’s a problem most salient in medical deserts — large swathes of the U.S. where there aren’t enough hospitals, doctors and mental health professionals to take care of the population. It can often lead to medical neglect, especially for chronic issues — Black patients with diabetes, for example, are three times more likely to lose their limbs than others, despite it being one of the most preventable surgeries. 
According to Crunchbase data, 21% of the 28 largest funding rounds to Black-founded companies in 2022 went toward health care companies fixing small gaps in the health care system. Somatus, which provides holistic care for patients dealing with kidney disease, raised $325 million in Series E funding last year. Eleanor Health, a mental health startup aimed at substance abuse patients, raised $50 million in Series C funding.


Incredible Health’s 2022 Series B raise was one of the largest in the health care staffing space that year. But it also came with a strategy: Abuzeid targeted technology-focused venture firms in the Bay Area with a history of funding underrepresented founders. 
“Frankly, it means that they don’t just talk the talk, they actually walk the walk,” Abuzeid said. “They’ve already proven that there isn’t some weird bias going on, and I don’t have to deal with that aspect at all.”
Closing the gap in health care funding
When funding flooded into the health care space in 2020 in a pandemic-induced frenzy, Black-founded startups saw less than 2% of it, Crunchbase data shows.
According to a report from digital health-focused investment firm Rock Health, 41% of Black health care startup founders said they bootstrapped their company, while less than 25% of white and Asian founders said the same.
Inequity is often baked into the fundraising process — founders with connections in the venture world are more likely to get their foot in the door. Many venture firms look at past fundraising rounds to help determine whether or not they should invest, and some minority founders aren’t always able to scrape together a sizable friends and family round to launch their business. 
But some firms like Jumpstart Nova, an offshoot of Nashville, Tennessee-based Jumpstart Health Investors that is specifically dedicated to funding Black-founded health care companies, are rethinking the process. The fund details what kinds of startups it invests in, and all founders have to fill out the same form before being considered for an investment. 
“Black founders are chronically underfunded and health care is no exception,” Cooper said. “Health care affects all Americans. And if a certain group is going to be cut out from this funding, I don’t think that’s representative of all health care opportunities.”

"
The Problem With Letting Market Momentum Determine A Startup’s Valuation,Guest Author,2023/02/24,"

By Dan Gray
“We’re letting the market price this round.”
This line is often fed to founders in preparation for the notoriously tricky valuation question.
It’s a negotiation tactic. You don’t want to pitch a price that may be off-putting, so you avoid giving an answer. But what does “letting the market price a round” mean?

In warm markets, when capital flows freely and optimism is high, it means you are confident that interest in your startup will be sufficient to secure attractive terms. As a founder, you leverage market conditions to get what you want.
Dan Gray of Equidam
Unfortunately for founders, it cuts both ways. In cooler markets, as we saw in the latter three quarters of 2022, letting the market price the round means downward pressure on valuation. It is a buyer’s market, and investors are likely to set terms further in their own favor.
In technical terms, it means your focus is really on “pricing” rather than valuation. Instead of focusing on the objective worth of your company, you ask what the market seems willing to pay at that moment. It is in that fine distinction that the trouble begins.
The underrecognized influence of momentum in VC
Early-stage startups are — in theory — fairly well insulated from macroeconomic conditions, being many years away from exit and serving niche market segments. So why have their valuations been knocked around so much?
The truth is that a significant amount of VC activity is influenced by momentum, which manifests in two places: First, the notorious FOMO factor which, for example, drove a lot of Web3 and crypto investments. Second, the reliance on comparables, and how that can compound trends in pricing and cause them to leak into other sectors and stages.
An unfortunate consequence of this behavior is that investors are keen to deploy capital in hot markets when valuations are high and more cautious in cooler markets when there is a greater need for capital and better deals to be had.
As Rachel ten Brink of Red Bike Capital wrote in a Forbes article:
“As with most economic cycles, investors’ interest to deploy capital peaks when it is usually a terrible time to invest and the market is overheated, but stay on the sidelines when conditions for investments are at their best.”
Hype vs. rational market
Investors who navigate by market momentum can find themselves with a lot of capital tied up in expensive hype, while great ideas in overlooked segments go underfunded. Rational markets are healthy markets.
It seems obvious that throttling this connection between market momentum and startup valuation would yield better results for everyone involved.
Founders would have more consistent access to capital, and investors would be less vulnerable to the tide turning against them. Overall, a more robust market still delivers the specific risk/return ratio required of that asset class, with more direct focus on the performance of investors and founders. It requires a fundamental change in how we value the startup asset class, and specifically that we look at valuation as more than just a pricing exercise. The process of valuation allows us to dive more deeply into the performance and potential of a company, and build a more analytical picture of the opportunity. Away from the reliance on comparables, we can exercise greater independence of judgment, more rationality and more accountability.
The die-hard momentum investors in venture capital are welcome to steam ahead, but it seems like an odd choice in a market that can change course quickly, with long windows of illiquidity.

Artificial Intelligence In Agtech Is Blooming,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/02/23,"

Artificial intelligence has been a hot topic in recent months thanks to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. While everyone is marveling at the technology for passing law exams, AI has long had the ability to feed us.
Source.ag, a Netherlands-based agriculture tech startup, announced on Thursday it raised a modest $23 million Series A funding round for its AI platform that predicts the best growing conditions for greenhouse plants.

AI has been deeply seeded in agtech for a long time. At least $400 million poured into AI-powered agtech startups in 2022 per Crunchbase data, though I suspect the number is higher based on how ubiquitous AI applications are in the space.


 
Agriculture’s love affair with AI
Due to the irregularities of climate change, extended drought seasons and supply chain issues, feeding the world’s 8-billion-and-growing population is perhaps one of the most pressing problems of our time. These factors add to the rising cost of food.
That’s where AI comes in — several companies use it to predict weather conditions, adjust and save water, and detect diseases that can kill crops.
One of the most common uses for AI is indoor farming. Source.ag’s technology works in greenhouses to adjust water and humidity conditions, making the growing process more efficient and leading to greater yield. Greenhouse growing requires less arable land (a dwindling resource across the world) and less water, making it more resource-efficient than traditional farms.
We’ve touched on this topic before.
Last year, Soli Organic raised $125 million to grow a variety of plants indoors using automation to adjust for temperature and a special “secret sauce” soil that maximizes yield. The company is in the process of peppering indoor farms close to cities around the U.S. in hopes to drive down transportation costs and preserve freshness.
Gotham Greens, another indoor farming startup based out of New York, raised $310 million last year to use water-saving hydroponics technology in its vertical farms.
While AI is busy being unhinged on Bing and copying artists, agtech is a good reminder that the technology raises fewer ethical concerns when it’s not pretending to be human.

E-Commerce Logistics Firm Spreetail Lands Large $208M Raise,Chris Metinko,2023/02/23,"

Nebraska is not known for large funding announcements, but that did not hinder Spreetail from securing some serious funding.
The Lincoln-based e-commerce logistics and channel management company closed a $208 million funding round, which the company said “was supported by McCarthy Capital, internal management, and other investors.”

Founded in 2006, the fresh round is the company’s first outside investment, per Crunchbase data.
Spreetail serves more than 500 brands, helping them push their e-commerce sales — through analytics, insights and logistics — on large platforms such as  Amazon, Walmart.com and other sites.
Funding to so-called “Amazon aggregator startups” has dropped since the highs of 2020-21, when online retail was hitting new all-time levels due to pandemic lockdowns and consumers relying more on delivered goods.
“Many brands, aggregators, and agencies are heavily leveraged moving into 2023,” said CEO, Brett Thome in a release. “We have read the writing on the wall around post-pandemic shifts in consumer behavior combined with inflationary concerns and have repositioned Spreetail to increase our investment into our brand partnerships, our technology, and our organization this year.”
Spreetail said it reached $1 billion in revenue in 2021.
However, in October it was reported the company had laid off a “substantial number” of what was believed to be an 800-person workforce.
Cornhusker cash
While Nebraska may not be a funding hot bed, the Spreetail round is not the state’s largest in the last 12 months.
Last July, Lincoln-based Monolith — which produces clean hydrogen, carbon black and ammonia — closed a $300 million round led by TPG Rise Climate and Decarbonization Partners, a partnership between BlackRock and Temasek.
Thanks to that round, VC-backed startups in the state saw $465 million in funding last year — more than the previous two years combined, per Crunchbase data.

"Once Taboo, Startups May Be Warming To Down Rounds",Chris Metinko,2023/02/23,"

In 2021 it may have seemed any startups could raise $100 million at the snap of its fingers — but the last year-plus is forcing some to find more creative ways to raise rounds and even contemplate the once taboo “down round.”
Last year ended with a slew of unicorns announcing deals that sliced into their valuations and the start of this year brought similar headlines, with reports that highly valued startups such as payments provider Stripe and online prescription delivery company Capsule are looking to raise down rounds due to market conditions.

As funding has become increasingly hard to secure for startups, down rounds, flat funds — fundraises at the previous round’s valuation — and other creatively structured rounds are becoming commonplace, as necessity dictates changes in the way companies raise cash.
Changing views
In the past, such rounds have been avoided, and not just because of any possible negative public relations spin. Down rounds were seen as lessening employee morale — since options can be a significant part of a startup worker’s total job offer — as well as creating dissension in the boardroom with new investors paying less for significant stakes.
“I think down rounds are becoming less stigmatized,” said Yash Patel, general partner at Telstra Ventures. “I think that’s become the new normal.
“I think if you are a startup, you have to ask, ‘What are the other alternatives?’” Patel said.
There are mainly two choices for startups right now aside from a down or flat round — venture debt or what is often referred to as a “structure” round.
Currently, venture debt providers are getting choosier as to who they lend to and there is more convenience included in the conditions of the debt — which set certain financial goals for the startup, Patel said.
The other option is a structured round, which a startup raises at a higher valuation but gives the investors liquidity preference that can be as high as 3x. This puts the investors at the front of the line to get paid out in the event of an exit at 3x the money invested.
Those deals can often leave early investors and common shareholders out in the cold with little recourse.
“I think existing inventors like the idea of a down round better since no one gets screwed,” said Patel, adding he views many structured rounds as “pernicious and predatory.”
Other investors say they never attached a stigma to down rounds, and an uptick in them helps keep them all on the same level.
“I have more respect for companies that are going to raise a down round and keep the same structure as previous ones,” said Don Butler, managing director at Thomvest Ventures. “It keeps (the cap table) cleaner.”
Down round not a death knell
Butler notes successful companies have raised down rounds and done pretty well.
Most famously, Facebook raised a down round after it raised $240 million from Microsoft in 2007. At that time, Facebook was valued at $15 billion. However, less than two years after that raise, Facebook raised $200 million at a reported $10 billion valuation — which included preferred shares.
The funding environment also has caused some companies to get creative. Butler said some startups raise what is basically an extension at the valuation of the preceding round. However, included in the deal is the ability to invest in the next round at the same valuation — locking in the price. Some deals let the company call it, while others let the investors decide whether they will invest in that succeeding round.
While not totally dissimilar from warrants or options, it is still a creative way to find financing.
Not all structured rounds are created equal, noted others.
Chris Farmer, CEO and co-founder at San Francisco-based venture firm SignalFire — which just closed on $900 million of new capital last week — said if the structured round leads to profitability or an exit it can make sense.
However, if it is just a bridge to the next round of funding, that is where trouble can start. That next round of investors will likely want to build upon the structure earlier investors already introduced and want even better terms.
In that case, Farmer said, raising a down round is logical.
“I’d rather reset the valuation to something sustainable, as a general rule,” he said.
Farmer added companies can also appease employees in a down round by doing refresh grants or creating a new strike price.
Regardless, Farmer said while many companies were able to do insider rounds last year to give them runway extensions, down rounds are certainly here as the market has shifted.
“We’ve entered a Darwinian period in the market,” he said. “There is a premium of execution over high growth right now.”

This Is Not The End: How To Navigate A Down Market,Guest Author,2023/02/23,"

By Eyal Lifschitz
Like all industries, venture capital is not immune to the overall market uncertainty that dominated the second half of 2022 and has now spilled into 2023.
According to research firm Preqin, venture capital investments last year experienced the sharpest drop in 20 years, equating to a year-over-year difference of $286 billion. On a global scale, deal executions were down a staggering 42% in the first three quarters. These significant dips in activity indicate that investors continue to be more cautious with their money.

While the current climate of venture capital investments could appear all doom and gloom from a first glance, history has shown us that in these market conditions, great opportunities for investment still exist.
Early-stage investing
In just the past 20 years, we have seen downturns in the market that have provided actionable tips for navigating the present. In just the 2000s, we have experienced multiple spurts of economic difficulties; however, these periods presented some of the best conditions for venture capital firms to build their portfolios by specifically targeting early-stage companies.
Eyal Lifschitz of Peregrine Ventures.
Although early-stage companies are often considered the highest risk, they do present the most rewarding opportunities. By jumping in at the ideation phase, venture capital firms that have the know-how to build early-stage companies can leverage their industry-specific connections with “strategics” and provide guidance with minimal capital infusions to foster the company’s growth. This level of oversight and leadership of a young company can produce significant money-making opportunities as the portfolio matures or through either M&A or IPO prospects when the market self-corrects.
First- and best-in-class investments
Early-stage investing will be a key to surviving this most recent market dip, bthe companies selected for investment must also be identified as both first-in-class and best-in-class. Very good companies will continue to raise money no matter the economic climate. While raising money is extremely important, it is not the end goal for successful returns.
It is critical that venture capital firms engage in market conversations with strategics to understand the strategic institutional players’ goals for their own portfolios. Industry-specific giants will look to acquire companies that not only fill a need and will service the widest selection of people, but also offer the most cutting-edge technologies. Venture capital firms should spend the time now, while the market is in a downturn, to identify and foster the maturation of these companies. When the market corrects, the early-stage company that is producing a best-in-class product will be primed for acquisition by strategic industry players.
Applying just one of these factors will not be enough to successfully navigate a downturn. Overall competition in the market naturally weans itself as a lack of funding impacts often newer and stagnant firms in challenging economic conditions. With a perfect storm of high inflation rates and talks of a recession looming, top players will understand how to navigate the market by seizing early-stage companies that are both first-in-class and best-in-class to build their portfolios for years of successful returns.

"Special Series: Black-Founded Startups Raised Large Rounds, Added 3 Unicorns in 2022",Gené Teare,2023/02/23,"

Editor’s note: This article is the second of our three-part series on the state of venture investment to Black-founded startups in 2022. Driving these reports are data from Crunchbase’s Diversity Spotlight feature, which helps indicate diversity in startups’ and investment firms’ leadership teams. Part One introduced the funding landscape for Black-founded startups in 2022, and Part Three focuses on VC investment in Black-founded health care startups. — Special Projects Editor Christine Kilpatrick
Esusu, a fintech startup that helps renters build credit with on-time payment reporting, was rejected 326 times by investors prior to its 2022 funding that valued the company at a billion dollars. 
Investors who passed over the company did not believe in “this idea of investing in low- to medium-income households and helping them get quality financial access to products,” said Wemimo Abbey, Esusu’s co-founder and co-CEO. 
That all changed in early 2022, when Esusu raised a $130 million Series B funding led by the SoftBank Vision Fund — just six months after announcing its Series A in 2021. 

Abbey, who grew up in the slums of Nigeria and came to the U.S. as a student, had direct experience of the impact of not having a credit history. He was not able to get a loan from a bank, so borrowed from a predatory lender. 
Wemimo Abbey, co-founder and co-CEO of Esusu
Around 47 million American households — representing more than 100 million people, or roughly a third of the country’s population — rent their homes. But those rental histories don’t help to build credit, said Abbey. Esusu works with property owners to help renters build their credit scores with on-time payment reporting. The company has 3.5 million rental units on its platform, and grew 300% over the past year. Esusu also provides rental assistance with 0% fees in order to support renters and avoid evictions. 
“As a society we’re not solving homelessness backwards, and the landlord also doesn’t have to evict people,” said Abbey. 
Esusu was one of three Black-founded U.S. startups that joined The Crunchbase Unicorn Board in 2022. At the top of the list was new health care unicorn Virginia-based Somatus, which raised $325 million in a round that valued the company at $2.5 billion. Somatus provides kidney care and prevention through a network of health care providers. 
Another Black-founded health care startup in recruiting, San-Francisco-based Incredible Health, raised $80 million last year, valuing the company at $1.7 billion. 
These three companies joined a 2022 cohort of 170 new U.S. unicorn companies, based on an analysis of Crunchbase data.
In the U.S., 13 current unicorn companies have a Black or African-American founder, out of 714 unicorn companies. This amounts to just 1.8% of U.S. unicorn companies. 
And in total, Black-founded startups in the U.S. raised about $2.3 billion in 2022, representing 1.1% of U.S. venture funding that year, per a recent Crunchbase News report. That’s more than a 50% drop in VC funding from 2021, while the broader U.S. funding market was down 37% over the same time period. 
Leading sectors
Behind these stark statistics are companies building key services for consumers and businesses. Leading sectors for funding in 2022 to Black-founded companies included financial services, health care, consumer goods and professional services, based on an analysis of Crunchbase data. 
San Francisco and Nigeria-based fintech unicorn Flutterwave, a cross-border payments platform that connects 34 countries in Africa to the broader payment ecosystem, was first valued as a unicorn in 2021. It went on to raise a $250 million Series D funding in early 2022 led by Eduardo Saverin’s B Capital Group that valued the company at $3 billion, making it the third most highly valued company with a Black founder alongside Calendly. 
Other Black-founded fintech and SaaS service companies that raised VC funding in 2022 include:

San Francisco-based career service company Career Karma raised a Series B of $40 million led by Top Tier Capital Partners. 
Atlanta workspace logistic fulfillment for e-commerce providers Saltbox raised a $35 million Series B led by Cox Enterprises and Pendulum Holdings. 
An HR management platform for small businesses, Los Angeles-based Bambee, raised a $30 million Series C from QED Investors.
San Francisco-based Wonderschool, a service to assist the setup of preschools, raised a $25 million Series B led by Goldman Sachs.
Oakland-based Promise, a payment processor for utilities and government agencies, announced a Series B of $25 million led by The General Partnership. 

With the slower funding environment, companies tightened their belts in the latter half of 2022 to preserve cash. Only one of the companies listed here raised funding in the second half of the year. And there’s no sign of how long the U.S. venture market will have to wait to see the first Black-founded unicorn in 2023.  
Methodology
Funding amounts and counts for the most recent year were collected through Feb. 21, 2022.

Special Series: VC Dollars To Black Startup Founders Fell More Than 50% In 2022,Chris Metinko,2023/02/22,"

Editor’s note: This article is the first of our three-part series on the state of venture investment to Black-founded startups in 2022. Driving these reports are data from Crunchbase’s Diversity Spotlight feature, which helps indicate diversity in startups’ and investment firms’ leadership teams. Part Two in the series highlights the year’s biggest funding rounds to Black-founded companies, and Part Three focuses on investment in Black-founded health care startups. — Special Projects Editor Christine Kilpatrick
After receiving a record $5.1 billion in venture capital during the height of the market in 2021, Black-founded startups based in the U.S. saw that number more than halved as VCs pulled back significantly last year.
While venture funding in the U.S. overall dropped nearly a third in 2022 — from about $337 billion to roughly $214 billion — Black-founded startups were hit disproportionately by the decline, Crunchbase data shows. Such startups saw their share of the market drop from 1.5% in 2021 to only 1.1% last year.

In general, Black-founded startups in the U.S. have struggled to gain anything above 1.1% of the venture market in the U.S. for the last several years.


“It’s like they say, when the U.S. economy has a cold, the Black community has pneumonia,” said Paul Judge, managing partner and co-founder of Atlanta-based Panoramic Ventures, which invests in emerging markets and diverse founders. “So the numbers are not surprising.”
Deals fall
Deal count numbers do not paint a better picture for Black founders. Those numbers dropped from a high of 419 deals announced in 2021 to only 260 last year — a 38% decline. The 2022 number even represents a fall from the 403 deals announced in 2020.
Venture funding also continued to get worse as the year progressed for Black founders, until a slight pickup in the last quarter. 


While almost $1.3 billion went to Black founders in the first quarter of last year, that number fell to $184 million in the third — the lowest total since Q3 2020.
The fourth quarter saw a slight comeback, hitting $274 million.
Seen it before
The numbers are disappointing, but not shocking to those in the venture industry.
“I would say it’s not a surprise,” said Nicole DeTommaso, a senior associate at Harlem Capital, an early-stage venture firm focused on investing in minority and woman founders. “Generally what happens is diverse founders are hit the most in a downturn.”
DeTommaso said there often is a “subconscious bias” during a drop in the market, where investors seek what they know and what is familiar to them — which often is not minority founders.
Along with that, it is clear this is no longer 2020, when firms and corporations — caught up in the Black Lives Matter movement in the aftermath of George Floyd’s killing — created funds and other pots of monies specifically to go to Black and other minority founders.
“It’s very clear that was top of mind at one point and not anymore,” DeTommaso said. “That was expected. That’s the human condition — you get excited and it’s top of mind. Then it goes away.”
Judge, a serial entrepreneur who has been in the tech industry for more than two decades, agrees that many have not kept their promise of funding minority-founded startups. He takes a critical view of the numbers and even the “improvement” some saw last year.
“We are so far off,” said Judge, who also is co-founder and partner at incubation center TechSquare Labs. “We are talking about (being off) by a magnitude of more than 10x. It’s like the decimal point is in the wrong place when you look at the money that goes to Black founders.”
With the Black U.S. population estimated to be about 13%, Judge questions why only 1.1% of venture dollars goes to such founders. 
He also agrees that the current downturn has made it easier for VCs to turn to their old ways of conducting business — the warm intros and closed networks that often leave Black founders out in the cold.
Investors are not doing their jobs by not opening up their sourcing, said Judge, adding that numbers show investing in a diverse set of founders creates the best returns.
“In investing you find alpha in places where other people aren’t looking,” he said. “I’m not talking about social impact, I’m talking about delivering the best returns.”
Judge, who remembers fundraising for his first company more than a decade ago, said it may be somewhat easier for Black founders to get a meeting with a VC, but it is still just as hard to finish the deal.
“It’s still difficult,” he said. “Getting in the meeting room and getting to the wire are two different things. That’s a long process and there are a lot of moments where bias can show up.”
With the numbers where they are, it’s fair to wonder if the venture world has improved for Black founders.
“I think we’ve made progress,” DeTommaso said. “I think the VC and investor base, including LPs, needs diversity.
“Things have gotten better, but they are not where they need to be,” she continued. “But it’s a slow process.”
One that seems to even stall at times.

"
Are Startup Investors Weary Of The American Consumer?,Joanna Glasner,2023/02/22,"

American consumers are used to brands catering to our every whim.
From footwear to skincare to pets, stores and warehouses are stuffed with products targeting every conceivable demographic, however bizarre its tastes. Pet ketchup? Snail slime eye masks? Zebra print goldfish platform shoes?
Any of those things are available with a few clicks. And if current selections aren’t enough, rest assured founders and product designers will continue to churn out new seasonal offerings at a dizzying pace.

But lately, startup investors don’t seem to be biting. Per an analysis of Crunchbase data, investment in U.S. nonfood consumer products startups has fallen off a cliff. So far this year, they’ve pulled in barely over $150 million across surveyed categories — on track for the lowest quarterly total in years.
For an idea of how far things have fallen, we chart our quarterly funding below to a selection of consumer products categories 1 (not including food and beverage).


Funding dries up for aggregators, D2C
The drop-off in funding is particularly pronounced for direct-to-consumer brands and e-commerce aggregators, two areas that were red-hot a little over a year ago.
As the chart above illustrates, the peak for consumer products funding was the latter half of 2021. That’s when we saw some truly ginormous rounds for aggregators focused on acquiring smaller consumer brands and scaling their presence on Amazon and other outlets.
The largest investment recipient, Thrasio, raised $1.85 billion in equity funding in 2021 to pursue its roll-up strategy, followed by Heyday, with $625 million. Benitago Group, which acquires Amazon brands in the consumer packaged goods space, also picked up $380 million that year, while aggregator Elevate Brands secured $372 million.
But investor enthusiasm around the space has since soured, and aggregators are scaling back. Thrasio laid off staff and announced plans to replace its CEO last year. Benitago cut staff a few months ago and has been tapping the brakes on acquisitions.
Upstart brands, many of which have touted themselves as direct-to-consumer models, are also not seeing so much investor love lately. That’s a sharp shift from the first quarter of last year, when Kim Kardashian co-founded shapewear brand Skims raised $240 million, and shaving goods supplier Harry’s raised $140 million.
So far this year, the only U.S. deal north of $20 million in Crunchbase’s beauty, fashion or consumer goods categories was a $40 million round for Makeup By Mario, a cosmetics brand founded by celebrity makeup artist Mario Dedivanovic.
It hasn’t helped that venture-funded fashion plays that went public under frothier market conditions in 2021 saw their valuations slashed the following year. So far in 2023, performance has been mixed.
A spring rebound?
Expectations for the broad U.S. retail sector this year, meanwhile, look neither great nor catastrophic.
Economists at S&P Global Market Intelligence forecast retail sales growth of 0.5% in 2023 (or a 0.1% decline when accounting for inflation). Analysts predict that “belt-tightening consumers will hinder sales in 2023” compared with previous years.
On the bright side, U.S. unemployment remains low. However, higher interest rates mean consumers are wary about making purchases on credit.
Of course, for an individual retailer, it doesn’t matter so much if consumers are more profligate or thrifty. What matters is if the thing they are spending on is your product.
Looking at venture funding tallies, it looks like investors are less confident about startups’ abilities to convince consumers to try out a new brand or product. Or perhaps they’re simply pulling back after capitalizing companies so heavily a year or two ago.
Either way, this is likely a temporary state of affairs. Betting against American shoppers’ willingness to spend big on the next hot shiny object has never been a long-term winning wager.

Tech Jobs: These Cybersecurity Startups Are Hiring Now,Jenna D'Illard,2023/02/21,"

We can’t make this stuff up.
The United States government spent the last week scrambling to identify, shoot down, attempt to locate and then investigate (no luck yet) several “unidentified objects” over parts of North America.
What must individuals working within private cybersecurity startups be thinking of this would-be national threat? We can only imagine they just continued to do their jobs, namely protecting client infrastructures from real threats. While spy stuff is fun to talk about, the tangible work of cybersecurity startups is what’s really worth funding, even in a downturn.

The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Dreamscape and SandboxAQ See Monster Raises,Chris Metinko,2023/02/17,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.
Huge rounds were the theme of the week, as we saw six rounds of $100 million or more — including two of a half-billion dollars or more. What’s interesting is all the rounds came from different sectors — although one could argue two were in cybersecurity. While AI is dominating the headlines, investors placed bets in several other areas too this week.

1. Dreamscape, $850M, real estate: One of the difficult aspects of creating this list is trying to figure out what is debt and what is actually growth equity in many of these larger rounds. (This will come up again further down the list.) New York-based Dreamscape, a real estate development and investment firm, completed an $850 million capital raise this week. However, it’s unclear what was debt and what was equity. We do know Wells Fargo led the debt syndicate and Raymond James led the equity private placement, but that’s about it. We don’t know how much of that $850 million was equity. Regardless, it is a big raise. The firm will use the proceeds to create two new platforms: Dreamscape Entertainment Properties and Dreamscape Entertainment Integrated Resorts, both involving  gaming, hospitality and entertainment.
2. SandboxAQ, $500M, AI: Nearly a year after spinning out of tech giant Alphabet, AI and quantum computing startup SandboxAQ finally announced more funding details this week, saying it had raised a $500 million round. SandboxAQ is examining the related effects of both AI and quantum — which is where the company gets “AQ” — to develop commercial products for telecom, financial services, health care, security and other computationally intensive sectors. One aspect of security the startup is looking at is how companies and the government can replace current public-key cryptography algorithms with algorithms that are resistant to quantum computer-based attacks. Quantum computing is a level of compute much faster and at a level superior to classical computers that examines quantum states to perform computation. Investors named included Breyer Capital, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, Thomas Tull, First Light Capital Group, funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Guggenheim Investments, Time Ventures, Section 32, Parkway Venture Capital and other funds and investors.
3. Deepwatch, $180M, cybersecurity: Cybersecurity funding has proven resilient, even in this down market. Managed detection and response company Deepwatch is the latest in the sector to close a big round — locking in a $180 million round of “equity investments and strategic financing.” The financing comes from a handful of investors, including Vista Credit Partners — Vista Equity Partners’ “credit-investing strategy offering flexible, customized debt and structured equity financing,” per its website. However, the company declined to offer a breakdown of the round pertaining to equity investment and debt/credit. The Tampa, Florida-based startup reported 100% sales growth in 2022 while announcing the funding. Founded in 2019, the company has now raised $256 million, per Crunchbase.
4. Juniper Square, $133M, financial services: Ever wonder how GPs and LPs communicate? Well, one way is through San Francisco-based Juniper Square’s platform, which allows GPs and LPs to connect and manage their partnerships. The company announced a $133 million growth capital round this week led by Owl Rock. According to the company, more than 1,800 GPs use Juniper Square to help support more than 32,000 investment partnerships and $700 billion in LP capital. Founded in 2014, the company has raised $241 million in funding, according to Crunchbase.
5. Via, $110M, transportation: Nearly everyone has changed the way they travel and commute in the last several years. New York-based transit company Via locked up a $110 million round to help cities and agencies better traverse that changing landscape of transportation. The new round values the company at $3.5 billion and was led by 83North. The company ended 2022 with an annualized revenue run-rate of over $200 million, more than doubling since the previous financing round — a $130 million Series G in November 2021. Via plans to use the money to further expand its line of products that help cities and transit agencies improve the efficiency of their transportation systems. Founded in 2012, Via has now raised around $900 million, per Crunchbase.
6. R-Zero, $105M, biotech: Salt Lake City-based biosafety technology startup R-Zero closed a $105 million funding round led by the global investment firm CDPQ. Founded in 2020, the company has now raised more than $170 million, per Crunchbase.
7. Hexagon Bio, $77M, biotech: Menlo Park, California-based Hexagon Bio, a biopharmaceutical company focused on medicines encoded in the global metagenome, raised a $77.3 million Series B. New investors in the round include the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Founded in 2016, the company has now raised nearly $271 million, according to Crunchbase.
8. NanoGraf, $65M, batteries: Chicago-based battery materials company NanoGraf raised a $65 million Series B led by Volta Energy Technologies and CC Industries. Founded in 2012, the company has raised nearly $90 million, per Crunchbase.
9. Checkerspot, $55M, advanced materials: Alameda, California-based Checkerspot, which designs materials used for outdoor recreational products, closed a $55 million Series C led by ArrowMark Partners. Founded in 2016, the company has raised $109 million, according to Crunchbase. 
10. Descope, $53M, software: Los Altos, California-based Descope raised a $53 million seed round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and GGV Capital and emerged from stealth. The company has launched a new authentication and user management platform for developers.
Big global deals
U.S.-based startups were not the only ones to raise rounds of a half-billion dollars or more this week.

China-based Zeekr, which develops and manufactures electric vehicles, raised a $750 million Series A.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of Feb. 11 to 17. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

"If Startups Want To Be The Hip Kids Again, They Need To Start Losing More Money",Joanna Glasner,2023/02/17,"

A couple years ago, when startups were raising record sums and using it to lose money, there were those in the nonstartup founder community who tut-tutted about why it seemed like a bad idea.
“Slow down” was the common mental refrain. If you sell your products at a loss, how will you ever turn a profit? What if investors no longer want to fund growth at any cost? Is it really wise for a company this deeply in the red to spend on perks like in-house manicures and dog walking?

Well, now we’ve been heard. The cycle has shifted. Rather than counting on a massive up round, startup types are opining about conserving runway. These days, it’s all about raising gross margins, cutting noncore expenses and positioning for long-term viability.
Conserving runway is boring
I supposed us fiscal scolds should be celebrating.
But no. Rather than validating, the more tight-fisted investment environment has made life for those who follow the startup world more boring. No ridiculously big rounds for pie-in-the-sky goals. No more valuations that only go up.
There’s also the conspicuous absence of a big consumer benefit of the startup boom: companies selling products and services at a loss to build market share. This strategy is what enabled things like sub-$15 crosstown Uber rides, gourmet meal delivery at fast-food prices, $2 scooter rides, and all those things that made startups buzzy.
Now that investor tolerance for staggering burn rates has subsided, things are not as fun. So perhaps it’s time to ask: Are calls for budgetary restraint misguided?
Yes, yes, of course the startup graveyard is littered with headstones of those with negative margins who plowed through their cash and flamed out. But plenty have graduated to massive market caps as well.
Among gig economy platforms, Airbnb, Uber and DoorDash have market capitalizations of $87 billion, $72 billion and $26 billion, respectively. Many of the most valuable American technology companies, including Amazon, Tesla and Salesforce 1, were longtime money-losers, even post-IPO, before they eventually turned profitable. It’s unlikely any of those companies would have reached such heights had they spent their formative years fixated on net income.
The case for losing more money
Besides, startups are supposed to have a rebel streak. The current fiscally restrained mindset makes me wonder: If you’re a startup founder or investor who’s parroting talking points of people like me who work middle-class jobs and sock away meager sums in 401Ks, perhaps you’ve strayed too far from your authentic calling.
After all, the whole point of the startup investment sphere is to stick it to the scolds who insisted these strategies would never work. Do what’s never been done before. Spend the competition into the ground. Scale, scale, scale.
Venture investors and founders who believed in this ideology a couple years ago, when everyone believed it, should believe even more fervently now, when almost no one does.
Moreover, this is the perfect time to spend the competition into the ground. Rivals don’t have the money to keep up, advertising is cheap, and you can snap up the talented people they’ve laid off.
And keep in mind: Startup lifespans are short. Either you grow into something big, you get acquired, or you close down. Why spend those few years when you’re setting out to change the world obsessing over a couple more months of runway?

Putting The Company Mission First: How Startups Can Build Strong Teams To Drive Regulatory Change,Guest Author,2023/02/17,"

By Spencer Hawes
At some point, nearly every company, from a brand-new startup to a corporate behemoth like Amazon or Walmart, will look to shape the policy and regulatory environment around them.
Whether for a small change to an esoteric rule or a multinational lobbying campaign, an effective regulatory strategy is key to long-term growth.

The key point missed by many companies attempting to influence a regulatory environment: When forming a team, stakeholders must align on a common mission so individual priorities aren’t elevated over the mission of the company.
The solution rests on three pillars:

First, there must be clear ownership of decisions regarding regulatory strategy. Policy, legal and operations (and other) perspectives should all be considered, but there must be a central decision-maker responsible for making the final call and moving forward. This helps not only resolve internal disagreement, but provides consistency in approach as well.

Spencer Hawes, co-founder of Runway Strategies
Second, incentives for individuals involved in regulatory strategy (including performance evaluation, compensation and advancement) should focus on whether the individual is maximizing company interests. They should not be centered around whether the employee accomplished the preferred outcome from their team’s perspective. Regulatory success requires trade-offs among legal, political and business factors. Employees should be put in a position to clearly see the incentives to collaborate and make those trade-offs.
Third, incentivizing employees to maximize the company’s interests is only effective if there’s shared understanding of what those interests are. Accordingly, company leadership should set a clear framework for acceptable — and unacceptable — risk, as well as a hierarchy of regulatory objectives. The goal of this effort is to let teams know what are redlines vs. nice-to-haves when negotiating and making trade-offs. This allows policy, legal and operations (and other) teams on the ground to not only align on objectives and strategy, but justify their actions and explain why a risky deal was taken — or walked away from.

Fundamentally, building teams in the regulatory space is about empowering teams and employees to take short-term defeats in order to avoid greater longer-term pain and risk. It should come as no surprise that individuals are more open, creative, collaborative and deferential to company objectives when they aren’t concerned that doing so may lead to negative professional outcomes for them personally.

 Spencer Hawes is the co-founder of Runway Strategies, a Washington, D.C-based firm that provides regulatory and policy strategies to companies. Hawes specializes in the intersection of law, technology, cross-border regulatory development, and public policy.

Early-Round Unicorn Numbers Still Strong Despite 2022 VC Pullback,Chris Metinko,2023/02/17,"

Startup valuations may have taken a hit last year, but that did not stop some investors from minting unicorns at the very earliest of fundraising stages faster than any other year aside from the record-breaking numbers of 2021.
Out of the more than 300 unicorns minted last year, a quarter — 77 — of them were created after an early-stage funding round — defined as seed, Series A or Series B — an analysis of Crunchbase data shows.

See also: The Crunchbase Unicorn Board

However, while last year’s percentage of young unicorns is higher than 2021’s — which was 18% — the number of those created after just early rounds of funding could not come close to matching the venture capital heights of 2021.


A record 107 young unicorns were minted in 2021, but that number fell in 2022 by 28% as global venture funding saw a significant pullback. Last year saw $445 billion in venture funding globally — a 35% decline year over year from the $681 billion invested in 2021 — according to Crunchbase data.
A decline, but …
Although 2022’s young unicorn numbers fell, it is important to note the number is still well above those in the years before venture hit its frenzy in 2021.
In fact, the 77 early-stage unicorns minted in 2022 are more than double the next-best year of 2018, when 38 such unicorns were created. 
That shows astonishing resolve (although we could use another word) by investors to put money into young — often untested — companies at ridiculously high valuations, considering the battering tech stocks have taken in the public market.
However, the number of young unicorns created started to slow significantly in the second half of the year. Back in July, we reported 50 early-stage unicorns had already been created — meaning the second half of the year saw only about half that.
Some of those young unicorns — several Web3 and AI related, not surprisingly — minted in the second half of last year include:

In September, Palo Alto, California-based Aptos Labs hit a $4 billion valuation after Binance Labs — the venture capital arm and accelerator of Binance — made a new, undisclosed strategic investment in the Web3 infrastructure firm, per a Bloomberg report.
That same month, blockchain developer Mysten Labs closed a $300 million Series B led by FTX Ventures (remember it?) at a more than $2 billion valuation.
In October, Austin, Texas-based AI startup Jasper closed a $125 million Series A led by Insight Partners at a $1.5 billion valuation.
San Francisco-based TeraWatt Infrastructure raised a huge Series A of more than $1 billion, also in October. Launched out of stealth in May 2021, TeraWatt Infrastructure has built out a network of charging stations for the operation of light- to heavy-duty EV fleets.
Also that same month, Uniswap Labs — the company behind the Uniswap Protocol exchange — landed a $165 million Series B led by Polychain Capital that values the company at $1.66 billion, TechCrunch reported.

Looking ahead
The slowing pace of newly minted young unicorns in the second half may well indicate what VCs have been talking about for months — the venture slowdown that significantly affected large growth rounds early in 2022 has slowly crept into early rounds.
According to Crunchbase numbers, early-stage funding — consisting of Series A and B — totaled only $31 billion in the fourth quarter last year, down by 54% year over year. The third quarter was down 39% year over year. Before that, the first quarter was actually up and the second quarter down by less than 10% compared to the previous year.
Obviously, if that trend continues, this year could see considerably fewer unicorns minted after the early rounds. So far in 2023, only four such unicorns — including Astronergy and Our Next Energy — have joined the unicorn herd after early fundings.
Venture capitalists started to cast a wary eye at high valuations in later rounds early last year, so it would only be logical they are now doing the same at early rounds.
Even if it means missing out on the next can’t miss new thing — like Web3.

"How Candy Conglomerate Mars Is Investing In Pet Tech, One Of The Few Areas VCs Still Love",Keerthi Vedantam,2023/02/16,"

It may surprise you to know Mars Inc., the maker of beloved candy bars, was hit in 2017 with an antitrust warning from the Federal Trade Commission requiring the company to divest some assets before acquiring a new company.
But the FTC’s warning didn’t stem from Mars’ candy empire, which includes Snickers, M&M’s, Altoids, Life Savers and Skittles. Mars owned too many veterinary clinics, the FTC said, and was mandated to divest 12 of them in order to complete its $9.1 billion acquisition of VCA animal hospitals.

In fact, the candy conglomerate is the world’s largest pet food manufacturing company and has been steadily investing in dozens of pet tech startups in recent years, per Crunchbase data.
“Mars Petcare actually is very much growing and is one of the biggest parts of Mars corporate,” said Audrey Yoo, vice president of innovation at Mars Petcare.
The company, which owns more than 2,500 veterinary hospitals, began taking a greater role in the pet care startup space in 2018.
It’s a good time to be a pet care giant. Global funding for pet tech jumped 156% between 2020 and 2021 to $1.7 billion, Crunchbase data shows. The next year wasn’t too far behind — while venture funding declined in almost every other sector in 2022, pet toy and health investment saw its second-best year ever.


Mars’ pet history
Mars spent much of the late 1800s and early 1900s making chewing gum and chocolate. It wasn’t until 1935 that Mars acquired a canned dog food company, and then, a couple years later, began manufacturing cat food. In 1965, Mars established the Waltham Petcare Science Institute to study the nutritional needs of dogs and cats.
Thus began decades of collecting food brands, developing diagnostic kits and acquiring veterinary facilities. In Mars Petcare’s arsenal are 11 veterinary and diagnostic companies, 30 food labels, and nine research and health institutions.
In 2018, the company founded Leap Venture Studio with the nonprofit Michelson Found Animals and R/GA Ventures to fund pet-related startups.
“The pet space was totally void of a good venture capital foundation,” said Brett Yates, CEO of Michelson Found Animals. “Great ideas were just dying off because there just wasn’t enough money flowing into them. So there was no support for the whole system.”
Mars also set up a $100 million fund the same year called Companion Fund, which is the second-most active investor in pet care, according to Crunchbase data.
Together, Companion Fund and Leap Venture Studio have made 21 investments since 2018, to the tune of over $92 million in venture funding. They have around 50 companies in their combined portfolio.


Updating pet tech
Confined to their homes and working remotely long-term for perhaps the first time, 1 in 5 Americans decided to bring a new four-legged family member into their lives, according to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
One of the biggest drivers of opportunity in the space was changing demographics — digitally savvy millennials were grappling with an antiquated veterinary system. Meanwhile, pandemic-era changes to human health care came with accessible telehealth services and online scheduling platforms.
“We saw a shift in pet ownership,” Yoo said. “There’s a whole new generation of digital native millennials who are very familiar with different service concepts, and the pet parenting journey is not quite there yet. So we saw an opportunity.”
Investments from Leap and Companion span the world of pet nutrition, telehealth and support for new pet parents. PetPlate, for example, offers human-grade meal kits for dogs made with meat, potatoes, apples and other whole foods. MySimplePetLab creates mail-in diagnostic kits that test for ear infections, or routine stool sample tests. Scout Bio uses gene therapies to create new medicines for animals.
Much of the innovation in pet care comes from the advancements made in human health care. Wearable biometric trackers similar to the Apple Watch or glucose monitors could be tools to track the long-term health of animals that can’t tell their owners when something is wrong. At-home diagnostics kits similar to our COVID-19 tests and meal kits are also becoming more popular for pets.
“I think there are a lot of similarities with human health and pet health where we can learn from each other,” Yates said. “There are some things that we’re able to do with pets that aren’t generally accepted with humans — like wearing a collar — to see exactly what’s going on with your pet.”

This Downturn Will Show Us Which LPs Actually Believe In Diversity,Guest Author,2023/02/16,"

By Sara Zulkosky
The current market downturn is presenting a crossroads for LPs. Early-stage venture remains an attractive investment area, particularly now given the more rational pricing and abundance of later-stage dry powder waiting for the right opportunities.

But rather than continue to invest with the diverse and emerging managers that received so much traction when capital markets were booming, the risks in the current environment are redirecting some LPs to deploy their capital in the (perceived) “safer bet” funds, the household name-brands.
LPs need to step up
It’s time for LPs to make an important decision. How these institutions choose to deploy capital over the coming year will give the world a clear perspective on where these investment organizations, and the people who manage them, actually stand on diversity.
Do they actually believe that investing in more diverse partnerships helps drive potential returns in venture? Or were their previous investments in this area just lip service in order to get social credibility by investing in more diverse firms?
The thesis on early-stage venture and the unique (and valuable) perspectives underrepresented emerging managers bring to investing has not changed. People with diverse backgrounds have a unique edge in the investing market because they look at the world differently and consequently identify investment opportunities that may otherwise be overlooked. When interest rates were low and the market was booming, this edge drew tons of investor attention and has substantial data points to back it up. Now that risk is back on the table, the LP calculus seems to be shifting despite this thesis remaining not just intact, but more lucrative than ever before.
The pace of innovation continues to accelerate. There are many great startups with solid fundamentals that are hungry for investment. In fact, some companies forged during times like these have historically outperformed. Valuations have turned friendly to investors and the long-term thesis of early-stage investing remains the same as it always has been. If you believe, like we do, the data that shows that diverse emerging managers have a unique edge in venture investing, then these are precisely the managers you’d want to allocate to now in order to generate outsized returns over the coming decades.
The ‘safe’ bet
Unfortunately, the market seems to be signaling that institutional LPs are more interested in capping their (perceived) risk by investing in the long-established household names in VC (even despite many of those firms’ consistent lack of diversity), rather than doing the work to properly select diverse-led emerging managers. But that’s just it, isn’t it — it’s a perceived risk that they are attempting to cap. The data shows us that emerging and diverse managers can outperform; it’s the picking that matters.
LPs need a serious gut check. Does their willingness to “invest in diversity” stop when risk goes up? Or their willingness to put in the work to properly access and select them? I’d argue that they’ve never had a better opportunity to showcase their belief in diversity and generate best-in-class returns.

Cyber Startup Deepwatch Raises Fresh $180M Round,Chris Metinko,2023/02/15,"

Managed detection and response (MDR) company Deepwatch closed a $180 million round of “equity investments and strategic financing” to both push product development and grow partnerships.
The company declined to offer a breakdown of the round pertaining to equity investment and debt/credit. 
The financing comes from a handful of investors, including Vista Credit Partners — Vista Equity Partners’ “credit-investing strategy offering flexible, customized debt and structured equity financing,” per its website.

Other investors include Springcoast Capital Partners and Splunk Ventures.
Deepwatch’s MDR helps protect customers from the growing number of cyber threats. MDR platforms help investigate alerts and determine whether there actually is a threat at play. Such platforms use a combination of data analytics, machine learning and human intelligence.
“Our services have never been more vital,” CEO Charlie Thomas said in a release. “Business transformation to cloud and digital, coupled with increasing levels of cyber risk, drives strong demand for advanced protection from Deepwatch.”
Tampa, Florida-based Deepwatch reported 100% sales growth in 2022 while announcing the funding. Founded in 2019, the company has now raised $256 million, per Crunchbase.
Big cyber funding rounds
Deepwatch joins other cyber firms already announcing large rounds this year.
On Tuesday, Alphabet spinout SandboxAQ raised a $500 million round. The startup is looking at how companies and the government can replace current public-key cryptography algorithms with algorithms that are resistant to quantum computer-based attacks.
In January, Santa Clara, California-based Netskope received a $401 million convertible note investment led by Morgan Stanley Tactical Value. 
In general, investment in cybersecurity has held relatively steady this year. Through the first six weeks-plus of the new year, cyber startups have received a total of about $1.7 billion, per Crunchbase data. While that number is down from the same period last year — where startups raised more than $4 billion — it actually is ahead of the numbers from 2021 and 2020.
Investors still seem to prioritize cybersecurity as threats continue to grow and more scrutiny is put on how companies are protecting data.

"
What Are Latent Diffusion Models? How Founders Should Think About Integrating This AI Tool,Guest Author,2023/02/15,"

By Prashant Fonseka 
Generative artificial intelligence is currently a hot topic in the tech startup world, for good reason. Within the past few months there has been an improvement in the quality of outputs from buzzy projects like ChatGPT, DALL-E 2 and Stable Diffusion. These players are all advancing the underlying technologies a clear notch from cool to useful.
The latter two, along with Midjourney, are examples of latent diffusion models, which generate images from text inputs.

Image made by the author using prompts in DALL-E 2.
All three models operate in a similar manner in that the user writes a prompt in plain text such as, “watercolor of a blue alligator playing croquet at a country club,” and the model outputs a novel and unique image depicting what the user described.
Consumers got a taste of the power of these models when Lensa went viral in December for turning user uploaded images of themselves into packs of “Magic Avatars,” sets of  stylized AI-generated images of the user. When I bought my first pack in December, I received 10 sets of 20 AI-generated images of me, with each set having a particular theme such as“mystical,” “astronaut,” “rock star” and “superhero.”
On the backend, Lensa is deciding which prompts will create interesting image outputs and then standardizing those for each image set. That means the user only needs to upload 10-20 images of themselves to receive the striking, photorealistic images that I am still seeing all over social accounts. While the novelty around these first consumer use cases AI-generated images may already be fading, business applications of latent diffusion models are still in their infancy.
Prashant Fonseka of Tuesday Capital and Moongrove.
As such, a whirlwind of projects making use of these technologies have popped up in the last weeks and months. As both an early-stage investor at Tuesday Capital and the founder of Moongrove, a company implementing latent diffusion models, I have been giving a lot of thought to which ones make sense. Here are some criteria to consider in weighing whether latent diffusion models make sense for a particular business.

Does a latent diffusion model make sense for my business?
The first is the scale of outputs.
Latent diffusion models are good at generating a large quantity of images, so are inherently a good fit for applications where customers or users want a large quantity of images.
In general, the quality of these images can be good or great, but not perfect. So, almost certainly, the processing pipeline must either have an endpoint that doesn’t require absolute perfection or layers of human checking, editing and polish prior to the final output. Today’s models typically output a fair amount of noise, so if the capacity to review a large number of images is lacking, that use case may not be a good fit.
The second is the need for a high degree of creativity in those outputs. Oftentimes the image generation needs of a business entail iterations of existing content within what can be relatively narrow constraints, such as brand guidelines. Such changes often require small tweaks and subtle changes. While subtlety is not the strength of today’s image models, novelty is. Trying to use the current tools to iterate on existing assets would be akin to hitting a nail with a jackhammer. However, if one is looking for completely novel looks or image backgrounds, today’s technology is ripe. Good examples in the e-commerce space include Zeg and Flair, which can create novel product treatments from words.
Lastly, a good candidate for implementing image-generation models must have highly repeatable workflows and similar types of outputs. Examples of types of outputs include: human faces, product treatments, product packaging, website backgrounds and animated characters. Right now, image outputs are only as good as the text prompts fed to the models, and writing those prompts is still as much art as science. Therefore, to generate a reasonably high quality of outputs, it is best if a business use case involves generating many of the same type of output.
I should note that these criteria are very much for today, right now. I expect, and frankly hope, these points to be dated very soon. This space is rapidly evolving and many companies, including Moongrove, which is working on no code interfaces for latent diffusion models, are striving to lower the barriers to implementing image generation models.
Ultimately, I imagine that just about any business process or consumer product involving sharing, creating, manipulating or showing images will be improved or enhanced by generative AI.

We’ve Seen This Before: Investors Take To The Next Shiny Toy — AI,Chris Metinko,2023/02/15,"

The venture market is still recoiling from its highs of 2021, but that hasn’t stopped investors from pouring billions into the next big thing — artificial intelligence.

Investors talk about doing more due diligence now to avoid something like FTX happening again, and getting away from the FOMO environment that ruled venture not that very long ago.
But let’s take a look at what’s going on in AI.
Big money
Just last month, Microsoft confirmed it has agreed to a “multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment” into OpenAI, the startup behind the artificial intelligence tools ChatGPT and DALL-E for a reported $10 billion. The following week, news broke that San Francisco-based AI startup and rival to ChatGPT Anthropic is raising a $300 million round from Google — bringing the company’s total valuation to $5 billion, The New York Times reported.
Also just last week, Reuters reported Toronto-based Cohere, an AI platform that competes with OpenAI, is talking to investors to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in a funding round that could value the startup at more than $6 billion.
Others such as Asimov and Metagenomi — which use AI in biotech — and AI-based language translator DeepL all raised rounds of more than $100 million recently.
Those are big numbers — especially in a market that has slowed remarkably in the last 12 months, and the AI craze shows no signs of slowing.
Does any of this look familiar? Because it should.
At this exact time last year — just as the market was showing signs of strain — Web3 and crypto were having their seminal moment.
The first quarter of 2022 saw 29 rounds of $100 million go to startups in the sectors. Some of the biggest hits include:

Brooklyn-based decentralized protocols software startup ConsenSys raised a $450 million round at a valuation of over $7 billion.
Miami-based Yuga Labs — the startup behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection — closed a $450 million “seed” round led by a16z crypto.
India-based Polygon Technology, a scaling platform for the ethereum blockchain, closed a $450 million round led by Sequoia Capital India at a reported $13 billion valuation.
And, of course, both FTX and FTX US raised $400 million rounds at a $32 billion and $8 billion valuation, respectively.

AI: We’ve been here before
This happens all the time in venture. A few big rounds lead to more, even bigger rounds, and all of a sudden investors can’t stop writing checks as quickly as their hands can move.
Just recently we saw big venture runs in areas like HR (when companies were actually hiring, not laying off) and logistics technologies. In the past “big data,” “machine learning” and a variety of different cybersecurity acronyms all caught the attention — and a lot of money — of VCs only to flame out not long after.
Just as OpenAI’s artificial intelligence tools ChatGPT and DALL-E took off, the skeptic would wonder: Why has funding in AI exploded just in the past few months, and how will VCs see the multiples they want from an exit at these valuations? Where was this excitement, say, just 12 months ago? Was the technology not developed enough then, but it is now?
That seems convenient.
Private vs. public investors
But skepticism usually is in short supply in the private market, unlike its public brethren. Last week, while investors were jumping in with both feet in the private market, we may have seen just how unsure and uneasy public investors feel about the new AI craze.
Alphabet — the parent company of Google —  lost $100 billion in market value after its artificial intelligence tool, Bard, incorrectly answered “What new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope can I tell my 9 year old about?”
Not a great moment for Google’s AI team, for sure, but it also shows the extremely fragile confidence public investors have in what is a relatively new tech tool — at least in its new use cases.
That isn’t to say AI doesn’t have real and significant tailwinds. We’ve talked about those before, including the democratization of technology and the simple fact that computer technology advancements have made AI better and more efficient.
Then again, one can argue that decentralized finance and Web3 also are not going anywhere despite the battering startup valuation have taken in that sector.
Nevertheless, every startup is now using “AI” in its description — hey, you’d be stupid not to, as one AI unicorn founder told me recently. And every investor and firm wants in on the next hot deal in AI, even though not all of these “AI” startups are clearly differentiated and the enormous valuation spikes will make it difficult to get the returns VCs need for successful exits.
Maybe it’ll all turn out well, but recent history of these types of run-ups by VCs suggests it may not.

"
How Founders Should Manage Burn Rates During A Recession,Guest Author,2023/02/14,"

By Marc Schröder 
Managing burn rate is a critical aspect of running a startup, especially in a recession or protracted economic downturn. The market has shifted and so have investors’ expectations. It’s no longer a game of growth at all costs — sustainability, profitability and efficiency are the new key performance indicators catching the eyes of investors.

This change means that founders need to focus on burn rate now more than ever, so I’ve put together my thoughts on how to manage your startups in today’s economic climate.
What’s your break-even point?
Marc Schröder of Maschmeyer Group Ventures
First and foremost, founders need to have a clear and realistic financial plan. This includes having a detailed understanding of the startup’s current financial situation, and projecting future financial needs based on different scenarios. Startups should also have a clear understanding of their break-even point, which is the point at which the startup is able to cover its costs and generate a profit. By understanding the startup’s break-even point, the company can better manage its burn rate and ensure that it is able to generate enough revenue to cover its costs.
A key component of that plan is cash flow management. The ability to monitor and manage the startup’s cash balance ensures that bills are paid on time and provides an accurate perspective on when new funding will be required to continue operations. Given the constraints of this cash flow management plan, a refreshed and resilient take on the business model can be created. This includes finding ways to diversify revenue streams, building a strong and loyal customer base, and developing a business model that is scalable and sustainable.
Planning for future growth
Startups should also consider developing a strategic plan that outlines how they will navigate the recession and position themselves for future growth. If fresh venture funding will not be available for a year or two, founders need to actively seek out new sources of funding. Implementing a line of credit while the balance sheet and revenue are strong is a good first step, but other forms of short-term financing such as venture debt should also be considered.
Communicate clearly
Finally, it’s important for startups to have clear and open communication with their investors, employees and customers during times of uncertainty. This includes keeping investors informed of the startup’s financial situation, explaining any cost-cutting measures that have been implemented, and providing regular updates on the startup’s progress. Founders should also be transparent with their employees about the challenges they are facing and how the company is working to overcome them.
In conclusion, how founders manage their startups burn rate is essential during times of economic uncertainty. Startups should concentrate on executing cost-cutting measures, having a clear and realistic financial plan, focusing on cash flow management, building a strong and resilient business model, and having clear and open communication with their investors, employees and customers. By implementing these strategies, startups can increase their chances of success during a recession and position themselves for future growth.

Marc Schröder is the managing partner and co-founder of MGV, and is focused on working with world-class tech entrepreneurs and establishing the MGV legacy. Before co-founding MGV, Schröder served as the head of global sales at the Maschmeyer Group and was an investor at Seed + Speed Ventures. Originally from the Netherlands, he grew up in South Africa and graduated with a law degree from Bertolt-Brecht University.

It’s No Lie: Startups Fighting Disinformation Are Raking In Cash,Joanna Glasner,2023/02/14,"

If you spend time online, then invariably much of it goes toward consuming lies and half-truths. Even if you are good at filtering these things out, it’s likely others in your circle are not.
As we well know, misinformation has consequences. Hard-earned money evaporates in get-rich-quick scams. Patients reject proven therapies in favor of quack cures. And targets of false smears contend with long-term reputational damage.

So what to do? As with most societal problems that technology has a prime role in propagating, innovators believe tech will also play a major part in mitigating its spread.
Venture backers are on board as well. Over the past couple of years, investors have put over $300 million into an assortment of startups working on ways to combat disinformation and misinformation, according to an analysis of Crunchbase data. We list a sample set of 14 below:


Misinformation is a growth market
Generally, when we see a surge in venture capital around a theme, it’s tied to at least one of two factors. First, the problem founders are addressing has gotten worse. And second, the technologies founders are using to address these problems have gotten better.
For misinformation, one can point to both a worsening problem and advancing technology. There’s also some sense of urgency as the targets of attacks realize how hard it is to undo the damage after the fact.
“The markets changed, the world changed, and now a lot more potential clients understand the situation,” said Gideon Blocq, CEO and co-founder of VineSight, an Israeli software-as-a-service startup that secured a $4 million seed round in September. The company uses AI to identify suspicious patterns of digital content sharing, with a focus on spotting damaging narratives before they spread too far.
VineSight is one of several funded startups that pitches its offering to brands to help manage their online reputations. Nonprofits, celebrities and their affiliates, digital content platforms, and governments are also target markets for developers of tools aimed at ferreting out misinformation.
It’s a growing problem. Political misinformation is up 150% this past year, observed Noam Schwartz, CEO and co-founder of ActiveFence, a developer of technology to detect malicious content online. He points to Russian disinformation around the invasion of Ukraine, along with rising disinfo around elections and health care.
“Most disturbing is how we’ve seen online hate speech and extremism spilling from the digital world into the physical one, as we saw in the attack on the Brazilian capital on Jan. 8 this year,” he noted.
In addition to the increase in misinformation across political, health and other segments, new laws and regulations are also spurring interest in tools to combat the surge, Schwartz said. The Digital Services Act in the EU should have a particularly strong impact, as it carries fines of up to 6% of a company’s annual global revenue for noncompliance, he added.
Largest funding recipients
Judging by sums put to work, venture investors see this as a lucrative addressable audience.
One of the largest funding recipients, New York- and Tel Aviv-based ActiveFence, has raised $100 million in known funding to date. The company sells its offering to social media, streaming and gaming platforms, with an eye to fostering safer environments to while away our online hours.
Another venture capitalist favorite, San Francisco-based Primer, has raised $168 million to date for natural language processing technology designed to pull insights from vast amounts of data, with applications including detecting disinformation. The company counts the defense and intelligence agencies among its customers, as well as consumer brands.
In addition to disinformation campaigns, developers like Primer and VineSight are on the lookout for emerging narratives that could harm an organization’s reputation. Primer, for example, points to a situation in which it detected a damaging narrative around harmful packaging chemicals that was threatening the reputation of a fast-food chain. In that case, just detecting the meme was not enough — the company also moved quickly to announce a policy change to address concerns.
Is tech up for the task?
Not everyone is convinced today’s technologies are up to the task of sifting out the astounding number of falsehoods and misleading information served up online.
“Ferreting out misinformation through tech is a really hard problem, on multiple levels,” said Ethan Zuckerman, a University of Massachusetts professor of public policy, communication and information. “First, you have to agree on what is misinformation. Sometimes that’s easy. Often it’s complex and subjective. And even if you can do it for big conspiracy theories, it’s hard to do misinfo debunking for local stories all over the world.”
Another problem Zuckerman points out is much of what we might consider misinformation is more propagandistic than explicitly false. One can, for instance, weave a narrative that isn’t exactly a lie but does leave out key facts or dissenting viewpoints.
For Blocq and VineSight, the solution lies in focusing on the source of information, rather than fact-checking the content itself. Just as we might expect a $10 luxury designer bag for sale on a street corner to be a fake, even without close examination, we should be wary of content that can be traced to known suspect sources.
Blocq is optimistic that startups can make a major contribution to stemming the tide of disinformation. But, like many who study the space, he’s also worried that more realistic deep fakes, glib AI writing tools, and other emerging technologies are also making it easier for nefarious actors to spin out falsehoods faster and more effectively.

AI And Quantum Computing Startup SandboxAQ Snags $500M,Chris Metinko,2023/02/14,"

Nearly a year after spinning out of tech giant Alphabet, AI and quantum computing startup SandboxAQ has raised a $500 million round.
The round was first reported by Reuters.
Spun out last March, SandboxAQ is examining the related effects of both AI and quantum — which is where the company gets “AQ” — to develop commercial products for telecom, financial services, health care, security and other computationally intensive sectors.

One aspect of security the startup is looking at is how companies and the government can replace current public-key cryptography algorithms with algorithms that are resistant to quantum computer-based attacks. Quantum computing is a level of compute much faster and at a level superior to classical computers that examines quantum states to perform computation.
The U.S. government has flagged quantum computing as a key technology that is important for national security reasons.
SandboxAQ has already signed up more than 15 enterprise and government customers, according to the Reuters report.
The team
SandboxAQ was housed inside of Alphabet for six years before spinning out last year. It was announced then that the company — with 55 engineers, scientists and technologists — would be led by serial entrepreneur and CEO Jack Hidary. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt serves as chairman.
At the time, the company said it had received a “nine-figure” investment, but an exact dollar figure was not released. Investors named then included Breyer Capital, Eric Schmidt, Thomas Tull, First Light Capital Group, funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Guggenheim Investments, Time Ventures, Section 32, Parkway Venture Capital and other funds and investors.
Venture dollars in quantum computing hit a record level in 2021 with more than $800 million, according to Crunchbase. Last year, that number stayed pretty even, hitting $770 million despite venture dollars being down in many other sectors.

Taurus Announces $65M To Digitize Securities,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/02/13,"

Taurus, a Switzerland-based fintech company focused on digital asset infrastructure, announced on Tuesday it raised $65 million in Series B funding. The round was led by fintech-focused Credit Suisse with additional participation from the likes of Deutsche Bank, Cedar Mundi Ventures and Pictet Group. 
Taurus works through the entire spectrum of digitizing and tokenizing assets, particularly securities. The company issues and manages tokenized assets and has built a software solution that allows banks to offer clients custody and trading services. The company also built what it called the first regulated marketplace for tokenized securities. 

“Our thesis is the world of digital assets and the world of traditional finance will ultimately converge,” said co-founder Sébastien Dessimoz. “We basically built our business based on the assumption that we’ll see the institutionalization of this world.”
Digital securities on the global stage
That thesis is starting to come to life. In 2021, Switzerland voted in a new law that would allow any share or bond to be made official either on paper or via a digitized token, and both are equally recognized as proof of an asset. The Taurus marketplace for securities, T-DX, is regulated under the Swiss government’s financial marketplace department, FINMA. 
“I think what is important in terms of innovation is that we have the right regulatory framework in place,” Dessimoz said. “Plus having the technology there to allow this kind of transaction.”
In January, Swiss bank Cite Gestion became the first to hire Taurus to tokenize every single one of their shares. But it’s not the only one to do so — investment management firm Hamilton Lane worked with another digital asset platform, Securitize, to tokenize three funds.
Companies in the digital securities space have raised around $142 million so far in 2023. It’s unclear how affected blockchain-based platforms are by the cryptocurrency crash in 2022, but Taurus says it works with cryptocurrency banks and traditional financial institutions that don’t touch crypto. Taurus has more than 25 clients in the banking and corporate world. 
There are a couple of benefits to tokenizing assets. Because the token is inherently secure, trading shares becomes more efficient. Rather than issuing a number of shares and getting signatures from both parties to confirm the trade, the process can be done electronically.
But the world of tokenized securities is rather nascent, and the industry is still working toward a set of standardized regulations as well as grappling with the issue of cybersecurity.   
“Unfortunately the regulatory framework is moving country by country,” said Dessimoz. “There is no global legal framework all over the world.”

Rihanna Shines Bright As Celebrity-To-VC Example,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/02/13,"

Halfway through an understated and spellbinding Super Bowl Halftime Show, Rihanna touches up her makeup with a Fenty compact, reminding all of us of one thing: Belting out “Only Girl” in front of millions of viewers is just a hobby.
Rihanna is probably the first billionaire to entertain us with a Super Bowl performance, at least according to an estimation by Forbes, which reported her net worth to be around $1.7 billion. She is indeed balling bigger than LeBron.

Most of that comes from her makeup line Fenty Beauty, which accounts for around $1.4 billion of her estimated $1.7 billion net worth, according to Forbes.
It was her first foray into business after her 2016 album (the last time she dropped music). In 2019, she also launched Savage X Fenty, a lingerie brand that has raised more than $300 million from Neuberger Berman Group and L Catterton. The company reportedly looked into going public last year but, like many companies, decided to hold off.
Per Crunchbase data, Rihanna has used some of her wealth to invest in startups as an angel investor. In 2021, she contributed to Partake Foods’ $4.8 million Series A (the company makes and sells allergen-free cookies) and an undisclosed amount to medical devices company Therabody (maker of massaging device Theragun), according to Crunchbase data.
She also contributed to Destree, a fellow fashion label, in 2022.
The celebrity-to-VC pipeline
Rihanna, aka Robyn Rihanna Fenty, is perhaps the best example of why celebrities are starting their own venture firms and, in some cases, their own companies. Last year’s Halftime Show performance was dotted with prolific performers such as Kendrick Lamar, Dr. Dre and Marshall Mathers — all of whom have made investments in the startup world.
Snoop Dogg, one of the performers on stage with them, founded Casa Verde Capital, an investment firm focused primarily on the marijuana industry. But he’s also invested in the likes of unicorns Klarna and Robinhood.
They’re not the only ones. Actors have also gotten in on the VC game. Selena Gomez founded mental health startup Wondermind and makeup company Rare Beauty. She also invested in Gopuff, per Crunchbase data. Ashton Kutcher (who was actually the first celebrity I knew to go the VC route), is a general partner and founder at Sound Ventures, which started in 2015 and has made nearly 200 investments in companies like Acorns, Calm and Noom.

Transit Startup Via Rides $110M Round To $3.5B Valuation,Chris Metinko,2023/02/13,"

New York-based transit company Via locked up a $110 million round at a $3.5 billion valuation to help cities and agencies better traverse the changing world of transportation.
The new round was led by 83North, with participation from new and existing investors including EXOR, Pitango Venture Capital, Planven Ventures, Janus Henderson, CF Private Equity, RiverPark Ventures and ION Crossover Partners.

The cash infusion comes after a strong year for Via. The company ended 2022 with annualized revenue run-rate of over $200 million, more than doubling since the previous financing round — a $130 million Series G in November 2021.
Via plans to use the money to further expand its line of products that help cities and transit agencies improve the efficiency of their transportation systems. The company’s software gives insights backed by data so transit systems can be optimized even as riders continue to change the way they travel.
The company’s TransitTech products are used by more than 600 communities around the globe.
“This financing is an exciting milestone for Via and a reflection of the power that technology has to transform transit in communities around the world,” said co-founder and CEO Daniel Ramot. “Access to transit improves health, education, and economic outcomes, and all of us at Via are inspired every day to see the positive impact our customers have achieved by adding technology to their transit networks.”
Raising in a difficult time
Ramot told Bloomberg the fundraising environment is “very tough” right now, despite the sizable raise Via was able to secure.
Undoubtedly Via’s growing ARR, as well as a growing need to improve transit, helped the startup complete the new funding — which is the largest for any transportation startup this year, according to Crunchbase data.
Founded in 2012, Via has now raised around $900 million, per Crunchbase.

Why Kairos Ventures Is Betting Big On ‘Omics’ To Power The Biotech Revolution,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/02/13,"

At the turn of the 21st century, scientists Robert Langreth and Michael Waldholz posited a new idea: What if drugs were tailor-made to fit each patient’s genetic profile?
After two decades of scientists and engineers quietly toiling in biotech, quantum theory, artificial intelligence and data science, we are starting to see their theory become a reality.
The way we make and buy drugs today is not unlike how we buy clothing — mass-manufactured and sometimes ill-fitting. The way we are treated by doctors is often inefficient and diagnoses sometimes amount to a physician’s best guess.

But the “omics” — which include the fields of genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and proteomics, to name a few — could be the answer. The omics are a set of sciences that will allow us to code and dissect every cell, disease and tumor in the human body. The industry garnered $2.4 billion in funding in 2022, per Crunchbase data — on par with what it collected during the funding boom in 2021.
It can be tiring to hear someone wax poetic about the future of health care when progress is so slow-moving (“Why haven’t we cured cancer yet?” a friend asked me recently), but the ability to code all life will help us make drugs faster and help doctors treat patients more accurately.
Kairos Ventures, an early-stage biotech VC firm that brings startups out of universities, incubates several drug companies in their infancy that work to create more precise, efficiently produced drugs, such as Acutate Therapeutics and Linnaeus Therapeutics.
Alex Andrianopoulos, the chief research and development officer at the early-stage biotech VC firm, talked to Crunchbase News about the wide-reaching implications of budding biotech startups working in omics.
The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.
A lot of things somehow just happened all at once to really spur this industry. Genomics became very popular very fast. When did metabolomics, proteomics and transcriptomics start seeing more favor in the private markets?
Andrianopoulos: What we see in the private markets is translating all these discoveries from the ’70s, ’80s and ’90s into real technologies that could make a difference in pharmaceutical development as well as diagnostics in general.
Alex Andrianopoulos, chief R&D officer at Kairos Ventures.
It started with sequencers becoming affordable for researchers and startups. You didn’t need to have a whole floor of servers to actually transcribe the genome of a patient. If we can learn that much about human physiology from the genome, what else can we learn from ancillary structures and concepts?
This is critical. Since history started, we have been looking at health on a very experimental, very anecdotal basis. It was not based on understanding the programming of life. Now we know that if this gene is silenced, this disease will occur, or this cell will not grow properly.
We don’t understand why the human body produces cancers, and now we are starting to understand how we can treat cancer, but also why, in the first place, we have cancer.
I find when research goes from university to private markets, that signifies solid proof of concept. With the omics there is always a lot of promise, but we hear that with every advancement in science, and it feels like nothing has changed. When it comes to the end user, a patient, will they actually see the promised results of all this omics research in their lifetime? 
Andrianopoulos: We don’t understand how the world used to be in the not-far past. You and I probably don’t remember how bad it was for cancer patients 20 or 30 years ago. The reason the average age of humans goes up on a constant basis is because of those improvements that are made on a daily basis by companies like those we invest in.
The study of the genome and the study of the proteome translate directly to better drugs that you know will work for a patient. It’s not a science-fiction picture I’m painting. I’m not talking about 50, 100 years into the future. I’m talking about a few decades.
Cancer, we have been calling one disease. But in reality it’s about 180 different diseases. So to understand the nature of the tumor, you can couple the drug to the patient’s genome and tumor to make it a much more effective treatment for that specific patient. That is what we mean with personalized medicine.
I am curious to know, going into 2023, if there are certain sectors in this area that you think are going to do better in the private markets or are going to do worse.
Andrianopoulos: The combination of AI with robotics will revolutionize the way we develop pharmaceuticals. And we’ll be producing better drugs combined with the data that we get from the omics domains, from the analysis of the genome, the proteome, the metabolome and so on.
Pharmaceuticals right now are very much done on a trial-and-error basis, with researchers saying “I believe this is the right path.” With AI and robotics we will be producing drugs at a much faster pace and on a much more targeted basis. Anything that involves AI in prediction of efficacy is going to be a big deal in the next few years in our space.
At the end of the day, all of this is up against a health care system, from which it’s such a pain to get a diagnosis for anything to begin with. Is there any worry about having something with so much potential being sullied once it goes through this filter of what is essentially a very difficult-to-resolve health care problem?
Andrianopoulos: You’re absolutely correct that people don’t want to touch our health care system. When a doctor prescribes a drug with the hope that it will work, sometimes it doesn’t work and it produces side effects and you have to go back to the hospital.
Most of the poor experiences we have today in the health care system are driven by the fact that our physicians are mostly guessing about what is wrong with us, and that produces a lot of failure. It’s the same thing with drug and drug development. The reason we have such a dramatic failure in the pipeline of drugs is because we guess at the very early stages.
What omics systems do is fill the gaps. The future is not going to be a doctor trying to figure out what this pain in the abdominal area means. Rather than having to guess, with a blood test, you can do genomic analysis to understand what the genome is doing on a single cell basis.
I have to tell you, (this is) a great era to live in. And a great era to be a VC in life sciences.

"The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Pristine Sun Shines Bright, ShiftMed Raises Big",Chris Metinko,2023/02/10,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.

Renewable energy was big again this week after another quarter-billion-dollar round. Two media-related companies also made it into the top five — a rarity — in what was a slightly down week. We also had a six-way tie for ninth on the list, as $50 million proved to be a popular amount to raise.
1. Pristine Sun, $250M, renewable energy: To kick off this year, renewable energy firm Silicon Ranch announced it had closed $375 million of what could be a $600 million raise. This week, another renewable energy company wrapped up a huge private quarter-billion-dollar round. Richmond, California-based Pristine Sun locked up the huge round from what it called “strategic private equity and family office investors.” The company plans to use the new cash infusion to develop and finance up to 5 gigawatts of its solar projects in Texas, California and Louisiana. The round is the company’s first from outside investors, according to Crunchbase data. Since 1996, Pristine Sun and its affiliates have developed solar and wind projects totaling over 25 GW.
2. ShiftMed, $200M, health care: The pandemic exposed many issues affecting hospital workers — from burnout to scheduling problems. Virginia-based ShiftMed, a health care workforce marketplace, raised a $200 million round led by health care-focused Panoramic Ventures to tackle some of those issues. Through an automated scheduling platform, the startup connects 35,000 full-time nurses with hospitals and at-home care companies that need last-minute extra support. Founded in 2019, the company has raised $245 million, per Crunchbase.
3. Vox Media, $100M, digital media: Washington, D.C.-based Vox Media, which owns publications such as The Verge and New York Magazine, raised $100 million in new funding this week from Penske Media, as reported by The New York Times. Los Angeles-based Penske will take a 20% stake in Vox — per the report — suggesting Vox Media is valued at $500 million. Vox previously had been valued at $1 billion back in 2015 when it raised a $200 million Series F — but the digital media landscape was much different back then. The media firm now has raised more than $400 million from investors, according to Crunchbase.
4. Atmosphere, $65M, media: We’ve all sat in a doctor’s room, staring blankly at a television screen waiting for our names to be called. Atmosphere is one of the providers of those streaming channels you are watching to kill that time, and the Austin, Texas-based startup closed a $65 million Series D that values it at $1 billion. The round was led by Sageview Capital, Valor Equity Partners and S3 Ventures. Atmosphere, which provides streaming TV entertainment for other types of businesses such as Burger King and Texas Roadhouse, more than doubled its customer count last year. Founded in 2019, the company has raised nearly $214 million, per Crunchbase.
5. Salt, $64.4M, crypto: The fallout from FTX continues. Denver-based crypto lender Salt closed a $64.4 million Series A from accredited investors this week, it was reported. The startup paused business after the collapse of FTX. After Salt announced the business stoppage, online investing platform BnkToTheFuture backed out of buying the company. Founded in 2016, the company offers blockchain-backed loans where cryptocurrency is used as collateral.
6. Garuda Therapeutics, $62M, biotech: Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Garuda Therapeutics, a developer of blood stem cell-based cellular therapies, raised a $62 million Series B led by Northpond Ventures, OrbiMed Advisors, Cormorant Asset Management and Aisling Capital. Founded in 2021, Garuda has now raised $134 million, according to the company.
7. Zeitview, $55M, drones: Santa Monica, California-based drone startup Zeitview — formerly DroneBase — closed a $55 million round led by Valor Equity Partners. Founded in 2014, the company has now raised $114 million, per Crunchbase.
8. InfluxData, $51M, database: San Francisco-based InfluxData, the developer of an open source time series database, closed a $51 million Series E led by new investors Princeville Capital and Citi Ventures. The startup also announced a new $30 million debt facility. Founded in 2012, InfluxData has now raised $171 million, per the company.
To round out the list, six California-based companies raised $50 million rounds this week — Santa Clara-based Ushur, Campbell-based Acceldata, La Jolla-based Fabric8Labs, and a trio of San Jose-based startups, Light Field Lab, Skybox Security and Arrcus.
Big global deals
Here’s a quick look at some large rounds from outside the U.S., including one to a semiconductor firm.

China-based Tianyu Semiconductor, a semiconductor silicon carbide epitaxial wafer manufacturer, raised a venture round worth approximately $176 million.
Saudi Arabia-based Floward, an online flowers and gifts e-commerce platform, raised a $156 million Series C.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of Feb. 4 to 10. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

"
Funding Slowdown? Not For Climate And Clean Energy Software,Joanna Glasner,2023/02/10,"

Discouraging news on the climate front is easy to find. Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels continue to rise. The “Doomsday Glacier” is disintegrating faster than predicted. And climate change is contributing to extinction risk for thousands of species.
Positive indicators are scarcer. That’s why it’s encouraging to see at least one small sign of positive momentum coming from the startup sector. It comes in the form of more money.

In recent quarters we’ve seen unprecedented sums going to software startups focused on tracking and reducing carbon emissions, and on speeding up the shift to cleaner energy sources. The funding surge comes amid a broader rise in funding to climate-focused startups of all stripes.
A sampling of top funding recipients for climate and clean energy software shows at least $1.68 billion in capital raised since the beginning of 2022, per Crunchbase data. For a sense of where the money is going, we chart out 34 of the most recently or heavily funded companies below:
 


Consumer is out, enterprise is in
The most heavily funded companies are an enterprise-focused bunch, with many of the largest rounds going to those selling technologies to energy industry customers.
Washington, D.C.-based Arcadia, a climate software and data startup focused on decarbonizing the electric grid, is a perennial top fundraiser in this space. The company closed on $325 million in the past year alone, in rounds led by Magnetar Capital and J.P. Morgan, bringing total funding to over $495 million.
Aurora Solar, a platform for designing and cost-estimating solar power installations, is also up there, with $523 million in funding to date, including a $200 million Series D a year ago. It’s currently posting annual revenue over $100 million while still growing over 50% per year, according to John Tough, managing partner at backer Energize Ventures.
But Aurora isn’t the only company in the space with significant revenue that’s scaling fast. Since launching early-stage-focused Energize seven years ago, Tough said he’s seen revenue at climate- and clean energy-focused software companies rising alongside venture investment.
“When we launched in 2016, there probably wasn’t a single (software-focused) company in the solar or wind space with more than $25 million in revenue,” he said. “Now there are a dozen.”
Tough sees the likelihood of further growth given that companies in the energy industry have historically spent less on software than those in other sectors. One analysis his firm conducted estimated that energy companies spent only about 1% of their budgets on software — roughly half the Fortune 2000 average.
A maturing startup pipeline
The pipeline of funded climate and clean energy software startups is also maturing at a rapid clip.
In an initial Crunchbase roundup of climate software deals, published in October 2021, virtually all the cited companies were seed or Series A funded at the time. Since then, a majority have raised subsequent rounds and a number have moved on to Series B.
Clean energy-focused software companies, meanwhile, are also moving to later stage, with the largest funding recipients mostly at Series B and beyond. Per Tough, there are also a handful with metrics suitable for a public offering should the IPO window open further.
That could be in the cards. This week, Silicon Valley-based Nextracker, a provider of software and hardware for solar tracker systems, raised $638 million in its IPO after raising its price per share to $24. The higher-than-expected demand for its offering bodes well for other clean energy- and climate-focused offerings.
Impact of broader slowdown to be seen
Still, the resilience of climate and clean energy software funding comes against a backdrop of falling venture investment across most other industries. As tech valuations flatten and the biggest growth investors scale back the pace and size of deals, it’s not unlikely this space will see some impacts too.
For now, though, it looks like this corner of the space continues to heat up — but in a good way.

7 Unicorns Arrived And 2 Exited In January 2023,Gené Teare,2023/02/10,"

In the first month of 2023, seven companies joined The Crunchbase Unicorn Board — the third month in a row for new unicorns to number in the single digits.
Three of the new unicorns are U.S. startups, with two hailing from Dallas. China provided another three, and the final company is from Germany.

Dallas-based genetic de-extinction startup Colossal Biosciences, founded in 2021, is the youngest in this new cohort. The oldest debut is by China’s solar science company Astronergy, founded in 2006. The sectors represented include energy, health care, semiconductor and artificial intelligence.


M&A transactions lead
Zero unicorn companies went public in January, but two companies were acquired. They include Shanghai-based electric-vehicle company WM Motor, acquired by Hong Kong-based public company Apollo for $2 billion. WM Motor was reportedly struggling, and had a $5 billion valuation in 2017.
Chicago-based property management company SMS Assist was acquired by Arizona-based Lessen for $950 million, close to its 2016 funding led by Goldman Sachs that valued the company at $1 billion.
Here are the companies that joined the board in January 2023.
Energy

San Francisco-based Xpansiv, an energy infrastructure and commodities research platform, raised a $125 million round led by Bank of America and Goldman Sachs that valued the company at $2 billion. Xpansiv also announced the acquisition of New York state-based Evolution Markets for an undisclosed amount.
Anhui, China-based Huasun Energy raised a $295 million Series B, valuing the company at $1.5 billion. The round was led by China National Building Material.
Hangzhou, China-based Astronergy raised a $220 million Series B valued at $1 billion led by Yunhao Capital.

Biotech and health care

Dallas-based ShiftKey, a scheduling and credentialing platform for health care workers, raised a $300 million funding at a $2 billion valuation led by Lorient Capital.
Extinct species restoration company Colossal Biosciences, also based in Dallas, raised a Series B funding of $150 million led by US Innovative Technology Fund that valued the company at $1 billion. The company uses CRISPR technology and gene editing, which will have a broader impact around health and food production.

Semiconductor

Yunnan, China-based Yuze Semiconductor raised a $178 million funding round, valuing it at $1.5 billion.

Artificial intelligence

Cologne, Germany-based DeepL, an AI language translation company, raised $100 million at a $1.1 billion value, led by Silicon Valley-based IVP. Benchmark led its Series A in 2018 and Berlin-based btov Partners led its seed round in 2010.

Unicorn fundings in 2022 ($129B)

Methodology
The Crunchbase Unicorn Board is a curated list that includes private unicorn companies with post-money valuations of $1 billion or more and is based on Crunchbase data. New companies are added to the Unicorn Board as they reach the $1 billion valuation mark as part of a funding round.
The unicorn board does not reflect internal company valuations — such as those set via a 409a process for employee stock options — as these differ from, and are more likely to be lower than, a priced funding round. We also do not adjust valuations based on investor writedowns, which change quarterly, as different investors will not value the same company consistently within the same quarter.
Funding to unicorn companies includes all private financings to companies that are tagged as unicorns, as well as those that have since graduated to The Exited Unicorn Board.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.

Venture World Watches As SEC Moves To Regulate Industry,Chris Metinko,2023/02/9,"

The Securities and Exchange Commission and venture capitalists have traditionally lived in two different worlds, but if a new rule from the regulatory agency advances, VCs could find their world under increased scrutiny.
Nearly a year ago, the SEC started looking at adding regulations around how private investors — think private equity firms, hedge funds, some real estate investment companies, and yes, venture firms — vet deals.
The added scrutiny would also open the door for LPs to push litigation against an investor if proper due diligence was not followed in a completed deal — something VCs have not had to worry about before.

“The SEC has never really focused on venture capital or private equity before,” said Alan Wink, managing director of EisnerAmper‘s capital markets. “But I think FTX really opened the floodgates here.”
The sudden and complete collapse of crypto exchange FTX — and its affiliates — as well as the downfall of its founder Sam Bankman-Fried likely has generated even more interest by the SEC and others to examine the venture industry.
Earlier in the year, it was reported the agency wanted to probe what type of due diligence investors who poured nearly $2 billion into the failed exchange did before it declared bankruptcy.
What it means
The new push is not surprising, considering the tremendous growth the venture industry has realized, even in just the past decade. In 2021, venture funding hit more than $680 billion. While the SEC is normally associated with the public market, the amount of money and investors in venture make it ripe for regulation.
“The size and amount of money in the industry has changed,” Wink said. “It is a significant asset class.”
At the end of the day, the SEC is looking to protect investors’ returns, said Wink, adding that LPs include not just high-net-wealth individuals, but also groups such as pension funds and endowments.
VCs’ thoughts
However, not everyone is enthusiastic about possible new regulations.
The National Venture Capital Association penned a letter last April that stated “the proposed rules are profoundly flawed” and “represents a radical departure from Congress’s longstanding determination that private funds (including venture capital funds) … should not be subject to the type of granular and often intrusive regulatory requirements that generally apply to retail-level investment companies.”
Others do not seem too concerned about the new rules, but as with everything, the devil is in the details.
“I think there has to be more nuance as to how the due diligence is done,” said Yash Patel, general partner at Telstra Ventures. “If the SEC can be more thorough and thoughtful, it’s fine.”
The other aspect the agency has to remember is the very nature of venture. While something like private equity normally invests in the more mature, profitable companies, venture by its definition takes greater chances with young companies that can be nothing more than an idea.
“VCs have a higher mortality rate,” Patel said. “You have to remember that when looking at what happened to certain investments. You have misses but also greater returns.”
Patel adds he does not see the proposed regulations changing the industry greatly, especially since VCs are already doing more due diligence as VC has slowed since the salad days of 2021.
Things already changing
Also, the SEC has become more involved in some aspects of the venture world as investing has changed.
In recent years, large firms such as Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz have become registered investment advisers with the SEC for different purposes that include holding more publicly traded shares and crypto.
“I think the reality is that VCs expected more regulation,” Patel said. “This is an industry that, depending on the estimate you read, there’s $250 [billion] to $350 billion in dry powder right now. It’s large.”
Patel also does not believe the proposed rule will change the relationship between LPs and VCs. Both parties want to have good partners, and not have shareholders that put pressure on the fund, he adds.
One thing that could change is the expense side for VC firms.
Wink said he expects the new regulation — which could be instituted this calendar year — may mandate outside audits of new investments. New rules such as that likely will increase costs in venture.
“When it comes to compliance, you’ve heard about ‘the cost of being public,’” Wink said. “There will be ‘a cost of being VC-backed now.’”

"
January Monthly Recap: OpenAI Raised A Third Of All Funding,Gené Teare,2023/02/9,"

It is not every month that a company raises $10 billion in capital, but generative AI startup OpenAI did just that. Led by Microsoft, the deal included some unique funding terms. This single raise amounted to a third of the $31 billion in capital raised in January 2023 overall.
Despite that, global venture funding for January was down 50% year over year from the $62 billion invested in January 2022, but up 27% month over month from the $24.5 billion invested in December 2022.
This is the first month since June 2022 to breach $30 billion in funding.
$10 billion and up
To find another $10 billion funding to a venture-backed startup, we have to go back five years to 2018. Ant Group raised $14 billion from a group of growth investors and Juul raised $12.8 billion from big tobacco. That was the last recorded equity funding for Ant Group, which is still a private company. Meanwhile, Juul raised funding at the end of 2022 and cut staff to avoid bankruptcy.


Funding stages
Despite the massive OpenAI raise, late-stage funding was still down 46% year over year — but up 52% month over month.
Meanwhile, seed and early-stage funding were down by more than 45% year over year. Seed was up 14% and early stage down 7% month over month.
Micro-bubbles
“I don’t see the public markets recovering this year …” said Hussein Kanji, co-founder of London-based Hoxton Ventures when we spoke to him in the new year. “There’s too much uncertainty.”
Alongside the funding slowdown, Kanji anticipates mini bubbles in sectors like generative AI. “Prices go up, because there’s only one company or a handful of companies and more people who want to invest in it,” he said. As a result, valuations increase.
In the past few years, “these tech multiples went up to very high levels and have come back down to historical averages. They’re really not that low in the grand scheme of things. They’re just low by the last few years’ standards,” said Kanji on the bitter pill investors are having to swallow.
Methodology
Funding rounds included in this report are seed, angel, venture, corporate-venture and private-equity rounds in venture-backed companies. This reflects data in Crunchbase as of  Feb. 6, 2023.
Note that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarter.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.
Glossary of funding terms
We have made a change to how we include corporate funding rounds in our reporting. Corporate rounds are only included if a company has raised an equity funding at seed through a venture series funding round.
Seed and angel consists of seed, pre-seed and angel rounds. Crunchbase also includes venture rounds of unknown series, equity crowdfunding and convertible notes at $3 million (USD or as-converted USD equivalent) or less.
Early-stage consists of Series A and Series B rounds, as well as other round types. Crunchbase includes venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $3 million, and those less than or equal to $15 million.
Late-stage consists of Series C, Series D, Series E and later-lettered venture rounds following the “Series [Letter]” naming convention. Also included are venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $15 million.
Technology growth is a private-equity round raised by a company that has previously raised a “venture” round. (So basically, any round from the previously defined stages.)

Most Active US Investors In January: Y Combinator And Triangle Tweener Fund Lead Slow Month,Chris Metinko,2023/02/8,"

This is a monthly feature that runs down the most active investors in U.S.-based companies, looks at some of their most interesting investments, and includes some odds and ends of who spent what.
Just one month into the year, and 2023 already is looking different from 2022.
Last January, more than a dozen investment firms participated in 10 or more funding deals involving U.S.-based startups. This January, that number dropped to only two investors — Y Combinator and Triangle Tweener Fund — as few big names made a lot of deals in the first month of 2023.

Andreessen Horowitz made a good amount of deals, but other big players were nowhere to be found — at least in the U.S. Last January, Insight Partners and Tiger Global both announced 15 deals in U.S. startups. However, last month that number dropped to only one each.
Let’s take a closer look at the firms that still remained active in a slow market.
Y Combinator, 17 deals
Even in a down market, founders still have dreams, and that means Y Combinator remains busy.
The accelerator giant made 17 deals into U.S.-based startups last month, including participating in a $3 million seed round for Seattle-based LifeAt.
The company describes itself as a “virtual getaway” at work. It delivers work and productivity tools while giving the users relaxing music and video backgrounds — taking the user wherever else they’d rather be than work, such as a beach or a relaxing rain storm.
Remote work has changed our world forever, and sometimes staring at the same four walls eight hours a day can be hard. A startup that combines work and play may be something many of us need right now.
Triangle Tweener Fund, 10 deals
The Triangle Tweener Fund does not usually make this list, but it did in a slow January. The firm is the only other investor to make at least 10 deals in U.S.-based startups last month.
One of its deals included a seed round for Raleigh, North Carolina-based Nomad Development. Staying with the theme of remote work, the startup allows people to find places to stay as we become less tied to an office and roam more. The company describes itself as providing “accommodation for the modern nomad.”
Three years ago, a startup like this may not have ever been created — but a pandemic changes a lot of things.
Andreessen Horowitz, 9 deals
Last January — before the market slowdown was noticeable — Andreessen Horowitz made 15 deals that involved U.S.-based startups. Last month, that number fell to only nine.
Aside from the drop in deals, the other things that somewhat struck us was Andreessen Horowitz still likes the gaming sector. It led a Series A for an undisclosed amount for Miami-based Voldex, a gaming studio focused on user-generated content. However, it also led a $10 million Series A for metaverse gaming startup Createra and participated in a $27 million Series B for South Africa-based Carry1st.
While not all of those rounds involved U.S.-based startups, it’s interesting to see that Andreessen Horowitz still has a lot of faith in gaming, even during a pullback.
Catalio Capital Management, 6 deals
Baltimore-based Catalio Capital Management also is not a firm that usually makes this list. The venture capital firm invests in biomedical startups, and in January took part in a half-dozen funding rounds including four different Series Bs.
Some of the firm’s highlights include co-leading an $8.3 million venture round for San Francisco-based Spiral Therapeutics, which is developing therapies for hearing loss, and co-leading a huge $100 million round for Emeryville, California-based genetic medicines company Metagenomi. The startup uses metagenomics and machine learning to discover genome editing systems for therapeutics.
Gaingels, 6 deals
In January 2022, Gaingels made 28 deals in U.S.-based startups, but just like most firms that number significantly dropped — ending up at just a half-dozen after everything was said and done.
That doesn’t mean those deals didn’t include interesting startups. One of the firm’s deals included participating in a $3.2 million seed round for Brooklyn-based OneRoof.
OneRoof helps connect people living in the same building, striving to build a useful and supportive neighbor community. Users can buy and sell things — extremely useful when you are living in an apartment with limited room — and get to know their neighbors’ likes, interests and even pets.
In a world that often seems to have lost a sense of community, anything that tries to restore that is worth a mention.
Also notable

New York-based Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator came in next with five deals in January, while 10 firms each made four deals last month.
Y Combinator and Andreessen Horowitz led or co-led the most rounds in January with four each.
Not surprisingly, Microsoft led or co-led rounds totaling the most dollars for the month with their massive $190 billion investment into startup OpenAI.

Kansas City Chiefs Look For Big Win — In Startup Investing,Chris Metinko,2023/02/8,"

Kansas City, Missouri, may have BBQ and jazz, but it still has a relatively small startup ecosystem when it comes to venture investment.
The Heart of America’s tech scene can’t quite match the startup environment of its Super Bowl counterpart Philadelphia. Last year, VC-backed startups in KC raised just under $160 million in about two dozen funding rounds, according to Crunchbase data. In 2021, that number was only $70 million in 27 rounds.
Unlike the City of Brotherly Love, which has a robust startup scene around sectors like life sciences and fintech, KC’s is still a little more eclectic. The largest round in 2022 was a $90 million venture round to mobile transaction and payment PayIt.

However, the second biggest went to restaurant chain Hawaiian Bros Island Grill (probably not what you expected) which saw a $25 million private equity round.
Big-name investors
While the KC startup scene may still be finding its legs, a trio of the Super Bowl-bound Kansas City Chiefs themselves are immersed into the startup tech environment — unsurprisingly mainly investing in tech that involves health, nutrition and e-sports.
The player who leads that charge is none other than personality-laden, all-world tight end Travis Kelce.
Per Crunchbase, the big-time pass catcher’s investments include Mexico City-based fantasy sports platform Draftea as well as Irvine, California-based, vapor-distilled alkaline water startup ZenWtr, and Park City, Utah-based bakery company Kodiak Cakes. Kelce also is an investor in Cambridge, Massachusetts-based connected indoor rowing machine developer Hydrow, which has raised more than $300 million to date.
The guy who will be throwing the ball to Kelce on Sunday — Patrick Mahomes — also has his own small portfolio. The former NFL MVP is an investor in Irvine-based recovery and movement enhancement startup HyperIce, as well as Boston-based Whoop.
Whoop’s platform tracks an athlete’s recovery, training and even sleeping hours to help boost their performance. The company has raised more than $400 million, and received a $3.6 billion valuation after its $200 million Series F in 2021.
Lastly, another of Mahomes’ favorite targets — wideout and social media star JuJu Smith-Schuster — is no stranger to the investment world. The slot receiver has invested in San Mateo, California-based fantasy league and eSports platform Sleeper, Germany-based e-sports data analysis startup Grid Esports, and Los Angeles-based skin care product company Art of Sport.
While Kansas City’s startup scene cannot match Philly’s — which saw investors pour more than $2.5 billion into venture and growth rounds for local companies since the start of last year — its football team seems very much interested in the venture world.
And although its startup scene is smaller than its Super Bowl opponent, that does not mean it can’t win on Sunday.

Jobber Raises $100M To Make It Easier To Find A Plumber,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/02/7,"

No matter what state the economy is in, everyone needs a toilet that flushes and light bulbs that work. And as people spend more time in their homes thanks to companies adopting remote work, many are looking into remodeling their spaces.  
That could be one reason that Jobber, a workload management platform for companies in the home services industry, announced on Tuesday it has raised $100 million in Series D funding. The round was led by growth equity firm General Atlantic with participation from additional investors Summit Partners, Tech Pioneers Fund and Version One Ventures.

Jobber is for companies in the home services industry — small businesses that work in plumbing, HVAC installation, painting and electrical, to name a few. The company, based in Edmonton, Canada, has around 200,000 users across 60 countries that use the platform to schedule meetings, send quotes and accept payments. It previously raised $83.5 million, per Crunchbase data.
Updating the home improvement space
The home services industry is due for a tech-enabled update. While baby boomers still spend the majority of home improvement dollars, millennial home ownership is on the rise and opens the door for tech-savvy businesses to get their foot in the door.
Companies such as Angi (formerly known as Angie’s List) and Taskrabbit tapped into the gig work marketplace that permeated every industry and helped people to find handymen or home experts for quick fixes. But Jobber is also suited for small businesses with a handful of employees.
“Jobber is bringing much-needed innovation to the small business segment, a category that has been traditionally underserved by technology solutions and is still in the early stages of digital adoption,” Aaron Goldman, managing director at General Atlantic and Jobber board member, said in a statement.

SoftBank Posts $5.6B Loss Thanks To Vision Fund Segment,Chris Metinko,2023/02/7,"

SoftBank posted a loss of $5.6 billion for the quarter ended in December of last year, thanks mainly to significant declines in its Vision Fund investment arm.
The Vision Fund segment recorded a $5 billion loss for the quarter — further illustrating the softness in the current tech market as valuations have been slashed on private startups and share prices of publicly listed companies have been decimated.

In a significant change from the past status quo, charismatic SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son did not take part in the earnings release. Back in August, the engaging executive took responsibility for the poor performance of SoftBank’s investments, saying he had become “delirious” with the high returns the funds were seeing at the height of the market.
Slowing investment pace
SoftBank — known for its investment in U.S. companies like Uber, WeWork and DoorDash — has pulled back decisively on its investments. The Japanese conglomerate is now “focused on defense” when it comes to investing, and only deployed $300 million in capital for the quarter and only $600 million in the last two.
That is a sharp drop from the $29.7 billion SoftBank invested out of its Vision Fund arm during a six-month period in 2021 — the height of the venture capital frenzy that set new records.
Of course, SoftBank is far from the only big-name investor that has pulled back in the market. Others such as Tiger Global and Insight Partners also slowed their investment cadence. The tech market continues to wobble through rocky times and the economy struggles with rising inflation and interest rates, and supply chain issues.

"
Philly Is Not The Underdog For Life Sciences (Or Football),Joanna Glasner,2023/02/7,"

When Americans think about Philadelphia, hometown of the Super Bowl-bound Eagles, images that first come to mind likely revolve around cheesesteaks, Rocky and the Liberty Bell.
Startups, not so much.
In reality, however, Philly and its environs actually constitute one of the larger U.S. hubs for health and biotech founders. The City of Brotherly Love is also no slouch in the tech and fintech departments.

Funding numbers back up that assessment. Since 2022, investors have poured over $2.5 billion into venture and growth rounds for local companies, according to an analysis of Crunchbase data. Life sciences funding increased sharply year over year for the region, even as overall U.S.venture funding declined, with the seven biggest financings highlighted below:


“There’s a lot of positive momentum,” said Audrey Greenberg, co-founder of the Center for Breakthrough Medicines, a cell and gene therapy contract development, manufacturing and testing organization. The King of Prussia, Pennsylvania-based company closed on $350 million last year in the metro area’s largest startup funding round.
Not the underdog
With the Eagles poised for what could be their second Super Bowl victory in six years, Greenberg sees similarities between the local football and life science trajectories. The common theme: A city with a longtime underdog reputation is staging a serious comeback.
It’s a notion Greenberg likes to promote with two of her favored hashtags: #NotTheUnderdog and #celliconvalley. While the first could refer to either sports or science, the second one is definitively a nod to Philadelphia’s history as a hub for cell and gene therapy.
In recent years, the University of Pennsylvania, and the on-campus Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania, in particular, have gained a reputation as research pioneers in immuno-oncology, cell and gene therapy. The first FDA-approved gene therapy — for a rare form of retinal blindness — had its roots in local labs. And Philadelphia-based Spark Therapeutics (now owned by Roche), played a lead role in clinical trials and commercializing breakthrough gene therapies.
Among U.S. life sciences hubs, Philly consistently makes the top 10 lists by such metrics as local talent pool, square footage of dedicated facilities, and venture funding. While Boston, San Diego and the San Francisco Bay Area are bigger for now, Philadelphia has been steadily moving up in the ranks.
Affordability, Whiz and provolone
Local startup boosters see affordability as one driver of growth. While greater Philly isn’t exactly cheap, the cost of living is significantly lower than Boston and major California metros, with housing in particular far more affordable.
For better or worse, Philly’s startup scene is also pretty suburban. Out of total funding to the metro area, less than half went to companies in Philadelphia proper, with the rest going to surrounding towns and smaller cities.
In practice, what this means is mental images of scrappy startups in gritty urban digs probably aren’t too representative of actual reality. While the archetypal Philadelphian may be someone scarfing a Whiz-laden cheesesteak on a street corner, the typical startup worker is more likely to order lunch from some place in the suburbs with provolone 1 as the default cheese.
Still, Philly proper does attract its share of startups too. For 2022, the top tech funding recipient was dbt Labs, a developer of data engineering tools that pulled in $222 million in Series D financing. At the earlier stage, QuotaPath, a sales commission tracking platform, also landed a big round, with $41 million in an April Series B.
On the biotech side, meanwhile, one of the top funding recipients based in the city is Vitara Biomedical, a startup with ties to the children’s hospital, that is developing technology to help premature babies acclimate outside the womb. The company has raised $100 million to date.
Contender to winner
With the IPO market mostly on hold and M&A action fairly quiet, Philly’s startup scene hasn’t delivered a big exit recently. However, one local biotech — hypertension therapy developer Mineralys Therapeutics — did move closer to its debut, submitting an amended filing this month to raise up to $160 million in a planned IPO.
Given the sizable concentration of well-funded biotechs in the area, one would expect a series of other offerings should the market show signs of a sustained thaw.
Once that happens, the hope for Philadelphia’s startups is that their fortunes will look a little more like the Eagles’ track record this season: Few losses and lots of big wins.

ShiftMed Raises $200M As Nursing Shortage Transforms Hospitals,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/02/6,"

The pandemic brought to light a problem long festering in the health care industry: a shortage of workers, burnt out by low pay, long hours, and juggling many patients at once.
ShiftMed, a health care workforce marketplace, announced on Monday it raised $200 million in fresh funding to tackle the nurse shortage in the U.S. health care system. The round was led by health care-focused Panoramic Ventures with participation from Blue Heron Capital and Audacious Capital.

ShiftMed is addressing a nursing shortage crippling care facilities in America. Hospitals and nursing facilities depend on support staff, but they are leaving in droves, making hospitals, elder care facilities and medical offices scramble to care for patients in a timely manner.
Many hospitals have reverted to booking travel nurses, who fly into a specific area and work temporarily and are usually paid better than full-time nursing employees.
But booking travel nurses requires hospitals to be acutely aware of how much labor they need at a given moment and taking into account how many emergencies they may treat. Hospitals operate on low margins, and they don’t want to overbook on staff if they don’t have to.
Connecting nurses
Virginia-based ShiftMed connects 35,000 full-time nurses with hospitals and at-home care companies that need last-minute, extra support through an automated scheduling platform. The company says it can reduce operating costs 30%-40% by relying less on travel nurse agencies.
“By diminishing reliance on travel nurses, ensuring a compliant W-2 workforce, and providing tools to increase retention, we see a path for large health systems to change the labor framework to give them control and predictability,” said CEO Todd Walrath.
ShiftMed is one of several startups moving away from gig work employment in health care. In August, Incredible Health raised $80 million to help hospital systems quickly hire nurses.  Greater Good Health, which finds long-term employment for nurse practitioners who can take on some work normally assigned to doctors, raised $10 million in May.
Also in May, health care scheduling platform ShiftKey raised $300 million to pair nurses and health care organizations on a temporary basis.

Crunchbase Explainer: How To Sell Your Stock Options On A Secondary Market,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/02/6,"

Startup stock options mean something different in 2023.
Many unicorns are staying private for around eight to 10 years while enjoying household name status with public companies like Amazon and Microsoft.

Some of the highest-valued startups on the The Crunchbase Unicorn Board, including Stripe, Shein and ByteDance, have been around as private companies for longer than a decade. As their valuations have climbed and anticipation for their IPOs builds, those companies’ stock options have become increasingly valuable for their employees.
That’s where the secondary market — a marketplace that enables employees and shareholders to sell pre-IPO stock — comes in. Secondary markets have become more popular in recent years as pre-IPO stock has become more valuable.
It’s a great option for those who want to liquidate their assets. Maybe you don’t want to hold on to your shares from that one startup you worked at 10 years ago. Maybe you’ve just been laid off and need some extra cash in the bank. Maybe you’re just not ready to wait for liquidity until your company goes public or is acquired.
But understanding the secondary markets can be difficult. There isn’t one gold-standard marketplace to sell your shares on, and pricing isn’t as clear-cut due to the private nature of these companies.
What to look for in a platform
On every platform, you’re going to set a price for your shares. A broker will manage incoming offers and get permission from the company whose shares you’re selling before a deal closes. But, depending on how much time and money you want to spend selling your shares, each platform will offer something different.
Two of the most popular platforms are EquityZen and Forge Global. Carta’s CartaX platform provides private companies with liquidity strategies such as tender offers and secondary auctions. The Nasdaq is an investor in Nasdaq Private Market, and banks including JP Morgan are building out their own platforms to facilitate the sale of shares of private companies.
But pricing is tricky. On the public markets, stock prices are known, and public companies have to share financial data.
In contrast, many secondary market platforms will cobble together a price determination based on information found through Securities and Exchange Commission filings, investor demand and the company in question’s most recent valuation (which, these days, isn’t a great predictor).
EquityZen, for example, functions more like a traditional broker between buyers and sellers by marketing shares and determining price based on valuation, investor interest and other publicly available information. Forge Global leverages technology to automate the trading process.
Researching options
It’s worth contacting the platforms you’re considering to ask for a price estimation on each share.
Each platform has different selling requirements, but generally only shares from bigger late-stage companies are welcome on the platform. EquityZen has a minimum transaction size of $175,000. It will only accept shares from companies that have conducted a Series C or later funding round or pocketed $50 million or more from established VC firms.
Forge has around 500 companies on its platform. It has facilitated secondary market trading for Slack, Palantir Technologies and Spotify, among others, before they went public. Companies on the platform have to be “pretty big,” according to CEO Kelly Rodriques. Forge’s minimum transaction size is $100,000.
Each platform will typically charge a commission fee of 5% in exchange for the work of brokering a sale and working with the company to ensure the shares can be transferred.
Some things to consider
It often takes months to finalize a secondary market transaction. If there’s a deadline on exercising your options, you have to start pretty early if you want to go through the secondary markets.
You may be required to exercise your options before you can sell shares on a secondary market platform, depending on the company’s share transfer policies. Keep that in mind when calculating how much liquidity you will actually get.
There are also major tax implications. Because you cash out all at once, you’ll usually pay ordinary income tax on what you get. Depending on what kind of shares you hold, you might also be subject to long-term capital gains taxes.
Lastly, your company may not approve the sale of shares. More often than not, companies have the right of first refusal. This allows them to buy shares back before other buyers get a piece of the company. They may run a tender offer program, by which a company buys back shares at a set price during a specific time frame.
Ultimately, going through the secondary markets is a good way to cash out on shares if you need liquidity. But a good outcome is not always guaranteed.
This story has been updated to reflect Forge Global’s platform’s abilities and Nasdaq’s relationship with Nasdaq Private Market.

The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Anthropic And Our Next Energy Raise Huge $300M Rounds,Chris Metinko,2023/02/3,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.

It seems like every week we are going to be talking about AI. This week did not have a $10 billion round go to an AI startup, but $300 million is still pretty big. It’ll be interesting to see if these large corporate rounds to AI startups continue all year, or if this is just the latest shiny new object for investors.
1. (tied) Anthropic, $300M, AI: San Francisco-based startup, and rival to ChatGPT, Anthropic is the latest AI company to raise big from a tech giant. The AI startup locked up a $300 million round from Google this week. Anthropic’s new round could bring the company’s total valuation to $5 billion, The New York Times reported. The Financial Times first reported Google as the investor.  The new year is shaping up to be an all-out AI war. Late last month, Microsoft finally confirmed it has agreed to a “multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment” into OpenAI, the startup behind the artificial intelligence tools ChatGPT and DALL-E, for a reported $10 billion.
1. (tied) Our Next Energy, $300M, energy: While the EV market has taken off, it’s important to remember those vehicles need batteries. Novi, Michigan-based Our Next Energy raised a huge $300 million Series B to develop those batteries. The round values the startup at $1.2 billion and was led by Franklin Templeton Investments and real estate-focused Fifth Wall. The raise comes just as supply chain issues and the rising cost of battery and metal material are bottlenecking U.S.-based electric car manufacturers. The latest raise will help fund the operations of its battery cell factory that completed construction in December and will formally launch in 2024. Our Next Energy has now raised $390 million, according to Crunchbase data.
3. Colossal Biosciences, $150M, biotech: The idea of bringing back the dodo also was able to bring in big money. De-extinction platform Colossal Biosciences raised a $150 million Series B, giving the startup a valuation of more than $1 billion, per reports. The new round was led by US Innovative Technology Fund. The Dallas-based startup, which launched in 2021, plans to use the new cash infusion to continue to advance its genetic engineering, as well as keep developing its software and hardware solutions for applications involved with de-extinction, conservation and human health care. With this new round, Colossal has launched its Avian Genomics Group, which will pursue the de-extinction of the dodo. The startup previously had talked about bringing back the woolly mammoth and the Tasmanian tiger. Last March, Colossal Bioscience raised a $60 million Series A led by Thomas Tull and At One Ventures. Per the company, it has now raised a total of $225 million.
4. LeafLink, $100M, cannabis: Few cannabis startups raise the kinds of rounds to get high on this list, but LeafLink’s $100 million round makes it. The round was led by CPMG, L2 Ventures and Nosara Capital. The New York-based cannabis wholesaler also announced co-founder Ryan Smith will move to the chairman post, while company president Artie Minson will take over as CEO. Some form of marijuana use is legal in 40 states in the U.S. The company says its marketplace processes approximately $5 billion in annual transactions — which represents about 50% of legal U.S. wholesale cannabis commerce. Founded in 2015, LeafLink has raised $231 million in financing, per the company.
5. (tied) Clearsense, $50M, health care: Data governance and transparency aren’t the sexiest aspects of the tech world, but they are necessary — especially in highly regulated industries such as health care. Jacksonville, Florida-based health care data analytics startup Clearsense raised a $50 million Series D funding round led by HealthQuest Capital to tap further into that market. The company offers a platform of data applications that aim to drive faster clinical, financial and operational outcomes. Founded in 2013, the startup has raised more than $100 million, according to Crunchbase.
5. (tied) Jokr, $50M, delivery: Instant grocery delivery company Jokr raised a $50 million Series C led by G Squared on a $1.3 billion post-money valuation, according to TechCrunch. The New York-based company last raised a $260 million round in November 2021 at a $1.2 billion pre-money valuation. The startup is looking to increase its presence in Brazil. Founded in 2021, the company has raised $480 million, according to Crunchbase.
5. (tied) Portside, $50M, aviation: Air travel has some issues implementing new tech and software — something that became abundantly clear this holiday season as delays and cancellations ruined many people’s travel plans. Well, San Francisco-based software developer Portside is looking to fix that, at least for the business aviation industry. The startup raised a $50 million Series B this week led by Insight Partners. Its software allows aircraft operators to share schedules, maintenance data and other important data to help streamline a process with many moving parts. Founded in 2017, the startup has raised more than $67 million, per Crunchbase.
8. (tied) Freeform, $45M, 3D printing: Los Angeles-based 3D printing company Freeform emerged from stealth this week and announced it has raised $45 million to date from investors including Two Sigma Ventures, Founders Fund and Threshold Ventures.
8. (tied) Moov, $45M, financial services: Denver-based financial tools developer Moov closed a $45 million Series B led by Commerce Ventures. Founded in 2017, the company has raised nearly $78 million.
10. Phantom AI, $37M, autonomous vehicles: Mountain View, California-based autonomous driving platform developer Phantom AI locked up a $36.5 million Series C from investors that included Renaissance Asset Management and Samsung Ventures among others. Founded in 2017, Phantom AI has raised $80.2 million, per the company.
Big global deals
The largest round this week happened outside the U.S.

Switzerland-based ABB E-Mobility, an EV charging technology developer, raised a venture round worth approximately $351 million.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of Jan. 28 to Feb. 3. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

Google Invests $300M In Anthropic As Tech’s AI Arms Race Heats Up,Chris Metinko,2023/02/3,"

Earlier this week, news broke that San Francisco-based AI startup and rival to ChatGPT Anthropic was raising a $300 million round.
On Friday it was revealed the investor offering up the money would be none other than tech titan Google — obviously not willing to stand idly by and let Microsoft win the battle for AI supremacy.
The news was first reported by the Financial Times.

The deal — which gives Google a 10% stake in the company — comes just weeks after news broke of Microsoft’s massive investment in OpenAI.
Anthropic’s AI chatbot, Claude, is in closed beta mode, but in a paper detailing its goals, it is expected to combat harmful prompts by explaining why they are dangerous or misguided.
This is not Google’s and its parent Alphabet’s first foray into AI. In 2015 Alphabet bought DeepMind, a London-based AI startup founded in 2010, and is building an NLP model similar to ChatGPT.
AI dominance
The new year is shaping up to be an all-out AI war. Late last month, Microsoft finally confirmed it has agreed to a “multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment” into OpenAI, the startup behind the artificial intelligence tools ChatGPT and DALL-E for a reported $10 billion. 
Per Crunchbase data, funding in the AI space has accounted for around 10% of all venture funding in recent years. Even last year, as venture dried up, AI flourished in its second-best funding year ever. 
Just this week, it was reported by The Information that an AI startup co-founded by a pair of entrepreneurs who had left Adept AI recently raised $8 million. And Perplexity AI, which is developing a search engine that lets people ask questions through a chatbot, is looking to raise a $15 million seed round. 
Anthropic’s new round could bring the company’s total valuation to $5 billion, The New York Times reported. The startup previously raised $704 million across Series A and Series B funding rounds in 2022, according to Crunchbase data.

Some Beaten-Down SPACs Recover Amid Tech Rally,Joanna Glasner,2023/02/3,"

In 2022, companies that took the SPAC route to market performed so badly they were practically a punchline.
In 2023, they’re making a comeback.
Among a Crunchbase-selected cohort of “Truly Terrible SPACs,” roughly a third of the companies that were trading below $1 per share 1 in December are now above a buck. Several have more than doubled in price in the space of less than two months.

One of the most striking recoveries is BuzzFeed. Shares of the clickbait pioneer have more than tripled since the end of the year. Sharp gains followed the company’s recent announcement that it plans to use AI to enhance its online content, along with a report about a partnership with Meta.
AppHarvest, known for indoor tomato farming, is another dramatic back-from-the-brink stock story. The Morehead, Kentucky-based company, which bills itself as a sustainability-oriented agtech for its low-water approach to cultivation, has seen shares more than quadruple in price since the beginning of the year.
Altogether, at least eight of the 24 companies on our list had closed above $1 per share as of Thursday.
Up better than down
Meanwhile, among selected SPACs that were trading between $1 and $2 per share in December, the turnaround has been less pronounced. Out of 15 companies that made that list, just two — Nautilus Biotechnology and BarkBox — were above $2 as of Thursday’s close.
Given that virtually all SPACs initially trade at $10 per share, anything below that threshold represents a negative return since announcing or completing a merger. So, even if one of these stocks is trading at $2.50, it’s safe to assume early investors still lost most of their money.
However, up is better than down. And after going down, down, down for many quarters, it is certainly refreshing to see a bit of up happening in the SPAC world.

January Layoffs Analysis: Job Cuts Spike As Companies Conduct Second Rounds,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/02/3,"

Companies are going in for their second round of job cuts.
More people were laid off in the U.S. tech sector in January than any other month last year, according to Crunchbase News data. In January alone, more than 58,000 people were laid off in the U.S. tech industry, beating the record of 44,570 job cuts set in November 2022, when Meta, Stripe and Amazon each announced plans to shed thousands of jobs.

Perhaps more interestingly, the majority of layoffs in January came from companies that had already announced staff cuts once or twice in 2022.


The repeat offenders
We previously touched on “cut once and cut deep,” the generally approved strategy for layoffs. Trimming staff count more than once is usually bad for employee morale and reduces productivity as remaining workers anticipate another round.
“It’s frightening when your coworkers get laid off. There’s more work to do because there’s fewer people there. You question how the company is doing,” said Healy Jones, an executive at the startup consulting firm Kruze Consulting. “That continuously happening is really painful.”
As of the beginning of January, 9% of companies in our layoffs database had conducted two or more layoffs. By the end of the month, that number jumped to 12%.
Overall, repeat offenders were responsible for 50% of laid off tech workers in the U.S. last month. Around a quarter of the companies that announced job cuts in January had previously conducted them last year. Amazon planned to cut 10,000 workers back in November. In January, it announced another 8,000 would leave the company. Salesforce 1, which announced a layoff of 1,090 people in November, cut an additional 8,000 in January. (Side note: That’s why the number of companies in our database hasn’t grown by that much, but the volume of layoffs has.)


While more private companies than public companies announced layoffs in January, public companies were responsible for 91% of those employees who lost jobs 17 of the 23 companies that announced a second cut were public.


Why are public companies doing secondary cuts?
“With big tech, we’re going to see hiring freezes. We’re going to see more layoffs,” said Nolan Church, CEO of consulting firm Continuum. “And I think this middle-management layer is the most at risk.”
Public companies spent 2020 and 2021 stockpiling talent as they aimed to grow amid a tech worker shortage in the U.S. But, according to Church, that led to large tech companies dealing with bloat. As a company’s org chart grows and different teams get bigger, it may start instating managers that can wrangle big teams in smaller groups.
“There’s a lot of duplicative work. There’s a lot of bureaucracy. There’s a lot of inefficiency because there’s just too many people,” Church said.
Companies are also adjusting to the realities of the current economic situation as it unfolds. On average, companies that conducted their second round of layoffs did so around 4.5 months after their first round and, according to Jones, some executives are reluctant to make sweeping cuts that lay off more people than necessary.
“Most recessions last less than 18 months and most last around 10. And this recession is being driven by the Federal Reserve,” Jones said. “So when they decide it’s going to be over, hopefully things pick up again.”

"
A Human Breaks Down Some Top Categories For Generative AI Funding,Joanna Glasner,2023/02/3,"

Working as a reporter covering generative AI, one sometimes feels like a 15th century scribe writing about this hot new invention called the printing press.
Humans are on the job for now, but how much longer? Judging by the pace of funding in assorted AI bots and tools, investors would like it to be sooner rather than later.

As buzz around AI’s creative abilities reaches a crescendo, we thought it would be timely to put our human skills to work while we still can. To this end, using Crunchbase data, we assembled a series of lists highlighting funding to four categories where AI is playing an ever-larger role: Video-making, music, writing and customer service:
1: Video
We’ll start with video-related offerings, which have been raking in considerable investment over the past year.
Using Crunchbase data, we assembled a list of seven funded in the past few quarters:


WSC Sports, a startup that uses AI to generate personally tailored video clips for sports fans, is the largest funding recipient, landing $100 million in Series D funding nearly a year ago. Next is Papercup, a developer of AI-powered dubbing technology that raised $20 million in a June Series A.
2: Music
Music is another area where AI is generating traction. Below, we assembled a list of five funded companies cooking up tools in the space:


Amper Music, which raised over $9 million in venture funding before selling to Shutterstock in 2020, is still kicking under its original brand, offering editable, AI-generated music that matches a user’s selected genre and length.
Boomy, a newer upstart out of Berkeley, raised $3.1 million in June to build out a platform allowing users to quickly make original songs, even if they don’t have a musical background.
Another one to watch, Tokyo-based Soundraw, pulled in $1.4 million in seed funding last summer to develop its technology, which creates music using AI that can be replayed and distributed without royalty payments.
3: Writing
Of all the buzzy areas of generative AI, writing has been the buzziest lately, thanks largely to the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. We wrote about funding to writing-focused startups a couple months ago. To follow up, we’ve put together a related list of funded AI-related companies in the space:


After OpenAI, the most heavily funded company on our list is Grammarly, the AI-powered writing assistance tool that has raised $400 million to date, including a $200 million round in late 2021 at a reported $13 billion valuation.
Next is Jasper, developer of a platform that helps create original content while optimizing it for ROI and even repackaging it in different ways and in different languages. The Austin, Texas-based company raised $125 million in an October round led by Insight Partners that vaulted it to unicorn status.
4: Customer service
The addition of automation to customer service processes is nothing new. But a raft of AI startups are working to further lessen the human labor needed for this crucial business function.
Below, we put together a list of eight recently funded companies that fit this description:


Forethought, which describes itself as a generative AI provider for customer service automation, is particularly well-funded, having raised $92 million to date. Meanwhile Retail Rocket, a Dutch company developing AI-enabled marketing automation tools, is one of the more sizable early-stage funding recipients, with a $24 million Series A last summer.
We’ve got startups. Will customers follow?
The trouble with covering startups, as opposed to public companies, is they are under no obligation to disclose just how much revenue they’re generating. In the case of enterprise AI tools, it’s safe to presume those at the early stages are equally early in drumming up sales.
But as the buzz around AI intensifies, we’re expecting 2023 to be a year of increasing enterprise adoption, and not just headline generation. For humans accustomed to doing the tasks that AI now promises to either make easier or take over altogether, the process should be both intriguing and nerve-wracking.

Insight Partners’ Dealmaking Slows Substantially,Chris Metinko,2023/02/2,"

Insight Partners was one of the busiest firms in the record-breaking year of 2021, signing deals of more than a half-billion dollars to co-lead rounds for the likes of Transmit Security and Nuvemshop.
In 2022, the New York-based private equity and growth investor started the year in similar fashion, signing huge checks to co-lead big rounds in startups like Coda Payments and Xendit.
However, just as many large late-stage growth investors pulled back, so did Insight — and quite dramatically as last year wore on, according to Crunchbase data.

The numbers of venture and private equity rounds Insight participated in fell nearly 20% last year, dropping from 243 rounds to 199 last year, according to Crunchbase numbers.
The money involved in those deals dropped even more significantly. In 2021, deals Insight — known for its investment in companies like Databricks, SentinelOne and Nextdoor — participated in totaled more than $25 billion. Last year, that number dropped to only $14.4 billion (it’s Important to note the amount any investor — including Insight — invests as a specific stake in a round is not usually divulged).


Even with the drop, Insight participated in some huge rounds in 2022 — but again all the largest rounds it took part in were in the first half of the year when the market still had tailwinds from 2021.
Some of the largest deals Insight participated in last year included:

In January, Checkout.com, a payment processor that improves the checkout experience, raised $1 billion in Series D funding that values the company at $40 billion.
In April, Singapore-based Coda Payments raised a $690 million Series C.
In January, Paris-based fintech startup Qonto raised a Series D worth approximately $524 million.
In January, Project44 raised a $420 million round at a pre-money valuation of $2.2 billion.
In April, Switzerland-based SonarSource raised a $412 million round that valued the “clean code” platform at $4.7 billion.

Insight also pulled back on rounds it led or co-led last year. In 2021, the growth funding giant led or co-led 177 rounds that totaled $13.5 billion. Those numbers dropped to 142 deals, totaling just $7.5 billion — a 44% drop.
Second-half slowdown
Perhaps most noticeable about Insight’s pullback in 2022 is the substantial slowdown the firm’s pace saw in the last six months of the year. In the final two quarters of 2022, Insight only took part in 53 rounds that totaled less than $2 billion. In 2021, the firm participated in 134 rounds that totaled $14.5 billion.
Since 2021 seems to be an anomaly, it may be instructive to look at 2020 numbers. That year, Insight took part in 40 deals totaling about $2.4 billion in the last two quarters.
The pullback is not shocking. Big-name investors such as Y Combinator, Sequoia Capital and SoftBank all issued warnings about the private market in the first half of 2022 and said pullbacks were likely.
Tiger Global, for instance, only took part in 45 deals in the last six months of last year, with those rounds totaling less than $2.5 billion, according to Crunchbase data.
Last February, Insight Partners announced it had raised more than $20 billion for its 12th flagship fund — more than twice the size of its11th flagship fund. So when the private markets pick back up, look for Insight to be right there.
Insight did not respond to a request for comment.

The 10 Biggest Rounds Of January: OpenAI Starts Out The Year With A Big Bang,Chris Metinko,2023/02/2,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a monthly feature that runs down the month’s top 10 funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last year’s top rounds here.
The new year did not start slowly, as U.S.-based startups saw five rounds of more than $200 million. Of course, all the talk was about ​​OpenAI’s huge strategic raise, but health care, cybersecurity and renewable energy startups all saw large raises last month as investors wrote big checks.

​​1. OpenAI, $10B, artificial intelligence: The deal had been rumored for weeks, but was finally made official. Microsoft confirmed it has agreed to a “multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment” into OpenAI, the startup behind the artificial intelligence tools ChatGPT and DALL-E. The exact dollar amount was not confirmed, but Semafor reported earlier last month that Microsoft was in talks to invest as much as $10 billion. The deal follows a $1 billion investment in 2019 from Microsoft into the AI startup. It will help position Microsoft in what will be an all-out battle for AI dominance with other tech giants such as Alphabet and Amazon. Earlier this month The Wall Street Journal reported the startup could be valued at $29 billion thanks to a new tender offer.
2. Netskope, $401M, cybersecurity: There must be something about cybersecurity startups and $401 million in convertible notes. In October, Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based Arctic Wolf raised $401 million in convertible notes led by existing investor Owl Rock. This week another startup, Santa Clara, California-based Netskope received a $401 million convertible note investment led by Morgan Stanley Tactical Value. Both Netskope and Arctic Wolf are companies that have been rumored to be IPO candidates for the past few years, so such financings make sense with the path to the public market blocked. Convertible notes work like a short-term loan, but are repaid to the investor at a later point in equity — i.e., after an IPO — typically at a discount and can also include an interest rate. Founded in 2012, Netskope has now raised $1.4 billion, per Crunchbase.
3. (tied) Monogram Health, $375M, health care: Nashville-based Monogram Health is one of several health care startups to raise big last month, as the company closed a huge $375 million funding round. The round included strategic investments from the likes of CVS Health, Cigna Ventures and others. The startup is a specialty provider of in-home care for patients living with polychronic conditions, including chronic kidney disease. More than 37 million American adults live with chronic kidney disease, according to the company. Founded in 2019, the company has raised $555 million, per Crunchbase data.
3. (tied) Silicon Ranch Corp., $375M, renewable energy: Silicon Ranch Corp. actually announced a $600 million raise last month, but only the initial funding of $375 million has closed, with the additional $225 million expected to fund in early 2023. Founded in 2011, Silicon Ranch provides customized renewable energy, carbon and battery storage solutions for a variety of partners across North America. Last year, the company installed 11 new solar facilities that produce nearly 700 megawatts of new generating capacity. Silicon Ranch is no stranger to large raises; it raised $775 million early last year. The company has now raised about $1.6 billion, per Crunchbase.
5. Paradigm, $203M, health care: New York-based Paradigm emerged last month looking to take on one of the more complicated aspects of the health care industry. The startup, conceived by Arch Venture Partners and co-incubated by Arch and General Catalyst, raised a $203 million Series A. Paradigm is trying to change the way clinical trials are run, making it more equitable for patients to get in on them while also making it easier for health care providers to participate and cooperate. The tech-enabled platform aims to open up trials for more people and reduce barriers such as location and finance as it also looks to accelerate the clinical research process. Time will tell if it is successful — the startup already has big-name backers.
6. (tied) Asimov, $175M, biotech: In what seemed like a good month for biotech, Boston-based Asimov raised a $175 million Series B led by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. The startup is developing a synthetic biology platform to design and manufacture next-generation therapeutics, including biologics, cell and gene therapies, and RNA. It currently partners with more than 25 companies that include pharmaceutical companies, biotechs and manufacturing organizations. Founded in 2017, Asimov has raised more than $200 million, per the company.
6. (tied) VettaFi, $175M, financial services: In the financial realm, data is gold and VettaFi has a lot of that apparently. The New York-based startup formed last year and provides data analytics and indexing for financial advisers, asset managers and institutional investors. The company received a $175 million investment from global market developer TMX Group — whose operations include both the Toronto Stock Exchange and Montreal Exchange. The deal gives TMX a 21% common equity stake in VettaFi.
8. (tied) Colossal Biosciences, $150M, biotech: The idea of bringing back the dodo also was able to bring in big money. De-extinction platform Colossal Biosciences raised a $150 million Series B, giving the startup a valuation of more than $1 billion, per reports. The Dallas-based startup, which launched in 2021, plans to use the new cash infusion to continue to advance its genetic engineering, as well as keep developing its software and hardware solutions for applications involved with de-extinction, conservation and human health care. With this new round, Colossal has launched its Avian Genomics Group, which will pursue the de-extinction of the dodo. The startup previously had talked about bringing back the woolly mammoth and the Tasmanian tiger. Last March, Colossal Bioscience raised a $60 million Series A led by Thomas Tull and At One Ventures. Per the company, it has now raised a total of $225 million.
8. (tied) Pathalys Pharma, $150M, biotech: Raleigh, North Carolina-based Pathalys Pharma raised $150 million through what it called “a combination of secured product financing and equity to support the two phase 3 clinical trials, registration efforts and pre-commercialization activities for upacicalcet” — which is used to treat hyperparathyroidism. Abingworth was the lead investor. Simultaneously, the company and Launch Therapeutics announced a collaboration to advance phase 3 clinical trials for the drug. Founded in 2021, Pathalys has raised $150 million to date, according to the late-stage biopharma startup.
10. Xpansiv, $125M, financial services: San Francisco-based Xpansiv was busy last month. The company announced the acquisition of Evolution Markets — which helps with transacting environmental commodities — and the closing of a $125 million round. Xpansiv said the new capital is “linked to the recent $400 million capital raise led by Blackstone Energy Partners which closed in August 2022.” New strategic investors Bank of America and Goldman Sachs participated in the new round. Xpansiv is looking to grow its market infrastructure platform which helps with energy transactions such as carbon credits and renewable energy certificates. Founded in 2017, the company has raised more than $700 million, according to Crunchbase.
Big global deals
Not all the big rounds went to U.S.-based startups, as another AI firm had a big raise.

London-based global life insurance group Resolution Life raised a $1 billion investment from Nippon Life.

Methodology
We tracked the largest rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies in January. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late.

Our Next Energy Raises $300M As US Revs Up EV Industry,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/02/1,"

The U.S. is betting big on homegrown electric-vehicle manufacturing, starting with batteries.
Our Next Energy, a battery production startup, announced on Wednesday it raised a whopping $300 million Series B, bringing total funding to $390 million and raising its valuation to $1.2 billion, according to Crunchbase data.
The Series B was led by Franklin Templeton Investments and real estate-focused Fifth Wall with additional participation from the likes of Temasek Holdings and Coatue. The latest raise will help fund the operations of its battery cell factory that completed construction in December and will formally launch in 2024.

“We are transitioning from a startup funded by venture capital to a manufacturer fueled by growth capital,” said ONE CEO Mujeeb Ijaz. (Ijaz previously worked at Ford and Apple’s secretive transportation initiative before founding the company in 2020.) “That’s important in this environment where urgent demand for U.S.-based cell manufacturing is on the rise.”
Charging up the market
Indeed, the U.S. trails China in battery manufacturing. And, thanks to the rise of electric vehicles and the subsequent need for high-powered, easy-to-scale battery technology, that’s something the U.S. government is looking to change. 
The Inflation Reduction Act promises subsidies for EV companies, including a tax credit for those that use battery materials sourced in the U.S. The U.S. also passed a new law called the Invent Here, Make Here Act to prevent new developments in battery technology made in the U.S. from going overseas.
This comes at a time when supply chain issues and the rising cost of battery and metal material are bottlenecking U.S.-based electric-car manufacturers. Funding for electric-vehicle startups has plummeted from its 2021 highs thanks to the rising cost of materials. General Motors announced on Tuesday electric-vehicle production would slow down due to manufacturing and logistics issues.

"His Football Career Over, Will Tom Brady Focus On Startup Ventures?",Chris Metinko,2023/02/1,"

With Tom Brady announcing his retirement (again), most people will conjure up memories of his dramatic comeback wins, championship clinching drives or maybe even him almost throwing the Lombardi Trophy into the Tampa Bay.
However, the seven-time Super Bowl champion, three-time NFL MVP and sure-fire Football Hall of Famer also has a small footprint in the venture and startup world.

The San Mateo, California, native has invested in a handful of startups, co-founded a couple and seems to be a crypto enthusiast even with ties to the disgraced FTX platform.
Deals
Brady has made only a few startup investments thus far — some that cross into sports and celebrity, per Crunchbase data.
His investments include:

Culver City, California-based Omaze, an online fundraising platform that offers once-in-a-lifetime experiences and prizes to support nonprofits. The startup has raised $127 million, according to Crunchbase data.
New York-based watch retailer Hodinkee, which has raised $40 million in capital to date, per Crunchbase.
Washington, D.C.-based Class Technologies, which provides Zoom for classrooms. The startup has raised $164 million, per Crunchbase.
San Francisco-based Alt, an alternative asset platform that allows people to buy, sell and even store sports cards. The company has raised $306 million to date, according to Crunchbase.

The former University of Michigan Wolverine also has co-founded two VC-backed startups himself.
He is co-chairman and sits on the board at Andreessen Horowitz-backed Autograph — which helps athletes and entertainers launch and promote their NFTs. The company has received more than $200 million, according to Crunchbase.
He also is co-founder of Religion of Sports, a sports media company in Santa Monica that provides videos, podcasts, films and social content about athletics. The startup has taken in $63 million in funding to date, per Crunchbase.
FTX
And of course there is FTX — as we mentioned. Brady was one of nearly a dozen athletes and celebrities who promoted FTX.
In November, a class-action lawsuit was filed in Miami alleging FTX’s yield-bearing accounts were unregistered securities and is seeking unspecified damages from FTX co-founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and many of those who promoted it such as Brady, Brazilian model Gisele Bündchen, tennis player Naomi Osaka, basketball star Steph Curry, and the Golden State Warriors.
The FTX deal is likely one of the few things Brady will not win.
Now that he is retired, it’ll be interesting to see if Brady becomes more involved in venture and VC-backed startups. There are worse people to be associated with than someone commonly referred to as the “GOAT” — or “greatest of all time.”

5 Interesting Startup Deals You May Have Missed In January: Genetically Engineered Trees And Securing Space,Chris Metinko,2023/02/1,"

This is a monthly column that runs down five interesting deals every month that may have flown under the radar. Check out last year’s end-of-year entry here.
A new year brings new funding rounds to a variety of startups, including some that are doing quite unique things with innovative tech.

Let’s take a look at five noteworthy rounds from the start of the year, with funding going to startups ranging from genetically modified trees to take more carbon out of the atmosphere to a brain-computer interface developer to help those with neurological issues.
Building a better tree
Climate biotech firm Living Carbon made headlines last month when it raised a $21 million Series A led by Temasek.
The San Francisco-based startup’s “photosynthesis-enhanced hybrid” trees are genetically engineered to grow bigger and faster — therefore being able to take more carbon out of the air than unmodified plants. According to the company, its photosynthesis enhancement improves biomass accumulation in trees by up to 53% and has the potential to capture approximately 27% more carbon.
As part of the funding, Living Carbon will take its modified pine trees out of a lab and into the wild, planting them on private land in Georgia and Pennsylvania. The company said it is on track to supply 4 million to 5 million seedlings throughout the U.S. this year and next.
Everyone is looking for ways to cut down on carbon, after all — perhaps the path is through better plants.
Not brain surgery
Startups looking to solve health issues through tech is nothing new. However, every once in a while one pops into the newsfeed that is hard to ignore.
Brain-computer interface company Precision Neuroscience is just that. The New York-based startup raised a $41 million Series B led by Forepont Capital Partners last month. The news isn’t the money, but what its implant is trying to do.
The startup’s device is designed to help patients with degenerative diseases communicate using neural signals. In essence, patients would be able to type or move a cursor using just their brain.
On top of that, the interface is thinner than a human hair and would be inserted through a non-invasive process by just cutting a small slit into the patient’s head.
It almost sounds like sci-fi, but even more amazing.
Space, the final security frontier
If you’re a startup and you combine spacetech with cybersecurity, you likely will find yourself on this list.
SpiderOak has done that, after raising a $16.4 million Series C round led by Empyrean Technology Solutions. The zero-trust cybersecurity software company is looking to secure civil, military and commercial space mission systems.
The startup will use the cash to  complete on-orbit testing of its OrbitSecure 2.0 security software. Just last year, the company announced a contract with the U.S. Defense Innovation Unit to demonstrate its zero-trust protocol.
Every new frontier needs security — space is no different.
Big data meets land-based aquaculture
More than 3 billion people in the world currently rely on seafood as a significant source of protein, and with that land-based aquaculture may become even more important. However, as those facilities grow, they will need more accurate, real-time data to make the right decisions about their operations.
That’s where Nova Scotia-based ReelData AI comes in. The startup closed an $8 million Series A led by Buoyant Ventures last month.
The company offers solutions that identify real-time aquatic life population appetite and adjusts feed levels, as well as technology that can monitor the size, weight and distribution of fish populations.
With the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization reporting aquaculture production is projected to reach 109 million tons in 2030 — an increase of 32% from 2018 — having the right data to make the most accurate decisions is critical.
VR-powered learning
Getting through to students can always be hard in the classroom. However, involve some virtual reality and cinematic storytelling, and it may become a little easier.
Startup Dreamscape Learn locked up a $20 million Series A in investment from backers including GSV Ventures and Verizon Ventures to do just that.
The Los Angeles-based company, built in collaboration with Arizona State University, is developing both VR-enabled biology courseware and a platform for instructor-led experiences that allow the class to be conducted in any location relevant to the its area of study.
Dreamscape Learn thus far has focused on the STEM fields with the highest failure rates — likely due to the fact many high school graduates are not prepared for college-level STEM coursework.
More companies are using VR to train employees — extending that to the classroom is the next logical move.

Defy.vc Closes On $300M Fund To Fund The Gap At Pre-Series A Rounds,Gené Teare,2023/01/31,"

Early-stage VC firm Defy.vc  has closed on its third fund of $300 million to invest in pre-Series A funding rounds.
“That’s our core deal: where you need $3 million to $10 million to lead a seed-plus or A-minus” round, said Neil Sequeira, who co-founded Woodside, California-based Defy.vc after leaving General Catalyst to focus on this niche stage.
The firm has already made a couple of investments from fund three, including one in blockchain infrastructure and another in real estate — deals it said will be announced in the coming months.

Most of the commitments to fund three were made in early 2022 with supportive insiders. The firm kept the fund open to add some new investors when the market soured. It decided to wait to announce as it was still investing from fund two.
The firm intends to invest in 33 core companies from this new fund, slightly up from the 27 out of fund two and the 19 core companies in fund one.
 
Defy.vc team from left: Purvi Shah, Brian Rothenberg, Neil Sequeira, Phebe Chen Tran, Bob Rosin, Madison McIlwain and Kamil Saeid
Defy will reserve more than double the initial funding to invest in future rounds. And with 90% of the fund in these core companies, the firm also invests around 10% in smaller seed deals where it has relationships with founders.
Maintaining valuations
From his experience investing at General Catalyst, Sequeira found that a lot of the returns came from early-stage investments.
Fund three is double the size of its inaugural fund raised in 2017 and closer to the $262 million announced in 2019 for fund two. Sequeira notes, however, that in two very different funding climates comparing its 2017 to 2020 funds, “our entry point valuation between fund one and two, the difference was 3%.”
It owns an average of 17.6% each in its eight most promising companies, Sequeira said.
A niche market
On funding early-stage companies at late seed or smaller Series A, startups don’t need another party round. “You need somebody to actually sit on your board and be your partner,” said Sequeira.
“We felt this really strong pull to this niche market, where you could sit on boards, be active, lead investments and be really helpful to entrepreneurs.”
Notable investments from Defy’s first fund include:

Airspace Technologies, which makes technology for time-critical logistics and says it has reached nine figures in revenue.
Direct homeowner real estate marketplace Aalto.
Pawlicy Advisor, a marketplace for pet insurance.

Fund two investments include:

Novi, a technology platform to help enterprise customers to access data on ingredients in a product.
Apploi, which makes software for health clinics workforce management.
Bazaar, a Pakistan-based company that connects mom-and-pop stores with wholesalers.
Arena Club, a sports cards trading startup co-founded by Derek Jeter.

Defy’s strong exits include Securily, which makes security technology for schools, code review company PullRequest, commerce operations company Skubana and health care AI startup Lumiata.

Stripe In Talks To Raise $2.5B After Lowering Valuation,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/01/31,"

Stripe is scrambling. 
The payments processing startup from San Francisco is seeking to raise around $2.5 billion, according to The New York Times, which would raise Stripe’s valuation from $55 billion to $60 billion. 
Thrive Capital, which led Stripe’s Series C and contributed to its Series E (according to Crunchbase data), contributed $1 billion to the fundraising efforts per the report. 

Stripe’s raise will likely not go toward bolstering the company’s operations, according to The Wall Street Journal. Instead, the company will use the funds to resolve the expiring stock units held by employees. 
Collapsing under late-stage pressure
Stock options are a crucial tool for tech startups to recruit and retain valuable employees, and several veteran members of Stripe also have stock units that are set to expire this year. Stripe is considering going public or facilitating a private market transaction to allow employees to liquidate those assets. 
Stripe’s next moves could pave the way for other late-stage, high-value companies grappling with the same problems. It’s the fifth-highest valued startup on The Crunchbase Unicorn Board, under Shein, Tiktok owner ByteDance and SpaceX.
The company, which spent the majority of its last 12 years flourishing, is now reckoning with a frosty market. The startup was valued at a high of $95 billion back in March 2021, when the company raised a $600 million Series H round. At the time, co-founder John Collison said he had no plans to take the company public. 
That valuation was, reportedly, later cut down to $74 billion in July and again to $63 billion in January amid a funding pullback. But Stripe’s current reported valuation of $55 billion is still light years ahead of where it was in 2020, when it was valued at $36 billion.

De-Extinction Startup Colossal Biosciences Raises $150M To Bring Back The Dodo,Chris Metinko,2023/01/31,"

Colossal Biosciences raised a $150 million Series B to further its de-extinction platform that could bring back the Dodo bird and the woolly mammoth.
The investment gives the startup a valuation of more than $1 billion, per reports.

The new round was led by US Innovative Technology Fund, and included participation from Breyer Capital, WestRiver Group, Animal Capital, In-Q-Tel, Animoca Brands, Peak 6, Bold Capital, Jazz Venture Partners and others.
The Dallas-based startup, which launched in 2021, plans to use the new cash infusion to continue to advance its genetic engineering and software and hardware solutions for applications involved with de-extinction, conservation and human health care.
“The World Wildlife Fund found that in the last 50 years, Earth’s wildlife populations have plunged by an average of 69% at the hands of mankind,” said co-founder and CEO Ben Lamm in a release. “By gathering the smartest minds across investing, genomics, conservation and synthetic biology, we have the opportunity to reverse human-inflicted biodiversity loss while developing technologies for both conservation and human healthcare.”
Bringing back the DoDo
With this new round, Colossal has launched its Avian Genomics Group, which will pursue the de-extinction of the Dodo.
There are now more than 400 bird species that are categorized as either extinct, extinct in the wild, or critically endangered, per the IUCN Red List. Colossal is looking to reverse these numbers through its genetic rescue tech and its de-extinction toolkit.
Paleogeneticist Beth Shapiro, and Ben Lamm, co-founder and CEO of Colossal
The company has said in the past it would focus on the “restoration and rewilding of functional woolly mammoths to the tundra” and bring back the Tasmanian tiger.
Colossal said bringing back mammoths would allow for a better understanding of evolutionary change in other species, and that genetic engineering applications also will help enhance food production and reduce environmental impact.
Last March, Colossal Bioscience raised a $60 million Series A led by Thomas Tull and At One Ventures. Per the company, it has now raised a total of $225 million.
Colossal’s first technology spinout, Form Bio, also raised a $30 million Series A in September.

AI In 2023: A Year of Reckoning In The Enterprise,Guest Author,2023/01/31,"

By Jason Schoettler
If you go by the headlines, 2022 was a breakout year for AI. Every week, it seemed there were articles about generative AI showcasing the technology’s ability to create amazing artworks, essays and graphic designs seemingly out of thin air.
There were stories about AI companies raising hundreds of millions of dollars despite the downturn. AI was everywhere.

But as an investor in AI and automation companies for the last decade, I’d say, “We’re just getting started.” Underlying technologies have advanced to a point where AI is now useful for most industries, and the cost to deploy it has reached a point where real ROI is possible. But we’re still in the early innings.
2023 predictions
In 2023, I predict one thing: Companies will put serious time and money into investigating AI, leading to widespread deployments in 2024.
Jason Schoettler, co-founder and managing partner at Calibrate Ventures
Right now, AI is still something most companies are looking to understand from a business perspective. They know it’s important to improve productivity, efficiency and profitability, but they aren’t sure which AI-enabled tools are the right investment. And they are still trying to hire teams that understand AI enough to help direct implementation.
Almost every CTO I talked to in 2022 said their biggest roadblock to deploying AI was finding the right engineers and data scientists to help them get there. And even companies in sectors that are further along the AI adoption scale — such as health care, manufacturing and warehousing — still struggle with getting buy-in from higher-ups to roll out AI at scale. It’s a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation. To get AI widely deployed you need a champion inside the company to support that investment. But until leaders see AI in action, they don’t become those champions.
So what’s next in 2023? Generative AI will break into the enterprise in fits and spurts. Executives will be surprised by the speed, depth and capabilities of generative AI, leading to experimentation with business models and use cases. Forward-thinking business leaders will reimagine their products, service delivery and operations based on what AI can do for them.
More broadly, 2023 will be the start of a real AI reckoning for companies across diverse industries from finance and health care to manufacturing, transportation and entertainment. Companies that layer machine learning and generative AI over their own proprietary data sets stand to gain actionable insights that will help them jump ahead of competitors in the next decade. Thanks to myriad stories about the power of generative AI in 2022, AI will finally get the attention it deserves from business users in 2023.

Everyone Wants To Be An Accelerator,Joanna Glasner,2023/01/31,"

If you’re a new founder researching accelerators, the choices can look overwhelming.
Should it be regional or international? Is it better to spend a few weeks in a high-intensity program or commit to a couple years of close mentorship. Remote, hybrid or in-person? Industry-specific? A big program or a small cohort?
Now, as accelerator programs regain their groove following a couple years of pandemic disruptions, it looks like the options are, if anything, getting even broader.

In the past few months alone, we’ve seen brand-new and retooled accelerator programs roll out at a steady clip. Several are sector-focused, seeking to leverage advancement in hot fields like generative AI. Others are looking to build up entrepreneurship in metro areas not known as major tech hubs.
Venture investors, always keen to get in on the new, new thing early, are also joining the fray. One motivation is a belief that the largest, big-name accelerator programs, and Y Combinator in particular, aren’t the best fit for founders seeking a more hands-on, long-term approach
“A lot of these programs have really become just machines,” said David Beisel, partner at NextView Ventures. The system is to accept dozens or hundreds of companies, provide “formulaic programming” and culminate with a big demo day show.
While the prevailing accelerator model can be useful for founders, per Beisel, one key problem is that the journey from newfound startup to fundable early-stage company takes a couple of years, usually with pivots along the way. Drawing raves on demo day doesn’t translate into long-term success, he added
Accelerating VCs
VCs think they may have better takes on the accelerator model. NextView is one, with an eponymous spring program that includes $400,000 in funding for software-focused founders and extended support through the next funding round. The firm settled on a hybrid model, mixing a few days of in-person activities with virtual programming.
The most prominent names in venture capital are also getting in the accelerator game.
In March, Sequoia announced the launch of Arc, an eight-week program for European seed-stage founders to build enduring businesses that includes $1 million in initial funding. The famed VC’s pitch is that its long track record of backing transformative startups provides useful knowledge around fundamentals that “make the difference between companies that stand the test of time and those that don’t.”
Andreessen Horowitz, meanwhile, joined the fold in October with the announcement that it is relaunching its Crypto Startup School and expanding it to an accelerator program. Participants get $500,000 in seed funding and take part in a 12-week program in Los Angeles.
Sector-focused accelerators
A number of newer accelerators are sector-focused, drawing on the notion that founders can get the best resources from others in their field.
To this tune, the University of Chicago’s Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship this month announced Transform, a new accelerator for startups focused on data science and artificial intelligence. A couple years earlier, Polsky launched Duality, dedicated to quantum science and technology companies.
AI has been a particularly hot area for accelerators, as evidenced by the sizable number of them operating in the field. But other areas are scaling up as well. For instance, FemTech Lab’s is looking to invest in more entrepreneurs building offerings with potential to improve women’s health and wellness.
Regional boosters
Regional accelerators are also playing a growing role in the competition to find and fund the most promising seed startups. In past profiles of state and metro area startup scenes, we’ve noted how some local operations — such as Buffalo, New York’s 43North and Ohio’s JumpStart — have played a role in building high-valuation companies.
Other metros are adding their own new offerings to the mix. Earlier this month, for instance, Green Bay, Wisconsin’s business community launched a 10–week accelerator program targeting founders in northeast Wisconsin.
Tampa Bay, meanwhile, just launched what it calls the region’s first tech accelerator for Latin American founders. The LatinTech Accelerator is planning a 90-day program for startups led by founders of Latin American descent, who have historically been underrepresented among venture-backed companies.
The right balance
For founders who choose the accelerator route, figuring out which program to pick seems to resemble the dilemma of the college-bound senior with multiple scholarship options. Probably, every one will open up previously unknown opportunities. In hindsight, it’ll likely be difficult to  determine if you made the best choice.
At the end of the day, however, virtually all of the offerings seem to share an interest in furnishing startups with help in navigating some of the more predictable elements that contribute to success. This includes such fundamentals as establishing a network, pitching investors and making do with the resources at hand.
Still, the other puzzle pieces that turn ideas into startup success stories invariably have to come not from accelerators but from founders themselves.

OpenAI Rival Anthropic Expected To Nab $300M,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/01/30,"

In 2021, veterans of ChatGPT’s parent OpenAI founded a new AI startup that would quickly rival the company.
Anthropic, the San Francisco-based AI startup and rival to ChatGPT, is close to adding $300 million to its dry powder, The New York Times reported.

That could bring the company’s total valuation to $5 billion. Anthropic previously raised $704 million across Series A and Series B funding rounds in 2022, according to Crunchbase data (much of that Series B was bankrolled by Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced FTX founder).
The AI arms race
Anthropic and its AI chatbot, Claude, are riding on the coattails of Silicon Valley’s latest obsession with AI that started in November, when OpenAI launched the new and improved ChatGPT.
Anthropic aims to do the same. The chatbot is in closed beta mode, but in a paper detailing its goals, Claude is expected to combat harmful prompts by explaining why they are dangerous or misguided.
Per Crunchbase data, funding in the AI space has accounted for around 10% of all venture funding in recent years. While several industries buckled amid the funding dry spell in 2022, AI flourished in its second best funding year ever. Funding in startups that used AI-related descriptors far outpaced those with Web3 descriptors, which was once the apple of Silicon Valley’s eye.
Cohere, a Canada-based natural language processing startup that was founded in 2019, has raised around $170 million in two series. DeepMind, a London-based AI startup that was founded in 2010, was acquired by Alphabet in 2015 and is building an NLP model similar to ChatGPT.
As investors scramble to grab a piece of sophisticated, AI-powered language processing models, OpenAI is making strategic moves to ensure it’s adopted before the competition. The Information recently reported that OpenAI is investing in startups, particularly those that will use its language processing networks.

New Unicorn Shuffle Thins Herd In Final Month Of 2022,Gené Teare,2023/01/30,"

More unicorn companies left The Crunchbase Unicorn Board in December than joined. In the final month of 2022, three companies joined the board whilst four dropped off and four exited.
Three unicorns in the crypto space faced bankruptcy in December 2022; FTX, BlockFi and Celsius Network. And door-to-door delivery service Oda, based in Norway, left the board with a valuation below its prior billion-dollar value.

We estimate that many more companies  will drop off the board, if given a new valuation in 2023. Half of the 1,400-plus companies currently on the board are valued at $1.5 billion and under.


So which companies are garnering fundings at high valuations?
The new unicorns
The three companies that joined in December 2022 include:

Shenzhen-based hydrogen fuel cell vehicle company SFCC raised $647.5 million in a Series B funding valued at $1.9 billion. Founded in 2016, the company was incubated by SPIC (State Power Investment Corp.), one of the largest energy groups in China. It aims to support the ecosystem of  developing hydrogen fuel cells, vehicles and refueling stations.
Salt Lake City-based lifesciences quality and manufacturing solution MasterControl raised a Series A funding of $150 million led by Sixth Street. The funding valued the company at $1.3 billion. The company has grown to $100 million ARR without raising prior funding and is over three decades old.
London-based talent engagement platform Beamery raised $50 million in a Series D funding valued at $1 billion. Teachers’ Ventures Growth led the round. This is part of the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, which led the Series C funding in June 2021 that valued the company at $800 million. Beamery counts General Motors and Johnson & Johnson amongst its customers, “with net retention for Fortune 500 customers at 135%+” according to its latest funding announcement.

Four exits
Four companies left the current unicorn board and joined the exited unicorn list. These include Berlin-based delivery startup Gorillas, which was acquired by Turkey-based Getir for $1.2 billion. Gorillas was last valued in 2021 at $3.1 billion in a Series C funding.
And on the public markets side, San Francisco-based peer-to-peer car sharing company Getaround was valued at $1.2 billion in its NYSE listing.
Two companies from China exited. Hangzhou-based Ecarx, an automation computing technology integrated into cars, went public on Nasdaq via a SPAC merger which valued the company at $3.8 billion. And Henan-based snack food brand Weilong Foods went public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange valued close to $3 billion.

Methodology
The Crunchbase Unicorn Board is a curated list that includes private unicorn companies with post-money valuations of $1 billion or more and is based on Crunchbase data. New companies are added to the Unicorn Board as they reach the $1 billion valuation mark as part of a funding round.
The unicorn board does not reflect internal company valuations — such as those set via a 409a process for employee stock options — as these differ from, and are more likely to be lower than, a priced funding round. We also do not adjust valuations based on investor writedowns, which change quarterly, as different investors will not value the same company consistently within the same quarter.
Funding to unicorn companies includes all private financings to companies that are tagged as unicorns, as well as those that have since graduated to the exited unicorn list.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.

"Chip Stocks Are Down, But Pockets Of Semiconductor Startup Funding Still Robust",Joanna Glasner,2023/01/27,"

For the semiconductor space, these are not looking like the best of times.
Intel stock plummeted to its lowest point in over five years Friday, following a disappointing earnings forecast predicated on slowing PC demand and sinking profit margins. The news follows several downward-trending quarters for big U.S. chipmakers, with Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices also well below last year’s peaks.

Still, it’s not the worst of times either. Even with the markdowns, big chipmakers still rank high among the most valuable American companies, with the leader, Nvidia, in the No. 7 slot. As for semiconductor startups, venture funding may be down in recent months but we’re still seeing big deals getting done.
In an effort to see where the money is going, we used Crunchbase data to put together a list of top funding recipients. The curated list below includes 17 semiconductor startups that have collectively pulled in more than $1.1 billion since last year.


Among recent funding rounds, the standout deal is Astera Labs, a Silicon Valley-based developer of system-aware semiconductor products, boards and services. The 6-year-old company raised a $150 million Series D round in November, led by Fidelity Management at a valuation of $3.2 billion.
A much newer company, 2-year-old Eliyan, also scored a sizable funding. The Santa Clara, California-based startup, which manufactures semiconductor interconnects to accelerate chiplet-based systems, pulled in $40 million in a November Series A.
Early-stage action
In the past few weeks, the space has also seen some seed and smaller early-stage action. Most recently, Rapid Silicon, a 2-year-old, Los Gatos, California-based startup described as “an AI-enabled field-programmable gate array company,” picked up $15 million in a January Series A financing. And New York-based Xscape Photonics, a photonic chip provider, landed $10 million in December.
Current market conditions in the semiconductor space, meanwhile, look rather different than they did  a year ago, when headlines about semiconductor supply chain shortages were a regular feature of the news cycle. Global venture funding to companies tied to the semiconductor industry hit a record $6.4 billion in 2021, per Crunchbase data.
Exit activity, however, has slowed since those bubblier times. The paucity of public offerings has put a damper on pre-IPO financings. The collapse of Nvidia’s planned $44 billion acquisition of Arm last year also put an end to what would have been the largest M&A deal in semiconductor history.
For semiconductor startups, however, there’s certainly a case to be made. The future looks bright, as humanity’s ongoing addiction to ever-smaller and more powerful devices ensures any technology that ups performance and saves power ought to find a welcome market.

The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: OpenAI Lands $10B; Paradigm Raises $203M,Chris Metinko,2023/01/27,"

This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.
Artificial intelligence is certainly having a moment right now. This week it was all about OpenAI with its massive $10 billion round — a round so big, it’ll be hard for any company to top all year. Right now, it seems every startup is claiming to use AI in some form or another, and why not? Those two letters are getting strategics and VCs excited all the same. It’ll be interesting to see what it does to venture overall in the next six months.

1. OpenAI, $10B, artificial intelligence: The deal had been rumored for weeks, but was finally made official. Microsoft confirmed it has agreed to a “multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment” into OpenAI, the startup behind the artificial intelligence tools ChatGPT and DALL-E. The exact dollar amount was not confirmed, but Semafor reported earlier this month that Microsoft was in talks to invest as much as $10 billion. The deal follows a $1 billion investment in 2019 from Microsoft into the AI startup. It will help position Microsoft in what will be an all-out battle for AI dominance with other tech giants such as Alphabet and Amazon. Earlier this month The Wall Street Journal reported the startup could be valued at $29 billion thanks to a new tender offer.
2. Paradigm, $203M, health care: New York-based Paradigm emerged this week looking to take on one of the more complicated aspects of the health care industry. The startup, conceived by Arch Venture Partners and co-incubated by Arch and General Catalyst, raised a $203 million Series A. Paradigm is trying to change the way clinical trials are run, making it more equitable for patients to get in on them while also making it easier for health care providers to participate and cooperate. The tech-enabled platform aims to open up trials for more people and reduce barriers such as location and finance as it also looks to accelerate the clinical research process. Time will tell if it is successful — the startup already has big-name backers.
3. Boston Metal, $120M, cleantech: Certain parts of cleantech seem to do well in turbulent VC times, and right now eliminating greenhouse gas is big. Boston Metal was the latest to get funding in the cleantech space, taking in a big $120 million round led by steel and mining company ArcelorMittal. The startup is creating equipment that is able to take heavy greenhouse gas emissions out of steel production. It hopes to go to market with its solution by 2026. Founded in 2012, the company has raised nearly $191 million, per Crunchbase.
4. Alleviant Medical, $75M, medical devices: Austin, Texas-based Alleviant Medical landed a $75 million equity financing co-led by S3 Ventures and RiverVest Venture Partners to help combat heart failure. The medical device company is developing a no-implant interatrial shunt for heart failure — the leading cause of hospitalizations worldwide. Alleviant is preparing to go to trial with its device, and expects to enroll 400 to 700 patients at sites worldwide. Founded in 2017, the startup has now raised $88 million, per Crunchbase.
5. (tied) Osmo, $60M, artificial intelligence: Yet another AI company. However, this one is a little different. Osmo — a spinout of Google Research — is trying to give computers a sense of smell. Its goal is to scientifically create molecules to be used in perfumes, candles, etc. The company launched with this Wired article, where it’s reported the Cambridge, Massachusetts, startup raised $60 million in an initial funding round led by New York-based Lux Capital and GV.
5. (tied) QuickNode, $60M, blockchain: It has been a tough fundraising environment for Web3 startups lately. However, that didn’t stop Miami-based blockchain development platform QuickNode from closing a $60 million Series B funding led by 10T Holdings that values the company at $800 million. QuickNode helps developers build and scale Web3 applications faster. The startup said it grew its user base 400% and its revenue 300% in the past year. Founded in 2017, the company has raised nearly $102 million, according to Crunchbase.
7. Angle Health, $58M, health care: Like we said, AI is a big buzzword right now — even when it comes to health care. Angle Health locked up a $58 million Series A led by Portage this week. The San Francisco-based startup offers an “AI-enabled technology platform” that helps employers tailor health care plans that include traditional health benefits as well as  telemedicine, behavioral health and other digital health solutions. Founded in 2019, the company has now raised $62 million, per Crunchbase.
8. Cygnvs, $55M, cybersecurity: Los Altos, California-based Cygnvs officially launched with a $55 million Series A led by Andreessen Horowitz. The company offers a cyber crisis platform that helps companies prepare and practice for a security event.
9. (tied) Crux, $50M, big data: San Francisco-based data integration and observability platform Crux announced a  $50 million venture funding led by Two Sigma and Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Founded in 2017, Crux says it has raised a total of $157 million.
9. (tied) Forward Networks, $50M, information technology: Santa Clara, California-based digital twin network modeling software developer Forward Networks closed a $50 million Series D led by MSD Partners. Founded in 2013, the company has raised more than $112 million, according to Crunchbase.
Big global deals
OpenAI was not the only private company to see a round in the billions.

London-based global life insurance group Resolution Life raised a $1 billion investment from Nippon Life.
Canada-based Blockstream, a bitcoin and blockchain technology platform for financial markets, raised a $125 million convertible note round.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of Jan. 21-27. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

Venture Fell More Than 40% In Hottest States For Funding,Chris Metinko,2023/01/27,"

Venture funding to the holy trinity of the startup world — California, Massachusetts and New York — fell sharply last year from 2021’s lofty heights.
All three states saw a precipitous drop — more than 40% in each case — in 2022 venture funding to startups based in their borders, according to Crunchbase numbers. Deal flow also fell.
But while the declines are striking, it is notable that last year was still an increase from 2020.

Also, despite the drops, the three states still far outpace other states in venture. Massachusetts startups saw nearly twice the amount of venture Texas — the fourth-biggest state for venture — startups got. (Although, Texas, North Carolina and Florida posted notable gains in VC funding last year, when most other states saw declines.)
“Those three will continue to be the leaders, that is not going to change,” said Steve Case, founder of Washington, D.C.-based venture firm Revolution, which focuses on investing outside the major hubs of Silicon Valley, New York and Boston.
The Golden State
California was the state with the biggest dip in terms of dollars. That’s not too shocking, considering it is by far the largest venture economy in the U.S.
Venture funding to the state fell 42% in 2022, from a high of $157.4 billion in 6,419 deals to $91.9 billion in 4,296 deals. The deals number represents a 33% decline in volume and the lowest deal count since at least 2017.


Then again, it is important to remember that in 2020, California-based startups raised $76.4 billion in 5,418 deals. Compared to that dollar figure, last year represented a 20% increase.
Funding slowed in several areas, but California — with its mature startup ecosystem and high valuations — was undoubtedly hurt by the decline in the large growth rounds the venture world witnessed.
While companies like SpaceX, Anduril Industries and Cruise saw huge billion-dollar-plus rounds last year, it is interesting to note the state saw only 13 half-billion-dollar rounds in 2022 compared to 33 in 2021.
The Empire State
Although California’s venture decline was eye-catching, it was not the largest percentage drop by a state. That dubious honor belonged to New York.
New York saw venture funding in the state drop from a high of $52.3 billion in 2,726 deals to $26.5 billion in 1,902 deals. That’s a nearly 50% decline in dollars and a 30% fall in deal flow.


The deal count is the state’s lowest since 2017.
Much like California, however, New York’s 2022 venture investment numbers were higher than those of 2020, which saw $23.3 billion go to startups in 2,181 announced rounds.
Also similar to the Golden State, New York saw a drop in large rounds. In 2022, New York startups took in 59 rounds of $100 million or more, compared to 84 in 2021.
The state’s numbers also were likely affected by the drop in fintech funding. While it’s hard to pin California’s downturn on just one sector — it’s home to a large number of startups in so many different industries — New York’s most dominant sector has normally been fintech, which faced a very bumpy funding road in 2022.
Indeed, the largest round raised in the state by a startup went to a fintech company. Brooklyn-based Web3 and fintech startup ConsenSys closed a $450 million round. The company develops decentralized protocols software to help developers build blockchain-based financial infrastructure.
Other New York-based startups that raised large rounds of more than a quarter-billion dollars last year include smart city firm Sidewalk Infrastructure and e-commerce provider Wonder.
The Bay State
Coming in just after New York for the biggest percentage drop in funding is the third state in the VC trinity — Massachusetts.
The Bay State saw a 46% decline in venture to its startups last year. While 2021 saw $35.7 billion in 1,119 deals, those numbers declined to $19.5 billion in 810 deals.


Similar to New York, the slowdown in deal count was a 28% drop from 2021, and the lowest number since 2017.
The numbers in the state were also hurt by the fact there were 97 large, $100 million-plus rounds in 2021, but only 62 last year.
Interestingly, while Massachusetts is known for biotech, the three largest rounds in the state last year went to a variety of other industries:

Digital manufacturing startup VulcanForms raised a $355 million Series C.
Iron-air battery developer Form Energy raised a $450 million Series E.
USDC issuer Circle Internet Financial raised a $400 million round as it waited to go public via a SPAC, which was officially called off last month.

Different times
Case said the numbers are not surprising when large growth rounds were so down last year and all three states have a mature startup ecosystem accustomed to huge mega rounds.
While Case said he does not see any of the trinity being dislodged from the top three spots when it comes to venture, the pandemic has changed some aspects of fundraising.
Those things include people who moved to different areas of the country during the pandemic and are now more likely to start their own companies in those areas one day, as well as those who may have suffered one of the many massive layoffs sending shockwaves through tech.
The pandemic also opened up more of the country to investors, causing them to explore other areas — something they are not likely to abandon now.
“Pre-pandemic, it was inconceivable for some investor to back a company outside of a place like Silicon Valley,” he said. “But once they started, they realized the opportunities. It’s not inconceivable anymore.”

"
Stripe May Go Public Next Year To Address Expiring Shares,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/01/26,"

Payments startup Stripe told employees and investors it will make a plan to go public next year, The Information reported on Thursday. 
Stripe has been arguably one of the most anticipated IPOs of 2023, making several end-of-the-year lists (including ours). It was also one of the highest-valued decacorns in 2022. And yet, when the company was valued at $95 billion in 2021, Stripe co-founder John Collison said there were no immediate plans to take the company public. 
But it looks like his tune has changed. The company is looking to solve the issue of 10-year stock units awarded to veteran employees that are expected to expire at the end of this year. It’s an issue several companies Stripe’s size will face as the IPO market all but closed up in 2022. 

One way for Stripe to resolve the issue is to take the decacorn public. Founded in 2010, the company has raised around $2.2 billion since then — most recently a $600 million Series H in 2021. It has dual headquarters, in San Francisco and in Dublin, Ireland.
Looking at the secondary market 
The other option Stripe may be considering is allowing stockholders to sell shares on the secondary markets. 
As an employee retention tool, it’s unclear what the best picture is for Stripe, which has operated privately for 13 years. According to data from secondary markets platform Forge Global, almost half of the investor activity on its platform in 2020 was around companies that were 10 years or older. In Q4 of last year, that interest nosedived to 8% — the lowest recorded on Forge. 
That’s pretty surprising, considering that the majority of tech company activity on the secondary markets are centered around established, pre-IPO dinosaurs such as Stripe. But given the state of overhyped valuations and the frosty market, perhaps investors are hesitant to buy shares.

NEA Announces Two New Funds Totaling $6.2B,Chris Metinko,2023/01/26,"

Venture giant New Enterprise Associates announced Thursday it has closed on approximately $6.2 billion across two funds.
The firm, known for investments in transformational startups like Salesforce 1, Workday and Robinhood, said one fund will be dedicated to early-stage investing and the other to venture growth-stage opportunities.
NEA will invest in a range of different ​​technology and health care sectors — including both enterprise and consumer technology, digital health, and life sciences.

The firm had more than $25 billion of assets under management as of the end of 2022.
“We are deeply grateful to our limited partners for the trust they have placed in our team, and excited to have raised the largest pool of capital in NEA’s history at a time of great uncertainty, but also tremendous opportunity,” said Scott Sandell, managing general partner at NEA.
A long history
Founded in 1977, NEA is one of the oldest VC firms in the country. The firm has had more than 270 portfolio company IPOs and over 450 mergers and acquisition events.
Just in the last several months, NEA has participated in rounds worth $100 million or more for companies such as Escient Pharmaceuticals, MBX Biosciences and Swift Navigation.
The announcement comes at a time when many in the industry believe fund managers may have a hard time raising new funds as limited partners and institutions try to avoid risk and rebalance their portfolios after the beating many public tech stocks have taken.
However, such an environment is likely to favor more established firms such as NEA and those who have a proven track record.
Just last week, another seasoned firm,  Sequoia, announced a new $195 million fund for seed-stage startups, according to Forbes.

"Europe’s Leading Investors Were Active In H1 2022, Then Dropped Off",Gené Teare,2023/01/26,"

Active investors in European startups remained very engaged in H1 2022 then slowed down significantly for the rest of the year, a primer to a slow 2023.
For context, the European funding environment grew 159% year over year in 2021, more dramatically than the U.S. and Asia. The slowdown in 2022 for Europe was less drastic than other regions, down 25% while North America was down 36% by year end.

So who were the most active investors in European startups in 2022 based on an analysis of Crunchbase data? We look at this by funding stage.
Seed investors
Seed funding in Europe showed the least decline year over year compared to other funding stages in 2022, down 11%.
The most active seed investors backed on average 43 deals per year in 2022. Of the 18 most active seed investors in 2022, two-thirds were more active or on par with 2021, while one-third were below 2021 counts. Some of the more active seed investors are global seed shops, often with a base in Europe.
Crowdcube, an equity crowdfunding platform, leads the list, but has a much lower investment count in 2022 vs. 2021, a signal of a cooling market.
Bpifrance, SpeedInvest, Kima Ventures, Plug and Play and Cherry Ventures were over 40% more active in 2022 at seed vs. 2021. Meanwhile, Antler and SOSV have been close to flat year over year.
If you view the same data by half-year in 2022, only four of the most active seed investors were more active in investing in European startups in H2 2022 compared to H1, an indicator of a more cautious seed funding environment as we head into 2023. Firms more active at seed in the second half of 2022 were Bpifrance, High-Tech Gründerfonds, FJ Labs and Cherry Ventures.


Early stage leads
The 18 most active lead investors at Series A and B fundings listed here averaged eight investments led per year. The more active investors in 2022, on average, led more rounds in 2022 than in 2021 or 2020.
Leading early-stage Series A and B fundings are a mix of European-based venture firms, U.S.-based venture firms that have set up shop in Europe, and late-stage growth capital based largely out of New York.
The most active lead  investor at Series A and B rounds is Octopus, a firm that led more than twice the average number of fundings for this cohort.
Tiger is the sole investor on this list that is down by rounds led at Series A or B in 2022.
Some investors who were more active in 2021 and cut back in led rounds in 2022 include EQT Ventures and Accel.
If you view the same data by half year, all funds listed here were down or flat except Valar Ventures and Temasek, which did more deals in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half.


Down by amounts led
Some of the largest investors have cut back significantly on the size of deals they led or co-led. Softbank Vision Fund and Coatue were the investors down the most year over year on the list of firms that participated in leading the largest funding amounts.
However Eurazeo, Lightspeed and Highland Europe were up, leading or co-leading fundings at larger amounts than they did in 2021. This total deal amount does not take into account the amount each investor invested in a deal it led.


The freeze is coming
Funding in 2022 showed remarkably distinct trends for the first half compared to the second. In a cooling market, industry experts expect Europe will fall further in the first half of 2023 compared to other regions, as Europe trails the U.S. funding markets.
Methodology
The data contained in this report comes directly from Crunchbase, and is based on disclosed fundings. Data reported is as of Jan. 24, 2023.
Crunchbase, like all databases of private-market transactions, has a documented pattern of reporting delays. It can sometimes take between weeks and months for some rounds to be announced publicly and subsequently get added to Crunchbase. This is especially the case for the most recent year, and for seed and early-stage deals, which are often raised by a companybefore it launches a product or otherwise gets much outside media coverage surfacing information about its funding history. As data is added to Crunchbase over time, some of the numbers in this report may shift.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.

Better Than 2021? Venture Funding Thrived Like Never Before In These 3 States,Chris Metinko,2023/01/26,"

Last year could not top the banner year venture capital saw in 2021 — at least in most geographies.
While the holy trinity of venture funding — California, New York and Massachusetts — saw massive declines (we’ll get to that tomorrow) some states actually realized significant gains last year, according to Crunchbase data.
“It doesn’t surprise me,” said Steve Case, founder of Washington, D.C.-based venture firm Revolution, which focuses on investing outside of the major hubs of Silicon Valley, New York and Boston. 

“A lot of these areas laid the groundwork years ago and are seeing the payoff,” he said.
While the big three saw big declines in venture investment between 2021 and 2022 — although still more than they saw in 2020 — states such as Florida and North Carolina saw substantial gains. Texas venture funding numbers remained even with 2021 levels to the state after seeing a significant increase in 2021 — still impressive since most areas saw a decline last year.
Case said while there has been steady progress in making the geographical dispersal of venture capital more diverse, the COVID pandemic and the movement of talent has likely accelerated that trend. 
Along with that, new government initiatives around sectors such as semiconductors and infrastructure and certain areas having an advantage in specific sectors tech has moved into — such as health care and foodtech — also have helped level the playing field.
The Sunshine State
No state was able to take advantage of those trends more than Florida. The Sunshine State saw the biggest percentage increase of any state in venture capital investment between 2021 and last year.
In 2021, investors spent $7.8 billion on Florida-based startups over the course of 652 deals, according to Crunchbase. Last year, that venture number jumped 25% to $9.7 billion in 601 deals. In 2020, Florida startups only took in $3.4 billion in 470 deals.


“Even us, as Florida’s biggest cheerleaders, we could not imagine what has happened,” said Saxon Baum, partner at Florida Funders, an investment firm that focuses on Florida and the Southeast and has 96 portfolio companies.
Florida saw several large funding rounds last year into the likes of Fanatics, Citadel Securities and Yuga Labs. Industries including crypto, space, gaming and cybersecurity have started to thrive in the state.
While the Florida startup scene has been bolstered by the lack of state income tax and a host of successful exits including KnowBe4, ConnectWise and Reef in recent years, it also is likely the state received the biggest boost from COVID migration.
During the pandemic, Florida remained much more open than parts of California and New York.
“People moved here, money moved here,” said Baum, pointing out the state has the third-highest number of accredited investors behind only California and New York.
Baum also points out that many see Florida as a natural entry point to the growing Latin American market, also making it an attractive location.
With the increase in venture, Baum added he has already seen big names move into the market in the past few years. “We see Sequoia, Andreessen, SoftBank, etc.,” he said. “We never really saw those names until recently.”
While those firms have added to the competition on deals to some extent, it also has given more opportunities to work together.
“Yes, it’s added competition, but also they want and need to collaborate,” he added.
The Tar Heel State
Although Florida saw the biggest venture capital gains in 2022 —  a come-back-to-reality year for the industry — it was not the only state to see a significant uptick.
Just up the road, North Carolina also powered through what was a down year for most areas. The Tar Heel State saw nearly a $1 billion increase in venture capital going to the startups in its borders.


The numbers were helped out immensely by Epic Games’ massive $2 billion investment from Sony and KIRKBI that valued the gaming company at $31.5 billion.
Lister Delgado, founder and managing partner at IDEA Fund Partners in Raleigh, said he has noticed real growth in the tech and startup ecosystem in the state — and it is not just due to the effects of COVID.
“Clearly there has been a shift,” Delgado said. “People moved here and you can just look at the dealflow.”
Unlike some regions that are seeing a relatively young tech scene prosper, Delgado points out that North Carolina has been sustainably growing its startup scene for decades, from research and biotech out of the Research Triangle to the successes of Epic Games and open-source software giant Red Hat.
North Carolina’s numbers are definitely moving in a positive direction. Startups in the state received about $3.5 billion in venture capital via 241 deals in 2020. Those numbers grew to $4 billion via 285 deals in 2021.
However, the state saw an even bigger jump — 24% — last year while most other regions posted declines. North Carolina startups, meanwhile, saw $4.9 billion roll to them in 234 deals.
Delgado said he already is seeing more out-of-state money come into the state — and just like Florida, he is seeing bigger names including Tiger Global, Bessemer Venture Partners and Battery Ventures being more active.
Tiger, for example, took part in Raleigh-based analytics firm Pendo’s $150 million Series F in 2021.
Enterprise software, deep tech, AI and fintech all provide substantial growth areas for North Carolina, Delgado said.
“It’s very diverse,” Delgado added. “Just the diversity of focus [of startups] is incredible.”
The Lone Star State
Sometimes in a year that doesn’t live up to its predecessor, it’s not just the areas that make gains that count. It’s also important to note the ones that held steady and did not give back previous massive jumps.
Texas fits that bill exactly. Venture funding to startups in the Lone Star State jumped 105% between 2020 and 2021 — from $5 billion to $10.3 billion — per Crunchbase data. Last year, Texas startups saw about the same — actually, a little 1% uptick — which is especially notable since Texas’ venture economy trails only that of the big three states.


“It was an interesting year here,” said Morgan Flager, managing partner at Austin-based Silverton Partners, which has more than $500 million under management. “It was kind of a year of two halves. The first half was definitely a carry-over from 2021.
“The second half softened,” he added.
Not surprisingly, the two biggest rounds — Securonix raising $1 billion and Elon Musk’s The Boring Company landing $675 million — both happened in the first half of last year.
While Texas has welcomed its share of big tech companies in recent years including Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Oracle, Flager said the tech ecosystem can still continue to grow in the state — although perhaps not at the same pace places like Austin have grown in recent years thanks in part to COVID and other cultural shifts.
Health care IT, fintech and enterprise software are all leading upward-trending growth, along with a significant influx of talent over the years.
“I don’t feel like we’ll take a step back,” he said. “There are too many tailwinds. But it will be interesting to see what happens to the pace.
“A place like Austin cannot continue to have increases in its population like what happened in 2021,” Flager added. “But it’ll still grow.”

Are SPACs Back? Freightos Marks First Expected Listing Of 2023,Gené Teare,2023/01/25,"

After a serious drought in public listings in 2022, Israel-based freight booking platform Freightos is preparing to go public via a deal with a special-purpose acquisition company on Thursday in what would be the first SPAC merger to list this year.

With companies continuing to struggle to raise late-stage capital in the private markets, it’s likely some others will look to SPACs — which have committed investors — as a way to bridge the gap.
Freightos CEO Zvi Schreiber
“We’re going public primarily as a way of raising money,” Freightos CEO Zvi Schreiber told Crunchbase News prior to listing. “It’s not because we are trying to exit or sell shares, or be in a hurry to be a public company. It’s a good way to raise capital right now.”
Jerusalem-based Freightos is valued at $500 million and raised around $80 million via the listing. The company had announced its merger with Denver-based Gesher Acquisition Corp. (Nasdaq: GIAC) on May 31, 2021. As part of the merger, Gesher CEO Ezra Gardner will join Freightos’ board.
“A SPAC is actually superior from my perspective to an IPO,” Schreiber said, as “it’s bringing us high-quality long-term investors who are going to be real partners.”
One of those investors is London-based M&G Investments, which — along with other leading investors as well as executives and employees — agreed to a two-year lockup, with some unlocking at six months, one year and 18 months. Unlike with an IPO process, Freightos’ leading SPAC investors have built a relationship with the company and are not investing with an eye for an IPO pop to make a quick return.
Prior to the SPAC listing, Freightos had raised $118 million, according to Crunchbase data. Its leading investors include Qatar Airways, FedEx, the Singapore Stock Exchange and the American-Israeli venture capital firms Aleph and MoreVC.
Streamlining container shipments
Freightos aims to make booking large freight transport as streamlined as booking a flight. Part of the reason it’s taken so long for the freight industry to digitize is that “cargo doesn’t walk itself onto the plane and off the plane and through customs,” said Schreiber.
Freightos has built not just a price comparison, but also a routing engine, he said.
Its platform brings together three parts of the ecosystem: The importer and exporters, the freight forwarders who handle the cargo, and the carriers — the airlines and ocean liners.
Freightos is multinational with its biggest offices in Jerusalem, Barcelona and Romala in the Palestinian territories. Its revenue in 2022 was around $20 million, according to the company. It expects booking in 2023 to be over $1 billion.

Blockchain Developer QuickNode Raises $60M,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/01/25,"

Web3 developer platform QuickNode announced on Wednesday it closed $60 million in Series B funding. The round was led by 10T Holdings with participation from Protocol Labs, Tiger Global Management and Seven Seven Six. The company is now valued at $800 million.
The Miami-based startup’s recent round comes on the heels of its $35 million Series A raise in 2021. In the span of a year, QuickNode grew its user base 400% and currently provides infrastructure for 16 blockchains. 

The tangled web of Web3
The buzzy world of Web3 has grown since Ethereum co-founder Gavid Wood uttered the word in 2014 to describe a future of the internet that would entirely exist on the blockchain. 
In 2022, U.S.-based startups in the Web3 space raised around $2.3 billion, the sector’s best year ever and more than double what it raised in 2021, despite every other industry facing a sharp funding pullback. Web3 has led to the rise of companies like Block.one, a blockchain technology developer that raised $4.1 billion since it started in 2016. 
But the industry is facing a far more hostile reality today. Funding for Web3 startups nosedived by 74% in fourth-quarter 2022. FTX, the crypto trading network that raised billions of dollars only to go bankrupt in a public collapse, was one of several blockchain-related companies to struggle last year. 
Despite this, QuickNode said its revenue grew 300% in the last year. And in a statement, CEO Alex Nabutovsky called the road to Web3 inevitable.
“The industry is about to enter its next era, and with this raise, we are preparing for mass adoption of blockchain technology in 2023 and throughout the rest of the decade,” Nabutovsky said. “We are proud to help our customers scale to their full potential and move the industry forward.”

"Here Are The Robot Startups Getting Funded, Even As Investors Pull Back",Joanna Glasner,2023/01/25,"

Everyone still wants a robot to do their most tedious, taxing and dangerous jobs. But lately, investors are less keen on funding startups that could deliver on that vision.
With venture funding down sharply in recent months to virtually every technology sector, robotics has not been spared. Per Crunchbase data, investment in robotics-focused startups in 2022 was down 44% from the prior year.

It was the second-lowest total in five years, as illustrated in the chart below:


On a quarterly basis, funding has declined sequentially as well. To illustrate, we chart out totals for the past five quarters and 2023 to date below:
 


Yet while the funding tallies may be down, buzz around the robotics space remains high. As employers in industries from retail to hospitality to health care struggle to attract human workers at prevailing wages, the situation is fueling a raft of startups developing labor-saving robotics technologies.
Bucking the trend
Even in the last few months, when investment was down most sharply, a number of intriguing companies secured large rounds, including:

Locus Robotics, a warehouse robotics company that manufactures autonomous mobile robots to support e-commerce, raised $117 million in a November Series F round.
AMP Robotics, a developer of AI-guided robots and infrastructure for the waste and recycling industry, picked up $91 million in a November Series C financing.
Verdant Robotics, developer of an autonomous system for spraying and laser weeding, along with digital crop modeling, pulled in $46.5 million in a November Series A.

Demand for robotics technologies also remains high. North American robot sales in the first nine months of 2022 reached record levels, according to the Association for Advancing Automation, with expectations we will see the highest number of robots sold in a year for the second year in a row.
Although the automotive industry accounts for the majority of purchases, A3 attributed recent quarterly sales increases to other sectors too. Much of the interest comes from industries experiencing ongoing labor shortages, including restaurants, retail, construction and agriculture.
Robots are poised to take on tasks such as drywall finishing, shelf-scanning, food preparation and service, and fruit picking. Theoretically, that would free up humans to do jobs that the robots can’t do.
Exit climate in flux
For a while, venture investor enthusiasm around robotics’ potential was starting to spill into public markets. During the IPO and SPAC boom of 2021, a number of companies in the space launched offerings.
To date, performance has been mixed and mostly not good. The exception is Procept BioRobotics, a surgical robotics company focused on prostate surgery, which looks like the star performer, with a $1.8 billion market cap.
Several that went public via SPAC have fared less well. This includes Nauticus Robotics, a developer of undersea robotics technology, and Vicarious Surgical, a surgical robot developer, which are both trading for a fraction of their offer price. Berkshire Grey, a developer of robotics technology for e-commerce and logistics that carried out one of the higher profile debuts, was recently trading below $1 per share.
Acquirers, however, are snapping up robotics companies too. The biggest headline generator, of course, was Amazon’s summer announcement of a $1.7 billion planned acquisition of publicly traded iRobot, best known for its Roomba robot vacuums. Also in the past couple years, agriculture-focused robotics upstart Bear Flag Robotics sold to John Deere, and Fetch Robotics, a developer of warehouse robotics, sold to Zebra Technologies.
Meanwhile, Miso Robotics, best known for its Flippy burger-flipping robot, is testing the waters with a planned micro public offering that would raise around $15 million.
Even if they haven’t been the steadiest public market performers, it’s hard not to root for a rebound in robotic startup fortunes. In a world where most of us want to live well without working ourselves into the ground, that ideal looks a lot more realistic assuming a growing role for labor-saving robots of all stripes.

"
Companies That Raised Money In 2021 Are More Likely To See Layoffs,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/01/25,"

Can we predict layoffs?
With data, maybe.
During the first week of January, Carbon Health CEO Eren Bali announced on Twitter the company would lay off around 200 people. Days later, according to Crunchbase data, the health care startup announced it closed a $100 million Series D round.

Carbon Health’s news follows a similar pattern we have seen in 2021 and 2022 layoffs compiled by Crunchbase. After companies raised two massive rounds in the span of a few months, layoffs followed the next year.
“There was this growth-at-any-cost mindset where the main thing that was being rewarded in a venture-backed company’s ability to raise at a high valuation was revenue growth,” said Healy Jones, an executive at startup consulting firm Kruze Consulting. “That’s all people cared about.”
You thought 2022 was bad? Brace yourself.
When I asked startup hiring experts what we can expect from layoffs in 2023, Continuum founder Nolan Church told me: “I think we’re going to double what we have done so far.”
That’s a bleak assertion, given 2022 ended with more than 107,000 job cuts to the U.S. tech sector. The new year has just started, and 2023 is already almost a third of the way there.ore than 30,000 people have been laid off from the tech industry in the U.S. so far in January, according to Crunchbase data. We’re likely to see as many staff cuts this month as in November 2022, when layoffs peaked.
Church, whose company acts as a consulting agency for tech startups, is not the only one to make that prediction. Tech startup consultants say layoffs are likely to rise in 2023, in part due to how many startups raised massive amounts of money in 2021 at high valuations that cannot raise in today’s fiscal environment.
“What founders are thinking about right now is that we need to grow into that valuation in order to justify our existence. And that’s where the rubber is meeting the road,” Church said. “If you raised during this boom period, call it August of 2020 through Q1 of 2022, you likely have a valuation that you cannot yet justify.”
According to my analysis of startups that performed layoffs between September and December last year, the majority of companies announced raises in Q3 and Q4 of 2021.


In 2021, a golden age in private market funding, startups raised huge amounts of capital at high valuations. Now, the market is at a standstill — companies don’t want to raise down rounds, lest they lose their precious valuations, and venture firms aren’t willing to invest large sums of money in 2023.
That has contributed to an onslaught of layoffs in the tech industry. While the majority of laid-off tech workers came from public companies such as Salesforce 1, Amazon and Microsoft, private startups account for around 60% of the companies on our Layoffs Tracker that have slashed their workforces.
Late-stage companies most at risk
“The companies that I’m most worried about are the ones that raised massive amounts of money at high valuations in early 2021, because those companies have huge valuations hanging over their necks,” said Jones. “Valuations have come down so much that even if those companies have grown their revenue, they may not actually be worth as much as what they raised at the last round.”
Let’s look at a few examples.
Gopuff, a Pennsylvania-based food delivery startup, raised a $1 billion Series H round in July 2021, four months after securing $1.2 billion in Series G funding, per Crunchbase News. The following January, the company announced its first layoff. It has since cut its workforce by around 2,300 employees over the course of three rounds of layoffs.
Another, fintech platform, Chime, raised $750 million in Series G funding in August 2021. By the following November, it had cut 156 people from its staff.


“For pre-IPO tech, early stage is going to continue moving,” Church said. “Late stage will continue to be in a [hiring] freeze until their valuation makes sense in today’s world.”

"
Web3 Weekly: SEC Doing No Favors For Crypto Industry,Chris Metinko,2023/01/25,"

This is a weekly feature that will look back at the week that was in crypto, blockchain and Web3, and offer insights and analysis. Check out our previous column here.
It’s no secret that the relationship between the Securities and Exchange Commission and the crypto industry is akin to that of a dog and a feral cat.
However, an interesting report by The Wall Street Journal further illustrates that frayed relationship and the fact that the SEC will not make it any easier for crypto to break out of its tailspin.

According to the story, the SEC did not give approval for public listings to crypto-focused companies such as Bullish Global, Circle Internet Financial and eToro. The companies all were looking to go public through mergers with special-purpose acquisition companies.
While the SEC did not stop any of the firms from merging, the slow pace of the review process and extensive questioning seemed to hurt their efforts to list, per the report.
Circle’s plight
Boston-based Circle’s effort to go public certainly caught our eye before finally reaching its long, winding conclusion last month.
Circle’s proposed merger with blank-check firm Concord, which is backed by former Barclays boss Bob Diamond, has been its own long and winding story.
The company — an issuer of USD Coin, a type of stablecoin — announced in July 2021 it would merge with Concord in a deal that would value the company at $4.5 billion. However, USD Coin’s circulation quickly doubled and, in February of last year, Circle terminated its previously announced merger agreement and agreed to new terms that doubled the crypto company’s valuation to $9 billion. 
That deal was expected to close last month, but instead the company called off its proposed merger agreement.
According to the report, the SEC raised more than 100 questions with Circle’s disclosures about the SPAC agreement.
Again, none of this comes as a surprise, but it is significant. VCs and other institutional Investors are likely more wary than ever about backing crypto startups. If it becomes clear one of the paths to a liquidity event is blocked by an agency such as the SEC, the appetite to invest in the space becomes even less.
In a market where it likely will be hard to raise funding for crypto-focused startups, the SEC’s actions may increase that difficulty level even slightly more.

"
Technology As An Empowering Force Is Lead Theme For Consumer Electronics Show,Guest Author,2023/01/25,"

By Jonathan ‘Yoni’ Frenkel 
It’s still the early days of 2023, and many of us are curious about what technology trends will impact our lives.
In exploring this idea, there was no better place to view the possibilities than the Consumer Electronics Show, held yearly in Las Vegas, which I attended in person the first week of January.
Traditionally, the conference has focused on consumer tech, but has grown to include a number of verticals such as content, media, early-stage companies and the metaverse (and extended reality).

This year, the inclusion of Web3 also showed up in different ways in many brands’ products.
The one consistent theme of the show, however, was technology as an empowering force.
While many of the technologies focused on finding real-world solutions (ex., digital health, wellness tech) for consumers, there were also hardware and software solutions which could empower creators in 2023.
From a VC’s perspective, Alexa Fund director Paul Bernard remarked via email that, “To invent on behalf of our customers, we’re investing in emerging trends across the metaverse, creator economy tools, XR, Web3 and so much more.”
Creator economy 2023
The newest video and audio gear featured at CES could help creators in producing higher-quality content, and there was a focus on panels relevant for creators.
The “Creator Economy and NFTs” panel featured conversation around how AI is helping empower creators and the use of technology to drive influencer and brand relationships.
Dylan Huey, a social media influencer who leads the University of Southern California influencer club, USC Reach, and spoke at the conference, noted in an email that:
“Attending and speaking at CES as a creator was beneficial as today brands and creators are merging, and creators are the CEOs of their brand. … As such, this show gave creators access to new hardware and software around AR, VR, gaming, AI and the metaverse which support content creation.”

Jonathan ‘Yoni’ Frenkel is a content strategist and founder of YKC Media, an agency which works with VCs, corporate executives and startup founders. He most recently wrote about The United Nations Global Assembly and Clinton Global Initiative for Crunchbase News.

Amazon Rolls Out $5-A-Month Pharmacy Subscription That May Not Save Money,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/01/24,"

Amazon continues to pave its way in the health care sector.
The company announced on Tuesday it launched a $5 monthly subscription for Prime users that allows them to access around 50 generic medications to treat over 80 common health problems like anxiety, bacterial infections and high blood pressure.

The membership benefit, RxPass, is another notch on the belt for the e-commerce and cloud giant as it continues to establish itself in the health care world. It launched Amazon Clinic, a telehealth offering akin to a low-urgency urgent care, back in November. The company also acquired telehealth startup One Medical in July.
“Over the last decade as a practicing pulmonologist, I have seen patients with chronic diseases struggle to get access to the basic medications they need to live their lives well,” said Dr. Vin Gupta, chief medical officer at Amazon Pharmacy. “Navigating insurance can be a maze and getting to the pharmacy a burden. Sometimes that has led to poor outcomes: New medications don’t get filled, refills don’t get picked up, and patients suffer.”
Pharmacies are not moneymakers
In 2022, over $900 million was poured into the pharmacy startup space in an attempt to turn a profit in an area of health care that makes surprisingly little money. Pharmacies operate on razor-thin margins, in part because generic drugs cost pharmacists more money than insurance companies are willing to pay. Filling generic prescriptions at a loss is leading to the downfall of the local pharmacy and forcing companies like CVS and Walgreens to lean on drug store purchases to offset the cost of running pharmacies.


Given that the pharmacy model is inherently low-profit, it’s hard to see how RxPass will save customers money at no cost to Amazon. Like other popular pharmacy-related companies (think The Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Co. and GoodRx), users won’t be able to use RxPass along with their insurance. That will run patients $60 a year on generic medications that cost around $5 for a 30-day supply, on top of a $139 yearly Prime subscription.

"
Do The Best Startups Really Get Funded During Bad Times?,Chris Metinko,2023/01/24,"

Chat with any venture capitalist about the current down market and their talking point is always the same — great companies get funded during downturns.
But is that really true?
It does seem odd that when the economy slows and VCs pull back on their checkbooks, they all of the sudden are able to sort the wheat from the chaff. However, the theory is that during tough times, great companies will rise to the top and investors will do more due diligence and leg work to find them.

That sounds good and makes a certain amount of sense, but does it actually play out? Did great companies get the biggest fundings when the market tanked during the global crisis of 2008-09? Or did VCs actually back their fair share of washouts just like any other time?
Running a quick search of Crunchabse’s data for the largest rounds raised by U.S.-based startups between mid-2007 and mid-2009 gives us a glimpse at all the “great” startups that got funded during the previous downturn.
The top 10 rounds from the last downturn
Here is a quick rundown of the 10 biggest rounds from that era:
The two biggest rounds in that 24-month period were two $300 million Series Ds — one to gaming studio ZeniMax and the other to solar power startup Nanosolar.
Those two companies’ stories turned out about as differently as one can imagine.
Media company ZeniMax is best known as the publisher of the Fallout gaming series and many others games — and for winning a lawsuit against Oculus for copyright and trademark violations. Less than three years ago, Microsoft announced it would acquire ZeniMax and all its subsidiaries for $7.5 billion.
Nanosolar’s story turned out very different — as did the tales of most solar companies from that time (which we’ll get further into). The San Jose, California-based startup developed a low-cost printable solar cell manufacturing process. But, after the financial crisis, prices for solar panels made of crystalline silicon plummeted. By 2013, Nanosolar’s competitive advantage evaporated and it had laid off most of its workforce and was soon gone.
Austin, Texas-based HomeAway comes up next with the third-largest round during that time — a $250 million Series D. The startup was a pioneer in the vacation rental marketplace. It actually went public just after the downturn, and was later bought for $3.9 billion in cash and stock by Expedia. HomeAway also made several acquisitions, with its best known likely Vrbo.
Coming in fourth is none other than Facebook, as Meta was called then. The then-social media-focused company raised a $240 million Series C. It also took in the eighth-largest round during that period — a $200 million Series D. The company went public in 2012 and is still one of the most valuable tech companies in the world.
Fifth and sixth on the list  are companies still with us today. Financial services and data company Amherst Holdings raised $225 million, as did communications infrastructure provider Zayo Group. Zayo actually went public in 2014 and was bought five years later by EQT Partners and Digital Colony Partners for $8.2 billion in cash.
The seventh-largest round was raised by yet another solar power company and one that is synonymous with the era — but not for the best of reasons. Solyndra raised a $220 million Series E during the downturn. The startup was hailed as a champion of sustainable energy and  made copper indium gallium selenide solar cells. However, after the company received a $535 million U.S. Department of Energy loan guarantee under the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the government discovered major issues in both the company’s business practices and claims it made about its cells. About two years later the company filed for bankruptcy.
The startup that raised the ninth-largest round did not fare much better. Better Place, a battery charging and switching service for electric cars, raised a $200 million Series A. While based in Palo Alto, California, the company actually opened its first charging station in Israel in 2008. However, the world was not quite ready for charging stations and electric cars. The company ran into financial struggles trying to grow its market, and with expensive charging and swapping infrastructure. It would be bankrupt by 2013.
And lastly, No. 10 was Iowa-based Renewable Energy Group. The company raised a Series C worth about $125 million in 2008. About four years later, the company went public and proved there was a market for sustainable energy after all. Just last year, energy titan Chevron bought Renewable for about $3 billion.
Looking ahead
Looking at the top rounds for U.S.-based startups does show some titanic successes, but also some colossal failures that were bankrupt just a few years after taking in their big rounds.
However, a .700 batting average is amazing in baseball, so perhaps in a market slowdown venture capitalists and others really are able to find the right companies to pick. At least for the most part. If we do enter another massive downturn, investors will undoubtedly also find the next Solyndra.

Tiger Catnapped As 2022 Wore On,Chris Metinko,2023/01/24,"

During the venture capital heydays of 2021, few firms were more front and center than Tiger Global, leading huge growth rounds and minting new unicorns on what seemed a weekly basis.
However, just as the venture market significantly slowed, Tiger also quietly decelerated dealmaking in the latter half of last year.

The firm dramatically pulled back as the venture market continued to decline every month. In the last six months of 2022, Tiger only took part in 45 deals, with those rounds totaling less than $2.5 billion, according to Crunchbase data (it’s Important to note the amount any investor — including Tiger — invests as a specific stake in a round is not usually divulged).


In the final quarter of last year, Tiger only participated in 17 funding deals that totaled about $900 million, per Crunchbase.
That dealmaking pace pales in comparison to the third quarter of 2021 when it participated in 83 deals worth a combined $17.5 billion or even the first quarter of last year when the crossover giant took part in 136 deals that totaled $14.1 billion.
Tiger also pulled back on rounds it led or co-led compared to the high times of 2021. Last year, the firm led or co-led 180 funding rounds that totaled $11.5 billion — far off its pace in 2021 when it led or co-led 223 rounds totaling a whopping $30 billion.
Despite the pullback and slowdown, Tiger did lead or co-lead some significant rounds last year, including:

In March, it co-led a $768 million Series E for Turkey-based delivery service Getir.
In January, it co-led a Series D worth approximately $524 million for Paris-based fintech startup Qonto.
In April, Tiger led a $350 million venture round for San Francisco-based blockchain firm NEAR.

Market woes
While the drop in investment pace and value of those rounds is eye-catching, it is not all that surprising. The salad days of 2021 seem like they are likely an aberration and not the norm of what venture capital can expect moving forward.
Tiger, known for minting unicorns Brex, Coinbase and Peloton, was one of the first big-spending investors to warn of a market downturn when reports emerged in February 2022 it would pull back from the private market.
Soon after that, other big-named investors such as Y Combinator, Sequoia Capital and SoftBank all issued warnings about the private market and also said pullbacks were likely.
Last June, Crunchbase reported that as of the end of the first quarter of 2022, Tiger had revised its private equity business down by around 9% to $58 billion, from a previously reported $64 billion at the end of 2021.
That same month, Bloomberg reported Tiger’s hedge fund business had taken a hit, losing 52% for the year due to the massive tech selloff after the firm reportedly invested heavily in tech giants such as Snowflake and Carvana.

Microsoft Agrees To Multibillion-Dollar Deal With OpenAI,Chris Metinko,2023/01/23,"

Microsoft confirmed Monday it has agreed to a “multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment” into OpenAI, the startup behind the artificial intelligence tools ChatGPT and DALL-E.
The deal has been rumored for weeks. While the exact dollar amount was not confirmed, Semafor reported earlier this month that Microsoft was in talks to invest as much as $10 billion.
The deal follows a $1 billion investment in 2019 from Microsoft into the AI startup. That deal made Microsoft’s Azure the exclusive provider of cloud computing services to OpenAI. 

“We formed our partnership with OpenAI around a shared ambition to responsibly advance cutting-edge AI research and democratize AI as a new technology platform,” said Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft. “In this next phase of our partnership, developers and organizations across industries will have access to the best AI infrastructure, models and toolchain with Azure to build and run their applications.”
Microsoft is in a battle for AI dominance with other tech giants such as Alphabet and Amazon.
Big money for AI
Earlier this month The Wall Street Journal reported the startup could be valued at $29 billion thanks to a new tender offer.
Venture firms Thrive Capital and Founders Fund were reported to be in talks to invest in the offer that would have allowed them to buy shares from existing OpenAI shareholders.
OpenAI had been valued at $14 billion during a tender offer in 2021.

The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Pathalys Pharma Lands $150M; Impel Drives Away With $104M,Chris Metinko,2023/01/20,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.
This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.

After a strong start to the year, this week slowed down. No round came close to $200 million, and only three rounds hit the $100 million mark. Health care and biotech were big again, as well as a startup that uses AI (it’s everywhere) to help people buy a car.
1. Pathalys Pharma, $150M, biotech: Raleigh, North Carolina-based Pathalys Pharma is the latest health/biotech startup to raise a big round this year. The late-stage biopharma startup raised $150 million through what it called “a combination of secured product financing and equity to support the two phase 3 clinical trials, registration efforts and pre-commercialization activities for upacicalcet” — which is used to treat hyperparathyroidism. Abingworth was the lead investor. Simultaneously, the company and Launch Therapeutics also announced a collaboration to advance phase 3 clinical trials for the drug. Founded in 2021, Pathalys has raised $150 million to date, according to the company.
2. Impel, $104M, automotive: AI is everywhere right now, so why not car buying? New York-based  digital engagement startup Impel landed $104 million in growth investment led by Silversmith Capital Partners with additional investment from Wavecrest Growth Partners. The startup offers an AI-powered customer engagement platform for the auto industry. Impel claims to have played a role in $2 billion worth of car sales since its inception in 2011. With so much data generated about buying cars — especially with so many buying cars online — Impel is able to use artificial intelligence to target customers with personalized messaging. Founded in 2011, the company has raised $130 million, according to Crunchbase.
3. Mill, $100M, environmental consulting: Mill was founded in 2020 by former smart home darling Nest alums. The San Bruno, California-based startup is on a mission to eliminate all waste, and in an effort to do that are asking people to buy a $33 monthly subscription for a 2-foot tall kitchen bin that “dries, shrinks and de-stinks,” as Bloomberg reports. That same report also revealed Mill has raised multiple funding rounds from investors like Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Energy Impact Partners, and has raised more than $100 million — but would not release an exact dollar figure.
4. SetPoint Medical, $80M, health care: Another health-related company cracks the top 5. Valencia, California-based clinical-stage health care startup SetPoint Medical raised $80 million in a preferred stock financing co-led by new investors Norwest Venture Partners and Viking Global Investors. The company is developing a treatment for chronic, inflammation-mediated autoimmune diseases with a focus on treating rheumatoid arthritis. Founded in 2006, the company has raised $344 million, per Crunchbase.
5. Vannevar Labs, $75M, national security: Defense startups seem to be having a moment. Drone companies that help with national security have raised money recently, and late last yearAnduril locked up a Series E worth nearly $1.5 billion that values the company at $8.5 billion. That nearly doubles the company’s previous valuation in June 2021. Palo Alto, California-based national security tech developer Vannevar Labs is the latest after raising a $75 million Series B led by Felicis 1. Founded in 2019, Vannevar Labs has now raised more than $90 million, per the company.
6. Outrider, $73M, logistics: Golden, Colorado-based Outrider, a software developer that allows for autonomous yard operations for logistics hubs, closed a $73 million Series C financing led by FM Capital. Founded in 2017, Outrider says it has raised $191 million to date.
7. Cloudian, $60M, cloud storage: San Mateo, California-based cloud storage startup Cloudian closed a $60 million new funding round from several investors, including the likes of Intel Capital and Silicon Valley Bank. Founded in 2011, Cloudian has now raised $233 million, according to the company.
8. ADARx Pharmaceuticals, $46M, biotech: San Diego-based ADARx Pharmaceuticals, a clinical stage biotech startup developing RNA-targeting therapeutics, raised a $46 million Series B-1 led by Ascenta Capital. Founded in 2019, the company has raised $132 million to date, according to Crunchbase.
9. MacroFab, $42M, manufacturing: Houston-based cloud manufacturing platform developer MacroFab raised $42 million led by Foundry. Founded in 2013, MacroFab has raised a total of $82 million, per the company.
10. Sublime Systems, $40M, energy: Somerville, Massachusetts-based Sublime Systems, a developer of decarbonized cement, closed a $40 million Series A led by Lowercarbon Capital. It’s the company’s first funding, per Crunchbase.
Big global deals
Despite some big rounds from U.S.-based startups this week, the three largest all came from abroad.

India-based PhonePe, a mobile payment application, raised a $350 million venture round.
China-based GenScript ProBio, a biopharmaceutical R&D and production platform, raised a $220 million Series C.
London-based electric vehicle manufacturer One Moto closed a venture round worth approximately $152 million.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of Jan. 14 to 20. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

"
Restive Fintech Report Points To More Regulation In A Slower Funding Climate,Gené Teare,2023/01/20,"

Restive Ventures, a seed fintech investor, released its State Of Fintech 2023 report to support founders as they head into the new year. Its notable findings include a more active regulatory environment which protects consumers in the wake of the FTX collapse as well as supporting competition. The report also points to a tighter Series A funding environment and an increased appetite for partnering from incumbents. 
Restive invests at pre-seed and seed in fintechs, and  provides operational expertise in the regulated industry. Among its founder-focused activities are an annual founder trip to Washington, D.C., to meet with regulators, and speed dating events with industry partners.
“If you raise a seed round in this climate, assume that it’s going to be very hard to raise an A,” according to the report.

Drawn from a survey of fintech seed investors, the report put average pre-seed valuations at around $9 million, while average seed values are now down around 50% — at $12 million. But the range is still wide. Tucked into this finding is that multiple seed rounds are perceived negatively by some investors. For these investors, raising further seed rounds instead of meeting milestones for a Series A suggests a startup is not reaching product market fit. 
More regulation
There is a shift in the regulatory environment from “innovation” to “enforcement,” according to the report. 
We spoke with Cameron Peake, a partner at the firm, on Restive’s findings around seed valuations, the increased interest in M&A, and the complex regulatory environment in 2023.
Restive partners Ryan Falvey, Cameron Peake, Tyler Griffin
Regulators are moving from“pushing innovation as an agenda item to wanting to ensure that there’s fair competition,” said Peake. They are making sure that both “customer protection and the ability for upstarts to play within broader spaces is protected.” 
A new focus is regulation around banking as a service. 
“Providing services to outside parties and the bank being the chartered institution just was never considered within the regulation,” said Peake, as previously, regional banks had vendor relationships but were not supporting fintechs with consumers using its services. 
“Regulators are posing hard questions about consumer data and are seeking to understand where risk actually lies in the three-way relationships among fintechs, BaaS providers, and the actual regulated bank,” stated the report.
Partnering
One bright spot in the report is that major banks, insurance and traditional payment companies are keen to partner with fintechs, with 80% expecting partnerships to increase in 2023. And as the IPO market has narrowed and private valuations have come down, interest in acquisitions has increased. “A lot of these outdated systems are just ripe for M&A,” said Peake. 
Looking forward to 2023
The areas Peake is excited about in 2023 include financial infrastructure due to “outdated infrastructure that exists across these legacy financial institutions,” she said. 
More work needs to be done on compliance workflows around billing management, Peake said. One hot topic is digitizing payments for industries that have not yet migrated, such as payment solutions for school districts and their vendors.

"
Unicorn Valuations Are On The Chopping Block,Gené Teare,2023/01/20,"

The ranks of The Crunchbase Unicorn Board have swelled in the past two years, adding almost 1,000 new companies and trillions of dollars in reported value. But now, as private company valuations go through a hard reset in a tough market, the board faces a reckoning.
Since the beginning of 2021, 925 companies have been added to the Unicorn Board and more than $400 billion was invested in those unicorns. But many of those same companies that raised in 2021 and the first half of 2022 will find their valuations — even just 18 months after their most recent funding — are too high in the current economy.

Of the 1,433 companies on the board, more than 1,100 — or 78% — had their valuations set in the past two years. Those companies with new valuations represent almost three quarters of the entire board’s total value.
Keep in mind, our  Unicorn Board reflects disclosed valuations tied to a priced funding event — not other valuations, such as those set in an internal event via a 409a valuation, or when investors revalue their portfolios via writedowns. (That’s why, for example, the board still lists Stripe’s valuation at $95 billion, although the payments company has reportedly reset its internal valuation to $63 billion — the third time in fewer than 12 months it has trimmed its valuation.)
According to Forge, a private securities marketplace, investors are purchasing private company stock on the secondary market at a median discount of 50.5% compared to their most recent funding. If that discount were applied across the Unicorn Board, 821 companies — or 57% of the companies on the board  — would drop off, and the value of the board would decline to $2.4 trillion from its current total valuation of $4.9 trillion.


Unicorns reset expectations
The funding environment has changed swiftly after a heady couple of years.
Valuations at 10x forward ARR in 2021 became “100x, 200x, and 400x multiples,” Tomasz Tunguz, previously a partner at Redpoint and now raising his own fund, wrote on his blog in April 2022.
Now, we’re seeing internal valuations revised downward — often drastically — for highly valued unicorns. Many companies are quietly raising extension rounds from existing investors, while those unable to do so sometimes crash and shut down. (That was the case with self-driving car technology company Argo AI, which shut down in the fourth quarter of 2022 after being unable to raise fresh capital).
In July 2022, Klarna lost $39 billion in value, plummeting from a $45 billion valuation to $6.7 billion in a new funding round.
Boston-based OutSystems, a low-code engineering platform, was valued at $9.5 billion in February 2021. It quietly raised funding eight months later, led by existing investor KKR —  more than halving its valuation to $4.3 billion, according to Forbes.
And Oda, a door-to-door grocery delivery service based in Norway, was valued below a billion dollars in a December fundraising, dropping from the unicorn ranks entirely.
Crypto companies are also facing a harsh new reality. Crypto exchange FTX, valued at $32 billion in a January 2022  funding, is valued at nothing. Other crypto unicorns in bankruptcy proceedings include crypto wealth management platform BlockFi and blockchain lending platform Celsius Network.
The reset is here
While the stampede of companies joining the board has slowed to a trickle, it will be difficult to decipher the new valuations for current unicorn companies in 2023.
Companies that can avoid raising funding will do so. Many unicorn companies are opting for debt or convertible notes to avoid being revalued. Others are raising extension rounds in which mostly existing investors add capital, and values might not be disclosed as readily as those unicorn rounds.
All that adds up to a lot of uncertainty — and some dubious rankings — in the year ahead.

The Crunchbase Unicorn Board is a curated list that includes private unicorn companies with post-money valuations of $1 billion or more and is based on Crunchbase data. New companies are added to the Unicorn Board as they reach the $1 billion valuation mark as part of a funding round.
The unicorn board does not reflect internal company valuations — such as those set via a 409a process for employee stock options — as these differ from, and are more likely to be lower than, a priced funding round. We also do not adjust valuations based on investor writedowns, which change quarterly, as different investors will not value the same company consistently within the same quarter.
Funding to unicorn companies includes all private financings to companies that are tagged as unicorns, as well as those that have since graduated to The Exited Unicorn Board.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.

"
Psychedelic Therapy Is Now Legal In Oregon. Are Investors And Startups Ready?,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/01/20,"

In the past few years, investment in psychedelic startups has mostly focused on drug development in anticipation of Food and Drug Administration approval to use such substances to treat depression and anxiety.
But things haven’t exactly turned out that way.
Instead, Oregon has beaten the FDA to the punch, approving the legal use of psilocybin or “magic mushrooms” in a therapeutic setting. California and Colorado are expected to pass similar laws soon. Under the guidance of a therapist, adults can consume hallucinogenic mushrooms as a tool to reach their mental health goals.

This new opportunity hasn’t translated into startup funding yet. Pharmaceuticals ended 2022 with $143 million in funding globally, while ancillary services such as telehealth and administrative services received about $29 million.


According to Marik Hazan, founder of psychedelics investment firm Tabula Rasa, the industry in 2021 was heavily built around the expected (and repeatedly postponed) drug approval from the FDA.
“This would be a completely drug development-focused center,” Hazan said. “Then, people started talking much more about the fact that state-by-state [law] is actually going to matter a lot and it’s worth paying attention to.”
Hyping up pharmaceuticals
For a long time, the psychedelics industry was squarely focused on pharmaceutical companies.
At its peak in 2021, funding in the space reached more than $368 million, according to Crunchbase data. The majority of that funding went to biotech startups. Companies like COMPASS Pathways and MindMed received millions of dollars to create new drugs based on psychedelic compounds. Several drug-making startups launched into the public markets.
While funding has lagged behind on everything else — teletherapy services, guided meditation apps and wellness trackers — venture funding quickly course-corrected in 2021. The number of funding rounds dedicated to pharmaceutical companies and ancillary services began to see more parity in 2021.


That change was partially due to the space becoming overcrowded with redundant companies that promised the same thing.
But, even more importantly, the industry realized that psychedelics, when legalized, would require infrastructure services to work properly.
New therapy infrastructure
“There aren’t enough therapists in general. There are certainly not enough psychedelic therapists,” said Brom Rector, founder of psychedelic venture company Empath Ventures. “Somebody is going to make a lot of money by being the default training program for something like that.”
Companies such as Lumen and Fluence have popped up to train therapists. New York-based Fluence provides training and certification for therapists who want to use psychedelics in their practice. The company received its license to train therapists in Oregon back in October, ahead of the rollout.
Fluence was founded by psychologists Elizabeth Nielson, Ph.D, and Ingmar Gorman, Ph.D., both of whom are working on psychedelics clinical trials with the FDA. The platform’s certification program is led by psilocybin researchers and psychedelics-trained therapists.
“Fluence brings a history of experience training mental health professionals in research and community-based practice settings, and we look forward to supporting the growing field of psilocybin services in Oregon through this program,” Nielson said in a statement.
Paying for it
Despite Oregon legalizing psilocybin-assisted therapy, insurance will not cover it since magic mushrooms are still federally classified as a Schedule I drug.
So companies like Enthea have entered the space with a workaround. The Massachusetts-based startup raised $2 million in December for its platform, which helps people access psychedelic-assisted therapy as a workplace benefit. Dr. Bronner’s, a soap company and Enthea partner, is one of the first companies to offer ketamine-assisted therapy to its employees.
“These medicines, when they do become approved, are going to be expensive and most Americans won’t be able to pay out of pocket,” said Enthea’s CEO Sherry Rais. “If most Americans can’t even afford a $500 unexpected expense, how are they going to be able to pay for these medicines?”

Semafor To Buy Back Bankman-Fried’s Stake — Report,Chris Metinko,2023/01/20,"

New York-based news startup Semafor is looking to buy back Sam Bankman-Fried’s stake in the company as the disgraced FTX co-founder faces fraud charges, according to a New York Times report.

The company raised nearly $25 million before its launch in October, with Bankman-Fried’s stake being about $10 million, according to the report.
The company is looking to buy out Bankman-Fried’s ownership as it simultaneously raises new money, per the report. The startup expects to put the money in a separate account until it receives guidance from authorities on how to return the investment, Semafor co-founder and CEO Justin Smith told The Times.
Cutting ties
Semafor is one of only hundreds of startups Bankman-Fried and his affiliates invested in over the last few years. Many of those firms are now looking to get out of their entanglement with him and his now-bankrupt crypto exchange, FTX.
Media startups seem especially interested in cutting any ties with Bankman-Fried. Last month, ProPublica said it would return the initial $1.6 million it received in what was supposed to be a three-year, $5 million grant, from Bankman-Fried’s and his family’s Building a Stronger Future foundation. The non-profit newsroom said it would sever its relationship with the foundation.
Bankman-Fried is charged with eight criminal counts, including allegations of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. He was released from custody on $250 million bail last month.

"In Latest SPAC Twist, Shell Is Buying Volta For Less Than The Amount It Raised",Joanna Glasner,2023/01/20,"

Normally, if a still-operating startup gets acquired by a $210 billion company, venture backers are pretty happy with the outcome.
But in the case of electric vehicle charging network Volta, that doesn’t appear to be the case. Shell announced this morning that it will pay $169 million to buy the company, which went public via SPAC in 2021.
Prior to going public, Volta had raised over $275 million in venture funding, per Crunchbase data. The company raised another $300 million in financing tied to its public offering.

Like so many venture-backed companies that took the SPAC route to market, things didn’t go well. Shares were trading around 73 cents before today’s announcement, down 94% from their 2021 high.
Following the acquisition news, Volta stock was up over 23%. But while that’s a big percentage gain, it still only took the stock to 90 cents, a valuation roughly around the proposed purchase price.
Playing the eco card
For Shell, the planned purchase serves to buff its street cred as an eco-conscious company, a public image move that oil giants have pursued for a number of years even as their primary revenues still come from fossil fuels. The Wall Street Journal speculated that the deal could usher in a wave of acquisitions of cash-strapped companies that went public via SPAC in areas tied to vehicle charging, EV battery tech and other “green” technologies.
The acquisition follows sharp cuts at San Francisco-headquartered Volta, which operates an ad-supported business model featuring large screens beside charging stations at commercial locations. In the third quarter, the company cut U.S. full-time staff by 54% in what it described as a move to cut expenses.
Even with cuts, however, Volta was operating deeply in the red, with a net loss of $42.5 million in its last reported quarter. That was undoubtedly a contributing factor to the low share price and not-much-higher acquisition price.
At least venture backers can take solace in the fact that not every exit is a home run, and some money back is better than none. Volta’s largest venture stakeholder at time of SPAC deal announcement was Energize Ventures, the leader of its $125 million Series D round, with a 7.7% stake. Other backers include 40 North Ventures, Energy Impact Partners, and Activate Partners.
Investors who participated in the $300 million SPAC merger financing include Fidelity, BlackRock, and Neuberger Berman.

Sequoia Announces New $195M Seed Fund,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/01/20,"

We’re starting to see where all that dry powder is going.
After a relatively quiet year on the private markets, venture firms are getting back into the funding game. Sequoia, a long-standing venture capital firm, announced a new $195 million fund for seed-stage startups, according to Forbes.

This isn’t a bad strategy for the prolific venture firm, which was an early investor in Apple, Stripe and Instagram. The funding market is currently at a standstill as startups, in an urge to preserve their current sky-high valuations, are reluctant to raise down-rounds. Since investors aren’t willing to shell out funding at current value, funding news has been relatively quiet compared to the heyday of 2021.
But investing in seed-stage startups gives venture firms like Sequoia a chance to invest at market rate, without the baggage that has plagued the private market in 2022.
This new fund is a chance for Sequoia to dip its toes back into the funding stream, after a rough 2022. The firm had to send an apology letter to investors for its FTX crypto investment (which ended up filing for bankruptcy in November). Sequoia, which holds stock in many of its now-public investments, also saw stock prices tumble: Snowflake is sharing 41% lower than when it debuted, while DoorDash is sharing 71% lower than its debut stock price.
Some of that $195 million will be funneled into Arc, Sequoia’s seven-week long accelerator program that teaches first-time founders how to build a company. Arc started in 2022 with two batches, but in 2023 the firm plans to run three cycles and give each seed-stage company no more than $1 million to participate.
Firms like Sequoia are entering 2023 with around $1.3 trillion in dry powder, but without anywhere to go in a precipitous financial market. It’ll be interesting to see new solutions VCs build to remain active.

"Web3 Weekly: Funding Down, Crypto Up",Chris Metinko,2023/01/18,"

This is a weekly feature that will look back at the week that was in crypto, blockchain and Web3, and offer insights and analysis. Check out our previous column here.

The final funding numbers for Web3 startup from last year are in, and it doesn’t paint a rosy picture for founders in the space that may be looking to raise money this year.
Funding was down significantly and dropped like a rock in Q4.
That is not a shock considering the headlines surrounding crypto and the overall slowdown in venture capital right now. The FTX scandal alone would be enough to violently rock the crypto segment of the Web3 industry.
However, something weird also is happening on the crypto front. Both ether and bitcoin are at prices they have not seen since before FTX filed for bankruptcy. Bitcoin is now above $2,100 and ether is more than $1,500 — prices not seen since early November.
While it’s much too early to call it a rally, it does speak to the resiliency of crypto. All the negative news around FTX and the fighting between Genesis and Gemini, have not been able to slow crypto prices which have been on the rise since the start of the year.
As we talked about in the Web3 funding piece, it is hard to predict where funding will go this year, but a rising crypto market would not hurt how investors see the market and the risks they might want to take on young startups.

"Top Seed Trends Include Carbon Capture, Women’s Health And AI Productivity",Joanna Glasner,2023/01/18,"

Every so often at Crunchbase News, we read through all the most recent seed funding rounds in an effort to identify trends. And each time, we’re reminded how quickly founders find ways to turn emerging technologies and business concepts into new startups.
This most recent data foray was unusual in that for the first time in years, seed startups were raising capital during a known downturn. To underscore that point, we limited our sample 1 to companies funded in the past four months, when investment across all stages really took a downward turn.

Still, seed company formation and investment tends to be somewhat resilient to market cycles. And this time around we saw clusters of startups around themes that seem to have really gained traction in recent months.
So where is the activity on the rise? Out of numerous potential options, we narrowed our take down to four emerging themes: carbon capture, AI productivity tools, women’s health and hybrid work.
Without further ado, here’s what we’re seeing in each of these spaces:
 No. 1: Carbon capture
Entrepreneurial minds have long been focused on reducing carbon emissions. In recent months, their efforts manifested in funding seed-stage companies focused on better ways to capture, store and even create useful products from this all-too-abundant element.
Along these lines, we identified at least seven companies that collectively raised over $25 million in seed funding in the past four months. Below is the list:


The largest funding round — $8.7 million — went to Paebbl, a Scandinavian startup that combines captured carbon with abundantly available minerals to create a carbon-negative raw material.
Lithos Carbon, a Seattle startup developing carbon capture technology for farms, landed $6.3 million, while Carbon Re, a British company whose platform aims to reduce emissions from the cement industry, secured just over $5 million.
No. 2: AI productivity tools
We talk about artificial intelligence taking over jobs, but the unfolding reality looks a bit more mundane. In the foreseeable future, AI will likely save time and effort on workplace tasks, rather than eliminate entire positions, with the hoped-for result being higher productivity.
In furtherance of this vision, a bevy of newly seed-funded startups are jumping on the AI productivity tools bandwagon. We put together a list of seven that appear to fit this profile:


Tel Aviv-based Ask AI, the largest recent funding recipient, bagged $9 million in October for technology that aggregates company data from scattered sources and uses AI to synthesize concise, readable answers to questions.
Meanwhile Tymely, another Israeli company that raised $7 million, offers AI technology for e-commerce customer support emails. And SellScale, of Silicon Valley, which snagged $3.4 million in seed funding, uses AI to personalize email outreach efforts at scale for sales teams.
No. 3: Fertility and women’s health
Demand for women’s health care services continues to exceed supply, and the imbalance is only projected to grow.
In the U.S., the number of OB-GYNs is expected to decrease 7% by 2030, according to the Health Resources and Services Administration, with demand on track to increase 4%. Shortages vary widely by region, with the South and Midwest expected to see steeper shortages.
Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like startups can do much to expand the supply of specialists. However, they can make it easier to access women’s health and fertility-related care regardless of geography as well as connect people to specialized providers.
On both these fronts, we’ve seen a number of good-sized seed funding rounds in recent months. Using Crunchbase, we aggregated a list of five:


Minnesota-based Herself Health, a primary care practice for women 65 and up, was one of two companies that closed a $7 million seed round. The other was Los Angeles-based Almond, a mobile health and telehealth platform for obstetrics and gynecology.
No. 4: Hybrid work
To go into the office or to stay home? That is the question still vexing employers nearly three years after the pandemic shifted millions to work-at-home status.
In the attempt to create a happy medium, droves of employers have adopted hybrid models in which workers come into the office, but not every workday. That’s driven a mini boom in startups crafting tools to meet the needs of this hybrid workforce.
We put together a list of five companies in the hybrid work tools space that have raised seed funding in the past four months:


Kadence, a provider of desk-booking software for hybrid offices, led in funding with a $10 million December financing. Founders initially launched as a wireless charging startup called Chargify, but changed the business model and brand following the pandemic-driven shift in workplace culture.
Deskbird, another startup offering desk- and space-booking tools for hybrid workplaces, pulled in $6.5 million in a late September round.
An overarching theme: Progress behind the scenes
Having written these seed funding trend pieces over many years, I’ve noticed some overarching themes crop up repeatedly. In particular, seed-funded startups commonly want to lead consumers toward an increasingly digital life, where screens rather than physical location dictate what we can do.
That hasn’t gone away. This time around, however, I’d describe the broad theme differently. The seed-funded areas emerging lately, to grossly over-generalize, seem more involved with what I’d call progress behind the scenes.
What does that mean? Essentially, they’re not making products that a consumer will have to consciously decide to consume, like say a new device, food or eco-friendly home good. Rather, they’re working on the kinds of innovations that get quietly incorporated into existing products, services and industrial processes, without the end consumer having to do much.
By way of analogy, it’s kind of like airbags and seatbelts. While you have to decide to buy a car, airbags just got included in the package over time, making an existing product better and safer. This is kind of how the carbon capture idea works. Consumers won’t necessarily know, say, that the concrete used to pour their driveway was more sustainably produced. It’ll just be that way. Same goes for AI productivity. You won’t notice that the help desk is providing clearer advice or responding more quickly. It’ll just kind of happen.
If all goes according to plan, we might wind up in that best of all worlds place for innovation: Technological progress that provides benefits, without requiring end users to spend a lot more or learn a new system. Ideally, like airbags, these innovations will work when you need them but can be taken for granted the rest of time.

AI-Generated Car Buying? Impel’s New $104M Funding Drives Innovation,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/01/17,"

A $104 million growth investment is driving the automotive industry forward.

Impel, the New York-based digital engagement startup, announced on Tuesday it secured $104 million in growth investment. The fresh funding was led by Silversmith Capital Partners with additional investment from Wavecrest Growth Partners.
The startup offers an AI-powered customer engagement platform for the auto industry, allowing shoppers to have a more tactical car-buying experience online. The company says it had a hand in $2 billion worth of car sales since its inception in 2011. Impel works with around 100 partners in the automotive space and has spent its past two years growing its revenue by 100%.
The auto industry is hitting the gas on AI
Since around 2012, the car market has slowly inched further online and away from traditional dealerships. Prolific new-car companies like Tesla and Rivian operate with direct-to-consumer models, and companies like Carvana went public on the basis that it was easier to buy a car online.
The move toward clear pricing is part of a larger car-buying trend that has moved away from dealerships and negotiating with salespeople. According to a 2021 Cox Automotive study, “Consumers generally remain less likely to visit dealerships during the car buying process. The average buyer visits only two dealerships in the process, and relies more heavily on digital tools.”
But dealerships are catching up. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the process of showing inventory and buying quickly moved online.
Tapping into a trove of vehicle purchase data, Impel and companies like it are able to use artificial intelligence to target customers with personalized messaging. In 2021, vehicle giant Cox Automotive announced it created a used-car e-commerce platform that would use AI to suggest accurate price estimates to potential buyers.
Vroom, another online car-buying marketplace, acquired CarStory in 2022 for its predictive market data analysis that can determine a car’s value. Meanwhile, Ravin uses AI to virtually inspect cars for damage and price them instantly.

Buyers Call Bluff On Unicorn Valuations: Spread Between Asking Prices And Bids Widens On Secondary Markets,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/01/17,"

For several years, you couldn’t do better than to work at a tech startup.
Employees enjoyed competitive wages, luxurious benefits and valuable stock options as the tech startups they worked for swam in venture capital funding and valuations soared.
But those stock options aren’t as valuable anymore. At least not on the secondary market, where buyers and sellers can trade pre-IPO stock. In 2021, thanks to high valuations, employees could sell shares of the private companies they worked for at rather generous prices.

Now, the secondary market is calling companies’ bluff on those valuations.
The discrepancy between what sellers are asking for and what buyers are willing to pay (known as the bid-ask spread) on secondary markets platform Forge Global is around 22%, quelling what was previously lively and bustling trading activity, according to the company.
This has created a logjam of sorts. Forge Global and EquityZen, platforms that help people trade shares in private companies, have noticed trading activity become quieter.
“At the same time that you’ve got a lot of activity in sellers, the price that buyers are willing to pay in a period where public tech dropped precipitously has been challenging,” said Kelly Rodriques, CEO of Forge Global. “Trade volumes have come down dramatically.”
Now, stock owners must decide whether to sell shares for a lower price than they’d hoped for, or try to ride out the frosty market — a choice that comes with the risk that their companies will perform down rounds, or new financings at lower valuations.
Shares trade at half price
Many tech companies have performed mass layoffs and cut costs in the past year in an attempt to cling to their valuations.
But those valuations are all but worthless on the secondary market, where it’s all about what a buyer is willing to pay for a slice of a private company. In November, Forge Global saw companies trade at around 47% lower compared to valuations set with their most recent rounds of funding. EquityZen reported stocks were trading at an average of 40% lower.
“[That’s] some of the lowest discounts that we’ve seen,” said Akshata Bailkeri, head of research at EquityZen.
Laid-off tech workers looking to liquidate their assets amid a looming recession are not selling shares at the prices they were once able to. This has led to a stalemate between sellers and buyers that is a sharp turn from 2021, when activity on the secondary market bustled
“The secondary market was thriving a lot in 2021,” Bailkeri said. “When you see public market valuations go up, you can see that relative interest in these private companies in similar technology-related spaces also get that attention.”
Risking a down round
If sellers think they can hold on to their shares until the market picks up, that could quickly change if the startup lowers its valuation or raises a down round. But, “even with no down rounds, shares are trading at a steep discount,” according to Rodriques.
Down rounds make shares in the company less valuable, especially for common stockholders such as employees and founders.
“The people who are going to be most hurt are the people who have left and exercised their stock options at the super hot startup,” said Healy Jones, an executive at startup consulting firm Kruze Consulting. “When that down round happens, those people are going to be particularly in trouble.”
Some companies have already made peace with the fact that their peak valuations were just too high. Stripe cut its valuation by 40% in the span of six months. After flying at a lofty $39 billion in 2021, Instacart’s valuation has since dwindled to $10 billion. Klarna slashed its valuation from $45.6 billion to a mere $6.7 billion in January with new funding. Several other prominent companies announced down rounds in December.
But there is still hope for some companies with strong performance metrics. If they can hunker down through 2023, they may continue to grow into their valuations.
“If a company continues to perform … even if the market’s down, they can grow out of this within a year or two,” Rodriques said. “And that’s why you saw companies resisting raising capital if they didn’t have to in 2022.”
A return to normalcy
When will the secondary markets reset to normal?
First, the IPO window needs to reopen. Many of these startups are ready to go public. When there are too many sellers on the secondary markets, it’s difficult to sell shares at a higher price point.
Second, that 22% discrepancy needs to decrease. According to Forge Global, the market doesn’t trade well at bid-ask spreads above 11%, which is causing the current standoff between buyers and sellers.
And lastly, if companies are buying back their shares — or if their investors are buying more on the secondary market — that’s an indication the startup is in good shape and is worth buying, according to Rodriques.
But until then, buyers and sellers on the secondaries are at an impasse.
“Right now, because the IPO window is closed, there is an intense pressure building up around liquidity in the market,” said Rodriques. “And that’s been building for 12 months.”

Funding To Web3 Startups Plummets 74% in Q4,Chris Metinko,2023/01/16,"

While everything Web3-related dominated much of 2021 and the early part of last year, the end of 2022 showed a significant cooling of investor interest in the still young space.
The softening of the market is not unusual, considering the significant venture capital spending pullback witnessed globally and investors likely turning to more mature, proven industries. 

However, the crypto winter and shakiness of the digital asset market also undoubtedly drove investors in a different direction — something that likely will be exacerbated with the dramatic collapse of FTX.
The final quarter of last year proved the most brutal as funding fell a staggering 74% from the same quarter in 2021, dropping from $9.3 billion to just $2.4 billion, according to Crunchbase data. The total dollar amount also makes it the lowest quarterly total since just about $1 billion went to startups in Q4 2020. 


The fourth quarter continued a clear downward trend in investment in the space, as dealmaking dropped every quarter of last year. Deal flow also declined quarter by quarter in 2022, with only 327 funding deals being announced last quarter — compared to a staggering 677 in the first quarter of the year.
In Web3, Amber Group, Matter Labs, Uniswap and Mineplex were the only companies to announce rounds above $100 million last quarter, whereas Q4 2021 had 20 such rounds.
2021 vs. 2022
The overall numbers for the year paint a slightly better picture for startups that may be looking for funding in the new year.
Funding to VC-backed startups in Web3 fell by about about a fourth — from a record high of $29.2 billion in 2021 to about $21.5 billion last year.


Deal count remained pretty even, with a difference of fewer than 100 deals for the year. However, unlike 2021 when FTX, NYDIG and Robinhood raised rounds of $1 billion or more, 2022 saw no round nearly that size.
The largest rounds of 2022 per Crunchbase data were:

Brooklyn-based blockchain startup ConsenSys locked up a $450 million round at a valuation of over $7 billion in March led by ParaFi Capital — just about four months after its $200 million Series C. ConsenSys develops decentralized protocols software that runs on the ethereum network and allows developers and enterprises to build on Web3.
In February, India-based Polygon Technology, a scaling platform for the ethereum blockchain, closed a $450 million round led by Sequoia Capital India at a reported $13 billion valuation.
Miami-based Yuga Labs closed a $450 million “seed” round led by a16z crypto, valuing the company at $4 billion in March. Yuga Labs is best known for its Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection.
In April, Boston-based internet finance firm Circle Internet Financial raised a $400 million private equity round from BlackRock, Fidelity Management and Research, Marshall Wace and Fin Capital.

Two other startups also raised $400 million rounds this year in the sector — FTX and FTX US — and are likely prime reasons Web3 funding will have a hard time rebounding.
Overall, there were three dozen rounds in 2021 of $200 million or more that went to VC-backed Web3 startups, while last year saw only 25.
End of Web3?
It is easy to look at the total numbers, and especially the current downward trend, in Web3 funding and conclude the “Web3 fad” is over.
However, it is important to look at ventures overall. With VCs pulling back on their investment checks, many are looking for industries that have been proven out — not the hope of a new decentralized application or digital asset exchange.
Web3 is relatively new and many investors are not nearly as used to it as areas such as SaaS, enterprise software or traditional fintech. In uncertain times like now, many are likely to shy away instead of jump in with both feet.
The crypto winter and the rockiness in that market also has undoubtedly played a role. When VCs were pouring money into the sector, bitcoin was hitting highs at nearly $70,000. Now, crypto headlines are dominated by one of the greatest debacles in startup history — which everyone will watch play out this year in courtrooms.
That will not help Web3 funding, but the FTX debacle could start to separate the good from the bad in the crypto sector and begin to give investors more confidence in all things decentralized and Web3 as a whole.
Or 2022 could be the start of something dangerous for many Web3 startups.

Molekule And Others Are Exiting For Less Than The Cash They Raised,Joanna Glasner,2023/01/13,"

The valuation peak has passed, but the dealmaking continues.
That’s the recurrent theme lately for acquirers of venture-backed companies. They’re still buying but are commonly paying less than the amounts prior investors put into the acquired companies.

Now, this would be nothing new if the startups getting sold were already winding down or close to it. However, what’s interesting lately is that a funded company still chugging along can also be a cheap acquisition or merger target.
Molekule meets AeroClean
For an example, look no further than Molekule, the air purifier upstart that this week closed a merger with AeroClean Technologies, a publicly traded, South Florida-based air hygiene company with a recent market capitalization around $50 million.
Under terms of the stock-based deal, AeroClean shareholders own 50.5% of the combined company, while existing Molekule stakeholders have the remaining 49.5%. The combined company has been renamed Molekule, and will soon begin trading under the ticker symbol MKUL.
The merger looks like an efficient way to raise the public profile of Molekule, which sells room air filters for about $400 and up at Amazon, Walmart, and other major retailers. But it’s hard to imagine venture backers of the nine-year-old company, which previously raised over $118 million in funding, are excited about the valuation.
At the combined company’s current value, prior Molekule investors’ stake looks to be worth around $25 million. That, of course, is far less than what they put in.
On the bright side, there is potential for future gains, should Molecule’s stock perform well. That’s not a given in the typical low-priced startup M&A deal, where investors get their share of the up-front price and no more.
Other acquisition activity
In case you’re wondering, it looks like a lot of startups are getting acquired lately at prices well below what their venture investors put into them. Using Crunchbase data, we aggregated eight examples of deals announced in the past six months in which the disclosed acquisition price is lower than the total venture funding:


The actual number of low-priced acquisitions of venture-backed companies, however, is much greater but difficult to quantify given that a majority of M&A deals do not have disclosed prices.

The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Monogram And ShiftKey Land Huge Rounds In Big Week For Health Care,Chris Metinko,2023/01/13,"

Want to keep track of the largest startup funding deals in 2023 with our new curated list of $100 million-plus venture deals to U.S.-based companies? Check out our new Megadeals Tracker here.

This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.
Health care led the way this week with two huge raises totaling nearly $700 million. However, the second week of 2023 produced a lot of big rounds. In fact, U.S.-based startups have seen more than a dozen rounds of $100 million or more so far this calendar year. While uncertainty looms, thus far VCs are pulling out their checkbooks.
1. Monogram Health, $375M, health care: Nashville-based Monogram Health is the first of several health care startups to make the list this week by raising a huge $375 million funding round. The round included strategic investments from the likes of CVS Health, Cigna Ventures and others.The startup is a specialty provider of in-home care for patients living with polychronic conditions, including chronic kidney disease. More than 37 million American adults live with chronic kidney disease, according to the company. Founded in 2019, the company has raised $555 million, per Crunchbase data.
2. ShiftKey, $300M, health care: The medical system is battling a significant labor shortage and investors are looking at startups to battle the massive problem. ShiftKey is one of those, and the Dallas-based startup locked up a $300 million round at a more than $2 billion valuation. The round was led by Lorient Capital. The company’s  scheduling platform connects licensed health care workers to facilities with staff openings. ShiftKey joins other startups such as San Francisco-based Incredible Health and Los Angeles-based Greater Good Health that aim to help solve the labor and staffing issues in the health care sector. ShiftKey works with more than 10,000 health care organizations across the U.S. Founded in 2016, the company has raised $300 million, per Crunchbase.
3. VettaFi, $175M, financial services: In the financial realm, data is gold and VettaFi has a lot of that apparently. The New York-based startup formed last year and provides data analytics and indexing for financial advisers, asset managers and institutional investors. The company received a $175 million investment from global market developer TMX Group — whose operations include both the Toronto Stock Exchange and Montreal Exchange. The deal gives TMX a 21% common equity stake in VettaFi.
4. Xpansiv, $125M, financial services: San Francisco-based Xpansiv had a busy week. The company announced the acquisition of Evolution Markets — which helps with transacting environmental commodities — and the closing of a $125 million round. Xpansive said the new capital is “linked to the recent $400 million capital raise led by Blackstone Energy Partners which closed in August 2022.” New strategic investors Bank of America and Goldman Sachs participated in the new round. Xpansiv is looking to grow its market infrastructure platform which helps with energy transactions such as carbon credits and renewable energy certificates. Founded in 2017, the company has raised more than $700 million, according to Crunchbase.
5. Chronosphere, $115M, analytics: New York-based Chronosphere, which helps companies monitor cloud-native applications, raised an additional $115 million Series C from investors including GV and Geodesic Capital, valuing the company at $1.6 billion. The company actually hit unicorn status in October 2021 with a $200 million round. Unlike many companies that have slashed their valuation, Chronosphere has increased its value as companies are looking for more observability tools to enhance customer experience. Founded in 2019, the company says it has raised nearly $343 million.
6. Carbon Health, $100M, health care: San Francisco-based Carbon Health, a health care startup that uses technology to better manage users’ health, received $100 million from CVS Health Ventures as part of an initial close of its Series D. Founded in 2015, the company has raised a total of nearly $623 million, according to Crunchbase data.
7. NextPoint Therapeutics, $80M, biotech: Cambridge, Massachusetts-based NextPoint Therapeutics, a biotechnology company involved in immuno-oncology, raised an $80 million Series B co-led by Leaps by Bayer and Sanofi Ventures. It was the company’s first announced funding.
8. (tied) Capella Space, $60M, space: San Francisco-based Capella Space, a satellite manufacturer, closed $60 million in growth equity financing from the US Innovative Technology Fund. Founded in 2016, the company has raised a total of $239 million, per Crunchbase.
8. (tied) Consumer Edge, $60M, consumer tech: New York-based Consumer Edge, a startup focused on data insights and analytics about consumers, raised a $60 million-plus equity financing from funds managed by CoVenture. The round is the company’s first announced financing.
10. Tigo Energy, $50M, energy: Campbell, California-based Tigo Energy, a developer of solar and energy storage solutions, sold $50 million of convertible notes to L1 Energy. Founded in 2007, the company has raised nearly $200 million, according to Crunchbase.
Big global deals
Two rounds from outside the U.S. cracked the top five financings globally.

Germany-based Enpal, which provides solar power systems to homeowners, raised a Series D worth about $232 million.
China-based Yuze Semiconductor,  a development manufacturer of N-type solar monocrystalline silicon rods and silicon wafers, raised a Series B worth approximately $179 million.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of Jan. 7 to 13. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

High-Speed Latin American Startup Funding Slows in 2022,Joanna Glasner,2023/01/13,"

One year, you’re the fastest-growing region in the world for startup investment. The next, it’s all shrinking fast.
That’s the narrative playing out across Latin America in the wake of a sharp shift in the startup funding climate. Per Crunchbase data, investors put $8.28 billion into the region in 2022, down 79% from 2021, a record-setting year.
Over all of 2022, investment was down heavily at both early and late stage, while seed investment actually rose a bit. In the fourth quarter, funding at every stage came in far below year-earlier levels.

For perspective, we chart out total funding, color-coded by stage, for the past 12 quarters below:


A couple quick takeaways stand out from the chart above. First, the magnitude of declines from Q1 to Q4 of 2022 was quite dramatic, evidence that the year started on a much more optimistic note than it ended. 
Secondly, it shouldn’t be understated that 2021 was a hard act to follow. While 2022 was below peak, it was still the second-highest funding year of the past decade, as illustrated in the chart below:


To get a clearer sense of the ups and downs of the 2022 funding scene, we break things down by stage below, including a look at the largest rounds and most active investors.
Late stage
We’ll kick things off at late stage, which has seen some of the steepest declines.
For all of 2022, investors put $3.57 billion into late- and growth-stage deals, per Crunchbase data. That’s a drop of over 72% from 2021, when over $13 billion went into late-stage dealmaking.
The year-over-year comparisons are even starker for the fourth quarter. During Q4 of 2022, just $450 million went to Latin American late-stage deals, down 84% from a year earlier. 
For a sense of the funding trajectory, we chart late-stage funding for the past five quarters below:


Even with the funding slowdown, we did see some good-sized rounds in the latter half of 2022. Standouts include NotCo, a Chilean maker of plant-based meat products that raised $70 million, and Cortex, a Brazilian business intelligence software provider that pulled in $50 million.
Early stage
Early-stage investment also slipped lower every quarter last year.
For the full year, an estimated $3.22 billion went into early-stage venture rounds. That represents a decline of just over 40% from 2021.
The fourth quarter came in especially low, with $344 million in early-stage investment, down 80% from a year earlier. For the bigger picture, we aggregated early-stage investment for the past five quarters below:


Some big early-stage rounds did get done, even in Q4. This includes a $28 million Series A for Lemon Cash, an Argentina-based digital wallet startup, and a $27 million Series B for Agrolend, which provides credit for Brazilian farmers.
Seed stage
Seed-stage investment in Latin America actually hit an all-time high in 2022. Reported deals totaled nearly $1.16 billion, up 9% from 2021.
However, the year-over-year gains are attributable entirely to heightened activity early in 2022. In the second half of the year, reported seed funding slowed considerably, as illustrated in the chart below:


Because there is often a lag between when seed funding occurs and when it is added to the dataset, it’s likely the Q4 numbers will rise in coming weeks and months. These additions, however, are still unlikely to change the general pattern of declining investment.
Big investors pull back
In 2021, much of the surge in venture funding to Latin America was the result of large, global investors upping their activity in the region. In 2022, by contrast, many of these active investors pulled back amid a worsening exit climate and diminishing valuations for their existing holdings.
The pullbacks were most pronounced in the second half of the year. SoftBank Latin America Ventures, for instance, had no disclosed investments in the latter half of 2022, per Crunchbase data. Tiger Global Management had just two. Both firms were among the most active global investors in Latin America in 2021.
Regional investors also cut back. Kaszek, the Brazilian firm that ranked as the most active regional investor in 2021, sharply reduced deal count in 2022, per Crunchbase data, most markedly in the second half. Deal count for Brazil-based Monashees, the second most active in 2021, was also down considerably in 2022.
Given that active investors did fewer deals across virtually all geographies in 2022, the pullbacks to Latin America aren’t necessarily indicative of growing pessimism about the region’s startup potential. Rather, this looks more like the familiar cycle of a down year after a very up year. 
Methodology
The data contained in this report comes directly from Crunchbase, and is based on reported data. Data reported is as of Jan. 4, 2023.
Note that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarter/year.
The most recent quarter/year will increase over time relative to previous quarters. For funding counts, we notice a strong data lag, especially at the seed and early stages, by as much as 30 percent to 40 percent a year out.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.
Glossary of funding terms
Seed and angel consists of seed, pre-seed and angel rounds. Crunchbase also includes venture rounds of unknown series, equity crowdfunding and convertible notes at $3 million (USD or as-converted USD equivalent) or less.
Early-stage consists of Series A and Series B rounds, as well as other round types. Crunchbase includes venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $3 million, and those less than or equal to $15 million.
Late-stage consists of Series C, Series D, Series E and later-lettered venture rounds following the “Series [Letter]” naming convention. Also included are venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $15 million.
Technology growth is a private-equity round raised by a company that has previously raised a “venture” round. (So basically, any round from the previously defined stages.)

The Week In Crunchbase Data: Funding Declines To Europe And Asia In Q4,Crunchbase News,2023/01/13,"

We’re getting a little tired of writing about it, so you are probably getting a little tired of reading about it, but the data continues to affirm that Q4 was a big bust for global funding. Specifically, we looked at venture and growth investment into Europe and Asia and it was pretty bleak. Meanwhile, we strolled into the used car space and cybersecurity sectors to see how funding fared in those areas.

Stripe Trims Internal Valuation Again As Unicorn Share Prices Plummet,Marlize van Romburgh,2023/01/12,"

Payments unicorn Stripe has cut its internal valuation by 11% to $63 billion, The Information reported, citing a source familiar with the matter.

Even at that valuation, the San Francisco-based company remains one of the most highly valued private companies in the world. But its latest cut is indicative of the falling valuations for unicorn startups over the past year as companies and investors reset their expectations.
Global venture funding in 2022 fell 35% year over year (though still topped 2020 and every other year before). Late-stage startups have been particularly hard hit as public market turmoil stalls the IPO pipeline.
Stripe’s latest cut comes after it already trimmed its internal valuation last year by 28%, from $95 billion. Competitor Checkout.com slashed its internal valuation by 70% to $11 billion last year. Other unicorns, including cybersecurity startup Snyk and AI/ML platform developer Dataiku, have raised new money but at lower valuations, in what’s known as a down round. In one of the more dramatic examples, fintech unicorn Klarna last year saw its valuation plummet 86% to $6.7 billion in a new funding round.

Scrambling For An Egg Replacement? Plant-Based Eggs Haven’t Yet Cracked The Market,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/01/12,"

“Sorry! There’s an egg shortage and we are not immune,” said a sign in my local Trader Joe’s. It was placed inside the refrigerator that once held organic eggs, large eggs, duck eggs and quail eggs. It was empty.
An outbreak of avian influenza (or “bird flu,” as you might have heard it be called) was detected last year in at least 57.83 million chickens, leading to a rapid depopulation of hens who could lay eggs and the rising cost of your favorite breakfast.

But you know what can’t get avian influenza? Plant-based eggs.
Cracking the code on plant-based eggs
Vegan eggs have come a long way. In 2011, startup Eat Just received its first $2 million in funding for what became its flagship egg replacement product made of mung bean protein. Just Egg, as the product is called, cooks up similarly to fluffy, diner-style scrambled eggs and the company flocked to a billion-dollar valuation.
Since then, several other startups have hatched plans to bring a variety of plant-based eggs to the market. There are hard-boiled egg lookalikes, courtesy of Switzerland-based Migros and Texas-based Crafty Counter. Singapore-based Float Foods unveiled a vegan “raw egg” — a viscous “yolk” suspended in a watery pool of “white” that cooks up like a fried egg.
But there’s a pecking order in the plant-based food market, and eggs are at the bottom. There are barely a dozen startups creating egg substitutes, according to Crunchbase data. At its peak in 2021, funding to the sector was a mere $208.7 million. For comparison, investors spent more than $2 billion on the meat substitute industry that same year.


And deal counts have naturally increased.


Will plant-based eggs poach the market? Probably not. Plant-based eggs, like most plant-based food, are suffering from the same supply chain and cost problems that currently plague the chicken egg industry.

"Europe Venture Fell In The Second Half Of 2022, But Not As Steeply As Other Regions",Gené Teare,2023/01/12,"

Venture and growth investors invested $90 billion in European startups in 2022 — marking a 25% decline from Europe’s 2021 funding peak of $119 billion. 
Much of the slowdown was concentrated in the second half of 2022, according to an analysis of Crunchbase data. And over this past year, late-stage funding took the biggest hit, having grown more than threefold year over year in 2021. 

Despite the decline in funding, 2022 is still significantly higher than annual funding in prior years, with 2022 close to double the $46 billion in funding raised in 2020. 


Comparing Europe
It appears that Europe has weathered the downturn better than other regions. Venture funding did not fall as sharply as North America or Asia in 2022 — markets which each declined between 36% and 39%, respectively, year over year. 
Europe has grown from a smaller foothold over the past decade compared to these leading regions — and gained a greater share of funding in the past two years, as it shot up in 2021 and did not pull back as sharply in 2022. 
This increase as a proportion of global funding, however, might not hold up in 2023. 
“Europe in general has lagged behind the U.S.,” said Hussein Kanji from Hoxton Ventures. “There’s a realistic chance that [the slowdown] might not really trigger fully in Europe until Q1 [2023],” he said, noting that Europe “fluctuates more with the markets. When times are good it goes up higher than expected, and I suspect when times are low it will go lower than expected.”
Quarterly pullback
So how does the slowdown in European venture funding look when broken down on a quarter-by-quarter basis during 2022? 
Funding for the fourth quarter was close to flat quarter over quarter and down 46% year over year. 
Again, Europe did not scale back as much as other leading regions, which declined from 58% to 63% this past quarter for the same time period.


Early stage suffered the most
The biggest cutback year over year for the fourth quarter was at early-stage funding in European startups — from $10 billion in Q4 2021 to $5 billion this past quarter. The dramatic drop at early stage is a signal that investors are adopting a wait-and-see approach to this market. 
According to Kanji, “There isn’t very much in the way of Series B, Series C, D right now in Europe. It’s really slowed down.” He acknowledged that investors seem to be oriented toward earlier fundings at seed.


Seed deals
The slowdown at seed-stage funding is also deepening, but less than the other funding stages. Seed declined by 37% year over year in the fourth quarter, totaling $1.8 billion. The fourth quarter of 2021 was around $3 billion for seed fundings. 


Late stage already dropped
Late-stage funding was flat quarter over quarter, having already dropped in the third quarter. Late-stage funding was down 45% year over year for the fourth quarter, reaching $9.4 billion compared to $17 billion in Q4 2021.


European gains
Whether the gains that Europe has made over the past two years will hold will be interesting to watch in 2023. 
Late-stage funding grew threefold year over year in 2021. As global growth investors step back from investing, it is likely to continue to scale back in 2023. 
The venture community in Europe has raised more funding in recent years, primarily focused on early-stage funding. The influx of U.S. venture capital in the market — whilst they are here to stay — have the majority of their portfolio in the U.S. market, which could take some attention away from Europe in the shorter term. 
Whether the slowdown in Europe is lagging behind other leading markets and will show larger declines or is on a new footing will be interesting to watch in the volatile markets of 2023. 
Methodology
The data contained in this report comes directly from Crunchbase, and is based on reported data. Data reported is as of Jan. 4, 2023.
Note that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarter/year.
The most recent quarter/year will increase over time relative to previous quarters. For funding counts, we notice a strong data lag, especially at the seed and early stages, by as much as 30 percent to 40 percent a year out.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.
Glossary of funding terms
Seed and angel consists of seed, pre-seed and angel rounds. Crunchbase also includes venture rounds of unknown series, equity crowdfunding and convertible notes at $3 million (USD or as-converted USD equivalent) or less.
Early-stage consists of Series A and Series B rounds, as well as other round types. Crunchbase includes venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $3 million, and those less than or equal to $15 million.
Late-stage consists of Series C, Series D, Series E and later-lettered venture rounds following the “Series [Letter]” naming convention. Also included are venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $15 million.
Technology growth is a private-equity round raised by a company that has previously raised a “venture” round. (So basically, any round from the previously defined stages.)

"Healthcare Employment ‘Matchmaker’ ShiftKey Raises $300M, Valued At $2B",Keerthi Vedantam,2023/01/11,"

ShiftKey, a Dallas-based scheduling platform for the health care industry, announced on Wednesday it raised $300 million at a well-over $2 billion valuation led by health care-focused private investment firm Lorient Capital.
ShiftKey is tackling a labor shortage that is crippling the medical system through a scheduling platform that connects licensed health care workers to medical facilities with staff openings. The company works with over 10,000 health care organizations across the U.S. and has onboarded hundreds of thousands of nurses, medical assistants and scribes.

“Nurses continue to choose to work on their own terms,” said Tom Ellis, founder and CEO of ShiftKey. “Our vision is to empower nurses and other licensed professionals through the combination of our core marketplace product along with additional technology and tools such as scheduling, payments, education and credentialing.”
Bigger economic factors
ShiftKey and scheduling platforms like it are combating a nursing shortage in America brought on by working long hours and juggling too many patients for too little pay. This exodus has affected every level of hospitals, from support staff to doctors, making it difficult for patients to access quality and on-time care.
Incredible Health, a San Francisco-based startup connecting nurses to health care facilities, raised $80 million in August. Los Angeles-based Greater Good Health, which aims to find long-term employment for nurse practitioners who can take on some of the work normally relegated to doctors, raised $10 million in May.
More and more nurses are moving toward short-term gig work or travel nurse work, which pays better than full-time employment at a hospital facility. But the rotating door of nurses can create inefficiencies in care — new workers have to catch up with patients’ medical histories and learn new workflows — and require hospitals to spend time constantly looking for new talent.
Companies like ShiftKey and Incredible Health are good short-term solutions for a decades-long staffing problem that has turned America’s health care system into a fragile one. But the evidence is clear: the only way to retain medical staff is to give them fewer patients to care for and pay them more.

Venom Foundation And Iceberg Capital Launch $1B Web3 Venture Fund,Chris Metinko,2023/01/11,"

The term “Web3” may not have the buzz it did this time last year, but that doesn’t mean all investors have forgotten about it.
Venom Foundation, a Layer-1 blockchain licensed and regulated by the Abu Dhabi Global Market, and Iceberg Capital have partnered to launch a $1 billion venture fund called Venom Ventures Fund.

The fund will invest in protocols and Web3 decentralized applications, concentrating on areas such as payments, asset management, DeFi, banking services and gaming.
The fund will be investing in projects and teams from pre-seed to Series A rounds.
Web3 funding slows
After a record year in 2021, when VC-backed startups in Web3 raised more than $30 billion, 2022 was a very different story.
Last year’s fourth quarter saw less than $2.4 billion roll into startups in the space, the lowest total since just about $1 billion went to startups in Q4 2020. The fourth quarter in 2021 saw a high of nearly $9.3 billion invested in the space.
That is not entirely surprising, as the venture market is in the midst of a significant pullback.  In 2022, venture funding globally hit $445 billion — a 35% decline year over year from the $681 billion invested in 2021 — according to Crunchbase data.
The decline likely affected Web3 startups more, as the technology is relatively new and many investors are not nearly as familiar with it as they are in other industries.
On top of that, the FTX debacle and crypto winter undoubtedly exacerbated the investment slowdown.
Despite the overall drop in venture, the new Venom fund is not the only large fund in the news recently. Earlier this week, it also was reported that Khosla Ventures has filed to raise $3 billion across three new funds.

Web3 Weekly: VCs May Not Be Immune To ​​FTX-Induced Contagion,Chris Metinko,2023/01/11,"

This is a weekly feature that will look back at the week that was in crypto, blockchain and Web3, and offer insights and analysis. Check out our previous column here.
We’ve covered a lot of the fallout from the FTX collapse and how it has affected a myriad of companies in the crypto space — from lenders like Genesis and BlockFi to payments companies like Wyre to even a crypto-focused bank like Silvergate Capital.
However, in one of the more intriguing VC-related stories to emerge from the FTX fiasco, Reuters reported late last week the SEC is now asking FTX’s investors about due diligence.

The report, which was attributed to two unnamed sources familiar with the inquiry, said regulators are asking the firms what “diligence policies and procedures they have in place, if any, and whether they followed them when choosing to invest in FTX.”
The report did not indicate which firms the SEC reached out to or how many. The SEC would have no shortage of firms to question, however, as FTX had dozens and dozens of VC investors and had raised more than $1.8 billion.
Some of the firms to invest in the failed exchange include Sequoia Capital — which took the lead in FTX’s biggest round of $1 billion — NEA, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Insight Partners, Temasek, SoftBank Vision Fund, Thoma Bravo, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Coinbase Ventures, Ribbit Capital, Multicoin Capital, Paradigm, Tiger Global and Altimeter, per Crunchbase data.
Sequoia apologized to its LPs after the FTX collapse.
The SEC inquiries do not indicate any wrongdoing, but the report said the inquiries could mean VC firms and funds face regulatory scrutiny, as regulators look into whether firms met their fiduciary duties to their own investors.
There is no doubt the FTX debacle already has affected venture capital and investing (as we’ve talked about), but it’s now looking like it is possible those effects may be heightened substantially as regulators figure out who’s to blame in a mess that is only beginning to be untangled.

"
It’s Crazy How Much Investors Cut Back From Q1 to Q4,Joanna Glasner,2023/01/11,"

As we bid adieu to 2022, it seems easy in hindsight to sum up the startup investment climate as your usual cyclic clean-up after a big party. Valuations fell, investors got pickier, and a cratering public market reminded us that tech stocks do sometimes go down.
But parsing through the quarter-by-quarter numbers for active investors, it’s clear 2022 wasn’t entirely a clean-up-the-mess year. For large investors, the party actually continued to rage through the first quarter and remained festive in the second. Only in the latter half of the year did we really see a big slowdown.

To drive this point home, we put together a chart of investors who led or co-led the most expensive collections of rounds 1 in 2022, organized by quarter.
The contrasts are dramatic:


As you can see from the thin gray line representing Q1, things were still extraordinarily spendy at the time. Tiger Global Management and SoftBank Vision Fund alone led or co-led rounds valued at more than $13 billion(!).
By Q2, activity was markedly slower. But it is between Q2 and Q3 that we see the most pronounced slowdown. For example, SoftBank, publicly regretful following a $22.7 billion realized net loss, pared the value of the rounds it led by 82% from Q2 to Q3.
And SoftBank wasn’t alone. Tiger Global, Insight Partners and Sequoia Capital cut back by 83%, 90% and 91%, respectively, from Q2 to Q3. Among active investors on our chart, only Andreessen Horowitz saw an increase in the value of lead rounds over this period.
Between the third and fourth quarters, belts tightened further for most active lead investors. This came as overall investment declined. Per Crunchbase data, fourth-quarter global startup funding totaled $77 billion — down 6% quarter over quarter and 59% year over year. This made it the lowest total since the first quarter of 2020, when $70 billion was invested.

Asia Venture Funding Falls 58% in Q4; Year Ends Down 39% From 2021,Chris Metinko,2023/01/11,"

Asia could not buck the global trend of venture capital pullback in 2022, as total funding for the year dropped 39% compared to the record-setting year of 2021.
Funding dropped from a high of $177.2 billion in 2021 to $108 billion last year, according to Crunchbase data.

The drop isn’t suprising, as markets around the world have been rankled by inflation, geopolitical issues and never-ending supply chain problems stemming from the pandemic.


Quarterly numbers
The final quarter of last year saw a significant drop from that of 2021. In Q4, $21.7 billion rolled to startups on the continent, a massive 58% drop from Q4 2021, which saw a record $51.7 billion invested.


However, Q4 actually saw a small uptick from the previous quarter, which saw $21.4 billion invested.
Deal flow also saw a huge drop, falling nearly in half from 2,455 funding rounds announced in Q4 2021 to only 1,246 in the last quarter. That also is a decline from 1,578 in Q3 of last year.
Late stage and growth plummets
The large year-to-year decline was set in motion by a big drop in late and growth funding. In 2021, $115.7 billion was invested in late-stage startups as valuations remained high and venture capital deals became extremely competitive.


Last year was a very different story, with only $56.5 billion being invested in later rounds, an astounding 51% drop.
While all rounds declined year to year, the drop in late and growth funding was a driving factor in venture being down from 2021 due to the large dollar amounts involved. The drop is not surprising, as later stage rounds — and the high valuations associated with them — were the first to feel the venture capital pullback earlier last year.
The fourth quarter actually saw a slight increase in such rounds from the previous quarter — at $10.4 billion from $9.4 billion. However, those numbers year to year saw a massive dip, falling 68% from the record-breaking high of $32.4 billion in Q4 2021.
Deal flow from Q4 2021 also was significantly down, falling from 359 to only 187 last quarter.
There were still large rounds in 2022, including:

China-based GAC Aion New Energy Automobile, which has five different EVs in the market, raised a Series A worth approximately $2.5 billion in October.
In April, Viacom18 Digital Ventures, a joint venture operation in India between Viacom and Network18, raised a $1.8 billion venture round.
Also in April, China-based fast-fashion company Shein raised $1.5 billion in a new funding round, giving the company a valuation of $100 billion.

Seed rounds sprout multiple stories
Not every round saw a dip this year. Angel and seed round funding actually increased for the year. In 2021, angel and seed rounds totalled $6.1 billion. Last year actually saw a 24% increase to $7.6 billion.


Of course, the issue is seed funding is the smallest by dollars, so it was not able to move the needle much.
Angel and seed funding declined by quarter. In Q4 2021, such funding was $2.1 billion in a whopping 1,281 deals, compared to only $1.4 billion in 624 deals in the final quarter of last year — a 32% decline. Angel and seed even saw a decline from Q3 2022, when it hit $1.6 billion in 882 deals.
Early stage sees some softness
Compared to angel and seed, early-stage rounds stayed pretty stagnant quarter to quarter. In Q4 last year, $9.8 billion was invested in early-stage rounds in 435 deals, down only 6% from Q3 which saw $10.4 billion spent on 520 deals.


The final quarter of last year was a far cry from that of 2021, which saw $17.2 billion invested in 815 deals — 43% more than Q4 2022.
Year-to-year comparisons paint a similar picture. While 2022 saw $43.9 billion go to early-stage rounds, that represented a 21% drop from the $55.4 billion invested in such rounds in 2021.
However, it’s also important to remember that in 2020, early-stage rounds only saw $28.8 billion — more than a third less than last year.
What happened where?
With the big drop in venture funding, it comes as little surprise the region’s two largest countries were most affected.
China saw its venture dollars cut in half from 2021, falling from $88.5 billion to $44.2 billion in 2022. Last year’s number also is a drop from even 2020, when $56.4 billion of investment went to China startups.


India saw investment fall by about a third, dropping from $36.3 billion to $24.9 billion last year. Much like China, 2022’s number represents a drop even from 2020, which saw $33.8 billion of dealmaking.
Other countries that saw notable declines from 2021 include Japan — falling from $5.1 billion to $2.5 billion last year — and Indonesia — dropping from $8.7 billion to $4.3 billion last year.
Countries like Israel and Singapore held pretty consistent from 2021, only seeing slight dips, and the United Arab Emirates jumped from $1.7 billion in funding in 2021 to $2.7 billion last year.
What it means
Asia could not swim against the tide of venture capital being down globally after a record 2021.
Global tensions and a world still struggling to emerge from a pandemic stifled markets everywhere. Asia had to deal with the added issues of China — the driving engine of the region’s economy — and its crackdown on the technology sector, which likely continued to have a chilling effect on venture funding on the continent.
However, it is important to remember numbers were down only slightly from 2020, and 2021’s numbers are looking more like an aberration than the norm at this point.
There also have been signs toward year-end that Chinese regulators may be softening their stance toward internet companies.
Just this week it was reported Tencent Holdings-backed WeDoctor is expected to file for an IPO this spring as regulations loosen. Those signs could help keep the venture market robust in Asia for the new year.
Nevertheless, others see the economy likely entering a recession, with layoffs and global supply chain disruptions still dominating headlines.
If that does occur, venture numbers in 2023 may not be able to maintain even 2020 levels.

"
How Founders Should Approach The Coming Wave Of M&A Deals,Guest Author,2023/01/10,"

By Matt Cohen
The current market conditions of slowing growth, high interest rates and dramatically reduced availability of venture capital for startups is creating a surge of M&A interest.

Many startups have built amazing products, teams and companies over the past few years, leveraging frothy venture capital markets to grow rapidly. Many of these companies are approaching the end of their runways without the ability to raise the next round of capital needed to continue on their mission or have existing investors willing to keep supporting them. So what options do founders have?
Founder choices
This leaves them with three real choices. Option one, go into survival mode — conduct deep layoffs, slow growth and extend the runway to at least 18 months of “always alive” status. Depending on the balance sheet, this may not be an option for every startup.
Option two, close up shop — return investor money and fold. This is certainly not an attractive choice.
Option three, sell the company through an M&A deal. There are a large swath of startups that can’t achieve option one and have come too far and created too much value to stomach option two. Private equity investors see this and have been preparing to scoop up the best companies, products and teams at a discount while folding them into their existing anchor investments.
Over the coming one to two years I suspect that the amount of M&A activity is going to increase dramatically as more and more startups find themselves faced with these three options.
What founders should do
So, what do you do if you’re a founder in this situation? Pride would tell you that selling is not an option — you’ll let your investors down, admit defeat and your reputation will be ruined. As an early-stage VC, I’m here to tell you that’s not the case. When faced with a 1.5x exit versus a zero exit, investors will take the former every day of the week. Plus, if founders handle this situation well, their investors will be lined up and ready to invest in their next startup when the dust settles.
Don’t be afraid to entertain M&A conversations and even lean into them.
Although you might want to ignore those strange emails pursuing an M&A avenue, don’t. In fact, if you’re seeing this type of interest hire an M&A adviser or coach to help you mindfully prepare for these conversations ahead of time.
Matt Cohen of Ripple Ventures
Over the past year I’ve had dozens of founders approach me about M&A interest and 100% of them were hesitant to dedicate resources to this type of endeavor. Those who decided to bite the bullet are glad they did. In addition to bringing on some outside help, I encourage founders to backchannel with their investors and board members to get their advice and experience. Get their input on the prospective buyer, think through how this deal might impact your employees, customers and investors, and even leverage their own portfolio founders for advice.
Treat an M&A deal the same way you’d conduct a funding round. Do your due diligence and take every option seriously. That strange email from an overseas investor might be the deal of a lifetime, so don’t discount any interest.
There’s no doubt over the coming year that times will get harder for startups. I’d urge founders not to consider M&A exits as a failure or an admission of defeat, but rather an offramp instead of ramming flat into a brick wall.
There are forces outside of your control that can dictate your future. As a founder, how you respond to these circumstances, communicate with investors and make the most of the available options will benefit you deeply in the long run. Don’t squander these opportunities and let pride and ego get in the way of your future.

Matt Cohen, founder and managing partner at Ripple Ventures, was founding investor of Turnstyle Solutions, which was acquired by Yelp in 2017. He is a frequent contributor to Crunchbase News, having written about why more VCs are becoming startup founders and other topics.

Used Car Startups And Backers Stuck As Market Stalls,Joanna Glasner,2023/01/10,"

Selling used cars hasn’t historically been the most admired profession. But at least it had a reputation for being profitable.
Not these days. At the dawn of a new year, players in the pre-owned vehicle business are navigating the most challenging market conditions in years. Faced with the combination of declining prices, rising interest rates and growing inventory, several are scrambling to stay afloat.
Among the most high-profile casualties is Carvana, the used vehicle sales platform whose iconic towers of cars grace the skylines of over 30 American cities. Shares of the onetime venture-backed company are down nearly 99% from peaks hit in the summer of 2021, amid slowing sales and shrinking profit margins.

A handful of venture-backed companies that hit public markets more recently are also seeing sharp declines. Out of a list of six funded companies that went public in 2020 and 2021, all are far off their peaks and a few are deep in penny stock territory. Worst performers include:

Cazoo, a London-based online used car marketplace, was recently trading around 17 cents a share. That’s a decline of roughly 98% from its debut price in 2021, when the company went public through a SPAC merger. Per Crunchbase, Cazoo raised $570 million as a private company and $800 million in post-IPO equity financing.
Shift, a San Francisco-based used car e-commerce platform, was already trading below $1 per share in August when it announced a planned merger with Carlotz, another player in the space. By the time the deal closed in December, shares of both companies were sharply lower. Before going public via SPAC in late 2020, Shift had raised over $220 million in venture funding.
Vroom, an online platform for buying and selling pre-owned vehicles, raised over $700 million in venture funding between 2013 and 2019 before launching its IPO in 2020. After peaking in August 2020, shares have shed over 98% of their value, recently trading below $1 per share.

Others have fared a bit better. Buffalo-based ACV Auctions, an online vehicle marketplace, and AUTO1 Group, a Berlin-based car-buying platform, have shed about half their values from a year ago.
VCs still investing
Meanwhile, venture capitalists are still investing in used car startups. However, very little is going to North America.
Using Crunchbase data, we counted at least 13 companies in the used car space that raised venture funding in 2022, collectively bringing in $670 million. The full list is below:


Carsome, a Malaysia-based platform for buying pre-owned cars, snagged nearly half the total, pulling in a $300 million Series E nearly a year ago. Athens-based Spotawheel, a used car dealership platform, pulled in the second-highest total, with $106 million in Series B funding in April.
Notably, none of the 10 largest funding recipients were U.S. companies, which makes sense given the macro situation. During the pandemic, used car prices surged, as auto manufacturers grappled with supply shortages and more vehicle buyers turned to the pre-owned market. Historically low interest rates kept payments reasonably affordable for many American consumers.
Today, rates are considerably higher, pushing up monthly payments. New car inventories have also recovered some. Demand for used cars, meanwhile, hasn’t evaporated. But changing market conditions means used car sellers can no longer count on the kinds of comfortable margins that make for a profitable business.

Most Active Startup Investors Hit The Brakes In 2022,Joanna Glasner,2023/01/10,"

For multiple years, the most active startup investors kept upping their games. They did more deals, backed larger rounds, and kept pushing up valuations. 
In 2022, they took a breather. Per Crunchbase, virtually all of the most prolific venture and seed investors did fewer deals last year than the year before. The value of rounds they led shrunk too, with particularly steep declines for SoftBank Vision Fund and Tiger Global Management, which pulled back in the wake of heavy losses in their existing portfolios.
But while their pace was slower, the usual busiest dealmakers continued doing deals. And since no one else stepped up to dethrone them, they continue to top the lists for most active and spendiest global startup investors.





Learn More




To get a sense of who’s topping the ranks and how much they’ve pulled back, we’ve aggregated a series of charts using Crunchbase data. We looked at the most extravagant investors, most prolific venture dealmakers, and busiest seed backers.
Spendiest lead investors (still Tiger and SoftBank)
We’ll start by ranking the startup investors who appear 1 to have put the most capital to work in 2022, based on the dollar value of rounds they led or co-led.


Notably, Tiger Global remains on top for 2022 despite the aggregate value of rounds it led — $22.3 billion — being 60% lower than in 2021. SoftBank Vision Fund took its oft-held No. 2 spot, followed by another usual suspect, Insight Partners, at No. 3, despite these two firms also being far less active year over year.
Also striking is the extent to which some names on the big spender list have pulled back. The values of lead rounds for Coatue, Temasek and Fidelity, for instance, are all down 75% or more year over year. The paucity of large public tech offerings in 2022 was likely a factor, as it meant big pre-IPO rounds weren’t happening either.
We also broke down activity by quarter, with an eye toward who might have started the year at a much different pace than where they ended. As it turns out, all of our spendiest lead investors put up far more in the first half of the year than the second. 
We saw a particularly dramatic slowdown from Sequoia Capital, which led or co-led $2.7 billion worth of rounds in Q1 and just $100 million in Q4. Tiger and SoftBank pulled back to a similar degree, going from billions of dollars in Q1 to hundreds of millions in Q4.
Most active lead venture investors (Tiger and Insight)
Besides spending less, active investors also participated in fewer deals in 2022, slowing their pace as the year progressed.
Below, we look at the most active lead venture investors by deal count, and how they compare quarter by quarter in 2022:


Once again we see familiar names topping the ranks. Tiger, Insight, Andreessen Horowitz, and SoftBank pulled back, but they obviously still kept busy. Temasek Holdings, meanwhile, has bucked the trend, with investment counts holding relatively steady for each quarter last year.
One investor we didn’t include in the rankings but which also numbered among the most active was Alameda Research, the trading firm tied to bankrupt crypto platform FTX. Although Alameda is known to have a large startup portfolio, with many investments made last year, the exact timing of deals has been difficult to pin down.
Most active seed investors
Seed investors are typically the last group to get spooked by a market downturn. After all, they’re investing smallish sums in companies that are probably many years away from a potential exit.
Even so, backers of these newest startups did curtail spending as 2022 progressed, with global seed investment in the fourth quarter down 35% year over year, per Crunchbase data. The most active seed investors also mostly cut back on deal count in Q4, as the chart below illustrates:


For 2022, Y Combinator still ranked as the most active seed investor, by a long shot. Next up were Techstars, SOSV and Antler.

"Khosla Ventures Wants To Raise $3 Billion, Its Largest Raise To Date",Keerthi Vedantam,2023/01/9,"

Khosla Ventures, the first investor in Impossible Foods among other notable investment distinctions, said in regulatory filings it plans to raise $3 billion across three new funds, Axios reported on Monday.

Of that raise, $1 billion will go to its second opportunities fund and $400 million will go toward its seed fund. Meanwhile, $1.5 billion has been allocated to its flagship fund. If successful, this will be Khosla Ventures’ largest fundraise to date, per Crunchbase data. The amount will surpass its seventh fund in 2020, which garnered $1.4 billion.
Khosla Ventures is one of the largest venture capital firms in Menlo Park, California, with portfolio companies spanning biotech, software and consumer goods. That includes DoorDash, e-commerce apparel startup Everlane, and grocery delivery service Instacart. Per Crunchbase data, its most recent investment was in December when it participated in IT-focused Synchron’s $75 million raise.
Venture firms struggled to raise capital last year. Funding in the U.S. amounted to $161 billion in 2022, largely thanks to a strong first quarter which led with over $72 billion. By the end of the fourth quarter, venture firms barely managed to raise around $16 billion, according to Crunchbase data.
It will be interesting to see when Khosla Ventures deploys the funds, and which lucky startups will benefit. Venture firms pulled back on funding in 2022 and, despite having around $1.3 trillion in dry powder globally, we’re not likely to see a ton of investment activity in the first half of 2023.

Venture To Cybersecurity Drops By A Third,Chris Metinko,2023/01/9,"

Venture capital in cybersecurity hit a record high in 2021 — like it did in many industries — but last year could not come close to matching those peak times.
Funding to cybersecurity startups dropped by a third in 2022, according to Crunchbase data. While 2021 saw a record $22.8 billion roll into startups in the sector, that number fell to $15.3 billion last year. 

However, the 2022 venture total still represents a 68% increase from 2020 — which until last year was the high-water mark for venture funding in the industry.
 


 
The downside, however, is that investment dollars trended downward as the past year went on — something that may not bode well for startups in 2023.
The fourth quarter saw only $2.4 billion go to cyber startups, the lowest amount of venture investment in the sector since the third quarter of  2020 — which saw $1.6 billion invested — according to Crunchbase data.


 
That was after the third quarter also saw a significant pullback in venture funding.
Big dip in big rounds
One reason for the dip in funding was undoubtedly due to far fewer huge growth rounds being raised overall.
A quick look at the numbers shows while 18 rounds of more than a quarter-billion dollars were raised in 2021, last year saw only seven such rounds.

In February, Addison, Texas-based Securonix closed the biggest cyber round of the year, a $1 billion-plus funding led by Vista Equity Partners. The startup offers security information and event management, and extended detection and response capabilities to companies.
In January, Toronto-based 1Password closed a $620 million Series C led by ICONIQ Growth that brings the cybersecurity firm’s valuation to $6.8 billion.
In October, Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based managed cybersecurity company Arctic Wolf raised $401 million in convertible notes led by existing investor Owl Rock.
Switzerland-based SonarSource, which helps manage code quality, raised a $412 million round in April.
In February, New York-based BlueVoyant closed a $250 million Series D at a $1 billion-plus valuation led by Liberty Strategic Capital — a private equity firm founded and led by former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin.
In July, San Francisco-based cyber insurance startup Coalition closed a $250 million round at a $5 billion valuation. 
Also in July, Switzerland-based cybersecurity and data protection firm Acronis raised $250 million from institutional investors including BlackRock that valued the company at more than $3.5 billion.

Nine-figure rounds, in general, were down, with only 42 such fundings going to cybersecurity startups last year compared to 67 in 2021.
What it means
The drop in such large rounds is not surprising, as large growth rounds were the first victims of venture capitalists pulling back on investing.
However, while early-stage rounds stayed strong in many sectors, cyber did see a substantial decline in deal flow, dropping from 862 announced rounds in 2021 to only 730 last year. While 2021 may be an outlier, nearly 830 funding deals were announced in 2020.
The drop in deal flow and the declining trend of investments seem to signal a potentially  tough year for cyber startups. Even M&A dealmaking was down nearly a third when it came to VC-backed startups being bought.
That could spell a hard road ahead for startups if funding dries up and no buyers are around to provide a soft(ish) exit. Palo Alto Networks (whose shares are down more than 17% since the start of 2022), CrowdStrike (down more than 40%), and many other cyber giants have been battered by the tech selloff in the public market. Those companies may not be willing to do stock deals with their shares discounted and investors may not want to see large sums of reserved cash used either.
Companies undoubtedly will continue to spend on security, and innovation is still needed, so some startups will continue to get the cash infusion they need to survive, but 2023 may force them to get creative. It may also be the end of the line for many others.
Methodology
Cybersecurity is defined by the industries of network security, cloud security and cybersecurity, according to Crunchbase data. Most announced rounds are represented in the database; however, there could be a small time lag for rounds reported late in the quarter.

"
January Is Already Breaking Layoff Records,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/01/9,"

In one week, January 2023 became the second-largest layoff month since Crunchbase News began tracking job cuts in the tech industry last year.

Large tech companies including Amazon, Salesforce 1 and Stitch Fix have slashed around 16,420 employees from their ranks. The last time we saw cuts that deep was in November, when the month ended with around 44,570 U.S. tech sector employees who had been let go.


But January isn’t over yet. After a brief break from layoffs during the winter holiday season, it looks like the large tech companies that spent most of the pandemic stockpiling talent amid a software engineer shortage are back to carving out large chunks in their payroll.
Where are these layoffs coming from?


Startups saw the writing on the wall in 2022. The majority of U.S. tech sector layoffs last year were driven by early-stage startups and a handful of mature, late-stage startups such as Gopuff, Klarna and Stripe, all of which conducted multiple layoffs throughout the course of the year. We’ve also seen around 23 companies (all private) shutter in the past year.
But while the data shows there were fewer public companies than startups conducting layoffs last year, those large businesses laid off more people in total — just take a look at November. Large tech firms made up less than 50% of the number of companies that announced layoffs, yet the likes of Twitter and Meta laid off the lion’s share of tech workers that month. Per Crunchbase data, public companies were responsible for around 75% of all layoffs despite making up 28% of all tech firms that announced layoffs.


 
What will the 2023 tech labor market look like?
It’s important to note that January typically is the most brutal month for layoffs, with job cuts hitting every sector from retail to business to technology.
That might explain the record-breaking numbers we’re already seeing in the first week of 2023. But for the first time since we’ve been tracking layoffs, the number of public companies announcing workforce reductions has eclipsed those in the private market. While that may not be the case week over week, the majority of layoffs well into the first half of 2023 will come from public tech firms.
“A lot of the startups kind of started to take medicine earlier in the year, and it’s the big companies that are doing it now,” Healy Jones, an executive at startup consulting firm Kruze Consulting, told me back in December.

"North American Startup Funding Tanked In Q4, Closing Out A Down Year",Joanna Glasner,2023/01/9,"

North American startup investment fell sharply in the fourth quarter, closing out 2022 with funding far below the prior year’s record-setting levels.
In total, investors put $36.1 billion to work across all stages in Q4, per Crunchbase data. That’s a whopping 63% decline from a year ago (a remarkably bubbly time for startup funding) and a 10% drop from third-quarter 2022.
Declines were sharpest at the late stage, as the shuttered IPO market and shrinking tech valuations muted investor appetite for large follow-on rounds. However, funding was down both year over year and quarter over quarter at every stage. 

For perspective, we lay out funding by stage over the past 12 quarters below:


Even with dealmaking down, there were some sizable rounds and exits that did get done in Q4. For the full year, meanwhile, Adobe’s record-setting $20 billion Figma acquisition proved high valuations can persist. Overall, however, both funding and exit numbers point to a down market.
For more detail, below we break things out by stage, as well as highlight top M&A deals and public market debuts.
Late stage
We’ll start at late stage, which remains the largest area for funding, albeit by a smaller lead than in past quarters.
For Q4, late-stage and technology growth investment totaled $18.7 billion. That’s a decline of  67% from the same period a year earlier and a drop of 3% from Q3. It’s also the lowest total of the past five quarters, as illustrated by the chart below:


Round counts also declined in Q4, with 272 disclosed late-stage and tech growth deals, the lowest total in at least five quarters.
Still, big investments did get done. One standout was Anduril Industries, the defense industry technology developer, which landed $1.5 billion in a December Series E round. Other large deals included a $450 million Series E for Form Energy, a developer of iron-air batteries, and a $330 million Series E for DispatchHealth, a provider of mobile and virtual health care.
The Q4 totals top off what has been a downward-trending year. For all of 2022, investment in late-stage and tech growth rounds totalled $124.6 billion. That’s a 43% decline from 2021, when $217.8 billion went into such deals.
Early stage
Early stage is also down. 
For the fourth quarter, $14.4 billion went into early-stage rounds (Series A and B), a 59% decline from year-earlier levels and a 16% drop from Q3 tallies. It was also the lowest total of the past five quarters, as illustrated by the chart below:


Deal counts contracted as well, hitting the lowest quarterly level in more than two years, per Crunchbase data. 
Even so, we did see a number of large early-stage deals. Treeline Biosciences, a precision medicine startup, pulled in $261 million in an October Series A round. Other big Q4 round recipients were biopharma startup Odyssey Therapeutics, with $168 million in Series A funding, and decentralized finance upstart Uniswap, with $165 million in Series B financing.
Early-stage financing was also down for the full year, with $84 billion in total investment in 2022, down from $117.9 billion in 2021.
Seed stage
North American investors also pulled back at the seed stage. 
For Q4, seed, pre-seed and angel investment totalled $3 billion. That’s down 37% year over year and a drop of 18% from the prior quarter.
Below, we look at how the just-ended quarter stacks up relative to the past five:


In some ways, the recent seed-stage decline is harder to explain than the drops we’re seeing at late stage. At this most nascent stage of startup development, investors aren’t really concerned about the current state of the IPO and M&A markets, as a potential exit is years away. 
Nonetheless, seed investors do care about whether there’s a steady supply of Series A capital to fund the next phase of growth. So, from this perspective, the decline in early-stage investment could be a catalyst for lower seed funding.
Notably, quarterly seed funding totals actually hit their all-time peak in Q1 of 2022, boosted by some big Web3-related rounds. That pushed total seed funding for 2022 to $17 billion, which is actually up about 4% from 2021.
M&A
Acquisition activity slowed in Q4, with no purchases that came close in size to Adobe’s jaw-dropping Figma deal the prior quarter.
The largest announced deal involving a private, venture-backed company was PTC’s $1.46 billion acquisition of ServiceMax, a cloud-based platform for managing the lifecycle of assets and equipment. At the time of purchase, however, ServiceMax was 15 years old and majority-owned by private equity firm Silver Lake.
Several younger startups sold for smaller sums, including RepairSmith, a car repair and maintenance platform being acquired by AutoNation for $190 million, and Fungible, a hardware and software system for data centers, which sold to Microsoft, also for $190 million.
For more deals, we put together a list of the top seven venture-backed M&A transactions below:


Public offerings
The new offerings market was quiet in Q4, but a few funded companies still made it to market.
One standout was Getaround, a car-sharing marketplace that went public via SPAC in December, wrapping up a merger deal that set an initial valuation for the company of $1.2 billion. Shares have fallen steeply since.
Meanwhile, Prime Medicine, a startup focused on gene editing, made its Nasdaq debut in October, with shares actually up a bit from the initial price. Several other biotechs also went public, though offerings were on the smaller side. We aggregated a list of seven Q4 offerings, across all sectors, below:


Down is a relative term
While funding was down year over year in 2022, it was still a strong year by historical standards.
Per Crunchbase data, last year actually had the second-highest total funding in the past 10 years. It’s only in comparison to the rollicking 2021 investment climate that things are looking sharply down.
For perspective, below we chart venture dollar volumes by stage since 2013:


Of course, it’s worth keeping in mind that 2022 started on a stronger note than it finished, with Q4 showing the lowest funding by a wide margin. So, if the pattern continues, it appears likely that we’ve still got further down to go.
Methodology
The data contained in this report comes directly from Crunchbase, and is based on reported data. Data reported is as of Jan. 4, 2023.
Note that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarter/year.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.
Glossary of funding terms
Seed and angel consists of seed, pre-seed and angel rounds. Crunchbase also includes venture rounds of unknown series, equity crowdfunding and convertible notes at $3 million (USD or as-converted USD equivalent) or less.
Early stage consists of Series A and Series B rounds, as well as other round types. Crunchbase includes venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $3 million, and those less than or equal to $15 million.
Late stage consists of Series C, Series D, Series E and later-lettered venture rounds following the “Series [Letter]” naming convention. Also included are venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $15 million.
Technology growth is a private-equity round raised by a company that has previously raised a “venture” round. (So basically, any round from the previously defined stages.)

"
The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: SpaceX Takes Off In New Year; Netskope Secures $401M,Chris Metinko,2023/01/6,"

This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.
Despite last year’s decline in venture capital investment, the first week of the new year saw some sizable deals. Three were more than a quarter-billion dollars, and the top seven made it into the nine-figure realm. This week may be more of an outlier than a harbinger of things to come in light of recent headlines of layoffs and a looming recession, but it still is a big kickoff to the new venture year.

1. SpaceX, $750M, space: Elon Musk’s rocket and satellite company raised a lot of cash in 2022, and this year may be more of the same. SpaceX is looking to raise a fresh $750 million round at a $137 billion valuation, CNBC reported. The report also said an email revealed a16z will likely lead the new funding round — the same VC firm also helped Musk in his $44 billion Twitter buyout. The Hawthorne, California-based startup raised $1.68 billion in June 2022 that valued it at more than $125 billion. The space startup quickly added another $250 million in July. It has raised a total of nearly $10 billion, according to Crunchbase data. Previous investors in the company include NASA, Stack Capital, Bracket Capital and the United States Space Force, among others.
2. Netskope, $401M, cybersecurity: There must be something about cybersecurity startups and $401 million in convertible notes. In October, Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based Arctic Wolf raised $401 million in convertible notes led by existing investor Owl Rock. This week another startup, Santa Clara, California-based Netskope received a $401 million convertible note investment led by Morgan Stanley Tactical Value. Both Netskope and Arctic Wolf are companies that have been rumored to be IPO candidates for the past few years, so such financings make sense with the path to the public market blocked. Convertible notes work like a short-term loan, but are repaid to the investor at a later point in equity — i.e. after an IPO — typically at a discount and can also include an interest rate. Founded in 2012, Netskope has now raised $1.4 billion, per Crunchbase.
3. Silicon Ranch Corp., $375M, renewable energy: Silicon Ranch Corp. actually announced a $600 million raise this week, but only the initial funding of $375 million has closed, with the additional $225 million expected to fund in early 2023. Founded in 2011, Silicon Ranch provides customized renewable energy, carbon and battery storage solutions for a variety of  partners across North America. Last year, the  company installed 11 new solar facilities that produce nearly 700 megawatts of new generating capacity. Silicon Ranch is no stranger to large raises; it raised $775 million early last year. The company has now raised about $1.6 billion, per Crunchbase.
4. Asimov, $175M, biotech: Biotech was big in a slow week, and Boston-based Asimov led the way with a $175 million Series B led by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. The startup is developing a synthetic biology platform to design and manufacture next-generation therapeutics, including biologics, cell and gene therapies, and RNA. It currently partners with more than 25 companies that include pharmaceutical companies, biotechs and manufacturing organizations. Founded in 2017, Asimov has raised more than $200 million, per the company.
5. (tied) Chronosphere, $100M, analytics: New York-based Chronosphere, which helps companies monitor their cloud-based applications, raised $100 million from GV, per a report in The Information. Founded in 2019, the startup has now raised more than $350 million, according to Crunchbase.
5. (tied) Metagenomi, $100M, biotech: Metagenomi apparently was in no rush to close its Series B. Almost a year after announcing it had raised $175 million, the biotech company decided to add another $100 million in a Series B extension financing, co-led by Novo Holdings A/S, Catalio Capital Management and Symbiosis. The Emeryville, California-based genetic medicines company has raised more than $450 million, according to Crunchbase data. The startup uses metagenomics and machine learning to discover genome editing systems for therapeutics.
5. (tied) Synthekine, $100M, biotech: Menlo Park, California-based biotherapeutics startup Synthekine closed a $100 million Series C led by The Column Group. Founded in 2018, the company has raised nearly $290 million, per Crunchbase.
8. Ensoma, $85M, biotech: Boston-based genomic medicines company Ensoma closed an $85 million financing co-led by Arix Bioscience and 5AM Ventures. Founded in 2019, the startup has raised $155 million, per Crunchbase.
9. Perceive Biotherapeutics, $78M, biotech: South San Francisco, California-based Perceive Biotherapeutics raised a $78 million Series B led by Johnson & Johnson Innovation. It is the company’s first announced round, according to Crunchbase data.
10. (tied) Belharra Therapeutics, $50M, biotech: San Diego-based Belharra Therapeutics came out of stealth this week in a big way — securing $130 million. First, the startup — which has developed a chemoproteomic-based drug discovery engine — locked up a $50 million Series A from founding investor Versant Ventures. It also announced a multiyear collaboration with Genentech that will provide the startup with $80 million in upfront capital.
10. (tied) Nano-C, $50M, advanced materials: Boston-based Nano-C, a chemical company involved in energy and electronics applications, received $50 million from COTE Capital. Founded in 2001, the company has raised more than $67 million, according to Crunchbase.
Big global deals
With so many big rounds in the U.S. this week, only one from abroad cracked the top five.

U.K.-based Upstream Health, which provides technologies for health and social care teams, raised a $140 million Series B.

Methodology
We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of Dec. 31 to Jan. 6. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

"
Forecast: Plant-Based Meat Is Starting To Sour With Consumers,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/01/6,"

What are flexitarians hungry for?
After Impossible Foods stunned the world with its Impossible Burger, the vegan burger that “bleeds,” in 2016, plant-based meat seemed like the natural next step in sustainable dietary consumerism — one that meat-eaters would happily flock to. Funding to plant-based meat startups between 2016 and 2019 saw a whopping ​​1,110% increase, and that percentage shot up during the pandemic.
Much of that success depended not on vegetarians and vegans, who only make up a small slice of the consumer market, but on omnivores and self-described “flexitarians,” who were looking to plant-based alternatives for the sake of their health and the environment.

But it looks like flexitarians’ attitudes are changing. Inflation, supply chain issues and dwindling customer satisfaction has brought startup investment into plant-based meat to a standstill. Funding went from almost $2 billion in 2021 to around $800 million in 2022, according to Crunchbase data. And these challenges are likely to continue in 2023 as startups work to find ways to deliver healthy plant-based meat products at a reasonable price.
While the outlook for plant-based meat is dismal, the far quieter cell-grown meat industry saw some good news in 2022. California-based Upside Foods got word from the Food and Drug Administration in November that its lab-grown chicken is safe to eat. 
For the first time in years, funding for plant-based and cultivated meat has nearly reached dollar parity. But investors aren’t putting all their eggs into a new basket. It’s clear that meat alternatives have not delivered on their promises to consumers.
“A lot of meat consumption is emotional,” said Lisa Feria, CEO of food venture firm Stray Dog Capital. “And a lot of the plant-based consumption and purchase is rational.”


An unforgiving market
In November, plant-based meat giant Beyond Meat shared some sobering news during its quarterly earnings call: The company posted net revenue of $82.5 million and losses of $101.7 million. The company said it would lower the amount of product it manufactured and revisit its marketing strategy to only certain consumers. 
It’s a sharp descent for a company that went public in 2019 to nearly double its share price. 
Other plant-based meat startups face the same reality, and new innovations in the sector will face more frostbite from the venture market than before. 
“In the past two or three years, a lot of plant-based food companies got funded that should not have gotten funded,” Feria said. “So part of what you’re seeing in the market is an adjustment to that. The products are repetitive and not really great.”
According to a 2021 Good Food Institute report, health is the primary driver for plant-based meat purchases. But it turns out these early movers in ultraprocessed plant-based meat weren’t, on the whole, that much healthier than the real thing. 
Nor were they any tastier, or cheaper. The cost of manufacturing these products has gone up 60% to 70%, and distribution costs have spiked as a result. Everything from plant-based cream cheese to plant-based eggs to plant-based meat have seen shelf prices soar. The GFI report found that more than 60% of consumers would eat more plant-based meat if it was cheaper or less processed.
All of this contributed to the sector’s economic decline in 2022. 
“There was a lot of initial purchase and interest in plant-based meat products, but not as much repeat purchase as was expected,” Matthew Walker, managing director of agriculture-focused firm S2G Ventures, said in an email. “You have a consumer that purchased a product at a premium price and may not have felt that the taste, mouthfeel, or nutrition sufficiently justified making that product a staple item on their grocery list.”
Tall order for 2023
Plant-based meat startups will face a difficult task this year: to create products that taste just as good as (if not better than) the incumbent, while also being healthier and cheaper. 
“The strategy we see as top of mind involves those solutions that make plant-based meats perform better for the consumer, have cleaner labels, and introduce nutritional benefits that go beyond the ‘halo effect’ that this recent wave of products enjoyed but seems to have declined,” Walker said.
Cultivated meat, which uses stem cells to grow proteins streaked with fat and tendons in petri dishes, has emerged as a possible alternative for those discerning flexitarians. But we won’t see them on the grocery shelves any time soon. 
The industry is still working out how to scale its products in expensive labs. Singapore became the first country to approve cultured meat for sale in 2020 with Eat Just’s lab-grown chicken. (The startup has raised $225 million since then.) And following the FDA’s “safe to eat” letter for a lab-grown chicken startup, the U.S. is on its way to seeing cultivated meat reach small-scale distribution levels, like how Impossible Foods opened in a few select restaurants. 
But investors are hesitant to promise too much too fast. Studies show that consumers will be far less forgiving of cultivated meat than they were of plant-based meat. 
“[For plant-based meat], I’m going to give some space for that because I want a trade off, which is nutrition and health,” Feria said. “When it comes to [cultivated] meat, because you’re trying to deliver the same product you have to deliver the same experience or better.”

Our Top 7 Predictions For What 2023 Has In Store For The Startup World,Crunchbase News,2023/01/6,"

Coming off a record-breaking 2021 for startup investment, this year has marked a hard reset to more normal times. As we head into 2023 with recession fears top of mind, here are a few of Crunchbase News’ top predictions for what the new year has in store, based on our reporting.

1) IPO markets will remain sluggish, but if anybody is going public it could be these companies. While market conditions remain crummy, there’s also a huge backlog of late-stage startups that have to find an exit at some point. With that in mind, we offered up ideas for 15 companies — ranging from logistics unicorn Flexport to grocery delivery app Instacart — that could be public-market candidates if and when the IPO markets open back up.
2) Expect more M&A as companies go bargain shopping: Speaking of exits, we could see more mergers and acquisitions in 2023, dealmakers predict. Although rising interest rates make capital more expensive, there are plenty of deep-pocketed buyers who already have money to spend and could go bargain-hunting as startup valuations drop, sources told Senior Reporter Chris Metinko.
3) Cybersecurity valuations will come back to Earth: Even the well-funded cybersecurity sector isn’t protected from valuation drops. Industry experts who spoke with Chris about the outlook for cyber startups in 2023 say they expect fundraising and valuations will continue to soften. That’s despite 2022 easily being the second-best on record for VC funding to cyber companies.
4) Fintech will remain hot, despite the crypto crash: Fintech was the largest recipient of venture dollars in 2022, despite an overall drop in VC funding this year and despite high-profile crypto companies going bust. Next year will likely see continued investment in fintech companies, particularly in the B2B payments and business services space, though we should expect to see a pullback in crypto funding in the wake of FTX’s collapse, Senior Data Editor Gené Teare reports.
5) Investors may be losing their appetite for plant-based meat: Investment into plant-based meat startups has come to a standstill, Keerthi Vedantam reports, noting that funding into the sector fell from almost $2 billion in 2021 to around $800 million this year. The challenges are likely to continue next year as startups try to find a way to deliver plant-based meat products at a reasonable price to consumers, who mostly are not vegan or vegetarian. Still, the alternative meat industry did end the year on a good note, with the FDA in November approving  California-based Upside Foods’ lab-grown chicken as safe for human consumption.
6) Biotech offers a rare bright spot: One area that could see continued investment even during a downturn? Biotech, specifically those companies involved with the so-called “omics” — think genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and proteomics. That’s because, as Keerthi notes, “many of these startups can turn a profit long before they actually make and sell a drug, simply by licensing out their platform to other biotech companies and employing a fee-for-service model.”
7) Novelty is in, copycats are out: Expect to see fewer startups position themselves as the “Uber of X” or the “Shopify of Y” next year, contributing reporter Joanna Glasner writes. While during times of easy money, VCs tended to glom on to follow-on startups riding a hot trend, that era is likely now over. Instead, “startup investors will be looking for novelty in the companies they back,” Joanna predicts. “Out with the me-too business plans. In with those quirky or differentiated enough to stand on their own.” And what are some of those startups? She offers a few picks, from bee startups to a defense tech unicorn.

ChatGPT Creator OpenAI Could Be Valued At $29B In Tender Offer — Report,Marlize van Romburgh,2023/01/5,"

OpenAI, the organization behind the artificial intelligence tools ChatGPT and DALL-E, could be valued at $29 billion in a new tender offer, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.
Venture firms Thrive Capital and Founders Fund are reportedly in talks to invest in the tender offer, which would have them buying shares from existing OpenAI shareholders such as employees. Such a deal would more than double the $14 billion valuation set during OpenAI’s most recent tender offer, in 2021. More recently, it was valued at $20 billion via a secondary sale.

San Francisco-based OpenAI, which has received the majority of its $1 billion in funding from Microsoft, is currently generating tens of millions of dollars in revenue. But the organization sees a path toward generating $1 billion in annual revenue by 2024, Reuters previously reported, by licensing out its technology to developers.
ChatGPT aims to be an “artificial general intelligence,” or AGI, meaning it’s designed to have the capacity to “learn” as a human does, by continually incorporating new knowledge into its understanding of the world. The tool’s proponents say it could one day augment or automate a massive range of human jobs and tasks, including in creative fields such as marketing copywriting or short story writing.
Open possibilities
If the tender offer succeeds, it will make OpenAI one of the few unicorn startups to increase its valuation in a tough climate for venture fundraising and place it among the top 20 most valuable private companies in the world on The Crunchbase Unicorn Board.
Artificial intelligence as a whole is one of the most heavily funded startup sectors. Funding to AI startups in recent years has accounted for as much as 10% of all global venture capital dollars invested, Crunchbase data shows. Despite a general pullback in venture funding in 2022, AI had its second-best year yet, with around $38 billion invested in artificial intelligence startups worldwide.
Along with OpenAI, the most highly valued startups in the space include data and AI company Databricks (valued at $38 billion), driverless auto company Cruise ($30 billion), and AI writing assistant service Grammarly ($13 billion).

The Week In Crunchbase Data: Billions Raised In 2022 Still Fall Short,Crunchbase News,2023/01/5,"

Welcome to the unofficial forecast edition of the Crunchbase Data Digest. While 2022’s funding numbers couldn’t hope to live up to the previous year’s incredible run, they still looked better than 2020’s pandemic swoon.

But what goes up must come down (check out our layoff tracker for evidence of that), and 2023 is already showing nervous signs that venture funding hasn’t hit the floor yet.

Silvergate Capital Lays Off 40% Of Staff As FTX-Induced Contagion Strikes Again,Chris Metinko,2023/01/5,"

Silvergate Capital reported investors pulled out more than $8 billion in deposits from the crypto-focused bank as FTX’s sudden and spectacular collapse left investors reeling.
The bank also announced it will cut 40% of its workforce — about 200 employees — “in order to account for the economic realities facing the business and industry today,” the company said in a release. 

Total deposits from digital asset customers at the bank declined to $3.8 billion at the end of December — from $11.9 billion at the end of September. 
The bank sold debt securities to keep up with withdrawals at a significant loss. The bank sold $5.2 billion of such securities at a loss of $718 million for its fourth quarter ending in December.
The news sent the bank’s stock into a spiral down, nearly 50% at one point Thursday.
FTX’s influence
Silvergate is just the latest to be affected by FTX’s implosion. Others such as crypto lenders Genesis, Voyager and  BlockFi all have been affected in one way or another.
FTX, the fourth-largest exchange by volume at one point, touched nearly everything in the crypto industry. Its implosion darkened what was already a crypto winter and has shook people’s confidence in digital assets.
Just two days ago, disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried pled not guilty in a New York federal court to eight criminal counts involving FTX’s and Alameda Research’s collapse.
Bankman-Fried also faces lawsuits from the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

"Forecast: Cybersecurity Likely To See Valuation Cuts, But Demand Still Strong",Chris Metinko,2023/01/5,"

Although security needs around software development, applications and data remain, cybersecurity startups likely will continue to battle against a new fundraising reality as 2023 dawns.
Industry experts expect a continued softening of the fundraising market in cyber — despite 2022 easily being the second best year ever in terms of raising venture capital in the industry.
“I think we are going back to normal,” said Alberto Yépez, co-founder and managing director at Forgepoint Capital — which specializes in cybersecurity and infrastructure software investments. “You are already starting to see that.”

2021 set a record for the sector, with more than $23 billion raised by VC-backed startups in network, cloud and cybersecurity, per Crunchbase data. While 2022 will only see around $16 billion, that is still nearly double from 2020.
“Across the board, you are just seeing much more realistic valuations,” said Stephen Ward, managing director at Insight Partners, who invests in cybersecurity. “I think in 2023 you will see the same type of thing we have been seeing the last six months.”
Not 2021
The days of a cybersecurity startup generating less than $1 million in revenue seeking a $300 million pre-money valuation are over, said Yépez. The market is normalizing, he said, especially as more “tourist investors” — those who do not focus on the sector — have left.
That is not to say funding is not available.
“Good companies will get funded,” Ward said. “They always do.”
Dino Boukouris, founding director of San Francisco-based financial advisory firm Momentum Cyber, said while considering VC funding in general it is important to remember there is a record high amount of dry powder — estimated at more than $300 billion for U.S. VCs alone — that needs to be deployed.
“Additionally, cybersecurity spending and budgets continue to rise, even in the midst of a recession,” he said. “As such, given the underlying strength of the industry, coupled with an accelerating amount of dry powder, I expect to see much stronger investment activity [in 2023] as this capital is deployed.”
Looking for an exit
For those cyber startups that have trouble raising cash, more exits may become available, but maybe not the much-dreamed-about IPO.
“With the overall deterioration of the economy — interest rates, supply chain issues, etc. — I don’t see the IPO market opening soon,” said Yépez, adding it could be in late 2023 at the earliest.
However, Boukouris said he believes as soon as the public markets recover, the IPO window will naturally reopen.  
“We’re already hearing of companies who are prepping filings for 2023 in anticipation of a market recovery,” he said.
While companies like Snyk, Netskope, Arctic Wolf and others are at the top of the list for IPO hopefuls, a number of them have run into trouble during 2022, with mass layoffs, and other challenges maintaining growth.
“It will be interesting to see which companies will resume IPO preparation and which may seek other alternatives,” Boukouris added.
That alternative could be M&A. 
“Right now people have money because of what they raised in 2021,” Yépez said. “But you will see an increase in M&A. Right now, acquirers are sitting on the sidelines … as startups have trouble raising, you will see them act.”
Drivers
Some of the same things — or offshoots of them — will continue to drive cybersecurity trends in 2023, experts say.
“I think data is the next frontier,” Yépez said. “People do not know where their data even is.”
Startups that can help with assessment, security posture management and data rights and privilege will continue to be looked at by investors, he said.
Also, while the term “shift left” — the practice of moving testing and performance evaluation up in the software development process — will continue to be in vogue, so will “shift up.”
Shift up is the attempt to streamline protections of your clouds, containers, laptops and servers all on one platform. Doing so allows companies to move from more siloed cyber tools and lets them apply rules, privileges and entitlements across the whole operation.
Yépez invested in one such startup — Massachusetts-based Uptycs. There likely will be others that join the market, including larger players like CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks.
In general, chief information security officers want fewer single-use tools and more platform plays as they try to stretch their dollars further in a slowing economy, said Ward.
“Tool fatigue is a very real thing,” he said. 
“Companies have to ask, ‘What do CISOs want?’ “ he added. “They don’t want long six- to 12-month rollouts. Companies need to be able to show their value proposition quicker.”

"
Global Funding Slide In 2022 Sets Stage For Another Tough Year,Gené Teare,2023/01/5,"

As the curtain falls on venture capital investment in 2022, the reviews are in, and they are mixed.
Venture and growth investors in private companies scaled back their investment pace significantly in the latter half of 2022, signaling a slower funding climate as we begin 2023.
To be fair, 2021 was a tough act to follow. Fast-growing startups were showered with capital, and tech firms went public at high valuations. Acronyms like SPAC and NFT were golden tickets to cash. Every type of investor had a role to play and there was every reason to believe the lavish show would go on in 2022.

But last year’s funding numbers said otherwise. Global venture funding in 2022 reached $445 billion — marking a 35% decline year over year from the $681 billion invested in 2021 — according to an analysis of Crunchbase data. But despite the slower funding environment in 2022, investors spent $100 billion more last year than the $342 billion invested in 2020. 
Indications that 2021 might be an outlier amid global funding’s more measured rise over the years instead of a new, heady normal, developed fairly quickly in 2022. The stock market’s fall, mass tech layoffs and crypto’s collapse left many investors and startups struggling to match 2021’s successes. Suddenly $445 billion of global venture funding in a year doesn’t look so bad.

Glossary of funding terms

Quarterly down
Much of the 2022 decline was weighted in the second half of the year. Funding in the fourth quarter was marginally below the third quarter, which had already declined significantly, particularly at late-stage financings. 
Fourth-quarter funding totaled $77 billion — down 6% quarter over quarter and 59% year over year — making it the lowest since the first quarter of 2020, when $70 billion was invested. 


As each funding stage attracts distinct investors, and is impacted in different ways through the downturn, let’s review funding for each quarter by stage. 
Seed funding
Seed funding was the least impacted funding stage through last year’s downturn. 
The fourth quarter was the first quarter in 2022 when seed-stage funding fell in a year-over-year comparison. Seed funding totaled $7 billion in Q4, down 35% year over year. The third quarter in 2022 was flat year over year, but the first two quarters were higher than a year earlier. 


Early-stage funding
Early-stage funding totaled $31 billion in Q4, down by 54% year over year. The third quarter was also a much slower funding quarter, down 39% year over year. Prior to that, the first quarter was up and the second quarter down by less than 10% compared to a year earlier.
Series B fundings were down by a greater percentage than Series A fundings these past two quarters. 


Late-stage funding
The pullback in late-stage funding started in the second quarter of 2022 and continued through each consecutive quarter. 
Late-stage and technology growth funding was $40 billion, down 64% year over year for this past quarter, from $110 billion in Q4 2021, and flat quarter over quarter according to an analysis of Crunchbase data.


Unicorn pace slows
As expected, unicorn creation also slowed in Q4, when just 22 new unicorn companies joined The Crunchbase Unicorn Board. That’s below the lowest quarterly count since the first quarter of 2020 with 23 new unicorns. 
New unicorns in peak quarters in 2021 numbered over 150 companies joining per quarter. 


A reckoning
The venture industry faced a reckoning in 2022. 
In the pandemic-heavy days of 2021, startups growing the fastest were rewarded with abundant capital. A record number of technology startups went public well above their last private valuations and soared on listing. Momentum for special-purpose acquisition company IPOs peaked and reached 613 listings. Thousands of buyers bought NFTs valued in the millions of dollars. And Bitcoin peaked at $65,000 in November 2021. 
Capital to private companies came from an array of investors; venture firms with bigger pockets, sovereign wealth funds, private equity and hedge funds committed more to private tech, and corporate investors leaned into innovation in part by funding innovative tech companies. 
As we entered 2022, the stock market crashed and spiraling public valuations put pressure on private company values. As capital became more expensive, conserving cash and demonstrating unit economics was advised by investors across the spectrum over the months that followed. 
The market for NFTs slid, crypto dropped — and has not emerged as a technology with a strong use case, outside of a store of value. 
The “Great Resignation” theme of 2021 turned on a dime in 2022 as broad layoffs hit across large and small public and private tech companies.
And the myth of the cleverest investor in the room was punctured with the collapse of FTX eviscerating $38 billion in value. 
Even artificial intelligence seemed to fall short of its potential with the closure of Argo AI, a self-driving technology company that was unable to raise further funding despite its backing from  VW and Ford. However, one bright spot in 2022 was the release of OpenAI projects DALL-E for text to image creation and ChatGPT for conversational AI, an indication of productivity gains to be had from developments in AI. 
The scaling back of late-stage funding will impact startups in 2023 as they prepare to raise funding at Series B and later. Round sizes have already come down, but investors will also be more cautious as a slew of startups —having held back — get ready to raise. 
Methodology
The data contained in this report comes directly from Crunchbase, and is based on reported data. Data reported is as of Jan. 4, 2023.
Note that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarter/year.
Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.
Glossary of funding terms
Seed and angel consists of seed, pre-seed and angel rounds. Crunchbase also includes venture rounds of unknown series, equity crowdfunding and convertible notes at $3 million (USD or as-converted USD equivalent) or less.
Early-stage consists of Series A and Series B rounds, as well as other round types. Crunchbase includes venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $3 million, and those less than or equal to $15 million.
Late-stage consists of Series C, Series D, Series E and later-lettered venture rounds following the “Series [Letter]” naming convention. Also included are venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above $15 million.
Technology growth is a private-equity round raised by a company that has previously raised a “venture” round. (So basically, any round from the previously defined stages.)

Salesforce’s Second Round Of Layoffs Is An Uncommon Sight,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/01/4,"

Looks like Salesforce is kicking off high-profile tech layoffs in 2023.
Layoff news quelled in the weeks leading up to the winter holidays. But it only took four days into the new year for the enterprise cloud platform to announce it will lay off around 10% of its staff in the coming weeks. This comes after spending two years of overhiring, like many other tech companies.

“I’ve been thinking a lot about how we came to this moment,” CEO Marc Benioff said in a letter to employees. “As our revenue accelerated through the pandemic, we hired too many people leading into this economic downturn we’re now facing, and I take responsibility for that.”
Salesforce1 cited having more than 7,900 employees globally back in February, and previously laid off 1,090 workers back in November, per Crunchbase layoffs data. A 10% layoff amounts to roughly 680 workers affected by the news.
Major party foul
If you asked me which U.S.-based company would announce layoffs early on in 2023, I wouldn’t have picked the publicly traded enterprise platform that already went through an employee cut in November. In a previous story I noted these sweeping mass layoffs from large tech companies are a good sign there would be no future layoffs from that company. Salesforce, however, conducted two rounds in the span of two months.
A company conducting multiple rounds of layoffs is already a bit of a rarity. According to Crunchbase data, around 9% of the 433 tech companies we tracked laid people off more than once through 2022.


Nolan Church, CEO of consulting firm Continuum (who headed up the talent teams at Carta and DoorDash) called multiple layoffs “a gigantic management failure.”
“If I am an employee in a company that’s going through multiple rounds of layoffs unexpectedly, I’m losing faith in the business and I’m living in fear,” Church said.
Multiple rounds of layoffs often happen at smaller startups, not large tech firms helmed by seasoned executives managing tens of thousands employees globally. Around 65% of tech companies that conducted a second or third round of layoffs were private startups. The rest were only a handful of publicly traded companies such as Lyft, Beyond Meat and Netflix, which undertook more than two layoffs over the span of the year.

Forecast: Which Fintech Sectors Will VCs Favor In 2023?,Gené Teare,2023/01/4,"

Financial services remained the leading sector for venture investment in 2022 despite an overall pullback in venture funding and shockwaves in the crypto industry. And fintech is expected to remain strong in 2023, with areas from payments to accounting management likely to lead the way. 
Payments could remain the most-funded sector within fintech, especially startups focused on B2B payments. On the other side, cryptocurrency and blockchain, which experienced a large increase in funding in recent years, will most likely face a pullback in the wake of FTX’s collapse. 

Leading sectors
Venture investment into fintech companies in 2022 reached $81 billion as of Dec. 14 — down 41% so far from the peak of 2021 at $137 billion. Still, that $81 billion figure still exceeds 2020 amounts by more than $30 billion. 
All told, the sector has grown more than 10 times in the last decade from $7 billion in 2013. 


Within the fintech sector, payments- and banking-related startups received the most venture funding over the past five years, Crunchbase data shows. Cryptocurrency startup funding exceeded these two leading sectors in 2021, but dropped back a bit in 2022. Blockchain technology also received more funding in 2021 and grew its share into 2022. 
E-commerce and insurance, meanwhile, fell as a proportion of overall dollars invested. 


First innings in fintech
The fintech sector is still in early innings, according to a recent report from venture firm Coatue that analyzes the changes modern fintech has brought to the world of finance. 
The New York-based firm, an investor in private and public company stocks, wrestles with the question of value creation in the fintech sector in the report on the state of fintech. 
Of the $11 trillion in market capitalization in financial services companies as of October 2022, only $508 billion — 2% — was in modern fintech companies, Coatue notes. That proportion was higher in 2021 at 5% due to high valuations given to public technology stocks, but in prior years it did not reach 1%. 
“On the way up everybody values growth,” Michael Gilroy, the co-head of its fintech practice and co-COO of Coatue’s growth practice, said in an interview. “On the way down, everybody is valuing profitability and retention. The highest-quality business models within fintech have actually been hit a lot less than the rest of the market.” 
There is a large amount of gross profit for modern fintechs to eat into: Across the financial services sector, gross profits globally totaled $6.5 trillion in 2021, Coatue estimates. 
Fintech business models
Not all fintech businesses and business models are created equal. Newer and in some cases unproven business models that have been hit harder in the public markets are consumer finance, insurtech and SMB payments, according to the report. 
Source: Coatue Whitepaper: Fintech and the Pursuit of the Prize, October 2022.
Public fintech
Coatue analyzed the strength of public financial services businesses across four measures: revenue retention, gross margin, operating margin and revenue growth. It then used its “rule of 200%,” which states that if those four factors combined add up to 200% or more, a company is in a stronger position in this market. 
By that measure, public fintechs leading on the list are Uruguay-based cross-border payment provider dLocal, Palo Alto, California-based back office financial startup Bill.com and North Carolina-based banking platform nCino.

Sectors for investment in 2023
“It’s very clear that it’s easier than ever to offer financial services, whether as a standalone business or as part of incremental margin and revenue in an otherwise non-financial business,” said Ben Savage of Clocktower Technology Ventures. “And we believe that trend is going to continue for the rest of our lives.”
With the slump in new tech listings in 2022 and the nosedive in value in public technology stocks including fintechs, where do investors see opportunities in 2023? Here are some sectors that stand out. 
B2B fintech 
Coatue continues to focus on B2B fintech, Gilroy said. Based on an analysis of the firm’s investments the best business models are in B2B. That’s because business-oriented financial services tend to have lower churn — compared to consumer fintech — and business customers often grow over time, increase spend and provide opportunities to cross-sell with new products. 
There is also opportunity in a “verticalized approach, whether you’re going after landlords in the real estate market or restaurants,” Gilroy said. 
Emerging markets 
Emerging markets present another growth opportunity for fintech startups.
“There’s a lot of underserved communities around the world in terms of access to even the most basic financial products,” said Emily Man, a principal at Redpoint and an investor in the firm’s early-stage practice in fintech and B2B software. 
Coatue noted in its report that “for incumbents who often struggle with customer service and innovation, doing business in emerging markets is practically impossible due to the increasing rate at which locals are coming online.”
Latin American fintechs that have gone public include cross-border payments dLocal, neobank Nubank and e-commerce platform MercadoLibre, which went public in 2007. 
CFO stack
Then there’s the so-called “CFO stack,” or technologies that would make a finance executive’s job easier.
“There’s a tremendous amount of digitalization yet to come. A lot of that is around payments, but a lot of that is also around what we would characterize as the CFO stack, all of the different functions a CFO might ultimately have to navigate,” said Savage. 
Areas of innovation in this stack include tackling expense management, payroll and benefits, stock allocation, business analytics, financial planning and accounting. 
“The opportunity areas in fintech focus on the boring areas of infrastructure, fraud, payment operations, compliance, and taxes. CFOs will be more focused than ever on impact to the bottom line,” Victoria Treyger, a general partner at Felicis, said via email. “Fintechs that can demonstrate an improvement in payment authorization rates, better reconciliation rates, or reduction in fraud that is measurable will weather the downturn.”
Owning the balance sheet
Becoming a bank is expensive and time consuming in the U.S., according to Coatue, but can ultimately provide longer-term stability for a fintech company.  
With that in mind, many fintechs are applying to get banking licenses in order to hold customer deposits, manage money transfers and offer loans instead of partnering with an established bank. Square received a banking license in March 2021 to be able to originate loans through Square Financial Services. Revolut has a banking license in the European Union but has yet to be approved for a banking license in the U.K. Neobanks Nubank and Chime are not licensed as banks.   
 “In a rising interest rate environment, legacy banks, insurance providers, and asset managers have the potential to weather down cycles better than capital-light business models, e.g., insurtech and consumer-facing fintech,” said Coatue in its report.
“Through this last cycle, balance sheets have kind of been a bad word within financial services, and we’re learning that owning the balance sheet, whether you’re consumer facing or business facing, puts you in control of your own destiny and takes you away from the need to maybe go and partner with somebody and continuously work on these these balance sheet agreements,” said Gilroy.
Looking forward
Last year, the big themes in financial services were infrastructure building, embedded finance, consumer fintech and a big interest in buy now, pay later platforms. 
With an increase in interest rates and the market downturn, consumer fintech and lending companies face choppier waters while those focused on enterprise payments have a greater potential for consistent growth in 2023. 
We expect consolidation as funding dries up, and fewer companies can scale up.

Web3 Weekly: The New Year Ushers In More FTX Intrigue,Chris Metinko,2023/01/3,"

This is a weekly feature that will look back at the week that was in crypto, blockchain and Web3, and offer insights and analysis. Check out our previous column here.
Normally the beginning of the year can be sluggish for news, but the crypto industry has never followed traditional trends.
On Tuesday, disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty to eight criminal counts involving FTX’s and Alameda Research’s collapse in a New York federal court.

Of course, that is only one aspect of the myriad of legal issues Bankman-Fried finds himself facing now, as both the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission also wait their turns.
While Bankman-Fried’s plight in a courtroom likely will continue to make most of the headlines involving FTX’s dramatic fall, another intriguing — albeit likely less newsworthy — drama is playing out in the Bahamas.
Through the past few weeks, both Bahamian regulators and FTX’s new management issued releases disputing each other’s take on the company’s assets, among other interesting issues.
The main issue of contention centers on money transferred to the Securities Commission of The Bahamas after FTX declared bankruptcy in November.
The commission said it received $3.5 billion worth of FTX’s assets at that time (obviously it would be a lesser number now considering the state of the crypto market).
However, FTX management has challenged that assessment, saying the assets seized were worth about $296 million at the time.
The commission already has accused new FTX CEO John J. Ray III of “key misstatements” as he attempts to clean up the exchange’s mess for debtors.
In the commission’s most recent news release, it accused FTX’s new management of a “lack of diligence” when making public statements and having “a cavalier attitude towards the truth and towards the Bahamas.”
The release also disputed what it said were public statements made by Ray alleging the commission gave instructions to FTX to mint as much as $300 million in FTT tokens.
While it’s true no one knows for sure what this new year will bring, it’s a near lock to have a lot of FTX-related headlines, intrigue and lawsuits.

SpaceX Shooting For $750M Round At $137B Valuation — Report,Chris Metinko,2023/01/3,"

SpaceX had a busy 2022 fundraising, and it looks like this year will be very similar for the space startup.
Elon Musk’s rocket and satellite company aims to raise a fresh $750 million round at a $137 billion valuation, CNBC reported.
The report cited an email that revealed a16z will likely lead the new funding round. The VC firm also helped Musk in his $44 billion Twitter buyout.

Hawthorne, California-based SpaceX raised $1.68 billion in June 2022 that valued it at more than $125 billion. The space startup quickly added another $250 million in July.
The new valuation is on par with a report late last year by Bloomberg regarding SpaceX selling employee and investor shares via a tender offer which will value the company at $140 billion.
SpaceX’s ups and downs
Last year was a mixed bag for the space startup. It faced delays to its Starship program — part of NASA’s effort to take astronauts back to the moon — but also saw its satellite internet service, Starlink, exceed 1 million subscribers.
The report of such a large round also is notable due to the significant dip in venture capital last year. It is unlikely that the SpaceX round will be a harbinger of an uptick in the market, but it could be one of the largest rounds raised in 2023.
SpaceX’s $1.68 billion raise last year was the second-highest round of the year raised by a U.S.-based startup, per Crunchbase.
The company has raised a total of nearly $10 billion, according to Crunchbase data. Previous investors in the company include NASA, Stack Capital, Bracket Capital and the United States Space Force, among others.

Forecast: Biotech Will Get Up Close And Personal In 2023 With More Funding To The ‘Omics’,Keerthi Vedantam,2023/01/3,"

When I think about health care in 2023, I think about personalized medicine. 
Advances in data science, quantum computing and biology have collided to transform how we treat illness. Just as we decry bloodletting today, one day future scientists will laugh at how we prescribe medication based on “symptoms” and “weight” and not genetic data. 
I’m talking about the “omics”: transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics and (everyone’s favorite), genomics. We’ve only recently begun to tap into this set of sciences to create tailor-made medicines and treatments for each person instead of one-size-fits-all drugs. 

The omics is a booming industry in biotech, garnering more than $2.4 billion in venture funding as we entered December 2022, according to Crunchbase data. Since 2019, funding has nearly tripled for startups parsing through the intricacies of cells to understand the sources of diseases on a molecular level, and how to manage or eradicate them. The pandemic sparked advances in omics in the form of rapid diagnostic tests and the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. 
Even Amazon Web Services got involved in November when it introduced Amazon Omics.


Many of these startups can turn a profit long before they actually make and sell a drug, simply by licensing out their platform to other biotech companies and employing a fee-for-service model. At a time when venture firms are pulling back on funding, the omics are likely to see far more investment from biotech-minded VCs. 
“From an investor standpoint, they’re derisking their business model and they may not need as much money. All of these go hand-in-hand with genomics and bioinformatics,” said David Crean, a longtime biotech investor and managing general partner at Cardiff Advisory. “You have to have a good database to profile all this stuff and that ultimately drives personalized medicine. 
You’re going to see investors putting money in that.”
What are the omics?
Seemingly every day a new kind of omic is popping into the life science lexicon, but let’s focus on four: genomics, metabolomics, proteomics and transcriptomics. 
You may have heard of genomics, the mapping of every strand of DNA that makes up a person. Genomics can allow doctors to predict what kinds of diseases a patient will get long before they present symptoms, staving off chronic illness.
We’ve talked about metabolomics before and how it can be used to tailor medicines to properly work in the human body. Using metabolomics, pharma companies can see how drugs metabolize in the body and change them so they work faster, better and safer. 
Then there’s proteomics, the study of proteins, where most diseases are manifested. Drug development has a 90% failure rate, due in part by the fact that most drugs are built to latch onto targets in the body that aren’t successful. Protein study is the key to unlocking new targets in the body for drugs to swim to. 
Transcriptomics, which studies RNA, can help scientists tap into which genes are working, and links the genome and proteome together. 
“It’s simply a march toward having a truly multi-omic ability with biology,” said Jack Geremia, co-founder of metabolomics startup Matterworks. “I would say that probably one of the biggest advances of the last part of the last century and the beginning of this one was rapid, efficient, effective sequencing for DNA. Those tools had to be built.”
Why does this matter?
There’s a guiding principle doctors use when prescribing medication called the five rights: the right patient, the right drug, the right route, the right dose and the right time. 
If you’ve ever been prescribed medication, you’ve seen the process play out: A doctor prescribes a cocktail of drugs, often at an amount set by middle-of-the-road standards, and then spends every month with the patient tinkering with dose adjustments or cycling through different medications, weighing efficacy against side effects until the right combination works.
But identifying what “right” looks like will be very different in a world governed by omics, where scientists will be able to spend more time looking at each patients’ individual cells rather than making guesses based on blood pressure or body temperature. 
Here’s the thing: We don’t know where many diseases come from. We can’t predict them or spot them until they’re already present. Many of our treatments today are playing catch-up to ailments that are unpredictable and evolving. 
Venture is pumping money into omics to solve these problems. Cellarity raised $121 million in October for its ability to use genomics to create cancer treatments. Transcriptomics startup Vizgen raised $85.2 million in June to advance drug discovery, and expect far better returns on investment than traditional biotech startups. 
By mapping out every molecule, gene function and cell in the human body, scientists can find patterns that may allow them to predict what diseases will occur, how they will progress, and how to make effective treatments to lower pharma’s dismal 90% failure rate, allowing pharma companies to rake in more money.  
This vast data would be useless without advancements in machine learning and computing to swallow this bulk of information and spit out useful insights.
“Genomics was the first omic to really be popularized. That’s actually just one data stream. But it turns out biology is crazy complex, therefore it makes sense that we would need other omics to really understand biology,” said Sara Choi, a Wing VC partner investing in data-heavy biotech companies. “So it’s not just genomics that matter, but it could be transcriptomics, it could be metabolomics, proteomics. And so I think that the very basic data collection was just not there.”

Forecast: Startup M&A Could Pick Up In 2023 As Fundraising Tightens Further,Chris Metinko,2023/01/3,"

While 2022 was relatively average in terms of M&A activity involving VC-backed startups in the U.S., dealmakers think this year could see a significant jump in volume as companies’ options for money and exits dwindle.
Rising interest rates make money more expensive, but those in the industry say both private equity and strategics have significant capital to get deals done now that prices have come down.
“It’s true debt is more expensive, but valuations are coming down,” said Dan Nash, senior managing director and head of investment banking at Cohen & Co. Capital Markets.

Although 2022 couldn’t come close to the robust number of deals announced in 2021, it was on par with previous years — with more than 1,070 VC-backed startups in the U.S. getting bought, according to Crunchbase data.


However, it is interesting to note dealmaking in the space did drop off as the year went along. The fourth quarter of 2022 was on pace to be the slowest of the year, perhaps dragged down by an uncertain economy and fears of a recession.


Big deals
Some of the biggest deals of 2022 involving VC-backed startups in the U.S. included:

In September, Adobe agreed to acquire San Francisco-based collaborative design platform Figma for $20 billion in cash and stock in the largest purchase of a U.S. private, venture-backed company in 2022. 
In January, Aptiv announced it will buy Alameda, California-based device software company Wind River for $4.3 billion.
Also in January, Sony Interactive Entertainment acquired Bellevue, Washington-based gaming company Bungie for $3.6 billion. 
In May, GSK bought Cambridge, Massachusetts-based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Affinivax for up to $3.3 billion.

Three of those deals occurred in the first half of the year, when the market was still riding the tailwinds of 2021. While the dealmaking market started slowing as 2022 wore on, most saw that “wait-and-see” attitude from buyers changing as potential targets started to run low on cash.
“Companies will want to raise capital, but are looking at what will be a dual-track process,” said Nash, meaning startups will be looking at both fundraising deals as well as possible sales.
“Our initial prediction is that volume picks up, but dollars will not” in 2023, said Nash. He added he expects dealmaking to pick up as the year wears on.
Valuations drop
In addition to the need for cash, many startups are not nearly as expensive as they were even as recently as the start of 2022. 
The skyrocketing valuations in the private markets and the option to go public via a SPAC left many would-be corporate acquirers on the sidelines, said Don Butler, managing director at Thomvest Ventures.
“The drop in valuations in public markets and the ensuing drop in valuations for many startups will bring pricing back in line,” he said.
Mike Ghaffary, general partner at Canvas Ventures, said even with dropping valuations, the  question is whether the buyers will be similarly motivated. 
“For the most part, their motivation will be ‘wait and see’ and there isn’t much of a rush, especially because of a perception that the market hasn’t hit bottom,” he said.
However, private equity is sitting on more dry powder than ever before — over $1.5 trillion — and strategics have perhaps been timid because of what had been until more recently a frothy market.
“You have large companies that are scaling back right now,” Nash said. “So they may start cherry-picking really interesting companies.”
Nash said that is especially true as cutbacks at these companies could have stifled innovation, which they may now need to acquire.
Also, big tech companies like Meta, Microsoft and Alphabet have — despite a brutal 2022 that involved layoffs — significant cash and could put it to use now that the market has turned back to their favor.
Affected areas
Where that dealmaking may occur could be the real question.
Nash said the IPO backlog has affected industries including health care, fintech and consumer tech the most. He added fintech could be a good spot to cherry-pick some of the best companies as funding dries up.
Other areas, such as renewables and cybersecurity, also could see activity — although valuations in cyber have not been affected as much in the recent downturn.
Dino Boukouris, founding director of San Francisco-based financial advisory firm Momentum Cyber, said while M&A activity was down year over year, 2022 should still easily be the best year ever for dealmaking, with the exception of 2021.
He expects 2023 to be another big year — certainly in terms of volume.
“As the funding crunch has continued for a bit longer than most expected in 2022, and many companies face considerable ‘down’ rounds in their next capital raise, M&A activity will likely increase, albeit at lower valuations than in prior years,” he said.
While interest rate hikes could curtail some dealmaking, Ghaffary said the market may see companies explore alternative financing plans and an increase in equity components as cash becomes more expensive.
“I don’t think the overall M&A numbers will stay down due to hikes, but we could see certain industries’ numbers fall,” he said. “Overall, I think we will continue to see a steady pace of M&A deals into 2023, but it won’t quite be the historic highs of 2021.”

"The Year’s 10 Biggest VC Funding Rounds: Epic Games Lands Epic Round, SpaceX Soars",Chris Metinko,2022/12/30,"

This is a year-end wrap up of our weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last year’s here.
While last year shattered records in venture capital, 2022 started off slow and only declined from there. Large, late-stage rounds were most affected as venture capital started to pull back. However, 10 companies in the U.S. were still able to break the $1 billion barrier in individual raises this year. 

As we close out the year, let’s take a look at the top rounds of 2022:
1. Epic Games, $2B, gaming: The metaverse is going to be epic — at least that is what both Sony and KIRKBI — the family-owned holding and investment company behind The LEGO Group — are betting on. Both invested $1 billion in  North Carolina-based Epic Games, valuing the gaming giant at $31.5 billion. The deal came just a week after Epic announced a partnership with LEGO to develop a “family-friendly” metaverse for kids. The company said the new cash will “advance the company’s vision to build the metaverse.” Founded in 1991, the Fortnite creator has raised more than $7 billion to date, according to Crunchbase data.
2. SpaceX, $1.7B, space travel: Elon Musk was everywhere this year — including here. Along with the seemingly never-ending Twitter purchase, his SpaceX company made headlines after it raised $1.68 billion in June. It was reported that the raise values the Hawthorne, California-based company at around $125 billion. SpaceX raised $1.9 billion in funding in April 2020 and has raised a total of $7.8 billion in funding, according to Crunchbase data. Previous investors in the company include NASA, Stack Capital, Bracket Capital and the United States Space Force, among others.
2. (tied) Lineage Logistics, $1.7B, logistics: Logistics were big this year with the supply chain still supremely mucked up. Novi, Michigan-based Lineage Logistics rode that interest to a huge $1.7 billion private equity round led by D1 Capital Partners in January. The past couple of years exposed many flaws in the global and domestic supply chains — and investors have taken note that it is an industry ripe for disruption. Other startups such as Seattle-based Convoy and San Francisco-based Flexport also landed large rounds in 2022.
4. (tied) Anduril, $1.5B, defense: Costa Mesa, California-based Anduril locked up a Series E worth nearly $1.5 billion in December that valued the company at $8.5 billion. That nearly doubles the company’s previous valuation in June 2021. The funding round was led by Valor Equity Partners. Anduril was founded in 2017 by Palmer Luckey, most famous for selling virtual reality company Oculus to Meta — then called Facebook — for $2 billion. Anduril builds software and hardware enhanced with artificial intelligence and machine learning for the military and defense industry. It works with the U.S. and its allies to create drones, underwater vehicles, and different operating and control systems. Luckey has said he started Anduril because many big tech firms were turning their backs on doing business with the U.S. Department of Defense, hurting the U.S. military’s ability to modernize as defense needs change.
4. (tied) Fanatics, $1.5B, retail: Jacksonville, Florida-based Fanatics raised $1.5 billion in a funding round that values the sports platform company at $27 billion. The company — which has exclusive licensing deals with most U.S.-based professional sports leagues and many universities to make and sell official team merchandise — was most recently valued at $18 billion, less than a year ago. The latest funding round includes new investors Fidelity, BlackRock and MSD Partners, as well as existing investors. Earlier this year, Fanatics acquired Topps trading cards for $500 million.
6. Cruise, $1.35B, autonomous cars: This was a strange one. In February, Cruise announced that SoftBank Vision Fund would invest $1.35 billion now that Cruise was operating fully driverless cars. The thing is — SoftBank reneged. That would be the first sign of SoftBank’s growing problems and poor investment strategy. SoftBank had made the commitment to invest when the company hit the milestone back in 2018 with its initial funding of $900 million. After SoftBank backed out, however, General Motors acquired SoftBank’s equity ownership stake in Cruise for $2.1 billion and made the startup whole on the round.
7. Citadel Securities, $1.15B, financial services: Miami-based market-maker Citadel Securities locked up a $1.15 billion minority investment led by Sequoia. The company provides both institutional and retail investors with liquidity to execute transactions across an array of equity and fixed income products. Citadel Securities works in more than 50 countries, supporting more than 1,600 clients.
8. (tied) TeraWatt Infrastructure, $1B, electric vehicles: San Francisco-based charging startup TeraWatt Infrastructure landed a huge Series A of more than $1 billion back in September. Launched out of stealth in May 2021, TeraWatt Infrastructure has built out a network of charging stations. The company acquires property in “strategically relevant” locations and helps customers operate EV fleets without the need to own and operate their own infrastructure. The new funding comes from funds managed by Vision Ridge Partners and existing investors Keyframe Capital and Cyrus Capital, and will be used for further development and expansion, including the buildout of a growing portfolio of charging centers. The round is the largest raised by a VC-backed startup in the electric vehicle segment this year, according to Crunchbase data. The company says it previously raised a $100 million seed round.
8. (tied) Securonix, $1B, cybersecurity: No cybersecurity company raised a round larger than this Lone Star State cyber company. The $1 billion-plus round was led by Vista Equity Partners, and is cybersecurity’s largest raise since San Jose, California-based cloud security provider Lacework closed a $1.3 billion round in November 2021. That was cybersecurity’s only round worth $1 billion or more last year. Addison, Texas-based Securonix offers security information and event management, and extended detection and response capabilities to companies. While we covered the heat the XDR sector has seen here, it is also interesting to add a note about the SIEM space. Earlier this year, news broke that Cisco had looked at buying Splunk in what would be the giant’s largest acquisition ever. While Splunk does a lot of things, many looked at the deal as a way for Cisco to enhance its IT security with Splunk’s SIEM platform and ability to use data to improve security.
8. (tied) Verily, $1B, health care: Google and its parent, Alphabet, have been active health care investors — especially recently. That trend has continued as Alphabet led a $1 billion investment in its former life sciences unit, Verily. Alphabet spun out what would become Verily as its own independent subsidiary in 2015. The South San Francisco-based firm — which introduced a COVID-19 testing program in 2020 — has now raised more than $3.5 billion in capital, according to Crunchbase.
Big global deals
While U.S.-based startups were able to weather the chilly conditions and raise large rounds, three of the five biggest global rounds were raised by companies outside the U.S.

Denmark-based energy trading house Danske Commodities raised a $3.7 billion corporate round.
China-based GAC Aion New Energy Automobile, which has five different EVs in the market, raised a Series A worth approximately $2.5 billion.
Viacom18 Digital Ventures, a joint venture operation in India between Viacom, raised a $1.8 billion venture round.

Methodology
We tracked the largest rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the year. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late.

Forecast: Mass Tech Layoffs Are Likely To Continue In 2023. But There’s Good News Too.,Keerthi Vedantam,2022/12/30,"

After two years of pandemic-fueled valuations, public market climbs and billions in venture funding, bloated tech companies big and small are now trimming their workforces as the economy slows.
More than 91,000 people have been laid off from the U.S. tech industry so far this year, per a Crunchbase News tally. Every week brings about several thousand more job cuts in the industry, at both large tech employers and smaller venture-backed startups.

But the future of hiring in the industry is brighter than you might think, according to consultants, recruiters and data firms watching the tech labor market.
When will layoffs end? When we see more down rounds.
Startups that raised capital at inflation valuations in 2021 are more likely to need to conduct layoffs in 2023.
That’s because those companies unable to grow into their frothy new valuations and can’t raise additional capital without risking a down round may need to slash payroll — often the biggest expense, by far — to extend runway.
“You’re going to keep cutting your headcount until you can grow into it. And we haven’t seen many down rounds yet,” said Nolan Church, CEO of consulting firm Continuum and former people’s executive at Carta and DoorDash.
Down rounds are logistically and financially challenging for startups, especially for employees who recently left the company with stock options in hand. Down rounds tend to reduce the value of the startup’s holdings, weakening company morale. They’re also not always possible — venture firms are being more selective about the investments they make, even at lower valuations.
“We have been proponents of companies taking their medicine now and doing a down round,” said Healy Jones, an executive at startup consulting firm Kruze Consulting. “But in order to really pull that off, you still have to be a company that is doing well. There are companies that raised Series Bs right after raising a Series A. In my mind, those companies just barely had Series A metrics.”
What roles are getting cut? Depends on company size.
Headlines have been dominated by massive layoffs at large tech companies, and the data shows it too. Per our layoffs database, 50% of this year’s U.S. tech layoffs occurred in November — when Big Tech companies including Twitter, Meta and Amazon cut tens of thousands of people from their payrolls.
Many layoffs from large tech giants were software engineers, according to workforce data startup Revelio Labs. These cuts followed an earlier season of talent hoarding at those companies.
“These earlier layoffs were dominated by small and medium sized tech companies, while layoffs since September have been some of the tech giants,” Reyhan Ayas, a senior economist with Revelio Labs, said in an email. “It seems that the latter still keep their hiring channel open, while the former seem to close off their hiring more.”
Jones said he’s seeing his startup clients cut roles in talent recruiting and sourcing first, followed by marketing folks. Startups tend to be more hesitant to let go of engineers who, despite the tech downturn this year, are still in short supply and highly valued, he said.
“Those people have been so hard to hire recently that I would imagine companies are going to not get rid of engineering and research to that same extent,” Jones said.
Good news: Laid off workers are finding new jobs fast
Despite industry wide layoffs, there are still more than 375,000 tech jobs in the U.S. that need to be filled going into 2023, according to a new report from tech insights firm Dice. That would mean there are 4x as many job openings as there have been layoffs recorded in our database this year.
“I’ve heard anecdotally many times that tech workers that are laid off are getting rehired within a week or two,” said Dice CEO Art Zeile. “In fact, the joke is it depends on how much time they want to take off.”
Other data also seems to support that: Per Revelio Labs, 70% of laid off U.S. tech sector employees since March 2022 have been able to find a job within three months of being unemployed. That number has been steadily climbing — in October, 75% of laid off workers found a new job within three months.
Salaries for U.S.-based tech roles skyrocketed between 2020 and 2021, representing a 6.9% year-over-year increase, according to Dice data. That was in part due to a tech labor shortage that forced companies to increase their compensation and provide robust benefits packages to hire and retain valuable employees.


As it turns out, 52% of laid-off workers have found a new job with a higher salary, according to Revelio Labs. Those in sales, software and marketing are faring better and quickly getting new jobs compared to those in HR and communications.
Many of the large companies conducting mass layoffs are slashing more jobs than strictly necessary in order to prepare for a worst-case scenario. Some of them actually hire employees back — but getting rehired may take months as the market recovers. Companies also don’t tend to onboard previous employees until at least six months later, due to legal implications around workforce cuts.
“One of the guidelines is that you should not be hiring for the same jobs that you did a reduction for, for at least six months,” said Jason Walker, founder of tech-focused Thrive HR Consulting. “Typically, employees that were let go don’t get hired back into the exact same position. Maybe they’ll come back, but if they come back they’ll come back into a different position.”

"Forecast: For 2023, Novelty Is In, Copycats Are Out",Joanna Glasner,2022/12/29,"

For what’s seemed like forever in venture capital, startups and investors have sought an edge by associating themselves with the hot space of the moment.
When Uber was ascendant in the early 2010s, startups habitually touted themselves as “the next Uber” of their field. When e-commerce aggregators were hot last year, it seemed like everyone was doing it. Same holds for autonomous trucking, 3-D printing, “buy now, pay later,” i-buyers. … Wherever you saw a hot trend, you’d find a cluster of well-funded startups. 
This strategy worked well when public market investors and acquirers were on board. Companies far from profitability could cash in on their industry’s perceived future-changing potential, as we saw in the early days of the SPAC boom.

But that was then; this is now. The rising tide has long since receded, and the SPAC boom has turned to bust. In today’s market, companies associated with once hot sectors that have fallen out of favor are seeing share prices shellacked pretty much across the board.
So what’s a venture capitalist to do? For 2023, we’re predicting that startup investors will be looking for novelty in the companies they back. Out with the me-too business plans. In with those quirky or differentiated enough to stand on their own.
Defining novelty
This assertion begets the question: What qualifies as novel? In particular, what does novelty mean at the late stage, where business models have presumably been around long enough for others to mimic?
Generally, we’re looking for companies in under-represented sectors that have a significant lead over would-be competitors in technology or gaining market share. It also helps to be the kind of startup that doesn’t remind people of another startup.
Of course, there is some subjectivity involved, and not everyone will agree with our picks. Nonetheless, here are a few that stand out among the largest, late-stage funding recipients:


For a sense of the logic in defining novelty, and the numbers involved, let’s break out some of these listings in more detail:
Anduril: We’ll start with the most heavily funded name on the list, defense tech startup Anduril, which pulled in $1.5 billion early this month in a Series E round that values the company at $8.5 billion. Launched in 2017 by Oculus founder Palmer Luckey, Anduril stands out in the startup field in that defense has historically not been a popular space for venture-backed companies, despite the enormity of spending that goes into the sector.
Bee startups BeeWise and BeeHero: Bee-related startups comprise a growing space, but also a pretty differentiated one. One unique standout is  Beewise, an Israel-based company that makes robotic beehives and has raised around $119 million to date. Another is BeeHero, which has raised $66 million to date for its “pollination as a service” offering, adding data science and sensor networks to the old-fashioned business of getting bees to do their thing.
Island: Dallas-based Island has raised a lot of cash, even in this down market. The startup, which develops enterprise browsers it says enhances security and worker productivity, pulled in $275 million over multiple rounds this year, at a last reported valuation of $1.3 billion.
Therabody: Los Angeles-based Therabody, which pulled in $165 million in September, is best known for its massage guns, which it claims can help with physical performance, pain, stress and sleep. 
These, of course, are just a few examples. Others on the list are addressing markets that range from mini golf to geothermal home heating to non-alcoholic craft beer.
Maybe novel investing, too
Beyond backing more original-sounding businesses, later-stage investors may also be more likely to consider companies that have done a well-known seed round or have an early-stage VC firm on the term sheet. 
Looking at the collapse of FTX and other high-valuation upstarts with famous investors, it’s clear prominent backers are capable of missing major red flags. So why not take a chance on something more “out there” and get in at a lower valuation, to boot?

Forecast: VCs Stockpiled Record Funds This Year. Where Will All That ‘Dry Powder’ Go In 2023?,Gené Teare,2022/12/28,"

Venture firms have continued to raise record funds in 2022, even as startups received far less money than they did last year. That poses the question: What will happen with all that dry powder in 2023?
Dry powder is as high as $1.3 trillion globally for private equity and $580 billion globally for VC, according to one estimate from James Ephrati of Lightspeed Venture Partners. The dry powder in 2021 was roughly the same, he said, but investors were putting money to work at a record pace.

See Also: The Largest US Venture Funding Deals Of 2023

Investors are likely to hold back in 2023, at least in the shorter term, as funding valuations trend down. Founders are becoming more disciplined around spending, which will impact growth. And limited partners who overextended in venture capital assets would prefer firms to come back to raise subsequent funds with wider time horizons.

All of these new conditions will make for a much more cautious funding environment next year. 
While fundraising by venture investors increased in 2022, funding to startups slowed significantly. In the third quarter of 2022, global venture funding dropped by more than 50% year over year, per a Crunchbase News analysis. Late-stage funding has plummeted even more dramatically by 63% year over year. 
The LP perspective 
Limited partners who invest in venture funds are expected to slow down commitments in coming years.  
“While I have not heard of many LPs looking to get out of the venture asset class, I do generally expect to see increased LP churn in 2023 and potentially into 2024,” Elizabeth Clarkson, a partner at Sapphire Ventures, which runs its allocation to venture funds in the U.S. and globally, said in written responses.  
“If history is any guide looking back from the 2000 dot-com bubble bursting and the Great Recession of 2009, I think we will see a reduction in 2023 in the total number of venture funds raised, and possibly into 2024,” she said. 
Fund managers should expect a tougher fundraising climate, Clarkson said. “I don’t believe this means emerging venture managers won’t get funded, but I do think the bar has been raised for all venture managers on what constitutes true underlying performance versus high paper valuations.”
2021 multiples
Many of the high valuations set in 2021’s frothy market, particularly for late-stage startups, are starting to look unsustainable, according to industry watchers. 
This is “reflected very much in private markets, where there’s tremendous uncertainty around the forward path of pricing,” according to Ben Savage, a partner at Clocktower Technology Ventures. “In the middle and later stages it’s been a much more difficult year to find compelling opportunities.”
Fewer companies are seeking funding at late stage either because they have raised large fundings in recent years that can tide them over or because they are cost-cutting or seeking other types of capital, as venture capital is not flowing as freely as it did in 2021.
As investors turn away from late-stage financings due to pressure on valuations, companies that need to raise funding face a dilemma. Those not able to grow into prior valuations will be forced to reset. For example, in July Klarna slashed its valuation from $45.5 billion to $6.7 billion to better position itself should it plan to go public in the next year or two. Meanwhile, Instacart, cut its internal employee share price in October, resulting in an internal valuation cut from $39 billion to $24 billion. And in September, SoftBank cut its valuation in travel tech startup OYO from $9.6 billion to $2.7 billion. 
Sitting on funds
With record funds raised, how will the venture markets look in 2023 and beyond? 
“While there is still pressure to invest, it depends on fund size/length, relationship with LPs, and market volatility,” Lightspeed’s Ephrati, who manages the firm’s follow-on investment practice, wrote in an emailed response. “If a fund size is large ($1 billion-plus) with a 10-plus-year lifespan, investors can make the argument that markets are too volatile, private and public valuations have yet to converge, and there will be better buying opportunities in 2024.” 
He anticipates that VC financings will pick up in the second half of 2023.
“A ton of great companies will raise in Q3/Q4 2023 because they’re (a) running out of cash or (b) would like to take advantage of friendlier private market conditions,” he said. “Those companies will also have grown into their 2021 valuation — meaning, the gap and price distortion between a private company’s last round valuation and where public market comparables are trading will be smaller.”
Tech rout
Companies last year were advised to grow at all costs. Investors rewarded them with funding and high values, which in turn led to more than 1,400 private companies valued at $1 billion or more on The Crunchbase Unicorn Board. The majority of those, 1,192, have raised funding since the beginning of 2021. And over 900 of those joined the board since the beginning of 2021.
In 2022 the message became to cut costs and extend runway. 
What happens in 2023 is still unclear. Will those same companies that come through to the other side and ready to raise funding meet a venture market willing to fund them?

"From Layoffs To Valuation Cuts, These Were Our 10 Most-Read Stories Of 2022",Jenna D'Illard,2022/12/27,"

If 2021 was characterized by record-setting wins in the startup, IPO and venture capital world, 2022 was the complete opposite. 
With layoffs, massive funding pullbacks and an overall sense of doom clouding the economy, we naturally saw attention drawn to our coverage of those issues. Readers want to be prepared and understandably gravitated toward our reporting on why these unfortunate economic events are happening.

Layoffs specifically drew interest from readers, namely our updated tracker of tech companies that cut workers in a given week. This year we also launched The Crunchbase Unicorn Board, where we list the most valuable private companies in the world, and our Emerging Unicorn Board of up-and-coming unicorns.
1. Weekly tech layoffs: Earlier this year we noticed the uptick and then steady pace of tech companies laying off workers. Hence, we began tracking those numbers — seeking tips from readers and also watching for the latest layoff news. As of mid-December, 90,000 workers in the U.S. tech sector have been laid off in mass job cuts so far in 2022. Companies large and small made unfortunate debuts on this list, which we will continue to update throughout 2023.
2. The Crunchbase Unicorn Board: Earlier this year, we launched our curated list of private unicorn companies with post-money valuations of $1 billion or more. New companies are added to the board as they reach the $1 billion valuation mark as part of a funding round. Data for companies already on the leaderboard is updated when there is a new funding round announced.
3. Layoff analysis: Consistently throughout the year, we have paused to reflect on what our layoff tracker told us. These analyses (including this one written by reporter Chris Metinko in May and others written later in the year by Sophia Kunthara and Keerthi Vendatam) provided thoughtful insight on the road ahead.
4. Emerging Unicorn Board:  In addition to the Unicorn Board, we also launched the Crunchbase Emerging Unicorn Board this year to track global private companies on the path to achieving unicorn status. Powered by Crunchbase’s comprehensive data, this list is updated as companies reach a valuation of $500 million or more but less than $1 billion and consistently drew readers this year.
5. VCs spent billions on scooters, with little to show for it: Five years ago, the scooters came. These nimble little vehicles offered riders a quick trip to work or a quick trip to the ER, depending on who you asked. Scooter mania spread worldwide, fueled by more than $5 billion in total funding. Since then, many scooter stocks have been tossed aside with Bird just a penny stock. We wrote about the industry and readers took an interest in what we had to say.
6. The VC reset: Senior Data Editor Gené Teare has done a stellar job this year providing monthly recaps of funding at every stage. This report from May held particular appeal for readers as it illustrated that while late-stage and technology-growth investing have been most severely impacted, seed funding remains surprisingly robust (at the time, anyway). Times have certainly changed since then.
7. Global VC pullback dramatic in Q3: With our recap of Q3 data, we could definitively say that the big global venture capital pullback we were all expecting had arrived. Venture and growth investors in private companies scaled back their investment pace significantly as the slump in the public markets stretched into the third quarter.
8. Self-driving truck upstart Embark: From $5B+ to basically worthless: San Francisco-headquartered Embark, which develops autonomous driving technology for the trucking industry, has presided over a roughly 98% share price decline since going public a year ago. In the process, it’s wiped out close to $5 billion in market capitalization. Contributing reporter Joanna Glasner dove into the company’s numbers and her insights struck a chord with readers.
9. VCs embrace a new type of dating app: Nothing better than a startup dating story in February. We wrote about a fresh crop of dating startups getting venture funding to help people find connections in new mediums.
10. Y Combinator warns of economic downturn: In May, accelerator Y Combinator warned the good times may be coming to an end for startups and the venture market. “No one can predict how bad the economy will get, but things don’t look good,” the letter said. The warning came shortly after SoftBank announced it would become much more selective in investments after posting a loss of $27.7 billion on investments in its Vision Fund for its just-ended fiscal year.

Forecast: 15 Startups We Think Could Go Public In 2023,Crunchbase News,2022/12/27,"

This year hasn’t exactly been a blockbuster for the IPO markets. Venture funding has tanked and fewer startups have dared to step into the public arena. 
Will 2023 be the comeback year for IPOs? What will it take for the public market to thaw? Here are the Crunchbase News staff’s top picks for the companies we think could go public next year. 

And if some of these sound familiar, it’s because they are: In our 2022 edition of this list, we predicted many of these might go public this year. Little did we know that the IPO markets would stall. So here we are again, offering up some thoughts on who might make public debuts, if and when IPOs start happening again.
Enterprise tech and cybersecurity
Arctic Wolf: It wasn’t that long ago when Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based Arctic Wolf seemed IPO bound. The company raised $150 million in a Series F in July 2021, taking its valuation from $1.3 billion to $4.3 billion. At that time, then-CEO Brian NeSmith said an IPO was likely the next logical move. Then the market changed drastically, and in October the managed security provider raised $401 million in convertible notes led by existing investor Owl Rock. Convertible notes work like a short-term loan, but these notes are repaid to the investor at a later point in equity — i.e. after an IPO — typically at a discount. The managed security space can support large players and Arctic Wolf has grown large since being founded in 2012. Perhaps those notes turn to equity in 2023.
Databricks: Everyone has been on Databricks for a while. As recently as February, CEO Ali Ghodsi talked about going public, but offered no timeline. The market has only grown colder for IPOs since then, but this is a company that ended 2021 with more than $800 million in annual recurring revenue. It’s big and growing. It also hit a post-money valuation of $38 billion after raising a $1.6 billion Series H led by Morgan Stanley’s Counterpoint Global in August 2021. And that big Series H came just seven months after the company raised $1 billion at a $28 billion valuation. That valuation may be what is keeping the San Francisco-based company from going public. Nevertheless, Databricks — which creates tools and products to help companies view both structured and unstructured data in a single location — could look to 2023 to finally offer employees and investors the liquidity they’ve waited for.
Flexport: The supply chain is still top of mind, so maybe some company will ride that to the public market. San Francisco-based Flexport, which was on our IPO list last year, locked up a $935 million Series E in February led by Andreessen Horowitz and MSD Partners at an $8 billion valuation. The global freight forwarder and logistics platform moved nearly $19 billion in merchandise across 112 countries in 2021, even as global supply chains suffered from multiple disruptions. In total, the startup has already raised more than $2 billion, according to Crunchbase data. Despite a down VC market this year, logistic and supply chain startups still were able to raise cash from private investors. Maybe they can do the same with public ones?

Fintech and banking
Stripe: The most obvious and one of the most successful fintech startups to add to this list is online payments company Stripe, which is co-headquartered in London and Dublin. It is the fifth most valued startup on the The Crunchbase Unicorn Board, and was most recently valued in a 2021 financing at $95 billion. Founded by brothers Patrick Collison, its CEO, and John Collison, its president, Stripe is now 12 years old and has raised more than $2 billion in funding. The company processed $640 billion in payments in 2021 up 60% from the prior year. It was said to have $12 billion in revenue in 2021 according to Forbes. As a result of the market correction, the company lowered its internal valuation in 2022 to $74 billion. The company filed its intention to go public in July 2021 but has not yet set a date. It cut around 1,100 jobs, or 14% of its workforce, earlier this year.
Revolut: London-based Revolut is the second most valuable European fintech, valued at $33 billion as of July 2021. The company is 7 years old and has raised $1.7 billion in funding. Founded by Nikolay Storonsky and Vlad Yatsenko, Revolut took off as it made transferring money in different currencies easy for those who work or travel in multiple countries. Revolut has not initiated layoffs in 2022 — in fact, it has kept hiring. The company announced revenueof 261 million pounds in 2020 but has not posted revenue for 2021. Revolut has 25 million retail customers and applied for a banking license in the U.K. in 2021. 
Plaid: San Francisco-based Plaid connects user bank accounts to fintech apps. The company was founded nine years ago by Zachary Perret, its CEO, and William Hockey, a board member. It was last valued in Series D funding in August 2021 at $13.4 billion and has raised $734 million over time. Plaid’s revenue in 2020 was said to be around $170 million in an article by Forbes. Visa planned to purchase the company in 2020 for $5 billion, which was halted by regulators the following year. In December 2022, Plaid laid off 20% of its staff, or around 260 employees, as Peret said that slower than expected growth after the pandemic meant that Plaid’s “pace of cost growth outstripped our pace of revenue growth.” On the other hand, Peret also said that the number of customers Plaid serves has grown 50% in the past year.

Consumer platforms and services
Instacart: Instacart is kind of the startup equivalent of the “always a bridesmaid never a bride” cliche. It’s always high on lists of likely public market entrants, but has never actually consummated an IPO. Well, we think 2023 will be the year. (Yes, we said that last year too, but cut us some slack.) An offering started looking even more likely after the company confirmed in May that it filed a confidential draft registration with U.S. securities regulators, with a debut currently expected to come next year. The filing followed a steep write-down, as Instacart cut its valuation in March from $39 billion to $24 billion.
Guild Education: Denver-based Guild was also on our list last year, but all told, it still looks like a strong IPO candidate. The Denver-based company, which offers a platform for extending employer-covered education and upskilling to workers, has raised over $640 million to date, including $265 million in a June Series F round. It’s particularly noteworthy that the company secured a big round in a period in which overall edtech funding has been declining, indicating investors see a lot to like in the business model.
Faire: If you’ve been around long enough and raised enough money, inevitably investors will be looking for a return. This notion applies quite succinctly to Faire, an online marketplace for independent retailers and brands that has raised $1.7 billion since 2017, per Crunchbase data. The company’s business model could also see some favorable headwinds as consumers return to local stores, which stock from its suppliers, after a pandemic-driven shift to predominantly online shopping.
TripActions: TripActions is another heavily funded company that’s often bandied about as a likely IPO candidate. The 7-year-old, Palo Alto-headquartered company provides corporate cards and expense management tools, with a focus on business travel. Startup investors certainly seem to like the brand. The company pulled in $300 million in an October Series G round at a post-money valuation of $9.2 million. TripActions also is already making progress on the IPO path — it filed confidential paperwork for an offering with the SEC, per a September report.

Life sciences, agtech and foodtech
Lyra Health: We’re still waiting for Lyra — or maybe Headspace Health or some other teletherapy company — to go public. A first-mover teletherapy startup that took the direct-to-employer route in 2016, Lyra Health has worked with companies including Palantir, Zoom and Amgen to provide teletherapy long before insurance companies at-large embraced the practice. At the beginning of this year the startup raised $235 million in Series G funding, upping its valuation to $5.58 billion. Lyra held back during the 2021 IPO mad rush its competitor Talkspace participated in, but it’s more than ready for the public markets.
Plenty: We consider vertical farming and urban farming a solid bet next year. Thin-margin grocery stores are being hit hard by logistics and supply issues, so the idea of a produce farm located close to consumers seems pretty ideal. Vertical farming startup Plenty rang in 2022 with $400 million in Series E funding, almost half of all the funding the company has raised since it got started in 2014. Plenty began building out a vertical farming “campus” in Virginia, where it would grow strawberries for the large farming conglomerate Driscoll’s. There aren’t that many agriculture startups that went public — AeroFarms almost made the leap via SPAC in 2021 until funding closed up — but Plenty seems ripe to go public.
Tempus: Armed with $1.3 billion in funding over nine funding rounds, precision medicine startup Tempus is easily one of the most intriguing companies to come out of the pandemic. Its technology platform is different from most biotech upstarts that focus on developing molecules. Tempus scooped up two clinical trial-related startups and has its hand in multiple parts of the drug-making lifespan — something we don’t see outside of giant pharma companies such as Amgen or Merck. Tempus raised $275 million in debt financing in October for its ability to leverage AI in drug discovery and genomic sequencing.

Outside the box
Canva: Design-software maker Canva has reeled in more than $572 million in funding and a $40 billion valuation from venture investors. The Australia-based company is known for its design software for nondesigners, but new tools rolled out this year show its ambitions are even bigger. It recently launched an AI writing tool that promises to help automate marketing copywriting, around the same time that OpenAI’s ChatGPT tool set the tech world abuzz. Investors seem to be increasingly drawn to technology that automates even the most creative of fields, and Canva is at the head of the pack in that group. At least one of Canva’s biggest investors is feeling more bullish on the company again: Franklin Templeton increased the value of its stake in Canva last month, after the design softwaremaker was previously hit by a series of writedowns.
ICON: We thought it’d be fun to include a name that doesn’t generally grace the likely IPO lists, and that’s where ICON comes in. The Austin-based construction technology company, known for its iconic 3D-printed homes, has raised more than $450 million in venture funding in the past five years. It’s the kind of branded, consumer-facing technology company that might benefit from the higher public profile that comes with a listing on a major exchange.

5 Interesting Startup Deals You May Have Missed In 2022: Woolly Mammoths And Space Mining,Chris Metinko,2022/12/23,"

This is a recap of the monthly column that runs down five interesting deals every month that may have flown under the radar. Check out November’s entry here.
Every month we take a look at a handful of rounds that maybe weren’t the biggest or spotlighted the most, but caught our attention for being a little different or unique.
We’ve covered everything from Katy Perry’s boozeless cocktails to bread robots.

Now that the end of the year is fast approaching, let’s cull the list down even a little further and look at the five most interesting rounds of the year — at least in our eyes.
Pleistocene Park
Colossal Biosciences: The Dallas-based company closed a $60 million Series A led by Thomas Tull and At One Ventures in March. What caught our eye is that this isn’t just a normal bioscience firm battling disease — it’s trying to solve de-extinction. Yes, like resurrection biology. (Which Hollywood has shown always turns out poorly, i.e., the whole Jurassic Park franchise.)
The company, which launched in 2021, is using genome engineering technologies to find a practical working model of de-extinction that will focus on the goal of the “restoration and rewilding of functional woolly mammoths to the tundra.” Colossal said bringing back mammoths would allow for a better understanding of evolutionary change in other species, and that genetic engineering applications also will help enhance food production and reduce environmental impact.
The other thing that piqued our interest about this were the investors: Thomas Tull of Legendary Entertainment (speaking of movies) and investment firm Tulco fame; gaming company Animoca Brands; Paris Hilton; and several other names from a variety of areas. A pretty eclectic bunch — but then again, maybe that fits in with the mission.
Mining space
AstroForge: Asteroids are known to hold valuable minerals like platinum and gold. The only problem is they’re in space — obviously — so mining them can be an issue.
This is where Huntington Beach, California-based AstroForge comes in. The company locked up a $13 million seed round led by Initialized Capital in May to make such mining a reality.
The company has not shared much of its technology publicly, other than to say it enables in-space material refinement and that it has procured a rideshare launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 vehicle. AstroForge also said it’s already looking at potential mining targets as it prepares for a demonstration flight as early as January 2023.
While asteroid mining has been attempted before, the space economy as a whole really seems to be taking off, and space mining will get you on the list any day.
Fair’s fair
FairPlay: Doing what is fair sounds simple, but society has proven through history it’s difficult for many. Now just like most things, we can have it “as-a-service.”
Los Angeles-based FairPlay is a “fairness-as-a-service” provider solution for algorithmic decision making. The startup landed a $10 million Series A led by Nyca Partners in July.
The company uses AI to help reduce algorithmic bias for people of color, women and other historically disadvantaged groups. The company already has launched two APIs that analyze loan applications and lending.
FairPlay will use the new proceeds to move its services into the insurance coverage, advertising and fraud industries.
Chicken is the new pizza
ZeroCarb LYFE: We’ve had cheese in crust, pepperoni in crust, cauliflower crust, cornmeal crust and any combination of all of those and more.
What is seemingly a little new is chicken as crust. But that’s what ZeroCarb LYFE does and what attracted a $1.5 million seed round from investors in June.
The Evansville, Indiana-based company produces what it calls “guilt-free innovation for pizza lovers looking for a delicious grain-free, high-protein option.” It creates a pizza crust made of only olive oil, spices, salt and, of course, chicken breast meat.
The crust reportedly has 37 grams of protein and zero carbohydrates — hence the company’s name.
ZeroCarb LYFE clearly sees a large and growing market, as it announced as part of closing the seed round it will soon begin a seed-plus round of funding to keep up with the pace of its expansion. The company’s crusts are already available for purchase in more than 150 restaurants and select supermarkets.
Accent bias
Sanas: Startups are always looking for ways to improve conversation and communication, be it through data, artificial intelligence or machine learning.
Speech AI firm Sanas is one of the latest, but it’s taking a unique twist. The Palo Alto, California-based startup has developed real-time accent “translation” software, where the user chooses the accent they want to use.
While Sanas says users have said there are a variety of reasons they may want to manipulate their accent — including it allowing them better fluency in a foreign language — the unfortunate issue of accent bias is also one of the driving forces.
The company announced a $32 million Series A in June, which it said was the largest Series A for any speech technology company. The round was led by Insight Partners with participation from other investors such as GV and General Catalyst.
Sanas says their software “allows for deeper personal choice” when it comes to people’s voices and addresses communication challenges between global teams and customers. In announcing the round, the company also said Alorica — a large business process outsourcing firm — has signed a strategic partnership with Sanas to use its tech with its 100,000 employees.

Here’s How Poorly Last Year’s Biggest Pre-IPO Funding Recipients Have Fared,Joanna Glasner,2022/12/22,"

Nearly a year into a deep bear market for new tech offerings, the concept of a hot, pre-IPO round sounds like an artifact from a bygone era.
But really, it wasn’t long ago. Just last year, in fact, big, late-stage rounds for companies on the cusp of a public market debut were all the rage.

Per Crunchbase data, venture and growth investors funded over 140 rounds in 2021 for companies that have since gone public. Collectively, funded companies raised more than $16 billion in pre-IPO funding.
How did that turn out? To put it mildly, most underperformed expectations on the public markets. Below, we take a look at the six largest pre-IPO round recipients and how they’ve fared since going public.
No. 1 Rivian
Pre-IPO funding: Raised $10.7 billion in total private funding, including $5.2 billion in rounds announced in January and July 2021.
Recent enterprise value 1: $17.4 billion
What happened: Plymouth, Michigan-based Rivian, which put the first of its electric pickup trucks on the road a year ago, was a darling of startup investors, counting Amazon, Ford and T. Rowe Price among its lead backers. When the company IPO’d in November 2021, public investors were pretty besotted as well, pushing the company’s initial market cap above $100 billion — higher than GM or Ford. Shares have fallen sharply since but, buoyed by strong vehicle demand, haven’t collapsed.
No. 2 Robinhood
Pre-IPO funding: Raised over $5.5 billion in total private funding, including $3.4 billion announced in February 2021.
Recent enterprise value: $4.1 billion
What happened: Robinhood secured fame and huge VC checks for its zero-fee stock and crypto trading platform. When it debuted on Nasdaq in late July 2021, shares surged initially but peaked shortly after. Since then, it’s been mostly down, with the company currently valued far below the $11 billion private valuation secured the year before its IPO.
No. 3 UiPath
Pre-IPO round: Raised $2 billion in known venture funding over the years, including a $750 million Series F in February 2021.
Recent enterprise value: $6.4 billion
What happened: UiPath’s business model combined a lot of tech investor buzzwords, with a SaaS platform employing robotic process automation to boost workforce productivity.  The company saw an enthusiastic reception after going public in April 2021, seeing its market cap peak at over $40 billion. Shares are now down over 80% from the top, but UiPath shares got a boost recently after a favorable earnings report.
No. 4 Roblox
Pre-IPO round: $520 million Series H in January 2021
Recent enterprise value: $18.9 billion
What happened: User-generated game platform Roblox went public via direct listing in March 2021 under buoyant market conditions. This resulted in an initial valuation of over $41 billion, with shares nearly doubling once again by their November 2021 peak. Since then, shares have headed steadily lower. While far below Roblox’s debut valuation, it’s still a tremendously valuable company.
No. 5 EQRx
Pre-IPO round: $500 million Series B in January 2021
Recent enterprise value: $350 million
What happened: EQRx had a pitch that venture investors dug: It develops cheaper versions of expensive drugs for oncology and immune-inflammatory diseases. After going public via SPAC in December 2021, however, Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EQRx hasn’t convinced investors it can execute on that vision.
No. 6 SoFi
Pre-IPO round: $370 million in January 2021
Recent enterprise value: $7.1 billion
What happened: Online lender SoFi, which went public via SPAC in June 2021, was one of the year’s higher-profile fintech debuts. But shares have been trending down for the past four quarters, with the stock trading at an all-time low this month. It’s a common pattern for recently public companies in the fintech space, which has been one of the hardest-hit sectors in the current downturn.

"The Week In Crunchbase Data: Billions And Billions, Reader Survey Results, And More",Crunchbase News,2022/12/22,"

“Billions and billions!” astronomer Carl Sagan is still famously (and inaccurately) quoted as saying about the number of stars. We here at Crunchbase love to talk about billions as well — billions in valuations, billions in revenue and billions in fundraising, even in a volatile year like 2022. Here’s the week’s most notable billions below.

We also learned that many of our readers are bracing for a recession in 2023, and that if you want to evaporate a whole pile of money, consider investing in a tech startup going public via a SPAC.

Charts: How Robust Is Series A Funding Amid The VC Downturn?,Gené Teare,2022/12/21,"

For startups in times like these, Series A is a good place to be.
At this stage, a company is established, with a solid track record, yet young enough so its biggest growth is still ahead. That’s a sweet spot for venture investors, with startups raising a Series A round this year generally enjoying more success than later-stage companies.

In line with overall funding trends, Series A funding worldwide went up significantly in 2021 — by more than 100% — and then declined in 2022 by 23%. Still, the decline at Series A was less dramatic than the drop in Series B and later funding rounds. Series B fundings have declined 30% year over year in 2022, while Series C and later funding has fallen 45%.
But startups can’t just stop fundraising at Series A — there’s a whole alphabet of rounds to come. If you are a startup raising at Series A in 2022, the outlook for raising has not weakened significantly by size of fundings. However, given the dropoff after Series A, startups might get stuck unless Series B-and-beyond fundings pick up in the latter half of 2023.
A deep dive into Series A funding also reveals distinct trends in different parts of the world. Back in 2021, the U.S. funding market increased by the largest share compared to other leading countries for Series A funding. But it then fell the most in 2022, based on an analysis of Crunchbase data.
Annual funding at Series A
Global Series A funding peaked in 2021, when more than $90 billion was invested in over 5,000 companies, Crunchbase data shows. Series A funding this year is down, however, with about $70 billion going to roughly 4,000 companies as of Dec. 11.


Downturn in H2
The pullback at Series A became apparent in the second half of 2022. Given the decline is only two quarters in, we expect this slower funding environment to carry on into 2023.


U.S. vs. rest of the world
In 2021, dollar amounts at Series A in the U.S. grew faster than in other leading regions, jumping 125%. But after that, the U.S. market also pulled back more sharply in 2022 in contrast to other parts of the globe with a 33% decline in Series A investment.


While the U.S. did not dominate as a proportion of deal counts compared to the rest of the world, the trends are similar. U.S. deal counts grew at a greater rate in 2021 year over year at Series A and declined at a greater rate in 2022 compared to the rest of the world.


Leading regions
Series A funding amounts in the U.S. in 2021 were double the invested dollars in Asia and more than 3x that of Europe, according to an analysis of Crunchbase data.
But this year, the U.S. — while still the largest market — declined by the amount invested relative to other regions. Still, overall U.S. Series A funding remains one-third larger than Asia, and more than double European investments in 2022.
A decline in Series A funding in China reduced the overall funding to Asia in 2020. But Series A funding to the continent grew again in 2021 and maintained that growth, by and large, into 2022.
European Series A funding grew in 2021 and has not suffered much of a decline in 2022.


When looking at deal counts, the U.S. market trends are inline with amounts: the continent’s deals grew at a greater rate in 2021 than Asia and Europe, and declined at a greater rate as well in 2022.


Median and average Series A
Despite the slowing venture environment, the global median Series A round kept growing in 2022. The average size of Series A rounds has dropped, however, but is still ahead of 2020.
Back in 2013, the median Series A round was $3 million and the average was $6 million. This year, Series A averages are nearly $20 million and medians are above $10 million. In 2020, an average Series A was around $14 million and the median was $7.5 million.1


In summary
Was Series A in the U.S overheated in 2021 compared to the rest of the world when it comes to funding increases?
We are still early in the pullback, and the earlier funding stages — namely seed and Series A — have not come down as precipitously as Series B and beyond.
However, with the decline in late-stage funding — by as much as 63% in the third quarter of 2022 when compared to a year earlier — the bigger question is whether companies that raised larger rounds at Series A will be able to raise follow-on funding at Series B and later.
With a strong pipeline of Series A-funded companies and a retraction of Series B-plus rounds, we foresee fewer companies proceeding to the next stage.

"Argentina’s Startup Scene Is Small, Scrappy And Sometimes Very Successful",Joanna Glasner,2022/12/20,"

Following a dramatic World Cup victory on Sunday, Argentinians are celebrating a rare opportunity to bask in the glow of global admiration and envy.
And so, with the world’s eyes on this South American nation, we figured it’s an opportune time to look at a space that gets way less attention than soccer: the Argentine startup scene.

Now, by global and even regional standards, Argentina is not a particularly large recipient of venture capital. Companies there raised just over $250 million in known seed and venture funding this year, per Crunchbase data. By comparison, neighboring Brazil, by far the largest startup hub in Latin America, pulled in over $5.6 billion.
And, contrary to what we’ve seen on the soccer field, 2022 has been kind of a downer for startup funding in Argentina. Unless there’s some end-of-year surprise, venture funding will likely be down about 60% year over year.
For perspective, we’ve put together Crunchbase data for funding and reported round totals for the past five years below:


Commerce and payments were the biggest areas for investment this year. The largest round went to payments provider GeoPagos, which secured $35 million in an August financing. Next was Lemon Cash, a crypto exchange with a reward card offering. It landed $28 million last month. Clicoh, an e-commerce fulfillment provider, came in third place with a $25 million May round led by Tiger Global.
To put this year’s falling funding levels in context, it should be noted that 2021 was an extraordinary year for Latin American startups. Venture and technology growth investors poured an estimated $19.5 billion into the region, per Crunchbase data. That was more than triple prior year levels, which were themselves record-setting. So, when we say things are heading lower, it’s from a very high base.
Meanwhile, Argentina’s startup ecosystem, while small, has delivered some big hits over the years. The most famous Argentine-founded internet company — online marketplace MercadoLibre 1 — commands a market cap of over $44 billion on Nasdaq.
Other sizable, Nasdaq-traded Argentine companies include Despegar, the travel-booking platform, and Bioceres Crop Solutions, which develops products to increase crop yields. The country also has a small stable of high-valuation private companies, including Ualá, a fintech and prepaid card provider that landed a $350 million Series D last year.
Security provider AuthO, acquired by Okta last year for $6.5 billion, also boasts Argentine roots. Although AuthO was headquartered in Bellevue, Washington, founders are all Argentinian, and built up the company working out of both Argentina and the U.S.
It’s likely the biggest success stories, however, will be the newer, earlier-stage companies that we haven’t yet heard about. Local startup scene watchers identify a number of these, innovating in areas that range from edtech to foodtech to CRM. Hopefully soon we might also see some of these emerging names take their place on the world stage.
Methodology:
Crunchbase data for Argentina funding totals only tallies companies headquartered in Argentina and does not include funding for companies with Argentine founders that are headquartered in other countries or that were initially headquartered in Argentina and later moved.

"
5 Non-Obvious Lessons Learned From The Year In Tech,Guest Author,2022/12/20,"

By Bradley Tusk
Even putting aside the collapse of the economy, the crypto winter, the lack of venture activity, and all of the ways the world is in chaos and crisis, a lot happened in tech in 2022, much of it not particularly good.
While billions of words have been spent dissecting the fall of Sam Bankman-Fried and Elizabeth Holmes, the collapse of crypto, Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter, and more, and given that none of us want to make the same mistakes, it’s worth taking stock of what we actually learned from each debacle.

Cerebral: The obvious lesson is don’t use TikTok and influencers if you’re prescribing something as serious as Adderall and don’t want to be seen as a pill mill. The playbook here is one we’ve always been wary of and hope to not see again: huge marketing spend to fuel explosive patient growth before the clinical infrastructure has been stressed-tested and validated.  The stakes obviously get higher when you’re dealing with a controlled substance prone to abuse. But the intense media and regulator fallout from Cerebral is not just a problem for one company or even one market segment.  The value proposition of digital health rose exponentially during COVID, but given how new the sector is, every time one digital health company suffers a major crisis, it impacts the view of regulators everywhere about the entire industry and threatens the progress made. Just keeping your head down isn’t the right call. It’s realizing that reactive regulation poses an existential risk to all digital health companies, and proactively showing why a bad actor is an isolated incident and not representative of the industry as a whole.
Sam Bankman-Fried/FTX: The obvious lesson is clear: don’t misuse customer money and don’t run a multibillion-dollar company like a fantasy football league. But there’s another: We need to stop this cycle of constantly building people up and then tearing them down. The tech world especially is guilty of anointing someone as the savior. Let’s stop creating false prophets. People are complicated. They’re both good and bad, usually at the same time. And they always screw something up. There’d be a lot less idolatry and disappointment if we recognized that.
Elizabeth Holmes/Theranos: The obvious lesson is don’t commit fraud. But the other is that we as VCs need to be more mindful of the situation where a young founder has an idea, we invest in that idea, they try to turn it into reality, they show some progress but not enough, we pressure them for results, they then start shading the truth so they’re not found out, and it turns into fraud. It’s being more aware of the indirect message of what a founder is hearing in board meetings or check-in calls. It’s recognizing that being wrapped up in another Theranos is far worse than a company growing a little less quickly.
Crypto Regulation/Web3: The obvious lesson from the tumultuous past year in crypto is that pro-consumer and pro-innovation regulation is needed. I don’t think any serious people in the crypto industry feel differently. But it’s also important to realize that while 99% of crypto investors are not true believers in a sovereignless currency, the general public is still susceptible to scams, fraud and a lack of transparency. In addition to creating a new regulatory framework for crypto, policymakers should clearly distinguish between crypto and other uses of Web3/blockchain that are either already regulated or don’t need to be. Without publicly drawing very clear distinctions, we risk the baby being thrown out with the bath water by consumers, corporate partners and regulators (a ratings agency for tokens would also help).
Twitter: Don’t make multibillion-dollar financial decisions based on getting attention. Elon Musk bought Twitter because he wants us to talk about him constantly, and we do. All the time. But it also cost him $44 billion. And while he deserves the benefit of the doubt when it comes to making money, so far, he has not demonstrated any ideas that would save Twitter. Can he still pay the rent even if he loses his entire investment? Sure. But his purchase of Twitter is a perfect example of the danger Twitter poses: Everyone’s decisions are based on retweets and likes and dopamine hits rather than thought and logic. It’s a bad way to live.
By definition, many of the industries that startups tackle are inherently riskier and are operating often without much — or any — regulatory guidance. But that doesn’t mean they have to lead with their chin or make obvious and avoidable mistakes. Hopefully the challenges and lessons of 2022 helps make that easier to figure out.

What The Heck Happened? The Whiplash Year Of 2022,Crunchbase News,2022/12/20,"

Remember January 2022? Ah, those were the days. The venture-backed startup world was revving up for another record-breaking year, raising huge rounds and paving the way to successful IPOs. But then caution flags began flying, venture capitalists pulled back, layoffs mounted, and lucrative exits became few and far between. Follow along with the Crunchbase News team as we track the major events of a year full of hairpin turns. 
January
• 1/18 — Not so fast, FTC says: Microsoft announces plans to acquire gaming giant Activision Blizzard, sparking a battle with Federal Trade Commission regulators who say the deal would allow Microsoft, which owns the Xbox gaming console, to suppress competition.  
• 1/25 — So young, so much money: Nearly 600 new unicorns were minted in 2021, and about 18% of them were early stage. Those glossy startups’ early rounds totaled almost $26 billion, with the total valuations of early-stage unicorns hitting $218 billion.   

February
• 2/7 — Supply chain, agtech, Web3 funding off to a strong start: 2022 has barely begun, and investors have already delivered nearly $1.9 billion in venture funding to supply chain management companies. Agtech investment also flourishes with more than $1 billion of venture funding plowed into the sector so far in the year. And Web3 funding heats up with two raises totaling $650 million in 24 hours.
• 2/24 — Russia invades Ukraine, sparking global unrest: Russia launches an unprovoked invasion of neighboring Ukraine, sending ripple effects throughout a world economy already on edge after two years of pandemic and supply chain woes. We look at Ukraine’s small but growing startup sector and how its business community stays resilient in the chaos of war, the ripple effects on the semiconductor industry, and how one company supports its Ukrainian employees. One silver lining for VC investors is the cybersecurity sector: Even as the markets tumbled, share prices have risen for several publicly traded cyber stocks. 
March
• 3/5 — Funding slowdown arrives: In a sign of things to come, global venture funding comes in at $160 billion in the first quarter of 2022, marking the first time in a year when startup capital fell quarter over quarter.
• 3/17 — Fed begins rate hikes: In a bid to tame inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve raises its federal funds benchmark rate by 25 basis points, to the range of 0.25% to 0.50% — marking the first time since 2018 that the central bank has increased rates. The rate hike is just the first of many in 2022 as the Fed tries to pump the brakes on consumer prices.
• 3/18 — SoftBank dumps Cruise: News breaks that SoftBank Vision Fund will not honor its previous commitment of $1.35 billion in funding to Cruise, now that the startup is operating fully driverless cars. It’s one of the first signs of SoftBank’s growing problems and poor investment strategy and a declining venture market.
• 3/29 — Hey, we care about the environment: Startups in the sustainable packaging space are pulling in hundreds of millions in venture funding, and industry insiders see plenty of room for growth ahead.
• 3/31 — Women’s network joins unicorn club: Chief, a private network for female leaders, raises a $100 million Series B at a $1.1 billion valuation.
April
• Tech layoffs mount: Tech layoffs spike in April with around 6,600 employees getting cut from the U.S. tech workforce.
• 4/11 — An epic raise: Epic Games, the company behind the wildly popular Fortnite video game series, raises $2 billion from Sony and Kirkbi. 
• 4/14 — Musk makes a bid for the blue bird: A few weeks after disclosing that he’d amassed a 9.2% stake in Twitter, Elon Musk offers to buy the social platform outright for $44 billion — a significant premium for the San Francisco-based company. But before the deal finally closes, tune in for months of litigation and drama.
• 4/28 — EV charging startups spark VC interest: Scores of companies in the EV charging space are raising funding, much of it in seed and early stage. But can the sector charge up equally powerful exits?
May
• 5/12 — SoftBank signals big losses: SoftBank — an investor in tech giants like Didi and Uber — announces a loss of $27.7 billion on investments in its Vision Fund for its just-ended fiscal year and tells investors there will be a “stricter selection of investments” for the new year.
• 5/25 — Sequoia sounds the alarm: Just about two weeks after SoftBank’s warnings of belt tightening, venture giant Sequoia Capital — known for investments in tech titans such as Apple, Uber and Google — shares a 52-slide presentation with 250 founders on May 16 over Zoom that warns of a “crucible moment” of uncertainty for the venture market due to inflation, the markets and geopolitical issues. The presentation is another sign of unrest in the venture market and reminiscent of Sequoia’s “R.I.P. Good Times” in 2008.
• 5/31 — Five thriving seed crops: Even as late-stage funding falls, investors are backing an abundant variety of seed-stage startups this year. Fertile sectors include the metaverse, brain and neurotech, fitness, NFTs, and alternative meats.
June
• VC takes another turn for the worst: Those looking for better news at the end of the second quarter were sadly disappointed: Global funding slowed dramatically in Q2 2022 as investors further shied away from later-stage funding bets.
• 6/13 — SpaceX fuels up with $1.7B: Elon Musk’s “other company,” SpaceX, raises $1.68 billion in equity financing from a large group of investors. Though the raise marks one of the largest of the year, it’s a tad under the $1.72 billion the rocket maker was reportedly seeking.
• 6/24 — SCOTUS sets off shockwaves:  The Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling that codified the right to an abortion in the U.S. After it was overturned, several online pharmacy and health startups began working toward providing abortions. 
July
• 7/11 — Klarna valuation plummets: Buy now, pay later startup Klarna raises $800 million in new funding in a deal that chops its valuation by 85% to $6.7 billion. The valuation drop is a sign of things to come, as other unicorns will also see their values decline, sometimes significantly, as the year wears on.
• 7/28 — Dry powder piles up: Firms keep announcing monster new commitments to funds even as venture investment drops. Already this year, firms have publicly announced nearly $144 billion in funds being raised, a number that nearly matches 2021’s blockbuster amount.
August
• 8/16 — Biden signs massive tax-and-spend bill: President Joe Biden signs the Inflation Reduction Act into law, cementing a massive piece of legislation that earmarks almost $400 billion for green energy and health care, while raising tax rates on corporations and the wealthy. Despite its name, many economists say the legislation is unlikely to greatly reduce consumer prices — and may actually spur further inflation over the next few years. Even so, Wall Street reacts largely positively to the bill.  
• 8/31 — Hello there, extension rounds: In a tepid market, extension rounds are on the uptick. It’s a viable option for some startups that raised at a high valuation in 2021 but aren’t meeting milestones to raise the next funding stage.
September
• VC funding drops dramatically: Venture funding in Q3 totals $81 billion — down by 53% year over year — removing any doubt that 2022 will look very different from 2021. 
• 9/15 — Adobe pulls out its pocketbook: Adobe announces its intent to acquire Figma for $20 billion — half in stock and half in cash. Should the acquisition be approved, it will be the largest acquisition of a private technology company to date. The largest technology acquisition prior to this announcement was Facebook’s purchase of WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion. And the third largest is Walmart’s purchase of Flipkart in 2018 for $16 billion. 
• 9/27 — Dermo funding more than skin deep: Investment in cosmetic dermatology — treating acne, brittle hair and wrinkles — has been on the rise in India. Generic drugmaker Torrent Pharmaceuticals sets up to acquire dermatology startup Curatio Healthcare for $245 million.
October
• 10/12 — The journey continues: TripActions pulls in $300 million in an October Series G round at a post-money valuation of $9.2 million. The corporate travel booking platform earlier filed confidential paperwork for an IPO with the SEC.
• 10/31 — The wheels come off Argo AI: Pittsburgh-based self-driving technologies company Argo AI closes down as it’s unable to raise new funds. Primarily backed by Ford and VW, the company was last valued at $12.4 billion in July 2021 in a funding and partnership with Lyft. 
November
• 11/6 — Binance says bye to FTT: Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweets that Binance — the largest exchange by volume — will sell its holdings of FTX’s native token, FTT. 
• 11/09 — Meta makes mega layoffs: Meta begins laying off around 11,000 employees, making it the largest layoff move in tech in 2022. Not far behind is Amazon, which cuts 10,000 jobs.
• 11/11 — FTX files for bankruptcy: After the collapse of the FTT token and a rush on withdrawals, FTX, Alameda Research and all their affiliates declare bankruptcy — with FTX showing an $8 billion shortfall. It’s a dramatic collapse when one considers just earlier in the year FTX and FTX US carried valuations of $32 billion and $8 billion, respectively, before everything fell apart.
• 11/16 — FDA OKs lab meat: The Food and Drug Administration says lab-grown meat is safe to eat, a major win for cultivated meat startups, which have gobbled up nearly $700 million in VC funding this year.
• 11/18 — Holmes gets prison time: Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes is sentenced to more than 11 years in prison for defrauding investors with her blood-testing startup, which prosecutors described as an elaborate, years-long fraud.
• 11/28 — Musk-Twitter deal closes: Elon Musk officially — and reluctantly — buys Twitter, just a day before a trial in Delaware Chancery Court is set to start in which the company aimed to force him to go through on his offer. Musk soon begins firing Twitter’s top executives and making deep cuts to its workforce, changes that in turn set off an advertiser revolt.
• 11/30 — ChatGPT says “hello, world”: OpenAI releases ChatGPT, its AI-powered chatbot, to the wider world, setting the tech world abuzz and renewing interest in artificial intelligence’s capabilities. While the robots aren’t (yet) taking our jobs, they are getting lots of funding from investors.
December
• Layoffs near 100K: By early December, at least 90,000 U.S. tech workers have lost their jobs this year. 
• 12/2 — Anduril locks in $1.5B raise: Defense tech startup Anduril, founded by Palmer Luckey, raises nearly $1.5 billion in a Series E round that values it at $8.5 billion. The company is one of the few VC-backed startups that do business with the Pentagon.
• 12/7 — Balwani gets 13 years: Elizabeth Holmes’ ex-boyfriend and former Theranos executive Sunny Balwani is sentenced to 13 years in prison for his involvement in the company.
• 12/12 — SBF arrested: FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is arrested in the Bahamas and charged with eight criminal counts. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler accuses Bankman-Fried of having “built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto.”
• 12/14 — Fed hikes rate again: The Federal Reserve hikes the federal funds rate to between 4.25% and 4.5% in its final 2022 rate increase, though the central bank signals it will continue to raise rates into 2023 as it struggles to tame inflation.

"
AI Buzzwords Beating Those For Web3 In Funded Startups,Joanna Glasner,2022/12/20,"

Startup funding is sometimes a lot like fashion. Some business plans are in vogue one season and out of style the next. Others show prolonged staying power.
In recent months, companies in the Web3 and broader crypto space are looking more like the first category. The FTX implosion, paired with steep declines in crypto asset prices, hasn’t killed investment, but it has dampened enthusiasm.

Artificial intelligence, meanwhile, looks to be in the class of categories with real staying power, and growing buzz to boot. The smash hit launch of ChatGPT, along with the slow-and-steady creep of AI tech into more real-life use cases, has fixated the attention of the tech world, including investors.
So how does that translate into funding? We attempted to find out using a Crunchbase analysis of key terms that funded startups use to describe themselves. The analysis looked at quarterly investment in startups with description buzzwords 1 in two categories: artificial intelligence and Web3.2
We looked to see whether startups touting AI technology are seeing more investment lately than those with Web3-associated businesses.
The findings? So far in Q4, startups with AI-related buzzwords in their business descriptions are collectively seeing a quarter-over-quarter rise in funding. Investment in Web3 startups is down quarter over quarter.
For perspective, we chart out funding to AI- and Web3-related buzzword companies for the past six quarters below.


As you can see, funding to both categories is down sharply from peaks hit in Q4 2021 and Q1 2022. This comes amid a broader downturn in global startup funding, from which few sectors have been spared.
The divergence in pathways shows up more recently, in the Q4 totals. This ties in with current events, as FTX’s collapse became widely known in November, followed by associated ripple effects, including crypto lender BlockFi’s bankruptcy filing later in the month.

Redaptive Nabs $200M As US Races To Lower Carbon Footprint,Keerthi Vedantam,2022/12/19,"

Redaptive, an energy efficiency startup, announced on Monday it raised $200 million from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board shortly after it scrapped plans to go public. 
The San Francisco-based company works with businesses to better conserve energy where it’s not needed, lowering utilities costs and making it easier for companies to meet various state- and country-wide goals to reduce the carbon footprint. 

The company runs an efficiency-as-a-service platform, or EaaS, using software to gauge how much energy is actually being used and making recommendations on how to better utilize that power. It can also install new lighting, water services or air conditioning that better track usage and meet carbon emission targets. 
“This investment is consistent with our focus on investing in best-in-class companies that are supporting the global energy transition by innovating in energy efficiency, sustainable energy, and the deployment of data solutions,” said Bruce Hogg, managing director and head of sustainable energies at CPP Investments.
VCs are a big fan of conserving energy
Funding for energy conservation startups has seen massive activity in 2022 despite the general private market slowdown. We’ve reported on Swell Energy’s $120 million raise in November, which uses real-time data to make decisions on power and electricity. More people visiting the office on Mondays than Wednesdays? Maybe Wednesday doesn’t need as much power. 


2022 is sustainable energy’s second-best year yet, and for good reason. The European Union is expected to impose strict tariffs on imports from countries with high emissions, which will impact American businesses. The Biden Administration concocted a similar proposal that would impose tariffs on metal made in high-emission settings (which would also favor domestic metal production). 
Companies from Microsoft to Apple have pledged to go either carbon neutral or carbon negative in the next few years to offset emissions that come from making their products. Over 350 companies have signed the Climate Pledge to reach net-zero carbon by 2040.

Funding Falls For Startups Fighting Cancer,Joanna Glasner,2022/12/19,"

If one thing could stay steady in this ever-fluctuating startup funding scene, you’d think it would be cancer investment.
Cancer still ranks as the second most common cause of death in America and a leading driver of mortality worldwide. And over past decades, we’ve seen startup innovation deliver lasting improvements to the arsenal of available medicines and diagnostic tools.

But no, that’s not how it works. The sharp downturn in startup funding between 2021 and 2022 extends to venture-backed companies working on cancer therapies and diagnostics.
Globally, companies in the space pulled in $8 billion in seed through growth-stage funding in 2022, according to a Crunchbase analysis of funded startups developing cancer drugs and tests, and associated medical devices. With the year winding to a close, that’s looking like a sharp decline from 2021, when $13.7 billion went into cancer-focused companies.
For a sense of where things stand, we charted out funding to cancer-focused startups over the past five years:


The year-over-year decline in 2022 largely mimics what we see across startup sectors. Global venture funding has been falling every quarter this year, culminating in Q3 numbers that were down 53% from year-ago levels.
As with other areas, late stage has shown the sharpest declines for cancer funding. Early stage has held up better, both for deal counts and total investment.
“There is still quite a lot of interest, especially in Series A and Series B,” said Luba Greenwood, managing partner at Binney Street Capital, a venture fund affiliated with Boston’s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.
What’s sputtered out is pre-IPO funding, as very few companies — in biotech or any other industry — are making it to public markets.
Where early stage is going
Data supports the notion that early stage is where it’s at. Half of the 10 largest cancer-focused funding rounds were Series A or B deals.
The biggest early-stage financing went to Treeline Biosciences, a developer of precision medicines that closed a $263 million Series A in October. Other big rounds include a $225 million Series B for Delfi Diagnostics, maker of tests for early cancer detection, and a $221 million Series B for ArsenalBio, a developer of advanced CAR T-cell therapies for solid tumors.
For a broader picture, we list the 10 largest 2022 rounds below:


Beyond moving earlier, Greenwood said investors are seeking out startups with novel approaches.
“We have spent so much money on the same me-too mechanisms. … Now, money is going to be concentrated in true innovation,” she said.
From Greenwood’s perspective, some of the most promising areas for novel innovation come from companies working on breakthroughs pertaining to cell state biology and the mechanism of differentiated cell death. She’s also optimistic about progress in the field of liquid biopsy, particularly for detecting cancer early and monitoring its progression.
To look at themes across our largest early-stage funding recipients, the term “precision” is the keyword of choice. Self-described immunotherapy startups also continue to draw significant funding, as they have for a number of years.
Still, funding is down some at seed and early stage this year, as the chart below illustrates:


Late stage and beyond
Funding declines at late stage are much more dramatic, as the chart below illustrates.


Beyond seed, early and late stage, we’re also seeing some contraction in investment at undisclosed-stage financings.
However, well-established startups that have been around awhile are getting some sizable financings. Freenome, a developer of blood tests for early cancer detection founded in 2014, landed $290 million from Roche early this year, bringing total investment to date to $1.1 billion.
What’s not happening are big rounds for companies on the cusp of a public offering. After dozens of cancer-focused companies took advantage of the wide-open IPO window in 2021, this year is a different story. Offerings have slowed to a crawl in recent months amid a broader downturn for biotech and health care stocks.
It doesn’t help that the Class of 2021 cancer-related IPOs haven’t been faring especially well. In a sample set of 20, the vast majority are currently trading well below early and peak share prices.
At the early stages, nonetheless, venture investors remain undeterred, per Greenwood, who observed: “Investors who invest in real science and real technologies that are curative for patients, we are not so invested in what’s going on in the public markets.”

"
A Letter To The Founder Who Has Yet To Raise Their First Big Round,Guest Author,2022/12/19,"

By Brett Queener 
Dear founder,
Your job is the same as it’s always been for founders at this stage. The only difference is that you have to actually achieve the validation required from investors early on. You have to do the hard work of finding some product-market fit whereby what you are building is something many people feel the need to purchase today.

It turns out, especially in a high-inflationary recessionary environment, this is hard and takes time. Rather than seeing this time as agony, take it as a gift. This is prime learning time. The more you know when you raise your first big round, the less apt you are to waste those funds.
Brett Queener, managing director at Bonfire Ventures
When it is time to raise money, you need to be crystal clear on the narrative (what you do and why people care), the opportunity (i.e., size of the market), and your traction (customers, ARR, etc.).  If you are looking to raise money from venture capitalists (which is not historically a cheap source of capital), then be honest with yourself: Do you have a real painkiller for your target customers? If not, keep at it until you do or consider alternative financing options instead of high-growth venture capital.
You also must not mess up the fundamentals of the round. If you are raising a pre-seed round, have pre-seed answers to the above, target pre-seed investors and raise a pre-seed type round. The same with seed.
Be crystal clear on where you will be as a business (realistically) after you have spent that amount of money in that round. I say this because I spend 50% of my time fixing start-up founders’ asks/assumptions for their fundraises. They fail at answering the most basic questions:

If you raise X amount of money in this round, where will your business be when that money is gone?
Why do you think those metrics are enough for the next stage investor?
What assumptions are you making to hit those metrics? Of those assumptions, which do you have the most confidence in and which do you need to learn/refine over the next 24 months?

Finally, when you think you are ready to raise, take the time to assess what type of investor you want.  Understand your own strengths, weaknesses and growth areas. Look for more than just money. If all goes well, you will be with this investor for over 10 years. Ask them how they will help you. Ask them how much of their fund is focused on follow-on investments. Ask them what happens if things don’t go as magical as you have shown in your P&L model.
The upside is, it is now unlikely that five companies trying to do the exact same thing as you will get over-funded and throw millions at the market, thereby inflating your cost of acquiring talent and customers. Only the strong will get funded and thrive — go be one of those.
You can do it.

Brett Queener is a managing director at Bonfire Ventures, an award-winning venture capital firm helping seed stage B2B software companies and founders beat the odds. Previously, he started his software career at Siebel Systems helping build a juggernaut of alliances and marketing organizations in the on-premise world and ran revenue operations, products, and larger acquired business units at Salesforce, and was COO of SmartRecruiters.

The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Group14 Adds To Big Series C; Dataiku And Snyk See Big Down Rounds,Chris Metinko,2022/12/16,"

This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.
It was a weird week. Two of the top four rounds were actually large down rounds and a third came with “restructuring” and layoff news. Not exactly what you expect when startups raise large rounds, but these are strange times indeed.

1. Group14 Technologies, $214M, batteries: Back in May, Woodinville, Washington-based Group14 Technologies announced a $400 million Series C led by Porsche AG. However, it apparently was far from done with the new round. This week, the manufacturer of advanced silicon battery technology, announced it had raised another $214 million from investors that included the Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund as part of the round. Group14 is dedicated to the “electrification of everything,” and has raised $650 million to date, per the company.
2. (tied) Dataiku, $200M, AI: This was a week for down rounds. New York-based Dataiku, an AI/ML platform developer for enterprises, closed a $200 million Series F led by Wellington Management at a $3.7 billion valuation. While that’s a high valuation, it represents a 20% drop from August 2021, when the startup raised a $400 million Series E at a $4.6 billion valuation. It’s fair to think Dataiku never planned on a Series F, and instead once thought their next round of funding would be an IPO. The company talked about such an event just back in March. The startup has now raised $600 million in primary funding.
2. (tied) Komodo Health, $200M, health care: It was reported this week that health data startup Komodo Health raised a “structured equity infusion” of $200 million led by Coatue Management. Along with the funding, it was also reported the company will be restructuring — laying off 9% of its workforce — and its CFO will be leaving for personal reasons at the end of the year. Similar to Dataiku’s hopes of an IPO, it was reported in March that Komodo was eyeing a summer listing. In March 2021, Komodo raised $220 million led by Tiger Global. The San Francisco-based startup has raised more than $500 million, per Crunchbase data.
4. Snyk, $196.5M, cybersecurity: As we said earlier, this was a week of downrounds. Boston-based application security developer Snyk raised a $196.5 million Series G led by Qatar Investment Authority at a $7.4 billion valuation. That’s a 13% drop from September 2021, when the company — which has now raised about $1 billion — closed a $530 million Series F co-led by Sands Capital Ventures and Tiger Global at an $8.5 billion valuation. The cyber startup — originally founded in Israel — also had long been rumored to be nearing an IPO before the public markets started falling. We will see if 2023 may be the year.
5. MasterControl, $150M, software: After 30 years, welcome to the unicorn club, MasterControl. The biotech SaaS startup closed a $150 million round led by Sixth Street at a $1.3 billion valuation — its first round since being founded nearly three decades ago. The company creates software for the life sciences industry to help companies navigate various research and development issues including supply chain and logistics problems. The company has worked with over 1,000 pharmaceutical, food and medtech companies over the past 30 years, including Pfizer, WD-40 and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
6. Nerdio, $117M, cloud computing: Chicago-based virtual desktop developer Nerdio raised a $117 million Series B from Updata Partners. Founded in 1998, the company has raised $125 million, according to Crunchbase.
7. HistoSonics, $85M, medical devices: Plymouth, Minnesota-based HistoSonics closed an $85 million round led by Johnson & Johnson for a device it says can destroy tumors in patients with liver cancer. Founded in 2009, the startup has raised nearly $227 million, according to Crunchbase.
8. Synchron, $75M, medical device: New York-based endovascular brain-computer interface startup Synchron raised a $75 million Series C led by Arch Venture Partners. Synchron says it has now raised a total of $145 million.
9. MessageGears, $62M, marketing: Atlanta-based customer engagement platform MessageGears raised a $62 million growth round led by Long Ridge Equity Partners. Founded in 2011, MessageGears has now raised $80 million, according to the company.
10. Shield AI, $60M, autonomous vehicles: San Diego-based Shield AI, a defense technology firm building AI pilots for aircraft, announced it raised an additional $40 million in equity from the US Innovative Technology Fund as part of its now $225 million Series E first announced in June. The round included $150 million in equity and $75 million in debt. Founded in 2015, the startup has raised nearly $575 million, according to Crunchbase.
Big global deals
The biggest round of the week came from a startup just north of the U.S.

Canada-based Svante, a developer of carbon capture technology, raised a $318 million Series E.

Methodology
We tracked the largest rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of Dec. 10 to 16. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

"
Truly Terrible SPACs Trade At Lower Lows At Year End,Joanna Glasner,2022/12/16,"

For anyone looking to evaporate a large pile of money, the past year has presented abundant options. Of those, one of the faster and more effective methods involved investing in tech companies going public via SPAC.
As we’ve documented several times over the past few quarters, venture-backed companies that went public via SPAC deals have mostly posted exceedingly poor returns. As we revisit a previously curated list of truly terrible SPAC performers, it’s clear they’re closing out the year at a particularly low point.

How bad? Out of a selected set of 50 completed SPAC deals, at least 24 were trading below $1 per share 1. Because most blank-check companies initially price at $10 per share, that means they’re down 90% or more to date.
Here’s a list2 of the 24 sub-$1 names from our sample:


No sector has been spared, as one can see from the broad array of industries represented among these beaten-down stocks. It includes autonomous driving (Embark, AEye), electric vehicles (Faraday Future, Lightning eMotors, Xos), telehealth (Babylon, Talkspace), and real estate (Offerpad, Doma), among others.
What’s also noteworthy is that the vast majority are trading at a lower point than they were a couple quarters ago. So no, things aren’t looking up yet.
And that’s not the worst
And trading below $1 isn’t necessarily the worst fate for a troubled SPAC. A few others have either declared bankruptcy or sold to acquirers for an even smaller pittance of their former price. 
One of the higher-profile casualties was Enjoy Technology, a mobile retail company founded by former Apple store executive Ron Johnson, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June. The company had previously raised more than $230 million in known venture funding from backers including Kleiner Perkins, Oak Investment Partners and L Catterton, and another $250 million from SPAC investors.
In the biotech space, meanwhile, Clarus Therapeutics, a developer of androgen-based medicines that went public in September 2021, is also winding down. The company announced in September that it has filed for Chapter 11 and is selling its sole commercial asset, a therapeutic for testosterone deficiency.
Metromile, the pay-per-mile car insurance provider, also took a hit. The one-time unicorn sold to fellow insurtech Lemonade at a valuation representing a roughly 95% cut from Metromile’s peak public share price.
Rounding out the list, Carlotz, a used car marketplace, sold this month to Shift Technologies, a used auto e-commerce platform trading for 23 cents a share, in a deal that appears to be valued at roughly $20 million. Carlotz previously raised over $160 million in venture and SPAC-related financing.
Any success stories out there?
No company on our sample list of 50 currently has shares trading above the $10 break-even threshold for SPAC deals. The top performer — consumer health platform Hims & Hers — was recently trading at a little over $7.
Meanwhile, there are 15 companies with shares between $1 and $2, listed below:


The remaining companies on our list are trading between $2 and $7. 
This story isn’t over
For anyone who binge-watches drama shows, the SPAC plotline is looking sort of familiar. We’re at that point where the protagonist is looking outmatched and on the cusp of defeat. 
If this was Hollywood, of course, the protagonist would suddenly summon the strength for a big comeback, overcome foes and declare victory. But we’re in the real world, where this kind of underdog story only occasionally plays out. 
At any rate, this does look like the back-against-the-wall moment for many SPACs. It’d be nice if 2023 could bring us some of those much-awaited dramatic turnarounds.

Survey Says: Crunchbase News Readers Preparing For Recession In 2023,Marlize van Romburgh,2022/12/16,"

A recession is more likely than not in 2023, Crunchbase News readers surveyed predict, though they’re much less pessimistic about the prospects at their own companies.

Still, most say their companies are cutting costs, and headcount is the No. 1 expenditure on the chopping block.
Recession fears rise
More than 82% of the 294 readers who responded to our recent survey put better-than-even odds on a global recession in 2023.
More than half of those who responded to our survey are in the tech or software industries, while the next largest share (10%) are in banking or finance.


In comments, several readers said they believe the world economy is already in a downturn — maybe even one that started in early 2022.
Another noted that this time feels different: “This is such a weird-ass economic period that we are in that it can’t (currently) be defined by traditional recession attributes,” the reader wrote. “When it all shakes out, this time period will need to be the standard bearer of a new category — one that is highlighted by uneven highs and lows that are felt differently across the globe.”
Yet others feel like investors are overreacting. “I think there’s a big disconnect between where investors think the economy is going and where everyone else thinks it’s going,” said one reader who identified as an owner or executive in the tech industry. “Investors are running for the hills. Everyone else is being cautious. It’s beyond bizarre.”
Companies cut costs, starting with jobs
A bit under half — 40.5% — of respondents said their companies are cutting costs. Another third said spending is staying about the same. Only 17.7% said their companies are increasing costs.


Among those businesses cutting costs, the biggest expenditure on the chopping block is headcount: More than 58% said their companies are conducting layoffs. That’s not surprising — at last count, U.S. tech employers have already slashed at least 90,000 jobs so far this year, according to a Crunchbase News tally.
Other big areas where companies are cutting costs include employee travel — more than half of readers surveyed said their businesses are slashing travel budgets — professional services, real estate costs, and software and other digital services.
Don’t expect a new company mug this year, either. Almost a third of readers said their companies are cutting back on free swag for employees.


“We are looking at the return we obtain from each discretionary spend to ensure we get value from it and to determine if there are other options that are less expensive but deliver the same or equivalent returns,” wrote a reader who identified as an executive, founder or business owner in the tech industry. “It is not the cost we are now looking at but the value proposition associated with each discretionary spend item.”
Optimism abounds at company level
Still, readers are much more upbeat about their own companies than they are about the global economy at large. While more than 8 out of 10 readers surveyed say a global recession is likely in 2023, more than 1 in 6 still rate their company’s financial prospects next year on the optimistic side.


“All of this doom and gloom is getting lumped into one big overarching theme — the reality is that given how tight the labor market is for skilled professionals, there will no doubt continue to be ‘winners’ in what will likely be a soft 2023 overall,” wrote one reader, who identified as working in sales in the professional services industry. “And given the tightness of the market, the moment the Fed decides to slow/halt their increases, the growth engines will no doubt be fighting to get ahead of the pack.”
Job hopping declines as purse strings tighten
Still, it seems the job market has swung back in employers’ favor. Fewer than 2 in 10 readers surveyed said they’re extremely likely to seek out a new role in 2023, while almost 40% overwhelmingly expect to stay in their current position.


Unsurprisingly, readers are also more cautious about their personal finances. Half of those surveyed said they’re cutting back on personal spending.
One reader noted that they’re “waiting to buy a new home until the housing market corrects.”
Still, a full third of survey respondents said they’re not reining in household or personal expenses.
 


“I think consumer spending will stay the same for 2023,” said another reader. “However, people will tighten up their budgeting.”
What else is on readers’ minds

Glass half full: “A down market will be an up year for us. Startups and small business need capital. As VCs pull back and bank loans become less appealing, companies will turn online for access to capital from their customers, friends, family, and followers. While average investor check sizes will be smaller, demand for capital among issuers is poised to be the greatest ever. We also predict that investors who want liquidity from their private company investments will leverage secondary trading platforms. Discounts are to be expected but this will bring into focus the ability for investors with unrestricted securities to find liquidity elsewhere without having to wait for a merger, sale, or IPO.”

— Executive/owner/founder in banking/finance
 

Recession: Not if, but how big: “The big unknown is the length and depth of the pending recession. Consumer spending is now back on the consumer to fund, which will further stall GDP.”

— CEO coach/adviser
 

Staying alive: “I treat every year like it’s a recession already. This should have little impact on business for truly lean operations.”

— Executive/owner/founder in software/tech
 

Keep calm and carry on: “Venture investors are running for the hills screaming about the impending doom (I’m looking at you Sequoia). The rest of us are standing around wondering if they’re geniuses or idiots. In the meantime, we’re just getting on with business.”

— Executive/owner/founder in software/tech

Methodology
Results are from a survey of Crunchbase News readers conducted between Nov. 29 and Dec. 13, 2022, in which 294 readers responded. Readers self-identified their industries and roles and were not required to answer all questions to complete the survey.

MasterControl’s $150M Series A Launches It To Unicorn Status,Keerthi Vedantam,2022/12/15,"

A decades-old biotech SaaS startup announced its first round of funding on Thursday. With it came a $1.3 billion valuation.
MasterControl, a Salt Lake City-based company that provides software to manage the development of life science products, raised $150 million in the round led by Sixth Street. The already profitable company has worked with over 1,000 names in pharmaceuticals, food and medtech over the past 30 years, including Pfizer, WD-40 and Thermo Fisher Scientific.

The company offers software for the myriad of inefficiencies that occur in the drugmaking pipeline and in life sciences in general, which force companies to spend more time and money in development instead of going to market and turning a profit.
A complicated product development cycle
We’ve talked in-depth about the manufacturing issues that plague pharma and biotech, which lead to billions of dollars sunk into treatments that often come out on the other side with a 90% failure rate. But drugs aren’t a unique industry in this regard — companies in the life sciences are facing supply shortages, logistics issues and steep safety requirements that beget the need for enterprise software that organizes every step of the process.
These problems have “led us to attack inefficiencies in quality and manufacturing that were extending product research and delivery cycles. We see an urgent need to help our customers to deliver their breakthrough technologies to the market faster and at a lower cost,” said Jonathan Beckstrand, CEO of MasterControl. “Our goal is to add a strategic partner with resources and expertise to help us to meet the significant need for our solutions.”
MasterControl started off as a document-control startup aimed at helping medical companies navigate requirements from the Food and Drug Administration.
Now, the company offers platforms that tackle supply chains, regulatory paperwork, distributed clinical trials and product development. Funding will go toward building predictive technology that can forecast the quality of events before a clinical trial or manufacturing plan is put into place, as well as developing automation tools in the manufacturing process.

"As OpenAI Reportedly Aims For $1B In Revenue By 2024, A Closer Look At Who’s Backing The Biggest Names In AI",Marlize van Romburgh,2022/12/15,"

OpenAI, the organization behind the buzzy artificial intelligence bots ChatGPT and DALL-E, projects that it will be able to generate $1 billion in revenue by 2024, Reuters reports.
Citing sources briefed on OpenAI’s recent pitch to investors, Reuters said the San Francisco-based organization expects $200 million in revenue in 2023 and $1 billion by 2024. OpenAI makes money by charging developers to license its technology to generate text and images.
OpenAI was co-founded in 2015 by Elon Musk, Sam Altman and others. It first drew mainstream attention for DALL-E, an AI that can create detailed, realistic images (whether to call them “art” is a matter of debate) in any style of almost any subject, based on written prompts from users.

Last month, OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT to the public. The chatbot, which can perform search queries and write entire essays based on prompts, immediately garnered attention in the tech and media worlds — not least from writers worried it’s so good, it could soon replace us.
Big bucks go to AI
Artificial intelligence as a whole is one of the most heavily funded startup sectors. Funding to AI startups in recent years has accounted for as much as 10% of all global venture capital dollars invested, Crunchbase data shows. Last year, nearly $70 billion in venture capital went to AI startups worldwide.


Along with OpenAI, the most highly valued startups in the space include data and AI company Databricks (valued at $38 billion), driverless auto company Cruise ($30 billion), and AI writing assistant service Grammarly ($13 billion). 
OpenAI alone has raised more than $1 billion in venture funding, according to Crunchbase data, with Microsoft as its largest investor. Khosla Ventures, Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global, Y Combinator and Bedrock Capital have also provided capital. 
The organization was recently valued at $20 billion in a secondary sale of its shares, Reuters reported. Its supporters see potential for its technology to generate huge amounts of revenue by automating even creative tasks like writing and design. 
Still, several prominent VC firms declined to invest earlier this year, “questioning if it could justify a higher valuation or compete with rivals like Alphabet Inc.-owned Google,” Reuters reported, citing sources familiar with OpenAI’s fundraising efforts. (Though the report didn’t say, it’s reasonable to assume OpenAI’s unusal cap on venture returns played a role in investor reticence as well: In 2019, OpenAI switched to a “capped profit” structure that limit the returns for its investors to 100x, or possibly less in the future.)
Microsoft also provides OpenAI with computing power. The software giant has reportedly considered increasing its stake in OpenAI, believing that its artificial intelligence technology could generate business for Microsoft’s cloud business as more companies embrace AI and automation.
“We’re going to see advances in 2023 that people two years ago would have expected in 2033,” Microsoft President Brad Smith told Reuters in an interview. “It’s going to be extremely important not just for Microsoft’s future, but for everyone’s future.”

Asia Crypto Lender Amber Group Latest To Feel Effects Of FTX’s Collapse,Chris Metinko,2022/12/15,"

Singapore-based Amber Group is the latest firm to get caught in the chilling aftermath of FTX’s spectacular fall.
One of Asia’s biggest lenders and trading platforms of crypto has canceled performance-based bonuses for 2022 due to slower growth and market uncertainty, per a report by Bloomberg.

Last week the news service reported the firm will slash its workforce to fewer than 400 from its current 700 employees. The company’s employment peaked earlier this year at 1,100.
In addition, it was reported the crypto platform was to pause raising a $100 million funding round. Crypto funding has been down of late.
Amber last raised a $200 million Series B+ round in February led by investment company Temasek, with participation from existing shareholders including Sequoia China, Pantera Capital, Tiger Global Management, Tru Arrow Partners and Coinbase Ventures among others.
The round valued the company at $3 billion. Amber has raised a total of $328 million, per the company.
Fallout from FTX’s fall
Amber is just the latest to announce cuts after FTX’s collapse.
Early last month, FTX saw a run of withdrawals after prices on its own token dropped like a rock. Despite being the fourth-largest crypto exchange at the time, the FTX empire was thrown into bankruptcy — with allegations CEO and founder Sam Bankman-Fried used customer deposits on the exchange to invest with his Alameda Research hedge fund platform.
The fall has set off an FTX-induced contagion in the industry. Just this month, crypto exchanges Kraken, Bybit and Swyftx announced they would be laying off 30% or more of their staff. In a letter to employees, Swyftx’s CEO cited the possibility of more “black swan-type events” and trading volumes likely falling in the first half of 2023 as reasons for the cuts, according to Bloomberg.
Federal prosecutors have charged Bankman-Fried with eight criminal counts after arresting him in the Bahamas on Monday. In addition, the SEC filed charges against Bankman-Fried for “orchestrating a scheme to defraud equity investors,” while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed charges against Bankman-Fried, FTX and Alameda Research for fraud and material misrepresentations.

Coinbase Ventures: What The Most Active Investor In Crypto And Blockchain Has To Say About The FTX Fallout,Gené Teare,2022/12/15,"

What does the world’s most active crypto and blockchain investor make of the spectacular collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX?
In the wake of FTX’s disintegration, we spoke with Shan Aggarwal, head of corporate development at cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and head of its venture investment arm, Coinbase Ventures, on what the collapse means for his firm and the industry’s future.

Shan Aggarwal, head of corporate development at Coinbase and head of Coinbase Ventures
Coinbase Ventures has amassed a portfolio of more than 400 companies since 2018. That includes FTX, which it invested in during its $900 million Series B in 2021, along with 59 other investors.
We had an extended conversation with Aggarwal about the investment outlook for Coinbase Ventures, the impact of the FTX fallout on his firm’s portfolio, the wider ramifications for the crypto industry, and the strongest use case for crypto today.
The following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity.
What is Coinbase Ventures’ outlook on the industry in relation to the collapse of FTX?
Aggarwal: I think the collapse of FTX is very much a seminal moment in crypto, probably one of the largest cases of corporate fraud that have existed in business anywhere. As you’d expect from my perspective, we’ve seen the venture funding conditions tighten quite a bit as a lot of investors are looking to figure out the true extent of the fallout.
The silver lining we look at is that the FTX collapse actually motivates a lot of individuals to learn about and explore decentralized technologies, which are exactly the types of things that we are investing in. Ultimately, the goal and the mission of Coinbase is to create more economic freedom in the world.
Post-FTX, you saw a significant spike in volumes on DEXes, and Ledger recorded a record number of sales for their self-custodial hardware wallets.
I think our general outlook is: It’s a pretty jaw-dropping and eye-opening display of corporate fraud. It shakes consumer confidence in a lot of ways, and likely contributes to some of the negative narratives that have existed around crypto in the past.
But at the same time, in many ways it’s very validating for the technology and for the core ethos of why decentralized technologies need to exist in this world.
How does it impact your investing strategy going forward?
Aggarwal: It doesn’t impact or change our investment strategy too much. We have been investing actively in the space since 2018.
Our viewpoint, and our focus, has always been investing in the best and the brightest founders who are building the future protocols and applications that we believe are going to be consequential in the future of this space. I think what it has done is created more of an emphasis on understanding corporate governance — the ways that a lot of the startups that we are investing in are managed.
Are there other sectors which are weakened in crypto, based on the current environment — like the crypto lending space?
Aggarwal: First and foremost, we think about the dichotomy between centralized platforms and decentralized platforms. So the biggest category of companies that have been negatively affected are centralized platforms — that includes centralized exchanges, centralized custodians and centralized lending desks. Those businesses are largely based on trust. And a lot of trust has been shaken across the industry. And it’s a shame to see one actor and one entity have this type of a ripple effect, because it’s not indicative of the overall industry.
What conversations are you going through with portfolio companies to support them at this point?
Aggarwal: We’re checking in with all of our portfolio companies, obviously, to get a sense of who has been directly impacted, who has not been directly impacted.
Regardless of the companies who have not been directly impacted, given the size and magnitude of FTX and the collapse, most entities in the group or space had some indirect exposure. Maybe they had some clients that had funds that were tied up on FTX, or they did business with FTX in some capacity.
So there’s going to be some adjustments that firms potentially need to make on how they operate their business.
Have you gone through a revaluation based on the market correction of your portfolio companies?
Aggarwal: We do it on roughly a quarterly basis. We don’t disclose the valuation results or exercises publicly. So we haven’t done one as a direct result of the FTX fallout. We will, as we enter the end of December and look into the end of Q4.
In your Q3 update, you said you might be reducing your position in certain companies or projects. What does that mean?
Aggarwal: Coinbase Ventures was born in the last bear market. We started the firm in the first half of 2018 right as the crypto cycle turned. We now maintain a portfolio of nearly 400 companies. Many of those companies have gone on to launch tokens.
We’ve always said we are long-term holders and we’ve continued to be supportive of all those companies. But next year will be our 5-year anniversary. In that period, we have never once sold a single token position. Some of our portfolio companies have been acquired that did not have a token, and so obviously we’ve exited those positions.
But as we look to the next phase of Coinbase Ventures’ lifecycle, we may selectively choose to sell certain of our positions, if that opportunity becomes available to us, to realize the return. But then also to have more capital available that we can recycle to future innovations in this space.
Have you written down FTX to zero?
Aggarwal: Yes, we have.
Coinbase Ventures is the most active investor in crypto and blockchain, based on Crunchbase data. Does this mean you’re in a place where you’re slowing down in the shorter term, or is this the time to invest more?
Aggarwal: We look at this as a generational opportunity to invest in crypto startups right now. And I am very excited in a lot of ways, because when these moments happen, a lot of the noise and a lot of the excess in the space gets flushed out.
And what you’re left with is missionaries — not mercenaries — and founders who were really investing in the space for the right reason. They’re building products for the right reason. And ultimately, when we take that longer-term view, those are the exact individuals that we want to align ourselves with. Those are the exact individuals that we want to invest in.
Do you think we are going to see a house of cards with the collapse of FTX?
Aggarwal: I do think that you’ll see the failure of future firms that we have not seen rise up into the mainstream media as yet. And I think a lot more will come out around other businesses that had business endeavors with FTX, and they may be in a predicament now where they’re unable to recoup some capital or have been affected.
I think we will continue to see other firms rise up and become public that are struggling, and will ultimately be dominoes that fall as a result of it, and I think you’ll see that for the next few quarters.
Candidly, it’s not something where you’ll have a secular washout and then everything is great. It’ll be sort of a slower drip.
Is it responsible to have a venture fund investing money from Coinbase, if it’s not a profitable company?
Aggarwal: I think about them as two separate relationships. When you say profitable: I think of the P&L, the income statement, and that’s on an annual basis. We’re not profitable today. We haven’t been for the past few quarters. We were very profitable last year, but those are points in time.
We also have a large balance sheet. And that balance sheet gives us flexibility to invest in the core business. It also gives us flexibility to acquire other firms or to invest in other firms, because we believe that as a strategic initiative that is gonna provide capital appreciation back to Coinbase, and/or help us enter new business lines or geographies.
And Coinbase has custodial accounts?
Aggarwal: You can think about us as a diversified crypto platform: an exchange, brokerage and custodian. And then we also have a suite of purely software-based products that largely are oriented around and toward developers. So in some ways the businesses were similar in terms of what we did, facilitating the buying and selling of crypto assets. In many ways they were very different.
An example of the ways that our platform is very different is we do not allow our customers to take leveraged positions in any way, shape or form. FTX enabled their customers to take up to 100x leveraged positions. So, for example, if a customer only had $1 they could take on a position that gave them $100 of exposure. That type of trading tends to be riskier in general. There is a chance for significant growth and capital appreciation, but also a high chance for significant losses. So we’re very different from that perspective.
Another way is Coinbase is based in the U.S., is a public company that has financials published on a quarterly basis, detailed financials that are blessed by our auditors. If you look at those financials, you will see a corresponding asset and a corresponding liability that show our customer assets and our customer liabilities held one to one. You can always verify that. So it is very, very transparent, and fully disclosed and verified by third parties that are blessed by our regulators. So there are certainly similarities between the businesses. There are quite a few differences as well.
Does that mean people are moving away from custodial counts overall? Are you seeing that trend? 
Aggarwal: It’s hard to say in the aggregate. We have noticed  a spike in interest in decentralized technologies and self-custodial services. The good thing about that for Coinbase and Coinbase businesses is, we offer self-custodial services. We have a Coinbase wallet product, which is a purely self-custodial wallet product where the user owns and controls the private keys to their crypto. And we have a range of other products that are custodial in nature as well, but customers have greater trust in.
We’ve seen that the narratives we have been preaching about Coinbase since the moment it was founded, is that we consider ourselves to be the safest and most trusted exchange for a number of reasons. And that narrative is largely being reinforced in many ways by the events of the past month or so.
What’s the strongest use case that you see for crypto?
Aggarwal: One of the areas that we’re very excited about investing in now is actually crypto-based rewards programs.
So you might have noticed, even just today that Starbucks launched its Odyssey program, which is Starbucks’ loyalty program launched with crypto-based rewards. I don’t know how many millions of users use Starbucks or have a Starbucks loyalty app, but I know it is a very significant population and that Starbucks is a globally recognized blue-chip brand that many other brands will take a lot of inspiration from.
And you need these small sparks to expose people to crypto to understand what it is. Once you understand what it is, the fear factor, the natural human response of engaging and or doing more with it, goes down.
Then beyond that, we’re seeing very interesting behavior and activity in things like Web3 and consumer social platforms, particularly with what’s unfolding with Twitter. People are thinking, “Is there an alternative platform where maybe I, as a creator, own my own data, I own my own audience?” There’s some platforms that we have invested in that are in line with that thesis, like Farcaster.
Is there anything we didn’t cover that you’d like to?
Aggarwal: These types of volatile periods have existed before, and the technology has always risen and continued to exist, and it’s risen to new heights.
In the near term, what we are focused on is building amazing products that abstract away the complexity of crypto and can get consumers invested in crypto. And then from an investment product, we believe that some of the best founders who are in it for the right reasons are starting companies today. So we’re very excited to partner with and invest in those companies.

HistoSonics Nabs $85M For Device To ‘Liquify’ Tumors,Keerthi Vedantam,2022/12/14,"

If you can prove your product with clinical data, the funding will follow.
HistoSonics, a medical device company, illustrated this on Tuesday with $85 million in funding led by Johnson & Johnson for a futuristic device it says could demolish tumors in patients with liver cancer. Additional participation came from Venture Investors, Yonjin Venture and Lumira Ventures.

HistoSonics says its device, named Edison (not to be confused with the Edison blood testing device championed by defunct Theranos), pulses bubbles through the human tissue that explode, breaking apart the tumor. It’s a noninvasive process called histotripsy.
HistoSonics completed a series of clinical trials and sent promising data over to the FDA. It expects to launch the Edison next year and is already developing clinical trials that target kidney tumors and pancreatic tumors.
One device to rule them all
HistoSonics and similar platforms are streamlining a new path to profitability: make one device that can do many things. 
Instead of developing multiple drugs or devices to target a slew of different types of tumors, the Edison platform could, theoretically, be used for tumors across the board. This saves the company on research and development costs, and the platform can make money while the startup pursues clinical trials for other use cases. 
“I have been following HistoSonics’ progress for years and believe that histotripsy offers a unique non-invasive solution capable of addressing a variety of significant unmet clinical needs,” Erica Rogers, the president and CEO of Silk Road Medical and HistoSonics board member, said in a statement.
Earlier in March, medical robotics startup Quantum Surgical received FDA clearance for its ablation device that attacks tumors in the liver, and the company was quick to begin pursuing studies that would test the device on other organs as well.

December’s Down Rounds Could Be A Harbinger,Chris Metinko,2022/12/14,"

There has been a lot of talk about down rounds and dropping valuations for startups since about the second quarter of this year, but examples of such picked up this week as startups looked to add cash before the end of the year at slashed prices.

Three well-known unicorns all announced deals this week that sliced into their valuation and dropped investors’ portfolio values.

Boston-based cybersecurity startup Snyk raised a $196.5 million Series G at a $7.4 billion valuation. That’s a 13% drop from September 2021, when the company — which  has now raised about $1 billion — closed a $530 million Series F at a $8.5 billion valuation.
New York-based Dataiku, an AI/ML platform developer for enterprises, closed a $200 million Series F at a $3.7 billion valuation. That represents a 20% drop from August 2021, when the startup raised a $400 million Series E at a $4.6 billion valuation.
London-based payment startup Checkout.com reportedly cut its internal valuation to approximately $11 billion last month, the Financial Times reported. The company previously was valued at $40 billion in January, when it raised a $1 billion Series D. That’s a whopping 73% drop in value. Checkout.com has raised about $1.8 billion — its backers include Tiger Global Management and GIC — according to Crunchbase.

Another large round reported this week — health data startup Komodo Health raising a “structured equity infusion” of $200 million led by Coatue Management — also came with some bad news. The company announced it would be restructuring — laying off 9% of its workforce — and its CFO would be leaving for personal reasons at the end of the year, it was reported.
In March 2021, Komodo had raised $220 million led by Tiger.
What it means
One of the things all these companies have in common is they raised large rounds in the salad days of 2021. Investors have said time and time again this year that companies may be able to avoid down rounds — which can cause board tension and lessen employee morale — because of the large amount of cash they raised last year when times were good and had extended their runway for years.
However, these are just some examples of companies this week alone that apparently saw a need to raise money less than 2 years after raising large rounds at larger valuations.
No doubt some of these companies likely thought their next round of financing would be an IPO. For example, it was reported in March that Komodo was eyeing a summer listing.  However, with the IPO pipeline line frozen — and perhaps no Plan B — a down round was the next best, and maybe only, option.
Of course, not all the news was bad on the funding scene. Elon Musk’s SpaceX is selling employee and investor shares via a tender offer which will value the company at $140 billion, Bloomberg reported. It was valued at $125 billion in a funding round earlier this year.
But not all companies are SpaceX, and seeing companies that raised big just in 2021 already accepting down rounds could foreshadow a scary 2023.

Digital Health Startups Exploded During COVID – A Playbook For Tougher Times Ahead,Guest Author,2022/12/14,"

By Robert Krayn
COVID proved how indispensable telehealth is to mental health care. Nearly 40% of American adults reported anxiety or depression symptoms in 2021, up from 10% in 2019. Virtual care was crucial in treating the mental health of millions of Americans and making clinical expertise more accessible nationwide.

And while society regains some semblance of normalcy, data shows many patients intend to continue using telehealth for their mental health care. In fact, psychiatry remains the only health specialty in which the percentage of virtual care bookings remains higher than peak pandemic booking levels.
A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to innovate behavioral health
The current state of flux gives us the rare opportunity to build on telehealth successes and learn from areas where access to care fell short. It offers a moment to construct a better path forward for the entire mental health care system.
Robert Krayn of Talkiatry
The market has confirmed that anyone can build a booking platform. But the key differentiator that sets an innovative health care company apart is the visible participation of physicians.
Startups, in particular, succeed when they have clinical experts as founders, in the C-suite, and on staff who understand that everything centers around the quality of care. Their presence ensures consistency in treatment, medication management and the focus on improved patient outcomes. That focus on outcomes is what keeps patients, providers and payors coming back. And that’s good for people and for the health care industry.
Green flags to look for in a digital health company
The pandemic-strained market reinforced the notion that you can’t be Uber for mental health care outside of low-acuity populations. (Read: patients with easy-to-meet medical needs that don’t require a physician’s care or expertise.) That model may succeed in business, but it’s not viable in pursuit of solving America’s mental health crisis. And after two years of data, tightened regulations and consumer scrutiny, we have a greater understanding of what’s been most effective in the market.
A few questions to consider: Does the company refer to people as patients instead of customers or users? Do they prioritize hiring high-quality providers over a laser focus on patient acquisition? Do they concentrate on solving the problem for each part of the ecosystem (payors, providers and patients) in tandem? Is a clinical leadership structure in place to oversee the company’s dedication to improved patient outcomes? Is the company staffed with full-time W-2 employees or independent contractors?
If the answer is a resounding yes to some or all of the above, then it’s likely the startup is a health care provider and not a booking platform with a sleek look and additional bells and whistles.
Long-term vision is the answer
When incentives other than the quality of care become the top priority, an hour’s intake drops to 20 minutes, follow-up appointments are skipped, and subscriptions are automatically shipped.
Then you begin to see startups that are supposed to be providing care with their logos on prescription bottles, potentially creating misaligned incentives. Ultimately, you get a race to the bottom where patients, payors and providers lose out as ethical guardrails and regulatory lines are blurred.
Differentiating only on price or brand is how Airbnb or Lyft compete. A behavioral health care startup should differentiate on quality of care.
Payors and insurers are embracing digital health care companies focused on high-quality care led by physicians because it works. We’re seeing several global corporations making significant investments in directly providing care. Walgreens made a $5.2 billion investment in VillageMD, a massive physician organization. Amazon acquired primary care physician powerhouse, One Medical, and CVS acquired 10,000-clinician strong provider group Signify Health.
A few years into the pandemic, national and global corporations are betting on physician-led networks’ long-term vision and success to move the needle in digital health care.
Startups are in a prime position to support that vision with mental and behavioral health innovation. But they need to shape business models around the quality of care, rather than price or brand, and attract top clinical talent to truly advance America’s mental health care system.

Robert Krayn is the co-founder and CEO of Talkiatry, a leading provider of high-quality, in-network psychiatric care and one of the largest employers of psychiatrists in the United States. Prior to co-founding Talkiatry, Krayn spent five years as vice president and senior analyst at an investment management firm.

Most Active US Investors In November: Techstars And Gaingels Lead The Way As Growth Giants Are MIA,Chris Metinko,2022/12/14,"

This is a monthly feature that runs down the most active investors in U.S.-based companies, looks at some of their most interesting investments, and includes some odds and ends of who spent what. Check out last month’s feature here.
November was another down month in venture, as VCs continue to pull back in a chilly market.
The current state of the market seems to have frozen the wallets of some big-named VC firms that went big last year. In November 2021, Tiger Global made 25 deals. Last month that number dropped to five.

Similarly, General Catalyst took part in 19 funding rounds in November of last year. The VC giant took part in only a half-dozen last month.
The lack of firms doing a few dozen in a month allowed a couple accelerators — Techstars Workforce Development Accelerator and Y Combinator — to claim two of the top four spots.
In fact, only three firms made a dozen or more deals last month. It makes you curious as to what December — usually a slow month — may bring.
Techstars Workforce Development Accelerator, 13 deals
The accelerator announced its newest class of startups looking to use innovative technologies to shake up the labor market. There were several interesting companies looking to change the way anything from recruiting to career development can be accomplished.
One of the startups included in the latest batch announced early last month was Skylyte, which provides burnout awareness and burnout training to help keep employees happy and healthy.
The company — which thinks of itself as a “digital chief wellness officer” — uses data to track behavior changes and mood trends to follow team health. While obviously benefiting their employee, it also can benefit the company by cutting down on employee churn and increasing productivity.
The pandemic showed how unhappy many are in the working world and some of the mental health challenges people face. In a still tight labor market, tracking work burnout is something some employers may want to look into.
Gaingels, 13 deals
Gaingels makes it back to this list after a month away.
One of its baker’s dozen of investments last month included a pretty big $20 million seed round for Seattle-based aerospace startup Gravitics.
However, the company isn’t just any aerospace startup — it develops space station modules. Its StarMax module provides up to 400 cubic meters of habitable volume. That is nearly half the volume of the International Space Station in just one StarMax module. The modules are also compatible to launch on any of the several vehicles now rocketing to space.
As space becomes more and more accessible, we’ll want to stretch and spread out. Gravitics may allow us to do that.
Andreessen Horowitz, 12 deals
Andreessen Horowitz is another good example of a firm that went big last year, but somewhat smaller now. It took part in 22 rounds in November 2021, but only a dozen last month.
However, it did participate in some interesting rounds. Always big on crypto and Web3 startups, the round that caught our eye hit a little closer to home for us.
The firm took part in a seed round for the just-launched Post News, a social media platform that publishes news. The platform is trying to be a more civilized social media site (yes, good luck with that) and focus on writing and news.
The site will look to offer articles “different premium news providers” users can buy (yes, actually paying for news!) and curate more civil discourse.
It’s both sad and funny that these concepts seem so novel in today’s world, but they do. With Twitter in chaos, maybe now is the time for more alternatives.
Y Combinator, 11 deals
The accelerator giant was busy in November and again invested in some diverse offerings. That included participating in a $7 million seed round for Courtyard, a platform that provides liquidity through NFTs for collectibles.
So how does it work? Good question. You ship your collectable — like a valuable baseball card or comic book — and the San Francisco-based startup authenticates it and stores it. Courtyard then will create a “connected collectible” — think NFT — that you can then trade on blockchain.
Each time your connected collectible is sold after the initial sale, you will still receive 1% of each future sale until the physical collectible is finally redeemed. If you are the original owner and don’t sell the NFT, you can redeem it back for your physical collectible with no withdrawal fees.
With the popularity of NFTs waning, who knows if it’ll last? But it’s an interesting model that allows collectors to receive passive income.
Also notable

Hawaii-based Elemental Excelerator and New York-based BoxGroup came in next on the list with eight and seven deals, respectively.
Techstars Workforce Development Accelerator led or co-led the most rounds in November with 13. Andreessen Horowitz came in next with nine rounds led or co-led.
Bain Capital Life Sciences led or co-led rounds totaling the most dollars for the month. The firm led or co-led two rounds that totaled nearly $400 million — including biotech startup Emalex Biosciences’ $250 million Series D.

Bankman-Fried Indicted On Criminal Conspiracy And Fraud Charges; Sued Over ‘House Of Cards’,Chris Metinko,2022/12/13,"

Federal prosecutors have charged disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried with eight criminal counts after his arrest in the Bahamas on Monday.

In addition, the SEC filed charges against Bankman-Fried for “orchestrating a scheme to defraud equity investors.”
Meanwhile, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed charges against Bankman-Fried, FTX and his hedge fund Alameda Research for fraud and material misrepresentations in connection with the sale of digital commodities in interstate commerce.
“We allege that Sam Bankman-Fried built a house of cards on a foundation of deception while telling investors that it was one of the safest buildings in crypto,” said SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a statement.
The federal indictment — unsealed Tuesday — charges Bankman-Fried with widespread fraud as he built his FTX empire. He faces charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud, individual charges of securities fraud and wire fraud, money laundering and conspiracy to avoid campaign finance regulations, per several media reports.
Bankman-Fried was in a Bahamas courtroom Tuesday, where he refused to waive his right to an extradition hearing — indicating he may fight being sent to the United States, according to Reuters.
FTX’s story
The charges all stem from the sudden — and complete — collapse of Bankman-Fried’s FTX crypto exchange and related companies.
In early November, the exchange saw a run of withdrawals after prices on FTX’s own token dropped like a rock. Despite being the fourth largest crypto exchange at the time, the FTX empire was thrown into bankruptcy — with allegations Bankman-Fried used customer deposits on the exchange to invest with his Alameda Research hedge fund platform.
The collapse is truly dramatic when one considers just earlier in the year FTX and FTX US had a $32 billion valuation and $8 billion valuation, respectively, before everything fell apart.
Investors in FTX included big names like  Sequoia Capital, NEA, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Insight Partners, Temasek, SoftBank Vision Fund, Thoma Bravo, SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Coinbase Ventures.
The fall has set off an FTX-induced contagion in the industry. Just this month, crypto exchanges Kraken, Bybit and Swyftx all announced they would be laying off 30% or more of their staff. In a letter to employees, Swyftx’s CEO cited the possibility of more “black swan-type events” and trading volumes likely falling in the first half of 2023 as reasons for the cuts, according to Bloomberg.

Zappi’s $170M Raise Proves The Value Of AI In Market Research,Keerthi Vedantam,2022/12/13,"

Consumer insights is a cruel industry. Companies are swimming in data after a product launches — sales data, demographics and insights into customer behavior.
But before that, new products and marketing strategies are built on guesses.

Zappi, a London-based consumer insights startup, announced on Tuesday it raised $170 million in growth capital from Sumeru Equity Partners and other undisclosed co-investors to make pre-launch data easier to access. 
The company’s AI-powered consumer insights platform is meant to help marketers evaluate ad campaigns and new product development before they launch. The startup has worked with companies such as PepsiCo, Heineken and McDonald’s since its inception in 2012 and has around 350 clients.
“Why is it that most products and ads still fail when they hit the market?” Zappi CEO and co-founder Steve Philips said in a statement. “It’s simple: traditional market research is too slow, too costly, and too analog, serving as more of a blocker than an enabler of creative effectiveness and winning innovation.”
Updating an antiquated industry
AI-enabled market research saw massive growth in 2021, and numbers haven’t died down despite an overall venture funding dry spell. Funding to the sector peaked in 2021 with over $2.2 billion in venture investment, and 2022 seems to be closing out with around $2.19 billion. 


AI was quickly embraced by investors starting in 2015, and that’s because without it, market research takes a long time. It often takes weeks of surveys, focus groups and panels to piece together actionable insights that can help product developers refine new merchandise in the early stages of conception. 
But not much happens to those data points afterward. Like Philips said, companies can spend thousands on research, product development and marketing launches and still fail.
But what if those expensive surveys were valuable long after product launch? For example, a seltzer company crafting a marketing campaign could use insights from another seltzer company that commissioned a survey. 
Plenty of startups like Zappi are starting to use AI to make the research process faster and quickly get the consumer’s pulse.

"
What Will Next Year Look Like For VCs And Startups?,Guest Author,2022/12/13,"

By Marc Schröder 
The recent slowdown in venture funding has shifted the way founders are approaching VCs and vice versa. Deal flow has slowed dramatically and VCs are being especially mindful around what investments they choose to make and why.
Only a few months ago, founders were raising at a frantic pace (and spending that way too). Now, the focus has shifted from growth to preservation, and funding is being used to shore up balance sheets and extend runways for at least two years. For startups that happened to time this cycle poorly, their founders are faced with difficult propositions and challenges.

My advice to these founders is it’s better to take a down or flat round in order to withstand the recession that is likely coming. That comes with a lot of consequences, so in the very worst case I advise founders to “fail gracefully” so they’re able to preserve their investor relationships and start preparing for the next wave.
Marc Schröder of Maschmeyer Group Ventures
The news headlines seem to reflect some of the opposite dynamics — the deals are continuing at a rapid pace and startups are able to secure continued funding. This is only partially true. VCs are triaging their value drivers, so the deal flow we are seeing is from VCs looking to protect their portfolio darlings by allocating enough cash to extend their runways and ensure their longevity. In classic VC fashion, these rounds have created a gravity that funds “standing by the hoop” wish to follow.
So in some sense, yes, deals are continuing but the broad allocations that were commonplace just a few months ago have come to a grinding halt. This has created a tale of two cities for startups; those which VCs wish to protect remain insulated with strong runways while all of the other startups on the roster are left with few options. Over the last few months we’ve seen many of the portfolio winners secure that protection, so most VCs are now in “wait-and-see” mode before reshifting their focus to new deals.
What’s ahead
If positive signs in the economy take more than six months to a year to manifest, we are going to see significant desperation in the market as startups start running out of cash. There might be a sweet spot window in there for VCs if that desperation closely coincides with an economic turnaround, but whether or not that comes to fruition remains to be seen.
If we experience a protracted slowdown, I expect to see layoffs and an increasing number of startup failures as cash runs out and VCs remain unready to deploy fresh capital into new deals. With their winners insulated, they may be incentivized to let portfolio companies on the fringes fail in order to preserve their capital for the next sign of life from the economy.
Like every VC, I hope we don’t see that day come, but it’s possible. The most likely scenario is that we see a brief window where great startups are on sale and the smart VCs are able to step in and secure lucrative equity at a deep discount. Historically, this is where the best VCs have risen to the top.

Before co-founding MGV, Schröder served as the head of global sales at the Maschmeyer Group and was an investor at Seed + Speed Ventures.

"
’Tis The Season To Buy An Enterprise Software Company For Billions,Joanna Glasner,2022/12/13,"

Software private equity investors like to think of themselves as deal hunters, adept at picking out undervalued companies that, with a bit of restructuring, could exit in a few years at much higher valuations.
Of course, not every deal works out. But those that do have a history of delivering some outsized returns. And buying at a low point in the market cycle seems to help.
That’s certainly the hope behind Thoma Bravo’s $6.15 billion cash purchase of Coupa Software.

The deal, announced Monday, represents a 30% premium over Coupa’s Friday closing share price, but is well below peak valuation.
San Mateo, California-based Coupa, which makes business spend management software, went public in 2016 and by early 2021 had a market capitalization of well over $20 billion. Shares have shed over 80% of their value since, picking up only when talks of a potential deal garnered headlines last month.
The purchase caps off a busy year for enterprise software M&A deals. Per Crunchbase data, acquirers have spent over $127 billion so far this year in disclosed-price purchases of SaaS and enterprise software companies. As the chart below illustrates, that’s the second-highest total in five years:


Globally, the trendlines look similar, with American companies accounting for the vast majority of M&A spending:


Many of the largest private equity purchases are for companies with stock fortunes that look a lot like Coupa’s. By and large, these are enterprise software players that went public a few years ago, saw shares surge in 2020 and 2021, and then suffered sharp declines in the past few quarters. Examples include:

ForgeRock, a provider of identity management tools, announced a deal in October to sell to Thoma Bravo for $2.3 billion. Shares of San Francisco-based ForgeRock had shed roughly two-thirds their value from their early 2021 peak prior to the deal’s announcement.
Zendesk, a customer service software provider, announced in November it completed its previously announced sale to a consortium of private equity investors led by Hellman & Friedman and Permira in an all-cash transaction that valued the company at approximately $10.2 billion. That purchase, announced in June, was a steep markdown from a $17 billion offer Zendesk had reportedly rejected just a few months earlier. However, market conditions changed in the ensuing months, pushing valuation lower.
Anaplan, a provider of business planning software, sold to Thoma Bravo for $10.4 billion in June. At the time of the deal’s announcement, Anaplan was trading well below peak, so Thoma Bravo was able to acquire it by offering a share price premium priced close to its peak valuation. The deal closed at a lower price than originally announced.

Web3 Weekly: Funding To Crypto Startups Plummets To Lowest Level Since Late 2020,Chris Metinko,2022/12/13,"

This is a weekly feature that will look back at the week that was in crypto, blockchain and Web3, and offer insights and analysis. Check out our previous column here.
Crypto funding sank to its lowest level since November 2020 last month as the industry was left reeling by an FTX-induced contagion.

VC-backed crypto startups raised only $394 million total in November, according to Crunchbase data. That is the lowest total since November 2020, when crypto startups raised less than $200 million.


Funding had been down this year compared to 2021 — which is true of almost every industry — but seemingly had bounced back some after a dip in July.
That was the same month embattled lenders Celsius Network and Voyager Digital filed for bankruptcy. In July funding in crypto fell to $402 million from $1.5 billion just the month before.
FTX’s impact
It is impossible to blame the drop in funding just on FTX’s fall — or possibly even any of it. Funding rounds typically close weeks — sometimes months — before they are announced, meaning most deals announced last month were closed before news of FTX’s collapse in early November.
Also, funding in November was down nearly everywhere, so it should come as no surprise crypto followed that trend.
Nevertheless, the numbers could be a troubling harbinger for an industry still struggling with the dramatic implosion of what was the fourth-largest crypto exchange and many of its affiliates. There are still significant questions about what the future will hold, not just for those companies but also the hundreds of investments and bets Sam Bankman-Fried placed on other companies in the greater crypto ecosystem.
The market also has even already seen companies without direct ties to Bankman-Fried negatively affected because of the contagion that has swept the industry.
Few are predicting venture funding will see a significant uptick in the coming six months — that likely is especially true for crypto startups.

"
Amgen’s Record-Breaking $27.8B Horizon Therapeutics Acquisition Is A Win For Rare Disease Fighting Companies,Keerthi Vedantam,2022/12/12,"

Pharmaceutical giant Amgen is wrapping 2022 with the largest pharmaceutical acquisition of the year (so far).
The company announced on Monday it will acquire biotech firm Horizon Therapeutics for $27.8 billion, approximately $116.50 per share of the publicly held drugmaker known for developing drugs that target rare diseases.

M&A activity is a different ball game in 2022
M&A activity was rather bleak in 2020 and 2021. Biotech startups saw record investments in private market funding through venture firms that became interested in COVID-related innovations. Moreover, the IPO market flourished — an unprecedented 143 biotech startups went public in 2021, creating funding opportunities for biotech that allowed them to avoid a buyout for as long as possible.
That was expected to change in 2022. Flush with cash, pharma companies were eyeing new innovations in biotech to replenish their expiring patents. But M&A activity hasn’t been in the acquiree’s favor. Ignoring Amgen’s anomaly acquisition move, around 226 biotech companies were acquired in 2022 for approximately $80 billion according to Crunchbase News, a bleak comparison to M&A activity in years past.
Rare disease drugs turn a quick profit
But Amgen’s first foray into rare disease with the Horizon acquisition is a smart one. Because rare diseases (by definition) affect so few people, drugs that target them are very well-funded by the National Institutes of Health as a means of influencing pharma companies to enter the rare disease development game. And since they’re so rare, insurance companies are extremely likely to cover them.
Rare disease drugs are a good bet for drug companies looking to turn a profit. Horizon Therapeutics’ star therapeutic is Tepezza, a first-of-its-kind drug that targets a rare thyroid eye disease. Horizon purchased Tepezza in 2017 for $145 million (and ended up promising more cash depending on if the drug would work). The drug was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2020.

Global Venture Funding Dips Further In November 2022,Gené Teare,2022/12/12,"

Global venture funding reached $22 billion in November 2022, down 69% from $70 billion in November 2021. Month-over-month funding is also down by 19%.
This is the lowest funding month on record since February 2020, which saw $18.3 billion invested.

Based on an analysis of Crunchbase data, all funding stages were down this past month compared to a year ago. Seed funding dropped by a third, early stage halved and late stage is down by 80% compared to November 2021.
Newly minted unicorns also counted the lowest since March 2020.


Late-stage financings were at the lowest proportion (39%) in a month over the past three years.
“The closer you get to the IPO markets, the more that [funding] has pretty much ground to a halt,” said Emily Man, an investor at Redpoint, who spoke with Crunchbase News on the current funding environment.
“We’re not seeing the same volume of companies at the same quality,” said Man.
“Companies are either not choosing to raise, or companies are trying to raise, and then deciding not to and choosing alternative methods of funding,” she said.
And in some instances there is a price mismatch in the market between investor expectations and founders who are seeking valuations that were possible more than six, 12 or 18 months ago.
Many startups are “heads down on building the business and getting to a scale where they can successfully raise the next round,” said Man.
Fewer startups funded
Around a third fewer startups were funded compared to a year ago. Unique startups funded in November 2022 were below 2,000 compared to 3,500 in November 2021.


Average monthly fundings have come down in the second half of 2022. From the beginning of 2021 through H1 2022, average monthly fundings skyrocketed. Since third-quarter 2022, average funding per month is more in line with fiscal half years in 2019 and 2020.
Based on this new economic outlook, as one investor said, we will continue to have high volatility across all markets.

Mark Cuban’s Pharmacy Company Partners With Employers,Keerthi Vedantam,2022/12/9,"

The Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Co. circumvented the pharmacy and insurance companies to directly reach customers. Now, it’s going to employers.
Billed as an alternative to brick-and-mortar pharmacies, and a way of getting prescription drugs at a cheaper cost, the company announced on Thursday it will partner with pharmacy benefit manager EmsanaRx, allowing employees whose companies are EmsanaRx members to access low-cost prescription drugs.

EmsanaRx will collect a 1.5% fee on each insurance claim and collected rebates.
Cuban said both companies are “working to disrupt the current pharmacy supply chain to eliminate the unnecessary markup and profiteering that is burdening businesses and consumers with high drug costs.”
The direct-to-employer pipeline
The pharmacy company’s move is a classic expansion from a direct-to-consumer to direct-to-employer strategy we’ve seen plenty of health startups resort to. In September, the company partnered with Rightway Health, another pharmacy benefits manager that works directly with employers.
Pharmacy benefits managers like Rightway Health and EmsanaRx work directly with drug companies to get rebates, lowering the cost of drugs for the end user they might not see at a traditional pharmacy. And self-insured employers that use them generally like them more than GoodRx types of companies because they get access to more information about how actively employees are using the benefit.
Benefit-focused companies have had a successful year closing out 2022. Startups focused on providing lifestyle, wellness and child care benefits for employees, and taking over some of the benefits-related administrative burden from HR departments, saw more than $1 billion in 2022, just $500 million less than the year prior.
This is in sharp contrast to the trajectory of benefits startups. In 2020, the space only saw $453 million.


But that might start to change in 2023. Large corporations and tech companies, driven toward benefits platforms in an attempt to attract and retain talent, are slashing their budgets and laying off workers en masse, a harbinger that the employee is no longer in control of the hiring market.

The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Investors Fanatical About Fanatics; Avant Locks Down $250M,Chris Metinko,2022/12/9,"

This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 funding rounds in the U.S.
We’ve been away for a couple of weeks, but now we’re back to cover the top rounds of the week. Funding news in general seemed to pick up after the typical slowdown before Thanksgiving, but large rounds were hard to find, with only five rounds of more than $100 million.

1. Fanatics, $700M, retail: Fanatics made this same list in March after The Wall Street Journal reported that the  Jacksonville, Florida-based company raised $1.5 billion in a new funding round. That valued the sports retail platform company at $27 billion. However, the sports merchandising giant wasn’t done. The Journal reported the company now has raised $700 million at a $31 billion valuation. Private-equity firm Clearlake Capital Group led the round, which will be used primarily for M&A activity. Earlier in the year, it acquired Topps trading cards for $500 million.
2. Avant, $250M, financial services: For some, securing credit can be difficult. Chicago-based Avant is a VC-backed fintech platform catering to that crowd — the non-prime consumer market. This week, Ares Management Alternative Credit decided Avant’s platform was attractive enough to pour a quarter-billion dollars into it. The $250 million raise was a mix of corporate debt and redeemable preferred equity. This year, Avant has surpassed $1 billion in the total amount of asset-backed debt financing commitments secured. Founded in 2012, the company has raised more than $2 billion, according to Crunchbase.
3. Drata, $200M, cybersecurity: Drata continues to go big and fast. The San Diego-based company locked up a $200 million Series C co-led by ICONIQ Growth and GGV Capital at a $2 billion valuation — doubling its valuation from its $100 million Series B in November 2021. Before that, the company raised a seed round in January 2021, then its Series A in June 2021. According to Crunchbase, Drata has now raised more than $328 million in less than two years. Drata’s automation platform helps companies with security compliance. That area has long garnered interest from investors as more regulations flood sectors such as finance and health care, which may explain the ability to fundraise.
3. (tied) First Mode, $200M, industrial engineering: Even with everyone striving for carbon reduction, there are some sectors that don’t seem to lend themselves to it. Heavy industry and mining is one of those. However, Seattle-based First Mode entered a deal with mining company Anglo American to try to accomplish just that. First Mode agreed to combine with Anglo American’s nuGen hauling solutions unit and supply those vehicles with its hybrid fuel cell battery powerplant. The newly combined business will be valued at $1.5 billion and includes a $200 million equity injection from Anglo American.
5. Apogee Therapeutics, $149M biotech: San Francisco-based Apogee Therapeutics closed a $149 million Series B co-led by Deep Track Capital and RTW Investments. The company is developing therapies for immunological and inflammatory disorders — like inflammatory bowel disease. Apogee is the first spinout company from Paragon Therapeutics. Founded in 2020, the company has raised $169 million, per Crunchbase.
6. Entact Bio, $81M, biotech: Watertown, Massachusetts-based Entact Bio, which is developing medicines that enhance the function of key proteins, raised an $81 million Series A co-led by Qiming Venture Partners USA and venBio Partners.
7. (tied) Sound Agriculture, $75M, agtech: Emeryville, California-based Sound Agriculture closed a $75 million Series D led by new investors BMO Impact Investment Fund and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. Founded in 2013, the company — which creates climate resilient crops — has raised more than $170 million, according to Crunchbase.
7. (tied) Sonatus, $75M, automotive: Sunnyvale, California-based Sonatus, a developer of automotive software, raised a $75 million round led by Foxconn. Sonatus has now raised over $110 million, per the company.
9. SonoThera, $61M, biotech: South San Francisco-based SonoThera closed a $61 million Series A led by ARCH Venture Partners. The company will use the new proceeds to develop its ultrasound-guided, gene therapy platform and treatments.
10. ZincFive, $54M, battery: Portland-based ZincFive, a developer of nickel-zinc-based energy storage solutions, raised a $54 million Series D led by Helios Climate Ventures. ZincFive has now raised $139 million since its inception, according to the company.
Big global deals
No global round topped Fanatics this week, but two of the week’s top five rounds came from abroad.

Foxconn Hon Hai Technology India Mega Development Private Limited, an electronics maker, received a $500 million investment.
Singapore-based Lazada Group, an online shopping site, raised a $342.5 million corporate round.

Methodology
We tracked the largest rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of Dec. 3 to 9. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

Telehealth Startups Pivot (Yet Again) As Employer Benefits Get Reevaluated In Layoff-Looming Economy,Keerthi Vedantam,2022/12/9,"

As tech companies slash their workforces and tighten their 2023 budgets, employers that once embraced shiny new perks to attract and retain talent are taking a second look at their benefit offerings.
Following suit, startups that made employer benefits their bread-and-butter business model are also shifting gears to depend on them less.

“The Fortune 500s adopted a lot of different benefits over the last five to eight years, and they’re all looking to consolidate,” said Kevin Zhang, a partner at Upfront Ventures who is focused on health care. “It’s a lot of pain administratively to deal with 20 different benefit vendors.”
How did we get here?
During the pandemic, tech companies that once boasted free meals, meditation rooms and zen gardens quickly scrambled to find different ways to curry favor with an in-demand (and now remote) workforce. Company perks quickly shifted toward more telehealth and wellness benefits, moving away from the on-campus perks.
In the pandemic’s wake, a flood of venture funding flowed into startups providing virtual health services as an extra incentive to manage particular health obstacles. Funding to this space peaked in 2021 with over $1.6 billion, but 2022 (so far) garnered around $1 billion, the sector’s second-best year yet.


In 2020, employers were swimming in a sea of health-related startups such as One Medical for primary care, Maven Clinic for fertility care, and Folx Health for queer-competent health care. By offering platforms that are easier to use, telehealth companies could work directly with employers to offer virtual services to their workers. Known as direct-to-employer, this was a popular strategy for startups.
It’s a lot easier to sell to employers than to insurance companies since employers aren’t really looking at the cost of health savings. They look for programs that will help keep employees productive, and benefits that will help retain them.
“Unlike the insurer, [employers] have a whole different ROI, which is really around workforce retention rate and ability to work more. So if someone’s really sick or if someone has a tough pregnancy, in addition to the health care costs that also costs the employer,” said Jacob Effron, a health care-focused investor at Redpoint Ventures.
Now, telehealth startups have to prove they work
When Maven Clinic first launched in 2014, it quickly evolved into a direct-to-employer platform and has onboarded around 450 employers, including the likes of Microsoft, Snap and SoFi.
The company conducted surveys boasting high engagement rates with employees, pointing out on its website that 40% of those surveyed said menopause interfered with their work, and Maven promised its program would cut costs and “drive better business results.”
“It’s harder for companies to take away existing benefits that people like,” Healy Jones, an executive at startup consulting firm Kruze Consulting, said in an email. “So if startups are going to cut, they are going to typically cut benefits that employees are not aggressively using.”
Most employees stick with their employer longer than they stick with their particular health insurance plan, making certain health perks more desirable as a direct-to-employer model.
“There is this increased scrutiny on ‘how much do these things actually save money?’” Effron said.
Benefits-driven startups are moving toward insurance
These startups may not have to prove their worth to employers for very long. Partnering with insurance companies, like what Maven did in 2021, can tap into a far wider pool of potential patients. This, ultimately, is the future for all virtual care startups, especially as fewer employers adopt new benefits in an attempt to conserve cash.
“The employers are doing separate deals with these providers of benefits because the insurance companies were bad at their jobs, have poor network coverage, and were missing benefits,” Zhang said. “So employers tend to be the first to adopt something new and different, and then the health plans will follow through.”
Teletherapy is a good example of this phenomenon. Lyra Health, an employer-focused teletherapy platform, began offering mental health services for employers in 2016, long before insurance companies embraced the practice during the pandemic.
But more venture firms are looking for telehealth platforms to work closely with health plans and Medicare and Medicaid, which can tap into a wider user base of patients.
“I do think any successful benefit provider, over time, if they’re able to sell it to an employer, there’s no reason why they can’t sell it to a payer,” Zhang said. “[As an investor] you do want to see a team that wants to expand into that over time.”

TripActions Secures $400M Of Credit Just Months After $300M-Plus Raise,Chris Metinko,2022/12/8,"

Palo Alto, California-based TripActions announced Thursday it had secured $400 million in credit facilities from Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Silicon Valley Bank.
The new credit facilities come less than two months after the business travel startup raised a $304 million Series G at a $9.2 billion valuation. That round was comprised of $154 million in equity from new and existing financial investors and a $150 million structured capital transaction led by Coatue.

The new credit facilities consist of a $200 million warehouse debt facility from Goldman — with a $300 million total limit — and an asset-backed lending facility of $100 million led by Silicon Valley Bank. 
Warehouse financings are popular with fintech companies — like TripActions with its credit card offering — as they can be secured by assets and loans those companies generate. TripActions will use the new credit to help grow its TripActions Liquid product, a corporate card and expense management platform.
“TripActions Liquid is the expense solution for companies that need to balance savings with proactive control in a complex macroeconomic environment,” Michael Sindicich, executive vice president and head of TripActions Liquid said in a statement. “With this new warehouse facility from Goldman Sachs, TripActions Liquid is well positioned to support its customers while continuing to innovate at a rapid pace.”
Busy year
The new credit lines continue what has been a busy second half of the year for TripActions.
In September, Business Insider reported the company had filed confidentially to go public sometime in 2023 and is aiming for a $12 billion valuation in Q2 of next year. The report also said Goldman Sachs has been hired to handle the listing.
The company then raised its Series G at a near decacorn status.
However, times have not always been good for the startup. TripActions looked like it would become one of the first casualties of COVID-19 when the pandemic took hold in March 2020. With all travel stopped, the company saw its revenue drop to $0. CEO and co-founder Ariel Cohen openly talked about the problems, including laying off 300 people.
However, in June 2020, the company was able to secure $125 million in debt and doubled down on its newly launched expense reporting platform—a platform that became popular as many were working from home and had new expenses.
Big-named investors in TripActions include Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Akkadian Ventures, Zeev Ventures and Elad Gil.

"The Week In Crunchbase Data: It’s A Sad State For Unicorns, AI Takes Over The World, And More",Crunchbase News,2022/12/8,"

We love our numbers at Crunchbase News, from huge billion-dollar funding rounds to the price of a crypto token. In this new feature, we’re letting the week’s hottest numbers tell the stories.
This week we learned (sadly, what we already knew), professional writers are just as replaceable — or at least pretty close to replaceable — as anyone else. This, from the launch of ChatGPT. We also saw some companies lose a coveted spot on The Crunchbase Unicorn Board as the FTX fallout continued to wreak havoc on the startup world. 

But some bright spots prevailed, particularly funding to India-based fitness and wellness e-commerce site HealthKart and cybersecurity startup Drata which each snagged a decent funding round in a dark funding climate.

The 10 Biggest Rounds Of November: Aspen Powers Up With $350M; DispatchHealth Raises Big For In-Home Care,Chris Metinko,2022/12/8,"

This is a monthly feature that runs down the month’s top 10 funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last month’s edition here.
November can be slow for funding as Thanksgiving can disrupt the pace of dealmaking. That may have happened last month; in October there were four rounds worth $400 million or more. However in November, no round hit that mark. Or it could just be another sign of the ever-slowing VC market. It’s hard to tell, but this year’s fourth quarter certainly is not last year’s.

1. Aspen Power, $350M, clean energy: The biggest round of the month was led by private equity giant Carlyle Group, which invested $350 million for a majority stake in renewable energy developer Aspen Power. The Dallas-based clean energy provider is looking to buy renewable energy projects across the U.S. Earlier this year, it agreed to acquire solar power company Safari Energy. Founded only a couple of years ago, Aspen already has raised nearly a half-billion dollars in funding, according to Crunchbase data.
2. DispatchHealth, $330M, health care: At-home care is becoming more necessary as the population gets older and hospital costs soar. Denver-based DispatchHealth is looking to help people get that in-home care. The company locked up a $330 million round led by health care-focused Optum Ventures, according to Home Health Care News. The startup provides at-home nursing services for patients who require more care or a higher degree of observation and intervention. The company partners with health systems, insurance companies and employers to offer families a long-term at-home care resource. Founded in 2013, the company has raised more than $730 million, per Crunchbase.
3. Emalex Biosciences, $250M, biotech: Biotech has been big the last few months, and the biggest deal in the sector in November was the $250 million Series D raise by biotech startup Emalex Biosciences. Emalex was started in 2018 by life science incubator Paragon Biosciences to create treatments for the central nervous system. Chicago-based Emalex has since focused on Tourette syndrome and Willis-Ekbom disease. The startup has a drug in a Phase 3 clinical trial for Tourette syndrome — the last stretch before it can be commercialized and marketed to the public. The new round was led by Bain Capital. In total, Emalex has raised $285 million, according to Crunchbase.
4. FogPharma, $178M, biopharma: Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biopharmaceutical startup FogPharma raised a $178 Million Series D. The round included new investors ARCH Venture Partners, Milky Way Investments and Fidelity Management and Research Co. The company is developing precision medicines that can target major cancer drivers. The new money will be used to continue the advancement of the company’s pipeline of therapeutics. Founded in 2015, the company has raised nearly $386 million, per Crunchbase.
5. Astera Labs, $150M, semiconductors: Santa Clara, California-based Astera Labs was minted a unicorn last month after raising a $150 million Series D led by Fidelity Management and Research that values the company at nearly $3.2 billion. The company last raised a $50 million Series C — led by Fidelity — that valued it at $950 million in September 2021. Astera Labs provides data and memory connectivity solutions for some of the biggest chipmakers in the world including Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. The company will use the new proceeds to expand its product lines, add to its workforce, and create two new research and design centers in Vancouver and Toronto this year. Semiconductor manufacturing has been in the news for the last several years as supply chain and manufacturing issues have played havoc with the market. Founded in 2017, the company has raised more than $200 million, according to Crunchbase data.
6. Weka, $135M, data: Even in a down venture market, investors will always put money into data. Campbell, California-based Weka locked up a $135 million Series D led by Generation Investment Management at a reported $750 million valuation. Weka helps companies move data between sources faster and more efficiently. The new cash will be used to get to profitability, fuel global expansion and scale the company. Founded in 2013, Weka has raised more than $290 million, according to Crunchbase.
7. Alation, $123M, data integration: As we’ve said, data is king, and Redwood City, California-based Alation further proves that point. The enterprise data intelligence startup raised a $123 million Series E led by Thoma Bravo, Sanabil Investments and Costanoa Ventures at a valuation of more than $1.7 billion. Alation offers everything from data search to analytics, and recently surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue. Founded in 2012, Alation says it has raised $340 million.
8. (tied) CG Oncology, $120M, biotech: Cancer treatments will always attract investment until more and better treatments are found to combat its various types. Irvine, California-based CG Oncology, an oncolytic immunotherapy startup developing therapeutics for patients with urologic cancers, closed a $120 million Series E co-led by ORI Capital, Longitude Capital and Decheng Capital. The biotech firm will use the money to advance its clinical programs in bladder cancer further toward Food and Drug Administration approval. Founded in 2010, CG has raised more than $200 million, per the company.
8. (tied) Escient Pharmaceuticals, $120M, biotech: Yet another biotech firm makes the list as San Diego-based Escient Pharmaceuticals closed a $120 million Series C co-led by NEA, Abingworth and Forge Life Science Partners. Escient is a clinical-stage biotech developing small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of a broad range of neurosensory-inflammatory disorders. The company will use the cash infusion to advance two therapeutics in its pipeline. Founded in 2018, the firm has raised nearly $238 million to date, according to Crunchbase.
8. (tied) Human Immunology Biosciences, $120M, biotech: San Francisco-based Human Immunology Biosciences emerged from stealth last month and announced it closed a $120 million round. The clinical-stage biotech company was developed by Monograph Capital and ARCH Venture Partners, and is looking to fight autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The startup plans to target cells such as plasma and mast cells that make up the immune system. Per Crunchbase data,  in 2022 alone, more than $2 billion has been pumped into drug startups tackling the immune system. The majority of these companies, including Rheos Medicines and Mast Therapeutics, are creating targeted therapies.
8. (tied) Swell Energy, $120M, renewable energy: Santa Monica, California-based virtual power plant startup Swell Energy raised a $120 million round led by the SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Greenbacker Development Opportunities Fund I last month. The startup’s virtual power plants provide grid capabilities in states including California and Hawaii to reduce reliance on fossil fuel plants. In doing so, the company can optimize energy resources and distribute it in real-time based on need and who is using it. Founded in 2014,  Swell has raised $582 million to date, per Crunchbase.
Big global deals
China-based companies in the electric car space raised the two largest rounds last month.

Voyah, an electric-car developer, closed a Series A worth approximately $717 million.
Levdeo, another manufacturer of electric cars, also raised a Series A worth about $459 million.

Methodology
We tracked the largest rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the month of November. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some are reported late in the month.

"
Value Vaporized From The Unicorn Board With FTX Collapse,Gené Teare,2022/12/8,"

Four newly minted unicorn companies joined The Crunchbase Unicorn Board in November 2022, while three companies were removed.

This is the lowest count on record for new unicorns since the beginning of 2020. (The next lowest count is five newly minted billion-dollar valued companies in March 2020.)
High-value closures
Three cryptocurrency companies vaporized $45 billion in value from the board. Bahamas-based cryptocurrency platform FTX and its U.S. counterpart based in San Francisco, FTX US, entered bankruptcy proceedings. And New Jersey-based crypto lender BlockFi was shuttered in late November. BlockFi had been bailed out by a loan from FTX in June 2022 to cover its losses.



FTX was the most highly valued unicorn to close, based on an analysis of Crunchbase data, followed by Pittsburgh-based self-driving startup Argo AI, which shuttered in October as it was unable to raise new funds. Argo AI — funded by Ford and VW — was last valued at $12.4 billion in July 2021 in a partnership funding with Lyft.
Theranos is the third most highly valued company to close. It was valued at $9 billion in a 2014 funding and shut down in September 2018.
And earlier this year, Celsius Network, another crypto lender, filed for bankruptcy  in July.
With bankruptcy proceedings and closures, the unicorn board’s value shifted down for the first time in three years; from $3.9 trillion to $3.8 trillion, a small proportion of its overall value.
Funding to unicorns
Unicorn companies raised $2.6 billion in November 2022, the lowest amount in recent years raised in a month by this cohort as global late-stage funding dropped precipitously.


Four new unicorns

China-based electric vehicle company Voyah, a subsidiary of Dongfeng Motor Group, raised its first funding, a $702 million Series A which valued Voyah at $4.2 billion. This is the sixth billion-dollar valued electric vehicle company out of China to raise funding this year.
Semiconductor company Astera Labs, based in Santa Clara, California, raised a Series D funding of $150 million led by Fidelity Management. The company was valued at $3.2 billion.
EV charging business ABB E-Mobility, based in Zurich, raised a financing of $209 million with participation from investment group Interogo Holding, family office moyreal holding, and ABB E-Mobility chairman Michael Halbherr. The company is valued at $2.6 billion with plans to go public.
Quantum computing company Xanadu, based in Toronto, raised a $100 million Series C funding led by Canadian growth-stage investor Georgian which valued the company at $1 billion.

Exits slow
The value of the unicorn board is dented by these high-profile closures. However, the bigger impacts to the board’s current value were the inflated valuations and pace of new unicorns set in 2021 and into the first half of 2022.
On a more telling note, zero unicorn companies went public this past month. The single exit from the board was California-based Evernote, first valued as a unicorn in 2012. It was acquired by Milan-based app developer Bending Spoons for an undisclosed amount.

Theranos’ Sunny Balwani Receives 13-Year Prison Sentence,Keerthi Vedantam,2022/12/7,"

Former Theranos president and COO Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani was sentenced to 155 months, or just under 13 years, in prison for wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.
The news comes weeks after founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes was sentenced to more than 11 years for defrauding investors.

While both Holmes and Balwani faced similar charges, Holmes was acquitted of charges related to defrauding patients, whereas Balwani’s wire fraud charges applied to both patients and investors. For risking patient health, Balwani received a longer sentence than Holmes.
Balwani’s Silicon Valley legacy
Balwani was long entrenched in the early years of Silicon Valley, working at Microsoft before building an e-commerce startup called Commercebid.com, which was later acquired before the dot com bubble burst. Using his wealth from the acquisition, Balwani funded the early days of Theranos.
The company quickly raised $1.4 billion, per Crunchbase data, and garnered big-name investors like Rupert Murdoch, Walgreens and Oracle executive Larry Ellison.
When the U.S. brought the case against Balwani and Holmes in 2018, both parties waged bitter campaigns, accusing each other of controlling the majority of the business decisions and lying to investors.
Balwani’s sentence is far from the end of the Theranos saga — Holmes appealed her conviction earlier in December, and Balwani is likely to do the same.

Drata Doubles Valuation To $2B After $200M Series C,Chris Metinko,2022/12/7,"

Fundraising isn’t what it was last year, but don’t tell that to cybersecurity startup Drata.
The San Diego-based company locked up a $200 million Series C co-led by ICONIQ Growth and GGV Capital at a $2 billion valuation. The round doubles Drata’s valuation from its $100 million Series B in November 2021.

Drata’s automation platform helps companies with security compliance, making sure they are in line with regulations such as GDPR. Keeping up to date with compliance rules and regulations also can help build trust in a company’s customer base, making it easier to retain clients.
“Since our inception, Drata has been designed to bridge the gap between compliance and trust through automation, and we’ve made significant progress in less than two years,” said co-founder and CEO Adam Markowitz in a release.
Going fast
The latest round keeps up with Drata’s quick pace of fundraising. The company raised a seed round in January 2021, then its Series A in June 2021. That was followed by being minted a unicorn with its Series B in November of that year.
According to Crunchbase, Drata has now raised more than $328 million in less than two years.
Those numbers are not entirely surprising. The governance, risk and compliance sector in cyber has long garnered interest from investors as more regulations flood sectors such as finance and health care.
IDC projects the GRC market to reach $15 billion in the next three years, making it a possible lucrative sector for tech startups offering solutions.
Overall, funding to cyber startups will not hit the highs of last year — which is not surprising as 2021 was an outlier in VC funding. Last year set a record for the sector, with more than $23 billion raised by VC-backed startups in network, cloud and cybersecurity, per Crunchbase data. While this year will only see around $16 billion, that is still nearly double from 2020.

Web3 Weekly: Apologies Won’t Keep Layoffs And Crypto Prices From Dropping,Chris Metinko,2022/12/7,"

This is a weekly feature that will look back at the week that was in crypto, blockchain and Web3, and offer insights and analysis. Check out our previous column here.
Apologies, layoffs and crypto prices dominated this week as the FTX-induced contagion continued to spread across the industry.
Late last week, Sam Bankman-Fried’s apology tour began, with the former head of FTX saying he was sorry, but adding he was not aware of some of the accounting issues at the exchange — such as the $8 billion hole on the balance sheet — and blaming other companies for its downfall.
His apologies have not impressed everyone — or likely anyone.
Market effects
Of course, apologies are necessary because Bankman-Fried’s actions — or inactions (it really doesn’t matter which) — have caused real world harm. Not only have FTX’s customers perhaps lost all their investments, but even those outside of FTX are feeling the effects. One needs to go no further than looking at the layoffs in crypto through the last week.

Crypto exchanges Kraken, Bybit and Swyftx all announced they would be laying off 30% or more of their staff.
In a letter to employees, Swyftx’s CEO cited the possibility of more “black swan-type events” and trading volumes likely falling in the first half of 2023 as reasons for the cuts, according to Bloomberg.
Also this week, Boston-based Circle Internet Financial called off its proposed merger agreement with special-purpose acquisition company Concord Acquisition Corp. — ending a year-and-a-half long SPAC saga which would have valued the company at $9 billion.
It’s not too much of a leap to think Circle figured this may not be the best time for an issuer of stablecoin to hit the public markets.
To top everything off, this week also saw Standard Chartered issue a note outlining a scenario where Bitcoin could drop as low as $5,000.
That would be a 70% drop from around the $17,000 price point it has hovered around since the FTX debacle came to light — which was a drop from the $20,000 it was at in early November.
While others are much more bullish — even outlandishly so — it is not difficult to imagine a further drop in crypto prices, especially considering everything the industry has been through.
That could well spell more business changes at crypto firms and more layoffs — and of course more apologies from those who helped cause it all.

How VCs Invest In Crypto Will Be Changed By FTX’s Spectacular Fall,Chris Metinko,2022/12/7,"

As  Sam Bankman-Fried’s apology tour continues and investors and regulators sift through the rubble of FTX, those in the industry say some significant investing trends should emerge in crypto and beyond due to the exchanges’s dramatic collapse as 2023 dawns.
Due diligence, asset sell-offs and increased scrutiny — especially on lenders and exchanges in the sector — are likely.

“I was pretty shocked to see the scope of what happened at FTX and some of the impacts it had across the broader ecosystem — how intertwined it was,” said Christian Lopez, head of blockchain and digital assets at Cohen & Co. Capital Markets.
FTX’s fall also impacted its venture arm — FTX Ventures — Bankman-Fried’s other trading firm Alameda Research, and countless other lenders and exchanges, sending reverberations throughout the industry and likely causing most investors significant reflection.
Big names
Some of the largest investors in both crypto and blockchain — in terms of total amounts of the rounds they participated in — are some of the biggest names in the venture and growth capital game, according to Crunchbase data.


Big players such as Tiger Global, Andreessen Horowitz and Lightspeed Venture Partners continued to place bets in the sector — some at a greater pace than even 2021. However, some of them and others may change how they invest in the industry in the wake of the FTX collapse.
Lopez said while the market favored startups while fundraising the last several years, this year’s venture slowdown has swung the pendulum back to investors. FTX’s problems likely only exacerbated that, allowing investors to do proper due diligence when investing — with VCs no longer in the “go fast, go big” mode.
“In the last cycle, things just moved so fast, so quickly,” Lopez said.
Part of that process of proper due diligence will not just be examining the books of crypto firms, but also having software engineers look at the infrastructure in place at some of these startups to make sure “the rails” that allow for the business are developed and sound.
Lenders and exchanges
The startups many VCs and growth investors look at may not include crypto and lenders, said Yash Patel, general partner at Telstra Ventures, who invests in crypto startups, including FTX.
The fallout of FTX and others, including BlockFi and Celsius may cause investors to shy away from that particular field, at least in the short term. Crypto exchanges Kraken, Bybit and Swyftx all announced layoffs this week.
“Investors will focus on what is on the balance  sheet,” he said. “They’ll look to see if they can generate real fiat revenues. Lenders will need audits.”
Patel said those startups may be dependent on raising debt, cutting cash burn or raising inside rounds to survive what could be a difficult 2023.
Lopez agrees centralized lenders may face a hard road of convincing investors to part with their money after the FTX implosion.
Hunting bargains
On the flipside, decentralized platforms — where customers actually hold their own digital assets such as on Uniswap — should continue to intrigue investors as they could gain in popularity (something we’ve mentioned before).
In general, Lopez said, people can expect to see a lot of crypto financings in the next three to six months focusing on restructuring situations — companies selling off assets or parts as they try to regroup.
That could whet the appetites of many firms looking for a bargain. FTX-owned LedgerX, a derivatives exchange, would be the type of asset that could attract significant interest, he said.
Just this week, Reuters reported Goldman Sachs is looking to spend “tens of millions of dollars to buy or invest in crypto companies” with FTX’s fall tamping down valuations. Other similar big banks also could see an opportunity to come into a market looking for more trust and regulation.
Another aspect related to FTX and its bankruptcy to remember is the nearly 50 investments FTX Ventures made this year since announcing its first $2 billion funding in January. Many of those investments included the contingency that the invested-in startup would allocate some of that money to the FTX platform, Lopez said.
Those startups now have to wait to see what may be left of their assets as FTX is unwound and what their next steps could be.
Beyond crypto
Another question remaining is what effects FTX’s fallout will have on Web3 development. While funding in Web3 is down from last year, it still is a space that excites investors and many see huge potential in the sector.
Companies such as Mysten Labs and Aptos Labs closed huge rounds this year — both received funding from FTX Ventures — as many eye a decentralized web.
“I think it’s already affected it, that I think the tentacles of crypto have affected it a bit, but I think it’s also correlated with the broader market downturn,” Lopez said.
“But that being said, if there is a world, if there is a kind of subspace within crypto that’s less affected by that, it is going to be the … likes of Mysten Labs and the likes of Aptos,” he added. “That’s where investors know that there is a future.”
Patel said there is still significant interest in areas of the blockchain related to sports, entertainment and supply chain.
“I really don’t think you’ll see that area affected as much,” he said.

"Recessions, Resilience And Returns: Here Are 8 Tech Sectors Primed For Growth",Guest Author,2022/12/7,"

By Rajive Keshup
The global economy will fall into a recession in the first quarter of 2023 (if it’s not already). Recessions typically last 15 months (2008 was 18) followed by 48 months of expansion, so what are the best resilient sectors primed for investment and growth?
Lessons from 2008 to 2022: The top performers and macro changes
In 2008, the iPad didn’t exist, the dominant enterprise smartphone was Blackberry and the dominant network technology was GPRS, EDGE and 3G.


This is a good start, but a lot has changed.

Today, we’re used to remote everything (work, health care, staffing, freelancing) without compromising productivity. We’ve also seen a rise in volatility — food shortages, energy transitions, security issues — and the Chicago Board Options Exchange‘s CBOE Volatility Index, which measures general market sentiment, is now trading 25% higher, signaling an increased level of overall risk in the market.
Rajive Keshup of Cathay Innovation
Lastly, we can’t ignore inflation — the cost of goods rising, incomes shrinking and layoffs will make investing a challenge.
A 2023 recession: The top eight investment sectors
Factoring in macro changes, here are the sectors likely to thrive. While not an exhaustive list, it highlights key resilience characteristics: Being mission critical, enhanced productivity with limited resources, and a general flight to quality.

Digital health: People need health care, even when incomes decline. But recessions still hurt companies with more debt or capital expenditure/operating expense costs and less cash flow. Health care companies that will do well are those that add productivity to existing infrastructure and allow for robust patient monitoring and tracking (doing more with less).
 Discounted/used goods, consumer staples and the circular economy: Dollar General outperformed all 2008 stocks, rising more than 60%. Recessions induce layoffs and reduce income, leading to households buying less or cheaper. Expect discount retailers, used goods and asset-light, customer-obsessed marketplaces and distributors of “must-have” recommerce, or previously owned products, to win.
Budget travel and leisure: With energy costs soaring, travel is becoming prohibitively expensive. Expect a shift to local activities — hence the surge in Airbnb Experience bookings and new hosts. Bet on companies involved with the infrastructure, enabling local travel and experiences.
Logistics: Never fully recovered from 2020, the entire supply chain remains under stress. We see particular potential around productivity — including mapping tools, route planning, resource management and seamless APIs for connectivity.
Personal services: Two themes — (1) accounting and tax services will remain an annuity and (2) mass layoffs will lead to a rise of new company formations and freelance workers. Companies addressing the freelance workflow from finding the next gig to invoicing and getting paid should thrive.
Critical stack SaaS only: Only SaaS with easy to measure ROI attributed back to cost dollars is safe. Remember the three Cs: if a company doesn’t help manage costs; if it’s not mission critical, and if it doesn’t help maintain control of businesses, it may experience headwinds.
The energy reset: We’re in the midst of a global energy transition away from fossil fuels and toward decarbonization. Two areas in focus are making energy management more efficient and grid digitalization to prepare for the transition and balance multiple sources (wind and solar).
Remote everything: 2020 permanently changed the future of work leading to more companies hiring remote teams in lower-cost-base markets to maintain productivity and increase profitability. Companies that help identify, hire, onboard, pay, handle taxes or train remote staff will likely benefit.

Parting thoughts: Buckle up, it’ll be a bumpy ride
While there are several other promising trends in the infancy stage, these eight key sectors will likely thrive through a recession, representing the bulk of digital transformation in the next 24 months.

Grocery Delivery Startup Oda Nabs $151M — At A Price,Keerthi Vedantam,2022/12/6,"

It can’t be avoided anymore: Companies have to raise money and face the music when it comes to valuations.
Norwegian grocery delivery business Oda announced on Tuesday it raised $151 million in equity from Kinnevik, Verdane and Summa Equity, bringing total funding to $630.5 million, per Crunchbase data.

The company turned a profit last year in Norway, but the new funding brought Oda’s valuation down from $900 million in 2021 to $353 million, according to Reuters. It’s far from the first company in this position, and in 2023 we’ll definitely see more companies like this.
Valuations are coming down
In 2020 and 2021, when the private markets were fertile with funding and companies began hitting the public markets at rapid pace, valuations were sky-high.
But that all changed at the end of 2021. Venture firms began tightening their purse strings, and startups once swimming in cash were suddenly hit with the realization that they needed to extend their runway on their own.
While fundraising was down, startups resorted to extension rounds and layoffs to avoid the inevitable: Their companies were, for the most part, overvalued, and pursuing new funding would lower those valuations.
After nabbing $233 million last April, Oda began turning to secondary market and convertible note financing. It’s not alone — Stripe, Instacart and Klarna are a few of more than 80 companies that saw a hit to their valuations back in August.
That’s not to take away from the significance of Oda’s $151 million. As far as grocery delivery funding goes, theirs is still one of the most sizable funding rounds of 2022. Micromobility and delivery startup Bolt raised $657 million in Series F funding back in January, per Crunchbase data. Weee, the grocery startup specializing in foods from east Asia, raised $425 million in February.

Writing-Focused Startups Draw Big Bucks,Joanna Glasner,2022/12/5,"

For years, tech writers have been warning about how AI will eliminate the need for all kinds of human-staffed professions from truck driving to portfolio management.
Turns out, the AI bots are really coming for us.
That’s becoming increasingly clear amidst the ongoing tech world buzz around OpenAI’s newly launched ChatGPT writing bot. Today’s tech, it appears, is pretty capable of churning out readable, reasonably accurate prose on a dizzying range of topics.

No, ChatGPT won’t be winning the Nobel Prize for literature. But in this employed-for-now writer’s experience, it actually does a credible job discussing octopus intelligence, dishing up a brownie recipe, or explaining how to make a ham sandwich in the style of the King James Bible.
And OpenAI is just one of numerous funded companies working on tools aimed at either helping humans write or letting computers do the job. Using Crunchbase data, we identified a sample set of 20 companies along these lines funded in the past couple years, listed below:


After OpenAI, the most heavily funded company on our list is Grammarly, the AI-powered writing assistance tool that has raised $400 million to date, including a $200 million round a year ago at a reported $13 billion valuation.
Next is Jasper, developer of a platform that helps create original content while optimizing it for ROI and even repackaging it in different ways and in different languages. The Austin-based company raised $125 million in an October round led by Insight Partners that vaulted it to unicorn status.
Still early days for AI
Altogether, the 20 companies on our list raised a combined $1.7 billion to date. However, of that total, just over a billion went to OpenAI, for which writing is but one of several focus areas around artificial intelligence. Even before the ChatGPT release, the company, a nonprofit with a for-profit subsidiary, was generating copious attention for its DALL·E 2 AI-generated imagery tool.
For now, we’re still early in the introduction of AI-enabled writing tools, so it’s premature to predict a sharp decline in demand for skilled human writers. That said, it’s also premature to say these tools won’t become good enough to displace us.
In the meantime, the craft of writing a few simple paragraphs around a basic topic — the staple school assignment for countless decades — has certainly gotten easier of late with the help of tech. Let’s hope over the long run that turns out to be a good thing.

India’s HealthKart Nabs $135M In Funding To Address Health And Wellness,Keerthi Vedantam,2022/12/5,"

The wellness direct-to-consumer industry in India got some surprising news today.
Consumer-focused nutrition marketplace HealthKart announced on Monday it raised $135 million in Series H funding. The round was led by Temasek Holdings with additional participation from health care-focused A91 Partners and Kae Capital.

HealthKart is an India-based online store that sells supplements, vitamins, protein powders and weight-loss foods. The company has incubated a couple of its own in-house brands and plans to use the funding to grow beyond its website, making its way into other online retailers and in-store warehouses.
It also plans to explore new product categories (like high-protein food) and new target markets (such as children’s care).
It’s a weird time for fitness in India
“Driving fitness and preventive health by addressing the nutritional gaps is a systemic trend which is taking off in a big way in India,” said founder and CEO Sameer Maheshwari in a statement.
That’s partially true. HealthKart’s massive raise comes at a time when the country’s health and wellness industry is in a bit of a slump.
After seeing over $1.7 billion in venture funding in 2021, startups in the space have only managed to scrape together around $456 million so far in 2022, per Crunchbase data.
HealthKart’s raise is easily the largest of its kind so far this year, equaling more than the next five biggest raises combined (for a cosmetic teeth alignment startup, a telehealth company, a caffeine-infused body care brand and a wearables platform, all in their early stages).
HealthKart is pursuing omnichannel distribution, a strategy that has become popular in the direct-to-consumer space for its ability to target multiple kinds of customers. While loyal, repeat customers buy directly from the website, new customers can discover these products while shopping in their familiar environment. The company is in 140 stores across 50 states, according to TechCrunch.

Circle Nixes $9B SPAC Deal With Crypto Market In Tumult,Chris Metinko,2022/12/5,"

Boston-based Circle Internet Financial called off its proposed merger agreement with special-purpose acquisition company Concord Acquisition Corp. — ending a year-and-a-half long SPAC saga which would have valued the company at $9 billion.
“We are disappointed the proposed transaction timed out, however, becoming a public company remains part of Circle’s core strategy to enhance trust and transparency, which has never been more important,” said Jeremy Allaire, co-founder and CEO of Circle, in a release.

The news comes as the crypto market continues to reel after the sudden and dramatic collapse of FTX, as well as many investors souring on the SPAC phenomenon that took hold a few years ago.
A SPAC story
Circle’s proposed merger with blank-check firm Concord, which is backed by former Barclays boss Bob Diamond, has been its own long and winding story.
The company — an issuer of USD Coin, a type of stablecoin — announced in July 2021 it would merge with Concord in a deal that would value the company at $4.5 billion.
However, USD Coin’s circulation quickly doubled and in February Circle terminated its previously announced merger agreement and agreed to new terms that doubled the crypto company’s valuation to $9 billion.
That deal was expected to close later this month — and could have been extended into January — but Monday’s announcement slammed the door shut.
In the announcement of the cancellation of the SPAC deal, Circle said it became profitable in the third quarter, with total revenue and reserve interest income of $274 million and net income of $43 million.
The company added it ended the quarter with close to $400 million in cash.

Upstream Nabs $140M To Provide Value-Based Care,Keerthi Vedantam,2022/12/2,"

Primary care platform Upstream Health announced it raised $140 million in Series B funding this week led by Coatue and Dragoneer, with additional participation from Avidity Partners and Mubadala.
North Carolina-based Upstream is betting on a new kind of health care system the U.S. has only recently started to embrace: Value-based care, which determines how much health care costs based on how effective it is, rather than how much a service costs.

The phenomenon is often joked about (in a rather sardonic manner): A trip to the emergency room or the doctor’s office ends with a steep bill mailed to the patient. One patient detailed a more than $700 cost to push morphine through an IV, a process that takes seconds.
Through value-based care, the argument goes, providers may be incentivized to spend more time with each patient and offer higher quality care. This could be a game changer for everyone involved. Physicians often get paid more by having more patients, which leads to short, hyperefficient appointments with each patient and leads to burnout. What if they could get paid better while seeing fewer people and spending more time with each of them?
“Primary care physicians are an integral part of the U.S. healthcare system, and all share a mission to see their senior patients live healthy, independent lives free from the burden of chronic disease,” Dr. Sanjay Doddamani, co-founder and CEO of Upstream, said in a statement. “However, they often lack the resources and technology to achieve their goals while also struggling to thrive financially in the value-based care era.”
More staffing and support
Upstream provides doctors working with Medicare patients with a team of nurses and pharmacists to shoulder some of the workflow often left to physicians. Using its technology platform of electronic health records and clinical data, the team can forecast potential health risks for each patient and get ahead of it.
Providing preventive care, such as lowering the risk of a patient getting diabetes, is far less costly to the health care system than managing a patient that already has diabetes. And for the U.S., which spends far more on health care than other countries with very little return, preventive care will be key to lowering the exorbitant cost of keeping people alive.

Defense Tech Startup Anduril Raises Massive $1.5B Round At $8.5B Valuation,Chris Metinko,2022/12/2,"

In a year where venture funding has slowed, defense and security firm Anduril helped close it with a big bang — and raise.
The Costa Mesa, California-based startup locked up a Series E worth nearly $1.5 billion that values the company at $8.5 billion. That nearly doubles the company’s previous valuation in June 2021.

The funding round was led by Valor Equity Partners, with participation from Founders Fund, Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, 8VC 1, Lux Capital, Thrive Capital, DFJ Growth, Elad Gil, Lachy Groom, Human Capital, Marlinspike, WCM Investment Management, MVP Ventures, Lightspeed Venture and US Innovative Technology Fund.
The funding round was rumored late this spring.
Big round
The round is one of the largest this year by a U.S. company. In April, Tencent-backed Epic Games raised $2 billion from Sony and Kirkbi. Then in June, Elon Musk’s space company, SpaceX, raised nearly $1.7 billion in June.
Anduril was founded in 2017 by Palmer Luckey, most famous for selling virtual reality company Oculus to Meta — then called Facebook — for $2 billion.
His newest venture promises to be even bigger. 
Anduril builds software and hardware enhanced with artificial intelligence and machine learning for the military and defense industry. It works with the U.S. and its allies to create drones, underwater vehicles and different operating and control systems.
“Anduril is a technology partner, not an equipment provider,” said co-founder and CEO Brian Schimpf in a blog post. “Security threats are evolving faster than the DOD can keep pace. In order to really outmaneuver emerging threats we need to move past just efficiencies and create clear step changes in capability, quickly.”
Doing something different
Luckey has said he started Anduril because many big tech firms were turning their backs on doing business with the U.S. Department of Defense, hurting the U.S. military’s ability to modernize as U.S. defense needs change.
However, the military and defense sectors can be hard to navigate for startups. Just getting started in the sectors can be extremely difficult and long sales cycles can crush a startup’s cash flow.
“Anduril has proven that our model — recruiting talented engineers, building quickly and efficiently using venture dollars, and selling next-generation technology off the shelf to the government — works,” Schimpf said. “And that with the right technology and incentives the government can be a nimble customer.”
The company certainly has seen significant growth. Just earlier this year, the company closed a 10-year, $967 million contract with the U.S. Special Operations Command. In the last 12 months the company has grown its employee count from 700 at the start of 2022 to more than 1,100 employees.
All of that is not to say the company has not had its critics. It has been criticized for possibly enabling the enforcement of border security policies and government surveillance.
Anduril plans to use the new cash infusion to accelerate its research and development and bring new products to market.
The company has now raised more than $2 billion, per Crunchbase data.

We love our numbers at Crunchbase News, from huge billion-dollar funding rounds to the price of a crypto token. In this new feature, we’re letting the week’s hottest numbers tell the stories.
This week we learned that the fallout from FTX’s collapse cannot be contained as fellow crypto exchanges lay off employees, file for bankruptcy and are generally very sad Apes. We also watched another self-driving trucking startup sputter and stall on the public markets.
But the news isn’t all bad: Check out the numbers around artificial intelligence startups, and New Jersey emerges as a surprising hotbed of startup investment this year.

"Beef, Pork, Chicken, Fish: Where The Money Is Going In Alt Meat",Joanna Glasner,2022/12/2,"

While venture funding has slowed this year, one area that remains hot is alternative proteins, and in particular cell-grown meats.
Funding in the cultivated meat space has reached close to $700 million so far in 2022, per Crunchbase data. Meanwhile, copious investment also continues to flow to plant-based protein startups. Collectively, founders working on everything from faux foie gras to shelf-stable mock goat meat are pulling in millions.

But not all meats are equally sought-after. To get a sense of how beef, chicken, pork, seafood and other categories 1 rank, we pulled together a dataset of top-funded companies in the alternative meat space.


 
Not all funded companies have products to sample. In the cultivated meat space in particular, goods aren’t likely to reach store shelves for a few years.
Still, most faux meat companies are actively promoting their brands. For a sense of who’s making what, we’ve put together lists below of funded companies in each meat category:
Chicken and poultry


Seafood


Beef


Pork (including bacon!)


Lamb, goat and mammoth
While chicken, beef, pork and fish are the top focus areas for alternative meat innovators, other proteins are getting a look too.
San Francisco-based Black Sheep Foods makes a plant-based lamb with textured pea protein as a key ingredient. The company raised $5.3 million in a January round.
Good Dot, an India-based startup, makes a product called “UnMutton,” which is intended to offer a shelf-stable, protein-rich, plant-based alternative to goat meat that can be used in the kinds of slow-cooked dishes popular in Indian cuisine. 
Last but not least is Paleo, a Belgian food ingredient company that makes heme proteins it says are bio-identical to animal sources, but are made without animals. In addition to staple flavors like beef, chicken and pork, the company also offers a mammoth heme made through precision fermentation and based on the DNA sequence of a 1 million-year-old steppe mammoth.
In addition to the curiosity factor, plant-based mammoth meat strikes me as having an advantage over competing protein alternatives: No one living today could authoritatively say how much it does or does not taste like the real thing.

Q&A: How Our Aging Population Will Change Health Care,Keerthi Vedantam,2022/12/2,"

The United States is bracing for a seismic public health issue that will affect every aspect of the health care system: Boomers, who are expected to be the oldest and longest-living elder population in history, will need more care as they continue to age, requiring more health care resources for the entire population. 
As this happens, the health care system’s fragmented and disorganized infrastructure will get its biggest test since the pandemic. Accommodating the country’s large population will require an entire overhaul of how the system works. 

Kelsey Mellard began thinking about how to create a health care system that works with the elderly population when she worked at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. After stints at naviHealth and senior care tech platform Honor, she founded Sitka, a telehealth platform that helps patients navigate specialty care. The San Francisco-based company has raised $22.2 million in venture funding, per Crunchbase.
Telehealth access to specialty care is far more difficult than, say, finding a therapist or primary care physician. Part of the reason is because much of speciality care is, by nature, unique, and doesn’t always translate well to a virtual setting. But as the number of patients gets larger and the number of speciality care providers gets smaller, telehealth is going to be an increasingly important piece of the health care infrastructure as boomers age.
Could you paint me a picture of what reality we’re going to see soon with the boomer population getting older? What do they want? What do they expect out of their care? And what exactly is the thing we’re supposed to be preparing for?
Mellard: So there are assisted living, independent living, skilled nursing facilities. And that’s one aspect of how we think about the aging infrastructure. Historically, that group of people who housed many of our aging seniors hadn’t thought of themselves as health care providers until very recently.
Kelsey Mellard, CEO of Sitka
I think there’s a type of convergence between how we think about housing needs and health care infrastructure, and navigational infrastructure as it relates to senior care today and moving forward. And we’re finally starting to see where those two things are recognizing one another and the value that each of these categories brings to the service.
The aging population — even if they’re aging relatively healthily — still start to utilize our system more and more as a direct correlation to age, which is going to continue to drive the need for more care models to be delivered at various sites of care. So we now see more home-based models, more models going into people’s assisted living, independent living facilities.
You touched on something I am very interested in, which is this very tangible need that we are going to see very soon. And then on the other side, this beautiful utopian concept of preventive care that does not really exist in our system as we know it. But there is going to be, I assume, a need for us to push more preventive health care systems forward just because that’s going to be important in caring for this population.
Mellard: Most people think you go into an assisted living facility to die, as opposed to, “I’m going to live, and I’m going to live well.” And there’s going to start to be more of that conversation driving some of the development in this space that we haven’t historically seen.
There’s also this strain on the health care system. I think it’s something that we found really interesting at Sitka. We practice medicine across state lines to bring different levels of efficiency into our system. And so while telehealth needed to spike as a result of the pandemic, that’s come back down. 
But there is going to be this need for general digital health, maneuvering and navigating not only across state lines, but also across interested parties, like within the family member spectrum. 
The rural nature of most of our country creates incredible challenges of accessing the right care knowledge at the right time. So we are going to continue to see more digital adoption occur, even into the aging population. Historically, there’s this big story that seniors don’t use tech. And I think the pandemic kind of largely proved that’s not accurate. Our aging population is actually very capable of using technology, which is great.

Online Wine Club Winc Files For Bankruptcy As Direct-To-Consumer Stocks Get Hammered,Marlize van Romburgh,2022/12/1,"

Winc, an online wine subscription service aimed at millennials that went public on the New York Stock Exchange last year, has filed for bankruptcy protection, according to multiple media reports. Shares of the Santa Monica, California-based company have declined 98% since its stock market debut.
Winc was founded in 2012 as Club W. The company, which sends customers customized wine shipments based on their tastes, raised a total of $54.2 million from venture investors including Bessemer Venture Partners, Shining Capital and Crosscut Ventures, according to Crunchbase data. 
It raised another $22 million in its November 2021 IPO amid a spike on online alcohol sales during the pandemic. Its market capitalization has hovered around $3.6 million lately — a fraction of its most recent private valuation of $112.3 million in late 2019.

Winc filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection — which allows a company to keep operating as it reorganizes — listing $50.3 million in assets and $36.8 million in liabilities. The company generated $72.1 million in revenue last year, but never turned a profit.
Its largest unsecured creditor listed in bankruptcy filings, Bloomberg reported, is Facebook parent Meta, which is owed $724,000, presumably for online advertising.
Shares of consumer brands have been particularly hard hit this year amid stock market turmoil. Among them:

Shares of ​​The Honest Co., Jessica Alba’s consumer goods brand, have fallen about 84% since its May 2021 IPO.
Oat-milk maker Oatly went public in May 2021. Its shares are trading down about 93% since then.
Poshmark, a second-hand clothing marketplace, went public in early 2021. Its shares are down about 79% since then.
ThredUp, another used-clothing marketplace, has seen its shares decline 94% since its March 2021 IPO.
FIGS, which makes medical scrubs, went public in May 2021. Its shares are down about 76% since then.
Shares of clothing rental service Rent the Runway are down roughly 92% since the company’s October 2021 public market debut.

Frore Systems Emerges From Stealth With $100M From Investors Including Mayfield And Qualcomm Ventures,Chris Metinko,2022/12/1,"

Everyone has heard that fan kick on in their laptop or tablet, followed by that dread that inevitably the device is about to slow down to a crawl.
Frore Systems emerged from stealth Thursday promising to fix that issue — and with some big-named backers behind it.
The company, which has spent the last four years developing its AirJet chip, announced it has raised more than $100 million from the likes of Mayfield 1, Addition, Clear Ventures and Qualcomm Ventures. Frore founders Seshu Madhavapeddy and Surya Ganti both worked at Qualcomm in the past.

The company also announced a collaboration with Intel for its Intel Evo laptops.
The problem
Heat is a big problem in computing — as anyone who has ever felt their phone or tablet warm up knows. A device’s processor generates more heat the faster it works. Most manufacturers of devices install mechanical fans to help with cooling or force the processor to slow if overheated.
Neither solution is ideal, especially since cutting the processor’s power can cause your device to slow or stall.
“While the latest processors promise higher performance, only 50% or less is realized because the thermal solutions are still the same, old, passive or fan-based systems that are inadequate, noisy, and bulky,” said founder and CEO Madhavapeddy in a release.
“Thermal is the only aspect of modern-day computing that still uses century-old technology,” Madhavapeddy said. “In today’s devices, what often determines performance is the capability of the thermal solution and not the sophistication of the processor.”
The cooling chips come in two sizes from the San Jose-based startup  — the AirJet Mini and AirJet Pro — and cool silently while not slowing the processor.
The mini chip is already shipping, while the larger pro chip is anticipated to ship in the first quarter of next year.

Early-Stage Investor 645 Ventures Closes 4th Fund,Gené Teare,2022/12/1,"

645 Ventures has closed on its fourth fund and first select fund, oversubscribed at $348 million. With this latest fund, the New York- and San Francisco-based firm now manages more than $550 million. 
We spoke with co-founders and partners Nnamdi Okike, previous principal at Insight Partners and a board member at the NVCA, and Aaron Holiday, who was previously a software engineer at Goldman Sachs and currently sits on the board of Cornell Tech.
“We’ve had a lot of success in our first three funds in terms of returns and recent exits,” said Okike. The founders reached out to its limited partner advisory committee last year to strategize for its next fund.

“We’ve really focused on capital-efficient companies,” Okike said, commenting on the firm’s success in raising its fourth fund. “We shy away from a lot of the exuberance of the past couple of years.” 
Holiday noted that last year the firm’s portfolio raised $1.1 billion in follow-on capital, far exceeding the reserves of its core fund, which led to its first select fund. 
Nnamdi Okike (above) and Aaron Holiday
The firm is reserving 44% of the capital to invest in follow-on funding rounds, in what it calls a “tournament strategy” to invest in its most successful companies that could potentially return the fund.  
For its new fund, 75% came from existing LPs who stepped up. And 95% are institutional investors including endowments, foundations and fund of funds. 
645 Ventures invests at seed between $1 million to $5 million, and up to $10 million at Series A. From the select fund, it can invest between $10 million and $15 million. 
To source and track investment opportunities, an in-house four-person engineering team built Voyager, a core asset to the firm that enables it to find investments outside of the firm’s network. It also has an investment research team to evaluate opportunities, a success team to support its portfolio companies, and a finance and operations team. 
645’s winning bets
Since July the firm has had three portfolio companies acquired, and its first IPO. Washington-based FiscalNote, a global intelligence company, went public in August 2022 via a special-purpose acquisition. 
It is a seed investor in two San Francisco-based unicorn companies: user engagement marketing platform Iterable and cybersecurity company Panther.
It also has two emerging unicorn companies, both based out of New York, in its portfolio: sports network Overtime and barbershop management service Squire. 
The team raised its first fund of $8 million from high-net-worth individuals in 2014. Its second fund with its first institutional investors was raised in 2018, totaling $41 million, and its third fund in 2020 totaled $160 million.  
Among its Connected Network advisers it counts Howard Morgan, previously at First Round Capital, Scott Maxwell previously at Insight, and Greg Pass, previously CTO at Twitter.

5 Interesting Startup Deals You May Have Missed In November: How To Say A Name And Pamper Yourself Without Going Broke,Chris Metinko,2022/12/1,"

This is a monthly column that runs down five interesting deals every month that may have flown under the radar. Check out October’s entry here.
Venture capital normally starts to slow down in the last couple of months of the year — the record-breaking 2021 excluded, obviously.
Last month did feel that way, with fewer rounds being announced and funding being down. However, there were still some intriguing rounds from companies that do things a little differently.
Here are five noteworthy November rounds from startups helping you pronounce someone’s name to others making urban farming a reality.
Say my name
There isn’t one person in the world who hasn’t come across a name and wondered out loud or at least in their mind, “How do you say that?”
It’s embarrassing and can also affect a relationship either party is trying to establish with the other.
NameCoach is here to help. The Palo Alto, California-based company is trying to solve the problem of name mispronunciation in critical settings. The startup locked up an $8 million Series A led by Impact America Fund last month.
The company’s software embeds accurate, context-aware audio name pronunciation buttons in everyday tools people use. The technology currently is used by educators, sales reps, customer support agents, call centers and recruiters, according to the company.
As the startup pointed out in its announcement of the funding, pronunciation is something that has become even more important as cultural norms change and people care deeply about their identity.
Eighty percent of the 30 million unique names in the world have multiple pronunciations, according to NameCoach.
This is a tool even a journalist would love.
Paltrow and Alba’s high-end pampering bet
We all have passed an amazing resort and wondered what it would be like to stay there.
ResortPass may help you be able to find out.
The New York-based startup raised $26 million in Series B last month co-led by Declaration Partners and 14W — and with investments from the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and Jessica Alba. The company offers day access to luxury hotels and resorts around the world — think Ritz-Carltons and Four Seasons.
The idea is many people may want to use a resort’s spa or pool, but can’t really afford to spend the type of cash for an overnight stay. Founded in 2016, ResortPass now works with more than 900 hotels.
It’s an interesting business model with some notable backers who likely know high-end resorts well. However, one has to wonder if the people who book a stay at such resorts would be thrilled with an influx of people using a place’s amenities without having to pay the same freight.
Just a thought.
Renting better
We often make fun of startups that come up with new “as-a-service” monikers.
When New York-based Rezi raised $100 million in debt financing from Stratos Credit and described itself as offering “Occupancy-as-a-Service” for rental property owners, it caught our eye.
However, this “OasS” startup escapes ridicule as it takes on a serious problem in renting. While the platform is designed to help landlords with quick and painless leasing, it also helps renters find homes through an online approval process. That can help remove some of the unfortunate biases people face.
In theory, the platform should help both landlords and tenants, so who can laugh at that.
Fresh food for all
Agtech has become increasingly popular with investors in recent years. Continuing that trend, a Boston-based startup closed a $17.5 million Series B3 co-led by Aliaxis and Ospraie Ag Science.
Freight Farms creates container farms that can be used anywhere and uses software enhancements for higher crop quality. The idea is to be able to grow fresh, local and healthy food year round — even in so-called “food deserts” that have challenging geographies and climates.
While vertical hydroponic farming is not new, the idea of a single shipping container to allow for urban farming enhanced with tech is something that sounds creative to us.
The company has customers in 39 countries and says it has created the largest connected network of farms in the world.
With vertical farming growing at more than a 25% compound annual growth rate and expected to hit a more than $10 billion market by 2026 — per the company — don’t expect investor interest in agtech to wane any time soon.

AI has been in the news a lot lately. However, much of it revolves around marketing and sales automation.
Spot AI caught our attention because of its use of AI involving security cameras. The Los Altos, California-based startup closed a $40 million Series B last month led by Scale Venture Partners to turn CCTV and other types of security camera footage into actual usable insights.
Usually such footage is just used for monitoring, but Spot AI’s platform is being developed to read such camera footage to get insights about anything from security to operations to safety.
The company is trying to make “video intelligence” an actual thing.
Since we already feel we are always being watched, we might as well get some good data points out of it.

"
New Jersey’s Startup Scene Is A Lot More Than BlockFi,Joanna Glasner,2022/12/1,"

While Jersey City is just an 11-minute train ride from Manhattan’s financial district, it’s historically been worlds apart when it comes to startup funding.
Ditto for the state of New Jersey as a whole. Despite being the most densely populated U.S. state and a major center of expertise in areas from pharma to finance, the Garden State lags its northern neighbor, New York, by a long shot when it comes to startup funding.

Now, crypto can no longer be counted on to help close that gap. The bankruptcy filing this week of Jersey City-based cryptocurrency lender BlockFi marks an end to any realistic hope of venture returns from its business. Before this year, the company ranked among New Jersey’s most heavily funded startups and was one of the hottest names in the emerging space.
Still, one would be remiss to count out New Jersey’s startup scene. So far this year, Garden State companies have pulled in $2.47 billion in seed through late-stage funding, per Crunchbase data. With a month left in the year, that’s already the second-highest haul of the past five years, as charted out below:


Yes, it’s well behind New York, which has a little more than double the population and pulled in $23.5 billion in startup funding so far this year. But still, New Jersey’s numbers reflect a pretty sizable and diverse startup scene, led by pharma, fintech and enterprise software.
Biggest rounds, biggest sectors
So far this year, New Jersey’s biggest funding round by a long shot is a $620 million March Series D that went to Cross River, a provider of embedded financial tools that counts a number of well-funded fintechs among its users. Andreessen Horowitz and Eldridge led the financing for the 14-year-old company.
Other recipients of large rounds include:

Areteia Therapeutics, developer of an asthma therapeutic, raised $350 million in a July Series A round led by Bain Capital Life Sciences.
Semperis, a developer of enterprise identity protection technology, raised $200 million in a May Series C led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.
Pathlock, a provider of application security and controls automation technology, raised $200 million in a May Series C round led by Vertica Capital Partners.

Over the years, New Jersey’s startup funding tallies tend to fluctuate quite broadly, depending in large part on the number and size of a handful of supergiant rounds. But even with venture funding down overall both globally and in the U.S., the Garden State is poised for an above-par year for venture funding.

Vial’s $67M Raise Spotlights An Untapped Moneymaker For Pharmacies,Keerthi Vedantam,2022/11/30,"

Clinical trials are the make-or-break step to financial success for a drug that took decades to make. Without them, it can’t get approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
Trials have always been challenging to execute, but now the  makeover that began during the pandemic is getting a refresh.

Enter Vial, a San Francisco-based startup designed to organize the trial process. The company announced on Wednesday it raised $67 million in funding led by General Catalyst with additional participation from the likes of Byers Capital and BoxGroup.
Clinical trials have undergone massive changes since the pandemic when the FDA outlined new policies allowing them to continue in a remote environment. As a result, a slew of startups like Vial have entered the clinical trial space to make the process faster and more efficient while troubleshooting problems that may result in the FDA not approving a drug.
What’s the problem?
Vial is tackling one of the most tedious problems in biotech: slow-moving and capital-intensive clinical trials. The clinical trial process, by which drugs are tested on humans, requires proper execution in order to be approved by the FDA.
But there are a lot of inefficiencies in the process: companies need to cherry-pick the right candidates for their drug, and there are often age or disease-severity requirements associated with being qualified to take the drug. Those candidates also need to be able to visit a health office frequently for clinicians to collect a slew of biometric and behavioral data from them throughout the clinical trial.
Vial’s platform allows companies to find patients across the country and better collect data that can be organized. Through its suite of applications, research organizations can manage patients worldwide on one platform, have a central hub for communicating and organizing participants and collect data in a uniform manner.
Companies like Vial have seen massive funding since the pandemic. In 2021 funding peaked at over $2 billion, according to Crunchbase data.
 


A new profit-making venture
Big box stores are getting involved too. In October, Walmart announced it would jump on the clinical trial train by identifying patients that may qualify as test subjects for a certain drug or product.
Through its pharmacy patient portal, patients get recommendations for opportunities they can participate in. In June, Walgreens launched its own clinical trial department and in February, CVS partnered with Medable to provide clinical trial services at its pharmacy-clinics.
Several of these companies bill their services as a way to get more diversity into clinical trials. Indeed, a decentralized clinical trial process is easier to onboard patients without asking them to commit to a full schedule of visiting testing sites for years, opening the door for people with disabilities, lower income individuals and people of color to participate in testing drugs that would enter the market.
In reality, pharmacy data from big companies like Walmart and CVS are likely huge untapped streams of revenue from biotech companies willing to spend to find the right participants for their clinical trials.
Biotech companies are racing against their drug patents, which expire after around 20 years to make way for generics. That means every inefficiency in the drug approval process can cost a company extra years of would-be profit.

Crypto Exchange Kraken Cuts Workforce; U.S. Pushing More Industry Regulation,Chris Metinko,2022/11/30,"

The brutal month for crypto exchanges continues.
On Wednesday, San Francisco-based Kraken announced it will cut approximately 1,100 people, or 30%, of its workforce “in order to adapt to current market conditions.”

In a blog, co-founder and CEO Jesse Powell wrote: “Since the start of this year, macroeconomic and geopolitical factors have weighed on financial markets. This resulted in significantly lower trading volumes and fewer client sign-ups. We responded by slowing hiring efforts and avoiding large marketing commitments. Unfortunately, negative influences on the financial markets have continued and we have exhausted preferable options for bringing costs in line with demand.”
The reduction will take Kraken’s employment count to where it was a year ago, Powell said.
The layoffs are just the latest bad news for an industry still trying to come to terms with the FTX implosion, which has crippled many firms that had any exposure to what was at one time the fourth largest exchange by volume.
U.S. government eyes regulation
The FTX collapse and crypto’s deepening winter has not escaped the eye of those wanting more regulations in the industry.
On Wednesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she remained skeptical about the industry and that FTX’s implosion and other turmoil in the crypto market showed it needed adequate regulation.
The comments come one day before the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee will hold the first hearing to examine FTX’s stunning collapse.

Web3 Weekly: FTX’s ‘Death Spiral’ Continues To Leave A Sea Of Wreckage,Chris Metinko,2022/11/30,"

This is a weekly feature that will look back at the week that was in crypto, blockchain and Web3, and offer insights and analysis. Check out our previous column here.
This week started off like the past few have and many will in the future — with a crypto company admitting financial difficulties thanks to the spectacular collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange.
Crypto lender BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Monday. In July, FTX gave BlockFi a $400 million revolving credit facility that included an option to buy BlockFi for up to $240 million. Earlier this month, BlockFi suspended withdrawals on its platform after FTX’s troubles came to light.

While also blaming crypto’s down year for the company’s predicament, Mark Renzi with the Berkeley Research Group — the proposed financial advisers for the company — emphasized FTX’s implosion was “a major cause” in BlockFi’s bankruptcy.
The 41-page filing described FTX’s fall as a “death spiral,” and BlockFi’s inability to access its credit facility forced the company to seek bankruptcy protection.
BlockFi had already drawn $275 million on the facility, and on Nov. 8 requested an additional $125 million, the filing states. However, by that time news of FTX’s troubles had spread and FTX did not honor the request. Shortly thereafter, Bankman-Fried’s other trading firm Alameda Research defaulted on $680 million of collateralized loan obligations it owed to BlockFi.
A new path forward
BlockFi is now seeking to “stabilize” its business through restructuring, and Renzi’s affidavit states the company does “not face the myriad issues apparently facing FTX.” However, it seems like a hard row to hoe as the FTX bankruptcy likely will only muddle up BlockFi’s attempts.
It’s a far descent for BlockFi, which raised $350 million at a valuation of $3 billion in March 2021 and followed that up four months later with a $500 million round at a reportedly $4.8 billion valuation.
More stories about FTX’s wave of destruction will continue to follow in the next several months. On Tuesday, The Information reported some Web3 unicorn companies FTX invested in at high valuations may have trouble attracting investors willing to pay the same for FTX’s stakes.
The story really is just beginning.

"
Luck’s Role In Venture Capital,Guest Author,2022/11/30,"

By Dan Gray
How much of a startup investor’s success can be attributed to luck?

Pablo Ventura, general partner at K Fund, believes that luck has a significant influence. His personal retrospective provides a fascinating opportunity to look at the philosophy behind venture capital and early-stage startup investment. I applaud the humility, but would like to suggest a different outlook.
Defining luck
Winning a high-stakes poker tournament as a beginner requires luck. Making a comfortable living as a professional poker player requires ability.
Dan Gray of Equidam
Of those two scenarios, it’s the second we’re likely to identify with venture capital, given the shared focus on analytical thinking and consistency. The first is a better reflection of a founder’s journey.
We all know the stories about VCs taking risky bets on early-stage companies with big ideas. Surely that’s evidence of a major luck component?
The greatest hurdle to understanding venture capital is that VCs expect most of the companies they back to fail. That sounds unintuitive, but it’s the simple and natural trade-off against potential.
You might have heard this concept referred to as the “VC Power Law,” well-explained by Luke Mostert, head of investments at Future Africa, in his recent Twitter thread.
In essence, the nature of a startup’s category-leading ambition means a lot of small losses is worth it for a few massive wins for investors. VCs want to back founders who will blow their company up trying to break the stratosphere, rather than those seeking a modest exit.
The corollary is that if every company in a VC’s portfolio produces a return, that’s a bad signal. It’s a sign that the VC is playing a low-stakes game: Not thinking big enough, not taking enough risk, and likely not producing the scale of return people expect from that asset class.
If that ratio of failure to success is intrinsic, and priced into the VC model, can you really attribute success or failure to luck?
Professional poker players will talk about the curse of “variance” (the deviation from expectations based on chance), but ultimately agree that luck is not a factor on long-term results. How the cards get dealt, how you deal with those situations, and the times you just have to take a loss on the chin are all assumed and accounted for. Only bad players refer to luck as an excuse.
If you want to see luck at work in venture capital you can certainly give it the opportunity: Dump your whole fund into one company, invest exclusively in sectors you don’t understand, or throw a dart at a board of opportunities. Just be wary, because while you might cite luck when you’re being humble about success, LPs certainly won’t accept it as an excuse for failure.
The smart approach is always to eliminate your exposure to luck with the usual combination of careful long-term strategy, observation and calibration.
“Hilariously-early stage” VC firm Hustle Fund offers a useful example to illustrate this philosophy: as the descriptor implies, it focuses on founders at the riskiest end of the spectrum, with the most untested assumptions.
Writing a lot of small initial checks allows it to convert that uncertainty into a strategic advantage: it gets the inside track on a startup before others, saves its seat at the table, and makes better decisions about involvement in larger future raises. It is smart, systematic and works out well for everyone.
The bread and butter of investors is consistency and repetition.
Leave luck for the founders, they need it more.

Autonomous Trucking’s Highway To Broke,Joanna Glasner,2022/11/30,"

The highway of startup ambitions is littered with the wreckage of companies that aimed to bring autonomy to the long-haul trucking industry.
Earlier this week, we documented the downward stock market trajectory of Embark Technology, a startup — backed by a host of big-name VCs — that has seen virtually all of its valuation evaporate since going public the past year.
But we’d be remiss to create the impression that Embark is the only high-valuation startup to find obstacles on the road to implementing autonomous trucking. A lot of upstarts devising labor-saving ways to truck goods from point A to point B have found anything but an easy route to market.

Using Crunchbase data, we identified at least six companies, in addition to Embark, that have raised venture capital for autonomous truck technology. Of those six, three have shut down and one has seen its valuation crumble. A couple more are still trucking ahead, having last raised financing in sunnier times for the space.
Below, we look at the most prominent funding recipients, and where they are now:
No. 1 Otto: San Francisco-based Otto, one of the earlier startups focused on self-driving trucks, sold to Uber for $680 million in 2016. About two years later, Uber shuttered its self-driving truck division and said it would focus its autonomous driving efforts on cars.
No. 2 Starsky Robotics: Starsky Robotics, a venture-backed San Francisco-based autonomous trucking upstart, was another casualty. The company shut down in 2020 after its Series B fell through. Starsky had raised just over $20 million in funding since it was founded in 2015.
No. 3 Peloton Technology: A similar fate befell Peloton Technology, a Silicon Valley-based autonomous and connected driving technology startup that developed a vehicle “platooning” system to enable pairs of trucks to operate at a close following distance. The company raised over $78 million in known funding before shuttering last year.
No. 4 TuSimple: Next up is TuSimple, a San Diego-headquartered developer of robotic truck technology that carried out an IPO in April 2022. It has also fared poorly. After going public at an initial valuation around $8.5 billion, the company now has a market cap around $500 million, and what looks to be a negative enterprise value. Shares fell last month when the company fired its CEO amid an investigation into improper ties to a Chinese startup.
No. 5 Kodiak Robotics: One more that’s still on the road is Kodiak Robotics, which has raised $165 million in venture funding to date. Notably, the Silicon Valley company took on debt financing for its last round of $30 million in October. While we don’t know Kodiak’s specific reason for taking debt, it is sometimes a strategy for companies that need growth capital but prefer to avoid a VC-funded down round in a time of declining valuations.
No. 6 Aurora: Last but not least is Aurora. Founded in 2017, the Pittsburgh-based company announced in summer of 2021 that it would go public via a merger with a SPAC, Reinvent Technology, at an initial market capitalization of around $13 billion (including about $2.5 billion in cash). At the time, the company planned to first launch its autonomous driving technology for the trucking industry in 2023, with last-mile delivery and ride-hailing markets to follow. Shares are now down more than 90% from their post-debut peak about a year ago.
The broad takeaway? This is a hard market to crack and, while impressive technology abounds, no one has yet succeeded commercially. Investors are currently not looking so optimistic about the prospects that anyone will either.

Google’s AI Could Check For Breast Cancer,Keerthi Vedantam,2022/11/29,"

Google announced this week it will partner with iCAD, a cancer detection company, to bring its AI-enabled mammography software into the world of breast cancer detection.
Through the licensing partnership, iCAD will integrate Google’s AI platform with its suite of AI solutions for breast imaging and potentially improve the company’s ability to screen for breast cancer at earlier stages.

It’s the first time Google’s mammography platform will be tested out in the real world, but it’s far from the only technology of its kind. In the past few years, artificial intelligence has made its way to the forefront of health care for its promise to solve perhaps the largest problem: finding the disease.
The effects of this kind of infrastructure are far-reaching. Not only could patients access parts of the health care system faster, it could mean less turnover of medical professionals, catching disease earlier, and in general lowering health care spending in a country that, quite frankly, spends a lot for little return.
In a post-pandemic health care system, those effects cannot be ignored. Though AI in diagnosis has been a popular concept for a while, it wasn’t until the past couple of years these startups got some serious funding.
Between 2020 and 2021, funding jumped into the billions for the first time in at least a decade. And 2022 saw more than $883 million in funding per Crunchbase data.


 
The promise of AI
Most people walk around with all sorts of health ailments and never know it until it’s too late. Part of reason for that is the screening process: Specialists are few and far between, and booking an appointment only to get a screening done isn’t always the best use of their time or the patient’s.
But what if AI-enabled software could sit at every doctor’s office, pharmacy and health clinic for a quick breast cancer exam? What if similar technology existed to check for diabetes? Or cavities? What if it was easier to get a doctor’s appointment because fewer people were going in for checkups? What if doctors could stave off burnout by only seeing patients who need to be treated?
Of course, the technology is still in its early days. The Food and Drug Administration is grappling with how to regulate the data sets these platforms are trained on. And, of course, no health technology will ever make it without buy-in from skeptical doctors worried about black box technology.

"Technology Complicated Billing For Doctors, But Can Technology Fix It?",Keerthi Vedantam,2022/11/29,"

Technology is a double-edged sword, and nobody knows that better than doctors.
Pre-digitization, doctors billed insurance companies by circling a handful of codes corresponding to diagnoses and processes and turning it in. The digitization of that process made it much easier for doctors to double reimbursements by selecting more billing codes. As a result, insurance companies demanded more proof and recordkeeping for the services doctors billed.
That led to a gamified billing system in health care, requiring doctors to take meticulous notes of each interaction and procedure with a patient, documenting every minute of an appointment, and turning massive patient panels into hours of administrative billing work on top of caring for patients.

“A really fairly simple, straightforward method of fee-for-service billing has now become a giant monster where the temptation of maximizing each billing opportunity drives an infrastructure that makes life absolutely miserable,” said Paul Chung, Kaiser Permanente physician and UCLA health policy professor.
The advent of technology fixed a lot of problems in billing, but brought an onslaught of new ones. Now the medical industry and startups are finding their way out of the mess that technology created.
Health care-focused insurtech startups have raised $215 million so far in 2022, a paltry amount compared to how much the sector received in 2021 ($1.3 billion, largely due to fertile economic times), but far more than 2020 and 2019, showing the problem is not one that venture left behind after the pandemic.
Why is billing so complicated?
The billing process is integral to the electronic health record system in the U.S. Each flu shot, diagnosis and procedure corresponds to a billing code and acts as a ledger for insurance companies to look at as proof the encounter took place.
Here’s the problem: A 10-minute appointment could have one billing code, while a 12-minute visit could correspond to another billing code. Can a patient’s diabetes be deemed mild or severe? Those are two different codes as well.
“As you start to see health care expenditure grow the way that it has in the U.S. without the improvement of outcomes, you start to question a lot of what’s driving the cost to go up,” said Jordan Nof, co-founder of Tusk Venture Partners which focuses on industries that operate in heavily regulated markets. “And a lot of it is inefficiencies that are driven around the infrastructure of health care.”
For example, doctors weren’t paid for conducting appointments over the phone or video, even if it was the most efficient process, until insurance companies made telehealth billable. And documenting every patient interaction prevents them from spending more time with the patient and affects rapport.
“That distinction is all codified and thus eventually gamified,” said Neil Batlivala, co-founder of physician platform Pair Team. “And all that burden falls on the clinician.”
Pair Team, a San Francisco-based administrative platform that streamlines operations in rural or understaffed clinics, entered the fray in 2021 with $10 million in funding. Part of the company’s tech stack translates doctors’ notes into billing codes across different health plans, allowing doctors to spend more time with patients.
Can new technology fix the problems that came with old technology?
Very few startups have been ambitious enough to tackle payments in the health care sector, partially because the web of insurers and providers is so vast, and each comes with its own set of reporting standards and styles.
Tusk Venture’s Nof said he’s eyeing companies like San Francisco-based Flexpa that builds developer tools and API integrations for the platforms health care systems are already using. Instead of creating one single, standardized system that clinics and doctor’s offices probably won’t adopt, Flexpa creates specific tools linking already-present systems together
“You’re letting them build on top of those APIs,” Nof said.
We’ve talked about companies that act as scribes in health care before. Abridge, which raised $12.5 million in August, helps physicians with the meticulous note-taking process that comes with billing through conversational AI. This infrastructure is key, especially for lower-income health clinics that need to wring every last dollar out of their patient interactions.
“Only bigger systems can do all of the complicated reporting … Rural hospital systems haven’t been able to compete,” Batlivala said. “Even though they’re providing the same or higher-quality care, their reporting isn’t in place because they have to work across four or five or six different health plans that all have their own different interpretations and reporting requirements. And there’s just no standardization.”
Indeed, billing isn’t just an inconvenient thorn in the side of physicians. It’s a massive, cumbersome portion of the health care system that incurs waste, creates inefficiencies and lowers the quality of care in a country that desperately needs to raise it. Startups will have to figure out how to throw more technology into it without causing unintended consequences.

"Special Series Part 4: From Wigs To Fish, Some Very Quirky AI Startups Got Funded In 2022",Joanna Glasner,2022/11/29,"

Editor’s note: This story is the final part of our four-part series on artificial intelligence startups and their impact on multiple sectors. In Part One, we analyzed VC investment in AI over the last decade. Part Two looked at the billions of dollars rolling into AI-enhanced cybersecurity. Part Three explored AI’s promise to transform medical imaging technology. — Special Projects Editor Christine Kilpatrick
For years now, startup investors have been busily writing checks to founders applying artificial intelligence in creative new ways to their respective industries.
That momentum continued in 2022, with investors signing on to back some rather quirky applications of AI technology. 
How quirky? Using Crunchbase data, we assembled a list of some of the more unusual-seeming models. If they pan out, expect a future where AI-enabled tech can customize your wig, cut your meat, sort your trash and track lice on your fish farm. (If you have a fish farm, that is.)

Without further ado, here are six recently funded or launched AI endeavors applying technology in surprising ways:
Customize your wig: New York startup Parfait has seen the AI future, and it’s all about making wigs. The company raised $5 million in April, with tennis star Serena Williams listed as a backer. Parfait uses artificial intelligence to capture a client’s exact measurements and skin tone when crafting its wigs. The company’s goal is to speed up the process and significantly cut costs for producing high-quality custom wigs, which usually cost upward of $2,000 and take months to make.
Upgrade your skincare: Estonian startup Haut.AI is applying artificial intelligence technology to the pressing task of figuring out which skincare products work best. The company, which counts Microsoft for Startups and Nvidia Inception Program among its partners, operates an AI engine trained on millions of face and skin images to match users to appropriate products based on over 14 skin health and beauty metrics.
Give you a good night’s sleep: Bryte makes high-tech mattresses optimized for restorative rest by tracking sleep duration, stages and efficiency. In July, the Silicon Valley company pulled in $20 million in a round led by mattressmaker Tempur Sealy.
Be your friend: Replika, an app that makes digital avatars that interact with people in the role of friend and confidant, has drawn over 10 million users in its few short years of existence. As users chat with the avatar, the AI learns more about them and improves its ability to provide personalized responses. VC-funded mental health app Woebot, which is also AI-powered, functions more as a mental health tool — it “listens,” asks questions and makes recommendations. Both startups join several other AI tools that purport to offer the kind of emotional support and interpersonal interaction one usually expects from a human. 
Keep your fish healthy: If you’re a fish farmer, AI technology can help deliver healthier fish at lower cost. That’s the pitch from Aquabyte, a 5-year-old Norwegian startup that raised $25 million in a July Series B round and counts SoftBank Ventures Asia as a backer. Aquabyte uses AI to scale adoption of tools that enable automatic lice counting, welfare scoring and biomass control, among other data-driven offerings. Meanwhile, another aquaculture-focused AI startup, Norway’s Aquaticode, also scored funding this year, pulling in $6 million in an August Series A.
Warn about a flood: In recent quarters, we’ve been seeing a good bit of venture investment directed at weather-related startups. Now, one AI-focused startup is promising better tools to predict one of the most worrisome of weather developments: flooding. Cloud to Street, calls its offering an AI- and satellite-powered technology that can track floods in near real time anywhere on Earth. To further this effort, the New York-based company pulled in $12 million in Series A funding in September.
Methodology
The dataset for the funding analysis includes companies categorized by Crunchbase as one of several sectors tied to fintech and financial services. Companies included in the results may be fully financial services-focused or include financial services as a significant focus of their business models. Funding rounds included in the results totaled at least $200,000 and included companies founded no more than 20 years prior to the funding.

The Bahamas Government Pushes Back After FTX Crash. So Who Are The Recently Funded Startups Based There?,Jenna D'Illard,2022/11/28,"

Stop making jokes about startups based in the Bahamas.
That wasn’t the official message of the country’s government reps last night during a national address, but we all know that a snicker or two naturally accompanies conversation around the fact that FTX (and other crypto companies) is based in the tropical island country.

The spoken or unspoken insinuation is that the country likely doesn’t carry the same rules, regulations or enforcement as other major markets.
Not true, say the country’s leaders.
In fact, Bahamas’ government officials came out strongly last night in defense of the country’s actions in the wake of the FTX implosion during a video released on the Office of the Prime Minister’s YouTube page.
Government of The Bahamas Attorney General Ryan Pinder released a 20-plus minute pre-recorded video last night outlining the country’s actions surrounding the FTX drama that has unfolded in recent weeks.
“It is important for me to share this summary of what took place, because over the last few weeks the basic facts have been obscured by guessing games and rumors,” Pinder said. “We understand the enormous interest in this story, but as a government we decided right away that what was most important was not to engage with speculation or gossip, but instead to proceed methodically and deliberately in accordance with the exercise of due process and the rule of law.”
The country’s securities and exchange commission suspended FTX Digital Market’s license, appointed liquidators “swiftly” and secured the companies’ assets, according to Pinder.
Who are the funded startups in the Bahamas?
A query of Crunchbase data shows that of the nine recently funded companies headquartered in the Bahamas, the majority operate in the blockchain space.


This includes FTX (obviously), but notable also is Orderly Network, which uses an on-chain orderbook to provide a platform through decentralized exchange protocol and modular ecosystems. Orderly received a $20 million seed round in June, according to Crunchbase data.
But not all funded startups on the list operate in the crypto space. Odyssey Aviation, a network of fixed-base operations and ground handling stations serving the private aviation community, reportedly raised an undisclosed round in September from Granite Creek Partners and others, according to Crunchbase.
For his part, Pinder made it clear last night that the Bahamas is a safe, legal and respectable place to do business.
“Any attempt to lay the entirety of this debacle at the feet of the Bahamas, because FTX is headquartered here, would be a gross oversimplification of reality,” said Pinder in the video. “… we have been shocked at the ignorance of those who have said that FTX came to the Bahamas because they did not want to submit to regulatory scrutiny.”
Meanwhile, disavowed FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried liked and retweeted the Office of the Prime Minister of The Bahamas’ tweet on the speech.
Cue the eyeroll.

BlockFi Files For Bankruptcy As FTX Contagion Spreads,Joanna Glasner,2022/11/28,"

Crypto lender BlockFi is the latest heavily funded company in the cryptocurrency space to file for bankruptcy.
Earlier today, the Jersey City, New Jersey-based company announced that it has filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. BlockFi said it plans to put together a restructuring plan with the intent “to stabilize its business” in a manner “that maximizes value for all clients and other stakeholders.”
As part of its restructuring efforts, BlockFi said it will focus on recovering obligations owed by counterparties, including FTX and associated entities. Due to the recent collapse of FTX, the expectation is that recoveries will be delayed.

Founded in 2017 by finance industry pros Zac Prince and Flori Marquez, BlockFi secured over $900 million in equity backing over the years. Its lead investors include Tiger Global, DST Global, Bain Capital Ventures, Rose Park Advisors and Valar Ventures. The company also raised $400 million in debt financing in June, backed by FTX US, in a deal that also offered FTX the option to buy BlockFi, reportedly for as little as $25 million. (At its peak, around August, 2021, BlockFi had a valuation around $4.5 billion.)
The FTX contagion
In mid-November, after FTX’s collapse, BlockFi said it was pausing withdrawals and asking clients not to submit deposits. The company said “rumors that a majority of BlockFi assets are custodied at FTX are false,” but acknowledged that it did have “significant exposure to FTX and associated corporate entities.”
BlockFi is one of a number of well-funded players in the crypto space with significant ties to FTX. As we’ve previously reported, FTX’s tentacles reached nearly everywhere in the crypto industry. It invested in nearly 50 companies through its venture arm, FTX Ventures. It also made another 180 investments through Sam Bankman-Fried’s other trading firm Alameda Research.
FTX also had a deep reach into the crypto lending space, which had taken off in recent years as prices soared and lenders could bring in new customers with the promise of high yields on their deposits.

Special Series Part 3: AI Could Transform Medical Imaging — So Why Don’t We See It More?,Keerthi Vedantam,2022/11/28,"

Editor’s note: This story is Part Three of our series on artificial intelligence startups and their impact on multiple sectors. In Part One, we analyze VC investment in AI over the last decade. Part Two looks at the billions of dollars rolling into AI-enhanced cybersecurity. Part Four spotlights some creative ways startups apply AI to their sectors.— Special Projects Editor Christine Kilpatrick
There are simply too few doctors in the U.S., and too many patients who need them. 
Amid doctor burnout and long waitlists to see specialists, a niche in technology that saw slow adoption rates was suddenly in high demand: medical imaging AI used to aid in diagnostics. Such technology could help prescreen patients or work alongside physicians to scan images and help find problems that may have gone unnoticed by the tired, overworked human eye.
Funding for startups with this technology jumped from $348 million to over $1 billion between 2020 and 2021, per Crunchbase data. Though that number has dipped to $883 million so far in 2022, it’s still the second-largest year of funding for AI in diagnostics to date. 

“[Adoption] was pretty slow up until COVID,” said Sara Choi, a biotech investor at Wing VC. “Now, I think there’s been a renewed focus on anything that fixes physician or clinician burnout.”
And yet, despite its inherent advantages, doctors are still apprehensive about this new technology. 
“It really requires a quite nuanced understanding of: How is this going to fit into a doctor’s workflow?” said Jacob Effron, a health care-focused investor at Redpoint Ventures. “How does it fit into the incentives of different people in the system?”
An answer to doctor burnout
America’s doctor shortage has effectively turned every clinic, doctor’s office and care organization into need-based systems where only the most urgent patients could see a physician in a timely manner. 
“Humans are missing a lot of diseases because there is an inherent mindset where they’re thinking, ‘Can I treat this patient tomorrow?’” said Kaushal Solanki, CEO and founder of medical imaging AI startup Eyenuk. “And that’s not the preferred threshold.”
Doctors are juggling large patient panels every day, unable to spend enough time with each patient to better treat them. This leads to burnout, which in turn translates into low-quality care. Most importantly, patients who can’t see a doctor frequently are treated for problems that could have been avoided if caught early. 
That’s where companies like Eyenuk come in. The 12-year-old California-based company’s platform can autonomously diagnose diabetic retinopathy, a disease that quietly grows behind the eyes and can worsen without immediate medical intervention. It was granted FDA clearance in 2020 and has processed around 2 million images to date. Eyenuk raised $26 million in Series A funding in October led by AXA Investment Managers, according to Crunchbase data. 
Eyenuk’s platform prescreens patients and allows ophthalmologists to prioritize who to see based on need. But the goal is to one day put the device in hospitals and primary care offices so doctors can check patients’ eyes instead of referring them to a hard-to-find specialist. 
“This could be operated by anybody with a high school diploma and produce an actionable report that can define next steps for the patient, whether they are referred to an ophthalmologist or an eye care specialist, or they would be seen next year for repeat screening,” Solanki said.
This type of medical imaging technology is used in a slew of other sectors as well. Pearl, a venture-backed dentistry startup based in California that has raised $11 million, has a platform called Second Opinion (can you guess why?) that scans teeth imaging to point out a variety of tooth ailments to doctors. Israel-based Aidoc offers radiology-focused artificial intelligence tools to customers that scan radiology images to look for potential issues. The company has raised over $237 million.
Adoption still lags
While adoption spiked during the pandemic, rollout of medical imaging AI is yet to be as widespread as its visionaries would have hoped.
“It’s actually not a problem of the technology not being sophisticated enough,” said Choi. “It’s an adoption problem, and really proving out the use cases to convince providers that there’s business value as well as clinical value to these solutions.”
Provider buy-in is paramount for almost any kind of health care offering, but running through a packed schedule of patients makes it difficult to learn and embrace a new technology that may impede workflow, especially if they don’t think it will add much value.
There’s good reason for that skepticism. The American College of Radiology found that most AI platforms aren’t independently validated, calling into question the accuracy of these platforms. The Food and Drug Administration doesn’t have consistent qualifications for how big or diverse the training data set ought to be.
“We need these models to work transparently and be explainable. And that’s the difference that clinicians are looking for — because a doctor deserves to know how these machine-learning models are reading their patients,” said William Padula, an assistant professor of pharmaceutical and health economics at the University of Southern California. “The fear here is that while the programmer knows what they’ve done to create the model, it’s unclear how exactly it’s looking at the patient.”
But the promise of AI can’t be understated. In a post-pandemic health system, easy-to-access diagnostic resources are going to be important. Public health officials are pushing for more at-home or accessible diagnostic tests for all sorts of illnesses. And diagnostics accounts for 70% of all health care decision-making. 
“We believe that the technology has to be good enough to work on its own. And that actually creates value for the system,” Solanki said. “Now there’s one less thing that the specialists have to worry about, which is routine screening.”

Crunchbase Insider: My Techonomy Conference Takeaways,Gené Teare,2022/11/28,"

I recently attended the Techonomy 2022 conference hosted by long-time journalist David Kirkpatrick and conference CEO Josh Kampel. The gathering in Sonoma on Nov. 13-15 offered a peek into the future, and I found that climate tech, a growing arena for venture investment, was threaded throughout the two days.

Speakers at the event also offered glimpses of what might be on the horizon in areas ranging from private air travel, to new vaccines, to solar energy.
My top 10 takeaways from the event
1. Nuclear fusion: Keynote speaker Michael Schroepfer, ex-CTO and current adviser at Meta, discussed his work on climate and biomedical research through Additional Ventures, a research and grant organization he co-founded with Erin Hoffmann. He called out MIT spin-out Commonwealth Fusion for its science of fusion reactors. “It is the most energy dense reaction that humanity knows in the universe,” he said. The focus is now an engineering problem of how to build it. If Commonwealth Fusion gets this to work “you can build this in a small area and produce basically unlimited free clean energy.”
2. Electric vehicles: “Battery electric is the future for mankind’s mass mobility,” according to Peter Rawlinson, CEO of electric car maker Lucid and the former chief engineer for the Tesla Model S. With the launch of the Lucid Air in 2021, the company is purposefully starting at the luxury end of the car market. “There is a financial imperative at work,” said Rawlinson. “Paradoxically, it costs less to industrialize a high-end product than a low-end product” due to the cost of factories for mass production. Tesla followed this model as well to establish the brand, and then moved to cheaper models. Rawlinson said many Americans imagine regular road trips when shopping for cars, but weekly road trips are a myth. In fact, 95% of electric vehicle charging is done at home overnight but many people lack access to overnight charging — a gap in the market which would benefit from government support, he said. Not all electric vehicles are born equal either. Some are so-called “electron guzzlers.” Lucid apparently has achieved efficiency of 4.6 miles per kilowatt hour, which translates to smaller and cheaper batteries, more miles per charge, and a more comfortable ride, said Rawlinson.
3. Driverless cars: Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO of autonomous ride-sharing service Waymo, said the company is seeking to address safety, or “how do we deploy this technology without asking humans to stay in the loop?” The experience of autopilot, where a driver needs to pay attention but the car will self-drive, does not lead to safety, she said. “We are not going to invite you to be distracted, and then invite you to be attentive.” Waymo is working to develop fully autonomous driving, and its ride-sharing vans are its first product.
4. Robotic friends: The next iteration of robotics that Amazon is focused on includes “robots being companions and endearing members of your family, actually having personality and being able to have conversation with you and knowing something about the environment,” said Ken Washington, VP of consumer robotics at Amazon who showcased the company’s robotic movable device. The robot, named Astro, can monitor your home for security, help elderly family members, and even engage your pet.
5. Venture investment in Africa: Janngo, a venture firm that invests across Africa, is raising its second fund. Firm founder Fatoumata Bâ noted the population across Africa in the next 30 years is projected to  double from 1.2 billion to 2.5 billion, which creates challenges, specifically the need to create 900 million jobs, but also the need for food, health care and education. With 93% of Kenyans using mobile financial services, “tech can be a very powerful way to leapfrog development,” said Bâ. However, there is a big gap as the current GDP and population in Africa equals that of India, but the continent receives less than 1% of global venture spending.
6. Global vaccines: The Open Source Pharma Foundation is looking to create more affordable medicine for a global population, said Jaykumar Menon, its chair and co-founder. It wants to create a global vaccine that works for COVID as well as other vaccinated diseases, with a cost as low as 15 cents a dose. The vaccine is in phase 3 trials. The foundation is also working to  address the most common form of malnutrition, iron deficiency, which affects 2 billion people. Adding iron to iodized salt at a cost of 25 cents per person per year would address this deficiency, which has currently reached 20 million people, explained Menon.
7. Private air: What could private air travel look like in the future? One potential solution could be from  Beyond Aero, a builder of zero-emission private aircraft that use hydrogen-electric propulsion.
8. Energy: TerraPraxis is a climate solution incubator nonprofit engaged in reengineering coal plants with small modular reactors by 2050.
9. Recycling: As companies are stepping up to carbon emissions, Plastic Credit Exchange wants them to commit to recycling plastics. It is partnering with companies to get plastics that have polluted nature collected and recycled.
10. Solar: GAF Energy, a solar shingle company, integrates as part of roofing solutions.
Final thoughts
For me, discussing the future of tech in this intimate Sonoma setting harkened back to the early days of PC Forum, which I attended in the late ’90s. That event, run by angel investor Esther Dyson, was an annual pilgrimage for tech leaders well before Facebook and smartphones were a thing. Sidenote: Dyson also attended Techonomy this year to discuss her Way to Wellville project.
But overall, the range of issues and speakers more than 20 years later at Techonomy proved, to me at least, that the reach of Silicon Valley has extended beyond this narrow corridor.

Autonomous Trucking Software Upstart Embark Has Quietly Gone From $5B+ To Basically Worthless,Joanna Glasner,2022/11/28,"

Out of all the beaten-down public companies in the autonomous driving space, Embark Technology stands out as a conspicuously terrible stock market performer.
The San Francisco-headquartered company, which develops autonomous driving technology for the trucking industry, has presided over a roughly 98% share price decline since going public a year ago. In the process, it’s wiped out close to $5 billion in market capitalization.
Today, Embark and a few others that carried out SPAC mergers are in that weird category of companies trading below the value of cash reserves. In Embark’s case, the company’s recent market capitalization of $110 million is actually quite a bit lower than the $191 million cash it had at the end of Q3. In other words, investors seem to think it’s worth less than nothing.

What happened? What’s noteworthy in Embark’s case, as opposed to some other venture-backed companies that crashed so mightily, is there’s no high-profile scandal. There was also no giant earnings miss, as it’s a pre-revenue company.
Rather, a mix of factors seem to have contributed to its fall, including apparent initial overvaluation, a sectorwide downturn and a critical report from a prolific short-seller. Collectively, those factors have contributed to erasing billions in valuation from a company that once secured backing from the most famous names in venture.
Back story
Embark’s story is the sort of rags-to-riches followed by SPAC-to-rags tale that’s been playing out a lot in the tech sphere. In an effort to glean a better understanding of just what happened, we look at how it got so high, and then so low.
To start at the beginning, when Embark’s co-founders Alex Rodrigues and Brandon Moak formed the venture roughly six years ago, neither was old enough to buy a beer. The company joined the Y Combinator accelerator’s 2016 batch with the  initial intent of building self-driving shuttles for use on college campuses.
Shortly after, the team pivoted to self-driving trucks, focusing on highway driving. It was an enormous market and, although still fabulously difficult, presented a  seemingly more tractable problem to solve.
As with many Y Combinator founding teams, venture funding followed. Between 2016 and 2019, Embark raised a $2 million seed round led by Maven Ventures, a $15 million Series A led by DCVC, a $30 million Series B led by Sequoia Capital, and a $70 million Series C led by Tiger Global.
Ambitions were high, to say the least. An article in The Wall Street Journal a few years back cited CEO Rodrigues projecting initial deployment of a fully autonomous truck in fewer than five years. The company’s long-term vision is for human truckers behind the wheel in city driving, with computers in control on the highway.
2021: A SPAC Odyssey
In 2021, Embark decided to take its venture to the public markets. In June, the company announced an agreement to list on Nasdaq through a merger with a SPAC, Northern Genesis Acquisition Corp. II, in a $5.2 billion deal.
The deal announcement touted Embark’s partnerships with a number of major carriers and fleet operators, who paid a per-mile subscription for software to enable self-driving trucks. The company said it planned to enable carrier operation of self-driving trucks in the U.S. Sunbelt region beginning in 2024.
Embark completed the merger and began trading under the ticker EMBK in November, 2021. Shares fell in first-day trading, and it’s been mostly down since.
A January report from short-seller publication The Bear Cave titled “Problems At Embark Technology” didn’t help matters, contending that “current valuation appears to be based on puffery rather than actual substance.” It warned that the company “holds no patents, has only a dozen or so test trucks, and may be more bark than bite.”
Shareholder class-action lawsuits followed, including charges that Embark had overstated its operational and technological capabilities. In its quarterly filing, the company acknowledged its status as defendant in consolidated securities class-action litigation and brushed off the allegations as “without merit.”
Public markets have not been supportive. In August, partly in a move to avoid delisting for having a share price consistently below $1, Embark announced a 20-to-1 reverse stock split. This move had the effect of boosting individual share price, but not company valuation. Since then, shares have nosedived further.
Self-driving truck startups veer off course, but Embark still has boosters
Embark is one of a number of startups focused on trucking automation that have either hit major roadblocks or ceased operations entirely. We’ll explore these in more detail in a follow-up piece.
A short list of some of the names includes TuSimple (also trading below cash), Starsky Robotics (now defunct), and Peloton Technology (shuttered last year).
It’s a tough space, and, as we observed a few weeks ago, the whole autonomous driving technology arena overall has been taking a beating on public markets. A couple weeks later, Ford Motor-backed Argo AI disclosed it is shutting down as well.
As for Embark, not everyone has turned bearish on the company’s course.
Misha Rindisbacher, Embark’s head of communications, attributed the company’s stock market declines to investor sentiment about the broader industry rather than company-specific performance issues.
“Our fundamentals are unchanged, and I would chalk it up to a larger sectorwide downturn,” he said, noting that the autonomous vehicle space and lidar space are both in the doldrums, and that investors are “probably less comfortable with the space and pre-revenue companies than they were a year ago.”
Series A lead investor DCVC told Crunchbase News via email that from the earliest days, Embark’s team has, in its assessment, “delivered industry-leading technology, safety and performance, earlier and more capital-efficiently by a wide margin than any competitor.”
To date, the firm says, “DCVC still holds every Embark share we ever purchased” and firm founders have “made additional personal purchases of Embark shares to demonstrate their confidence in the company.”
Pat Grady, a partner at Sequoia, still sits on Embark’s board of directors. It also appears the firm has held its stake in the company, per an Embark proxy filing this summer. Tiger Global sold shares in May but still holds a part of its stake.
Trucking ahead
Embark, for its part, is still trucking ahead in its public statements.
Earlier this month, the company announced it now has nine transfer points in its coverage map for the Sunbelt, including new locations in Dallas, El Paso, Atlanta and Jacksonville. Embark estimates the transfer points will collectively open up 28% of U.S. shipping volume in the region for autonomous transport.
The projected date of actual deployment isn’t too far off, either. Embark said it intends to commence commercial operations in 2024.
Whether this projection will come to pass, of course, is a present-day unknown. But the contrast between Embark’s public statements, which are optimistic and ambitious, and its public market performance, which shows little investor confidence, is certainly a sharp one.

Special Series Part 2: Billions Of Dollars Roll Into AI-Enhanced Cybersecurity,Chris Metinko,2022/11/23,"

Editor’s note: This story is Part Two of our series on artificial intelligence startups and their impact on multiple sectors. We look at the companies, the investments, the risks and concerns, and whether this technology’s promise will truly be realized. In Part One, we analyze VC investment in AI over the last decade. Part Three explores AI’s promise to transform medical imaging technology. Part Four spotlights some creative ways startups apply AI to their sectors.— Special Projects Editor Christine Kilpatrick
The use of AI by cybersecurity startups is nothing new, but as applications for the technology in the sector have grown, so has investor interest.
Cybersecurity firms were early adopters of AI — those in the industry use as many tools as possible to stop the bad guys — but increased processing power has expanded AI’s security uses and investors have taken note by investing billions of dollars in recent years.

Last year saw a record $2.1 billion roll into VC-backed startups that use AI in cybersecurity, according to Crunchbase data. That was the second consecutive year investors stuffed more than $1 billion into the coffers of such startups.


While this year in general has been a downer compared to last for fundraising — including in cybersecurity overall — cyber startups that use AI are still on pace to secure about $1.2 billion of investment.
Big rounds
Even in a down year, there have been a handful of nine-figure rounds for cyber startups using AI in their tech.

In February, Palo Alto, California-based Salt Security, an API protection platform that prevents attacks using machine learning and AI, closed a $140 million Series D round led by Alphabet’s CapitalG at a $1.4 billion valuation.
Switzerland-based AI-powered smart contract platform Velas raised a $135 million round in September.
In January, Austin, Texas-based SparkCognition, an AI startup that analyzes complex data stores, closed a $123 million Series D.

Threats and automation
Although AI is used throughout cybersecurity, it usually is associated with pattern matching in areas such as threat detection, as well as helping automate decisions in security operations concerning threats, response and remediation.
“While AI may not be the panacea for all cybersecurity concerns, it does help us with exponentially growing datasets, hyperscale attacks, identifying unknown attacks that cannot be detected via signatures, and also address efficiency challenges in an industry that has been plagued with a talent shortage for years,” said Dino Boukouris, founding director of San Francisco-based financial advisory firm Momentum Cyber.
Alberto Yépez, co-founder and managing director at Forgepoint Capital — which specializes in cybersecurity and infrastructure software investments — said embedded AI has had the biggest impact on both automation and ability to recognize rules in cybersecurity. 
Companies like identity detection firm Attivo Networks — acquired by SentinelOne earlier this year — and automation and observability startup TruEra both leverage AI in platforms. 
“You see it applied to automation all the time, especially when it comes to (the security operations center). It’s pervasive,” Yépez said.
However, he adds AI use cases in the space have expanded, too. 
San Francisco-based CyberCube applies AI to cyber insurance underwriting, and Australia-based Secure Code Warrior uses the technology to write better software code. Both show the growing possibilities.
“I think we are using it more and more,”  Yépez said. “The processing power has helped that.”
Not quite there yet
While there is no doubting advancement in the AI space, pretty much all admit there is still a way to go before its full abilities are realized in cyber.
Stephen Ward, managing director at Insight Partners who invests in cybersecurity, said the industry still confuses machine learning and artificial intelligence as the same thing — which they are not.
“Right now, security is in the ML and automation space, not the AI space yet,” Ward said.
Ward admits some companies, including San Francisco-based email security firm Abnormal Security, have used AI effectively in the industry, but in general the talent is not yet in cyber for most to harness its power.
“We don’t have the experts in it yet,” he said. “They are still in core tech. … Maybe in two to three years we will be there.”
While companies such as SentinelOne and CrowdStrike have effectively used ML tech to help become large security titans, Ward said he has not seen companies do the same with AI and does not hear many CISOs asking about such tech yet.
Yépez also said embedded AI has a little way to go before it can reach its full promise. First, while processing power has improved, most companies still haven’t found a way to make AI more efficient and easier to use. 
There is still a trust factor.
“There also is the question about responsible AI,” he said. “We are not comfortable enough to let AI make (many) decisions for us.”
Methodology
Cybersecurity is defined by the industries of network security, cloud security, identity management and cybersecurity, according to Crunchbase data. Most announced rounds are represented in the database.

Swell Energy’s $120M Raise Proves Renewables Is Getting More Love Than Ever,Keerthi Vedantam,2022/11/22,"

In September, during a massive heat wave in California, the state sent out a text alert urging Californians to reduce their energy consumption that probably prevented blackouts across the state.
What if we didn’t have to?

Solar, wind and other renewable energy startups have been slowly seeing more favor in venture funding, with startups in 2020 seeing $3.75 billion (per Crunchbase data). But 2022 has been a big year for renewable energy. Despite the economic slowdown, companies in the space have managed to raise around $7.6 billion.


Take Swell Energy. The California-based virtual power plant startup announced on Tuesday it raised $120 million led by the SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Greenbacker Development Opportunities Fund I, bringing the company’s total funding to $582 million.
The residential energy company is developing a slew of virtual power plants through 26,000 energy storage systems scattered across U.S. businesses and homes. These virtual power plants provide grid capabilities in states like California and Hawaii to reduce reliance on fossil fuel plants. In the process, Swell can optimize energy resources and distribute it in real time based on need and who is using it.
Embedded into our infrastructure
Funding in this space remained pretty static until around 2018, when the industry surpassed $2 billion for the first time. After that, funding only got bigger, peaking at $9.85 billion in 2021.
Renewable energy is becoming increasingly important for companies and homeowners in terms of reducing their carbon footprint and energy savings, and companies like Swell are taking note. For a while, renewable energy was laser-focused on large-scale energy consumption, working with public utilities and large venues. Now, startups in this space are focusing on acute use cases and distributing energy on a per-need basis.
This is important when we think about the climate and energy usage. Using energy storage solutions and sophisticated distributing technology, companies like Swell can prevent power outages — like the one that almost gripped California — from happening.

These Stocks Surged During The Pandemic. Now They’re Tumbling.,Marlize van Romburgh,2022/11/22,"

Remember when Zoom happy hours were a thing?
That was back when we were all stuck at home, ordering Domino’s pizza, riding our Pelotons (to work off all that pizza) and binging our favorite Netflix series every night.
Things look a little different as we close out 2022. The world is entering its third COVID winter and many of the companies whose share prices surged during the pandemic have seen those stocks come tumbling back.

Take Zoom, for instance. Shares of the video conferencing platform have fallen about 90% since their pandemic peak in October 2020. Shares fell about 10% just on Tuesday after the company cut its annual sales forecast and posted slowing growth numbers.
Let’s take a look at five other companies that benefited from the pandemic boom but have since come tumbling down.


Peloton Interactive: Shares of Peloton were riding high in December 2020, when they peaked around $152. But the pandemic fuel had worn off less than a year later, and shares are currently trading around $10.
Netflix: Shares of the streaming giant hit a pandemic high of around $690 in October 2021 as viewers curled up to binge watch their favorite shows. The stock is now trading at about half of that as viewers’ attention is divided with plenty of streaming options from Apple, HBO, Hulu and others.
Domino’s Pizza: Shares of Domino’s hit their pandemic high in late December 2021 at around $564 but are now trading around $376 — down about a third.
Carvana: Shares of used-car marketplace Carvana hit an all-time high in August 2021 as used-car prices soared amid a global chip shortage that in turn prompted a shortfall of new cars. Now Carvana shares are trading at an all-time low as used-car prices fall.
Moderna Therapeutics: Shares of Moderna peaked in September 2021, when the COVID vaccinemaker was still benefiting from people lining up to be jabbed. Although the company has said its latest boosters are more effective against the Omicron variant than the original vaccine, not that many people are clamoring to get the latest shots. Moderna shares are trading about 60% below their pandemic high.

Special Series Launch: The Promises And Perils Of A Decade Of AI Funding,Gené Teare,2022/11/22,"

Editor’s note: In this four-part series, we explore the impact of artificial intelligence startups on multiple sectors. Each story spotlights the companies, the investments, the risks and concerns, and whether AI’s promise will truly be realized. In this Part One, we look at venture investment in AI over the last decade and the leading sectors. Part Two tracks the billions of dollars rolling into AI-enhanced cybersecurity. Part Three explores AI’s promise to transform medical imaging technology. Part Four spotlights some creative ways startups apply AI to their sectors. — Special Projects Editor Christine Kilpatrick
From robotics to health care to wig design, artificial intelligence technology has made an impact on a wide range of industries. Funding to AI startups hovers around 9% to 10% of global venture capital dollars in recent years, based on an analysis of Crunchbase data. 

Leading the way in AI startup funding are robotics, autonomous vehicles and enterprise software, but other sectors have quickly followed: biotechnology, computer vision, language processing, fintech, semiconductors, security, logistics, learning, agtech and more. 


Back in 2013, funding to companies using AI was $3 billion, with fewer than 1,000 deals. In 2021, AI funding peaked at $69 billion across more than 4,000 deals. Venture investment in the technology has reached $38 billion so far this year.


The most highly valued AI companies on  The Crunchbase Unicorn Board are: Data and AI company Databricks, valued at $38 billion; driverless auto company Cruise at $30 billion; research and development company OpenAI at $20 billion; and AI writing assistant service Grammarly at $13 billion. In this current investing climate, valuations are likely down from these peaks in 2021.  
At Techonomy 2022, a conference on the future with a spotlight on climate tech, Waymo Co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana highlighted the 2020 launch of the company’s driverless ride-sharing service live in the East Phoenix area. And Ken Washington, vice president of consumer robotics at Amazon, showcased the company’s beta of an in-home robotic device named Astro that motors around to monitor security as well as interact with family members and behave as a pet. 
More recently, generative AI has become a trending sector for investment with text-generated visual art service Stability AI, and text editing for audio and video transcription startup Descript both raising funding at high valuations.     
Growing pipeline
The  number of AI companies that raised their last funding at seed since 2020 and have raised more than $1 million in equity adds up to more than 600 every year. Of those companies, Series A makes up more than 400 companies per annum. And at Series B, that count is 200 companies. 


With a strong pipeline of AI startups transforming a number of industries, our series of stories will spotlight some of the hottest sectors and companies and explore the reach of this ever-advancing technology. 
Cybersecurity startups, for example, saw a record $2.1 billion in venture investment last year, according to Crunchbase data. The pandemic also sparked new interest in AI-enabled medical diagnostics, with funding for such startups jumping from $348 million in 2020 to more than $1 billion in 2021. In fact, AI has crept into the most surprising of sectors, improving everything from how we get our sleep, farm our fish and design our wigs. Who knows what’s next?

Here’s How Far Fintech Funding Has Fallen,Joanna Glasner,2022/11/22,"

Last year, financial services was the leading sector for venture investment, with at least $131 billion globally going into startups in the space.
This year, the industry still ranks among the largest recipients of venture capital funding. However, investment to startups in the space has been dropping every quarter this year, with Q4 likely to be the lowest yet.

For a sense of the funding trajectory, we charted out global investment over the past five calendar quarters.


Even with the steep year-over-year decline, financial services funding is still high by historical standards. Currently, 2022 is on track to deliver the second-highest funding total of the past five years. For perspective, we chart out investment and round count totals below:


Perspective from the public markets
Shifting public market sentiment looks like a major driver of change in venture appetite for fintech deals.
So far this year, virtually every venture-backed company that took advantage of the wide-open IPO window last year is down sharply from its peak. This applies to at least 20 companies, listed here, which made debuts on U.S. exchanges, including high-profile offerings from Coinbase, Robinhood and SoFi.
In recent quarters, meanwhile, large fintech IPOs simply haven’t been happening. This has multifold and sometimes differing effects on venture funding. On the one hand, without IPOs, we don’t see big pre-IPO rounds. On the other hand, companies that had been contemplating public offerings might choose instead to seek more private financing.
Some of this year’s biggest rounds, in fact, were companies that generated a lot of buzz as potential IPO candidates. This includes Klarna, the buy now, pay later platform, which raised $800 million in July after cutting its valuation by 85%.
Early-stage funding is falling too
Seed and early-stage fintech and financial services investment is also down sharply. For a sense, we charted out funding and deal count for the space over the past six quarters at seed, Series A and Series B:


At early stage, some of the recent declines can be attributed to the fewer really big rounds and likely more constraint around valuations.
Last year, for instance, FTX raised over $1.4 billion in Series B financing at a peak valuation of $25 billion, per Crunchbase data. This year, we would hope venture investors would refrain from putting that kind of cash to work in any company with clear red flags around compliance and corporate governance.
Methodology
The dataset for the funding analysis includes companies categorized by Crunchbase as one of several sectors tied to fintech and financial services. Companies included in the results may be fully financial services-focused or include financial services as a significant focus of their business models. Funding rounds included in the results totaled at least $200,000 and included companies founded no more than 20 years prior to the funding.

Mergers & Money: FTX-Induced Crypto Contagion Likely Only Starting,Chris Metinko,2022/11/22,"

Editor’s note: Mergers & Money is a monthly column by Senior Reporter Chris Metinko that covers dealmaking and the flow of venture capital.
It was just last November when crypto prices were at an all-time high and the industry seemingly couldn’t have been hotter.

Today, the entire sector is stuck in a deep, dark winter, and it looks like a sickness is only starting to set in — mostly brought on by the spectacular implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange.
FTX’s tentacles reached nearly everywhere in the crypto industry. It invested in nearly 50 companies through its venture arm, FTX Ventures. It also made another 180 investments through Bankman-Fried’s other trading firm Alameda Research.
It also had a deep reach in the crypto lending space — which has taken off in recent years as prices soared and lenders could bring in new customers with the promise of high yields on their deposit.
It all was going well — until it wasn’t.
3AC should have served as a harbinger
Some lenders ran into trouble this past summer after crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital’s (3AC) collapse. The significant downturn in the digital currencies market left Singapore-based 3AC unable to meet obligations to lenders and barreling into bankruptcy.
In the wake of that collapse, crypto lenders Celsius Network and Voyager Digital also were forced to file for bankruptcy as 3AC defaulted on loans.
The bankruptcies rattled the market. However, crypto was able to find its equilibrium again — in part thanks to FTX which pledged to make further investments in infrastructure players hurt by 3AC, including to buy the assets of Voyager Digital for $1.4 billion.
The white knight is dead
Those promises turned sour this month. During the 3AC collapse, Bankman-Fried’s firms were also shown to be huge borrowers from these lenders, using FTX’s FTT token as collateral.
That should have raised red flags in an industry that just went through a tumultuous moment with 3AC.
Of course, it did not.
However, the house of cards came tumbling down earlier this month when FTT witnessed a major sell-off after reports came out that Alameda had a large portion of FTT on its balance sheet, helping prop up its value. FTT has lost more than 90% of its value since.
FTX collapsed, and now several lenders the crypto exchange was involved with seem to have their own significant financial instabilities some may not be able to overcome. Those firms include:

Crypto lender Genesis said last week it is suspending withdrawals and new loans after FTX’s collapse, noting a “loss of industry confidence caused by the FTX implosion.” The announcement comes just days after New York-based Genesis sent a letter to its clients letting them know it was able to secure an equity infusion of $140 million from Digital Currency Group. Genesis said it had about $175 million of assets locked away on FTX’s exchange — as reported by The Block.
Genesis’s announcement started a chain reaction, as Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss’ Gemini said it would halt redemptions. Genesis was a partner. “The past week has been an incredibly challenging and stressful time for our industry,” Gemini officials wrote in a blog post.
Almost immediately after FTX’s bankruptcy filing, Voyager said it is “evaluating strategic options” and reopening the bidding process for its assets. The lender said about $5 million in a “good faith” deposit from FTX was being held in escrow, but Voyager maintained a balance of approximately $3 million on FTX’s embattled exchange.
Crypto lender BlockFi has suspended withdrawals on its platform and is reportedly in the process of preparing to file for bankruptcy. In July, FTX gave BlockFi a $400 million revolving credit facility that included an option to buy BlockFi for up to $240 million. In March 2021, BlockFi raised $350 million at a valuation of $3 billion co-led by Bain Capital Ventures, partners of DST Global, Pomp Investments and Tiger Global.

This could be just the tip of the iceberg. Three Arrows Capital’s issues disrupted a few lenders and rattled the industry. FTX seems to have ties that run much deeper.
Aside from just the lenders, those who do business with them likely could be affected. It also was revealed over the weekend, FTX owes its 50 biggest creditors nearly $3.1 billion. The exchange owes about $1.45 billion to its top 10 creditors.
Just a year ago, people were wondering how high the crypto industry could go.
Now people are wondering how long this crypto contagion will last.

The FDA Called Cultivated Meat Safe To Eat. Funding May Take Time To Catch Up.,Keerthi Vedantam,2022/11/21,"

Long ago, fact-checking website Snopes.com had to clarify an internet rumor that, no, fast-food restaurant KFC does not use lab-grown, genetically modified eight-legged lumps of pulsating chicken flesh devoid of feathers and beaks in its food.
Fast-forward to today: In November, the Food and Drug Administration announced Upside Foods’ lab-grown chicken is safe to eat.

It’s been a long road for Upside Foods, the first company in this space to receive venture funding back in 2015, per Crunchbase data. But the reality of a bustling, highly competitive lab-grown meat startup system is not dissimilar from the horrifying visual of KFC internet lore. Scientists can grow lumps of meat in petri dishes that can mimic chicken breast, steak, ground meat and even filets of salmon with just a few stem cells.


Funding in the cultivated meat space has reached $693.5 million so far in 2022. That’s the second-largest amount of funding per year in that industry after 2021, and represents a 208% increase from funding in 2020.
Plants vs. cultivated meat
It is interesting to see that plant-based food, often a concoction of soy proteins, fermented mushroom cells and seaweed, is still netting more money than cultivated meat. But it had a five-year head start; the first plant-based meat startups to get venture funding happened in 2010, per Crunchbase data.
The sector also encompasses a wider variety of foods like milk and eggs. But plant-based meat hasn’t been immune to the slew of logistical- and supply chain-related challenges that plague the food industry, and companies like Beyond Meat are struggling.
Everything around meat — maintaining a home for animals, feeding them, butchering them, packaging them and selling them — is simply an insufficient use of supply chain capabilities. Thirty-six percent of the world’s crop calories go toward animal feed, and animal farms contribute to soil degradation, deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions. A 2020 report from IDTechEx says, unequivocally, that “the meat industry is unsustainable” — especially as our population reaches 8 billion.
So perhaps it’s unsurprising that cultivated meat (a more palatable word for “lab-grown,” perhaps) is seeing investment from giant meat producers like Tyson Foods, Cargill and JBS. What if, instead of growing whole animals, we only grow the parts we eat?
This all sounds great, but we’re not sure how well cell-grown meat scales. We’re not even sure if, at full capacity, it will be that much cheaper or better for the environment than how meat is grown now. Cultivated meat requires lab space, disposable equipment (laboratories are notorious for using a lot of single-use plastic) and logistical operations to package and ship the meat as well.
In November, Upside Foods opened a 53,000-square-foot plant that produces 50,000 pounds of meat per year (for comparison, 50,000 pounds of meat equals roughly 113 cows, and 53,000 square feet is 1.2 acres).
The IDTechEx report does point out a rather obvious solution that’s much cheaper than cultivated meat. “Whilst many of the problems associated with animal agriculture could be solved by large percentages of the world’s population giving up meat, this seems extremely unlikely, regardless of the environmental or ethical reasons.”

Elizabeth Holmes Is Sentenced To 11-Plus Years In Prison,Keerthi Vedantam,2022/11/18,"

Almost two decades after founding Theranos, Elizabeth Holmes was sentenced to 11.25 years in prison.
The founder of Theranos, which marketed itself as a cheaper, faster and more accessible diagnostic blood testing platform, was found guilty for four counts of criminal fraud in January for defrauding investors, facing a maximum sentencing of 20 years and a $250,000 fine, and wrapping up a trial that started in 2018.

Because Holmes was acquitted of defrauding patients who made medical decisions based on the incomplete platform, the judge chose not to take patient harm into account with regard to her sentence.
The former Silicon Valley darling received around 150 support letters from family members, friends and colleagues, including former investor Tim Draper, who continued to stand by the company until the trial started in 2018. Draper was also one of Theranos’s first investors.
Alex Moore, an 8VC 1 investor who sits on the board of Palantir, and former roommate Prerna Gupta who co-founded the storytelling platform Hooked, both said Holmes’s failure could happen to any other founder.
Holmes started Theranos when she was 19 years old and a student at Stanford University. The company was armed with a board of prolific investors like former secretaries of state George Shultz and Henry Kissinger as well as funding from the likes of Rupert Murdoch and Oracle founder Larry Ellison.

The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Health And Biotech Land Big Week As DispatchHealth Leads,Chris Metinko,2022/11/18,"

This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.

It seems like we say this every week, but again this week was big for biotech and health care. The majority of companies on the list fall into those categories and range from women’s health to cancer treatment to in-home nursing care. It seems like in a down market, investors are going big into anything related to health, knowing there will always be a market.
1. DispatchHealth, $330M, health care: At-home care is becoming more necessary as the population gets older and hospital costs soar. Denver-based DispatchHealth is looking to help people get that in-home care. The company locked up a $330 million round led by health care-focused Optum Ventures, according to Home Health Care News. The startup provides at-home nursing services for patients who require more care or a higher degree of observation and intervention. The company partners with health systems, insurance companies and employers to offer families a long-term at-home care resource. Founded in 2013, the company has raised more than $730 million, per Crunchbase.
2. Astera Labs, $150M, semiconductors: Santa Clara, California-based Astera Labs was minted a unicorn this week after raising a $150 million Series D led by Fidelity Management and Research that values the company at nearly $3.2 billion. The company last raised a $50 million Series C — led by Fidelity — that valued the company at $950 million in September 2021. Astera Labs provides data and memory connectivity solutions for some of the biggest chipmakers in the world including Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. The company will use the new proceeds to expand its product lines, add to its workforce, and create two new research and design centers in Vancouver and Toronto this year. Semiconductor manufacturing has been in the news for the last several years as supply chain and manufacturing issues have played havoc with the market. Founded in 2017, the company has raised more than $200 million, according to Crunchbase data.
3. Weka, $135M, data: Even in a down venture market, investors will always put money into data. Campbell, California-based Weka locked up a $135 million Series D led by Generation Investment Management at a reported $750 million valuation. Weka helps companies move data between sources faster and more efficiently. The new cash will be used to get to profitability, fuel global expansion and scale the company. Founded in 2013, Weka has raised more than $290 million, according to Crunchbase.
4. CG Oncology, $120M, biotech: Cancer treatments will always attract investment until more and better treatments are found to combat its various types. Irvine, California-based CG Oncology, an oncolytic immunotherapy startup developing therapeutics for patients with urologic cancers, closed a $120 million Series E co-led by ORI Capital, Longitude Capital and Decheng Capital. The biotech firm will use the money to advance its clinical programs in bladder cancer further toward FDA approval. Founded in 2010, CG has raised more than $200 million, per the company.
5. MBX Biosciences, $115M, biotech: Indiana-based MBX Biosciences, a biopharmaceutical company developing therapeutics to treat endocrine disorders, closed a $115 million Series B led by Wellington Management. The cash infusion will be used to support MBX into early 2025 as it develops therapeutics known as “Precision Endocrine Peptides,” which are designed to overcome limitations of traditional peptide therapeutics. Founded in 2019, the startup has raised nearly $175 million, per Crunchbase.
6. Jnana Therapeutics, $107M, biotech: Boston-based Jnana Therapeutics, a clinical-stage biotechnology company, raised a $107 million Series C led by Bain Capital Life Sciences. Founded in 2017, the company has raised more than $200 million, according to Crunchbase.
7. Bonum Therapeutics, $93M, biotech: Seattle-based Bonum Therapeutics, a biopharmaceutical company creating conditionally active and less toxic medicines, closed a $93 million Series A, which included participation from Roche Venture Fund, RiverVest Venture Partners and others. Bonum is a spinout of Good Therapeutics, which Roche acquired in August 2022 for $250 million upfront plus potential milestone payments.
8. Maven Clinic, $90M, health care: New York-based teletherapy startup Maven Clinic raised a $90 million Series E led by General Catalyst. Maven has raised more than $300 million in total funding, per the company.
9. (tied) Contentstack, $80M, content: San Francisco-based content management system developer Contentstack closed an $80 million Series C led by Georgian and Insight Partners. Founded in 2018, the startup has now raised $169 million, per Crunchbase.
9. (tied) Metagenomi, $80M, biotech: Emeryville, California-based gene editing startup Metagenomi raised $80 from Ionis Pharmaceuticals in a drug development deal. Founded in 2018, the biotech startup has raised $357 million to date, according to Crunchbase.
Big global deals
Only one of the week’s top five rounds came from abroad.

Berlin-based blockchain and Web3 technology startup Matter Labs closed a $200 million Series C.

Methodology
We tracked the largest rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of Nov. 12 to 18. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

"
Tech Industry Layoffs Are Accelerating. What Does That Mean?,Keerthi Vedantam,2022/11/18,"

U.S. tech industry layoffs have accelerated over the last couple of months, but the industry is still in a strong position to weather a recession.
During the first week of November, at least 6,473 tech workers in the U.S. were laid off, by our tally — a more than 600% increase from the 910 who lost their jobs the week before. Last week, there were more than 7,000 reported U.S. tech sector layoffs.


The job market whiplash comes after 2021’s economy brought about rivers of venture funding, a fertile stock market, and rocketing valuations that made the largest companies collect tech talent left and right to stockpile skilled workers. In 2022, markets became frosty, and some companies admitted they hired too many people, too fast.
This, some say, is a correction to last year’s hiring spree. While tech workers are going to have to adjust to a new reality — one that comes with lower salaries and fewer benefits — the tech industry is still poised to be one of the better-off workforces with the U.S. economy in flux.


 
Still a need for tech workers
Companies cut back on advertising spend in preparation for the economic situation to worsen. Meta, which is beholden to ad spend, saw dramatic cuts to its revenue and recently laid off 10,000 employees. Twitter has suffered from the ads cutback as well, not entirely due to Elon Musk’s takeover, and plans to cut about half of its employees from its payroll. Alphabet said during earnings that Google, which is the largest digital advertising platform, generated less revenue. The company could also push out as many as 10,000 “underperforming” employees next year.
But tech companies not beholden to ad spend are largely doing OK. This is always the case when the economy goes through a dramatic shift: some industries thrive while others go bottom-up. During the pandemic, the travel industry buckled amid social distancing guidelines while telehealth and e-commerce blossomed.
In fact, the overall tech market is facing a shortage of tech workers, the same shortage that drove large companies to stockpile top-tier talent in 2021.
“The real issue in the United States is that we’re not creating [tech workers] fast enough,” said Art Zeile, CEO at career insights firm Dice, a DHI Group company.
According to tech insights firm Dice, job postings between June 2021 and 2022 (the most recent data available) increased by 60% as big players like Amazon and Apple continued to hire talent. Companies that are not considered “tech companies,” but use technology, such as Disney, Deloitte and Bank of America, joined the fray, becoming among the top 50 employers for tech roles.
June ended with 554,573 open tech jobs. For comparison, that would mean for every person who has been laid off so far in 2022, there are around eight available postings — more if people who were laid off earlier in the year have already found new employment.
Roles including cybersecurity, cloud operations, and data science and analytics continue to be in demand as companies operate remote or hybrid workplaces and require distributed and secure networks, per Dice. Cloud computing roles grew 162% between the first half of 2021 and the first half of 2022, while data-related roles that use languages like R, Go and Typescript increased by 111%, 131% and 142%, respectively.
Salary decreases on the horizon
Wages skyrocketed in the last couple of years amid the labor shortage. In 2019 and 2020, the average tech salary saw a 3.6% increase. And in 2020 and 2021, it spiked again by nearly 7%. Companies had to offer competitive salaries and benefits packages to keep and retain valuable employees who could otherwise be poached.


That number is likely to come down, according to Healy Jones, an executive at the startup consulting firm Kruze Consulting. Companies can no longer afford to hire new talent at a premium, and job seekers might find their new company pays less than their old one.
“The ones that are doing well are continuing to hire,” Jones said. “There are definitely job opportunities available in the startup world, but I don’t think they pay as much.”
That means tech workers who jump from one company to another are unlikely to see the kinds of salaries and bonuses they saw in previous years.
Big layoffs stem from worst-case scenario
Per the Crunchbase Layoffs Tracker, some companies have made incremental layoffs over the course of the year as the economic picture became clear. For example, food delivery platform Gopuff laid off 2,200 people in a series of three rounds this year. Meanwhile, Stripe slashed around 1,000 of its staff in November after laying off around 50 people in October.
Incremental cuts usually save money for a while, but they’re generally bad for employee morale. Continued cuts destabilize the company, hamper productivity and can make it hard for companies to retain top talent.
“Multiple rounds of layoffs, I think, it’s absolutely detrimental to a culture,” said Nolan Church, CEO of consulting firm Continuum. “Having gone through a layoff, it is the worst day for everybody involved. To then have it happen again, in my opinion, is a gigantic management failure.”
The general advice is to conduct one large, sweeping round of layoffs that’s based on a company’s worst-case economic scenario, even if it’s unlikely to happen. That means the volume of layoffs likely doesn’t paint a very accurate picture of how well or poorly tech is doing.
It also means those companies probably won’t do another round of layoffs any time soon.
“Cut once, cut deep and tuck in your top performers with either salary increases or equity increases,” Church said.

NFT Startups Are Not So Alluring To Investors Lately,Joanna Glasner,2022/11/18,"

The NFT, or non-fungible token, is admittedly one of those hot venture sectors I never really got. But I don’t write the checks or do the diligence. So, when well-known VCs started financing big NFT-related rounds last year and early this year, it seemed like a space to watch.
So watch we have. And after months of data-tracking, this is what we can conclude: The NFT space is no longer nearly as hot as it was earlier this year. Fewer deals are getting done, and much less money is going into them.

For a sense of how far things have gone down, below we charted seed and venture investment to NFT-related startups for the past seven-and-a-half quarters:


Hot times
As you can see, funding to all things NFT reached its zenith in the first quarter of this year, when investors poured $2.1 billion into the space. Nearly a quarter of this went to a single deal: $450 million for Yuga Labs, of Bored Ape Yacht Club fame. Two others — metaverse digital property play Animoca Brands and NFT marketplace OpenSea — raised $659 million between them.
The fourth quarter of 2021, a record-setting period for global venture funding across all industries, was also a hot time for NFTs. Startups in the space raised over $1.5 billion, with $725 million of that going to Forte, a blockchain gaming platform.
When markets were up, big NFT rounds accumulated. Between Q3 2021 and Q2 2022, at least a dozen companies raised rounds of $100 million and up, per Crunchbase data.
Cold times
Those days are done. In the latter half of this year, NFT-related funding has slowed considerably, with the current quarter on track to show the sharpest contrast.
Case in point: Halfway through this fourth quarter, the three biggest NFT-related deals with known backers are $10 million rounds. If Q4 funding continues at its current pace, the quarterly total will be down over 80% from the Q1 peak.
The cost of NFTs and related assets also appears on the decline. Overall NFT sales volume and the total number of NFT sold fell in October, setting monthly lows for 2022, according to a Decrypt report.
Not all digital assets are faring equally, with some collapsing while others are holding up, albeit mostly below their peak. On the collapse side, one high-profile example was the NFT of the first-ever tweet, which initially sold for $2.9 million but drew bids of just a few hundred dollars when its owner attempted to resell.
Meanwhile, the cost of the lowest-priced Bored Ape, perhaps the most iconic digital collectible, has also fallen, and is down over 60% since its peak in April. However, it still costs around $70,000, so this is far from a dumpster fire.
Believers, nonbelievers and markets
Prognostications about where NFT startup investment will go from here varies widely depending on one’s affinity for the space in the first place.
For boosters of blockchain, crypto, decentralized finance and metaverse living, it’s conventional wisdom the rise of Web3 will only bring broader adoption for NFTs.
For nonbelievers, it seems bewildering that billions ever went into this asset class.
In the startup sphere, it’s pretty common for nonbelievers to be proven wrong over time, as a technology that once seemed fringe or out there gains mainstream adoption. In the case of NFT startups, however, market dynamics offer some support for the nonbeliever case, with funding sharply down.
Still, it isn’t game over yet. The past couple quarters of declining investment could be more of a pause than an exodus of NFT startup backers. And the enduring appeal of some collectibles — such as those hipster apes — indicates some real staying power.

"The Week In Crunchbase Data: Sexual Wellness, FTX’s Hot Mess, And Layoffs Peak",Crunchbase News,2022/11/17,"

We love our numbers at Crunchbase News, from huge billion-dollar funding rounds to the price of a crypto token. In this new feature, we’re letting the week’s hottest numbers tell the stories.
This week we learned that chipmakers are still getting VC dollars, probably because semiconductors are a real thing that make real things work. Which leads us to the epic fail that has been FTX and the very real billions wrapped up in its implosion.

On a lighter note, we explored the sexual wellness startup industry pivoting to more traditional retail spaces. Crypto investors might be down in the dumps, but at least now they can more easily buy sex toys along with their groceries at Target. What’s not to love there?

"Chipmaker Astera Labs Nabs $150M, Hits $3.1B Valuation",Chris Metinko,2022/11/17,"

Unicorn creation has slowed as fundraising has dipped and valuations have been slashed, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t new ones joining the herd.
Santa Clara, California-based Astera Labs raised a $150 million Series D led by Fidelity Management and Research that values the company at nearly $3.2 billion. The company last raised a $50 million Series C — led by Fidelity — that valued the company at $950 million in September 2021.

Other existing investors, including Atreides Management, Intel Capital and Sutter Hill Ventures also participated.
Astera Labs provides data and memory connectivity solutions for some of the biggest chipmakers in the world, including Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. The company will use the new proceeds to expand its product lines, add to its workforce, and create two new research and design centers in Vancouver and Toronto this year.
“This latest funding round is a testament that we are not only invested in the right growth markets such as cloud, artificial intelligence/machine learning and hyperscale infrastructure, but that we are also able to consistently execute and deliver breakthrough connectivity products that are critical to our customers and partners,” said CEO Jitendra Mohan in a release.
Chip market
Semiconductor manufacturing has been in the news for the last several years as supply chain and manufacturing issues have played havoc with the market.
In August, President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act, which includes more than $52 billion in federal subsidies for research and manufacturing of semiconductors in the U.S.
Startup investors seem to have taken note. While only $3.8 billion was invested in VC-backed semiconductor startups in 2020, that number more than doubled to $7.8 billion last year, according to Crunchbase data.
The industry will not hit that number this year, but it has seen significant investment with $5.1 billion poured into it by investors.

"
Why It’s A Good Idea To Invest In a Second- Or Third-Time Founder,Guest Author,2022/11/17,"

By Marc Schröder 
The best VCs identify and support the world’s best founders. This is at the core of what they do.
Creating and growing a startup to scale is an extremely difficult task that can be derailed by a myriad of circumstances outside of a founder’s control. So even when great founders fail, the best VCs are waiting in the wings to support their next idea.
The U.S. has an extremely positive mindset toward failures like these, but that same appetite for risk and the celebration of attempts at creating big ideas doesn’t exist in the same way in most of the world.

In Silicon Valley, startup founders who fail gracefully are celebrated as heroes — people who have bravely attempted the impossible. Their failures aren’t seen as personally attributed negative marks on their records, but rather learning experiences that will inform and enable them to be successful on their next attempt.
However, in Europe, Canada and other huge markets, these failures are viewed in a more embarrassing light that can stand as valid reasons to withhold capital from failed founders.
This perspective gives U.S. founders and investors a distinct edge and is responsible for some of the smashing successes the U.S. market has seen in every industry across the board.
From adversity to opportunity
With the sense of a significant downturn looming, there will undoubtedly be many startups that won’t achieve their vision in the coming years. It’s my belief that this represents a generational opportunity for founders and investors alike.
Marc Schröder, managing partner and co-founder of MGV
As the availability of capital diminishes, there will be many great startups that simply won’t be able to secure the funding needed to continue their operations. While this short-term pain will be felt by both founders and investors, it also represents a much-needed refresh of the cycle.
This refresh will unlock time for some of the most promising founders to go back to the drawing board with the wealth of earned experience needed to inform and create an even better company, product or service. For investors, this refresh will change the dynamics of valuations and opportunities in a way that presents uniquely valuable, once-in-a-lifetime opportunities to invest in great founders early and at extremely attractive valuations.
In the short-term it will be painful, make no mistake. But great VCs think on long time horizons and, for the last decade plus, great valuations in great startups led by great founders have been difficult (if not impossible) to come by.
And the winners are?
With the coming refresh, fund-changing valuations will present themselves again and the next generation of marque venture funds will be born out of this cycle. The major factor in deciding which funds will come out on top will be their willingness to lean into the risks and maintain focus on the long-term prospects of the coming cycle.
Having a strong portfolio of great founders is the key to unlocking this potential. So as failures begin to mount, VCs should be ready to back the founders they believe in most, even if those founders have earned a failure or two … or three.

Marc Schröder is the managing partner and co-founder of MGV, and is focused on working with world-class tech entrepreneurs and establishing the MGV legacy. Before co-founding MGV, Schröder served as the head of global sales at the Maschmeyer Group and was an investor at Seed + Speed Ventures. Originally from the Netherlands, he grew up in South Africa and graduated with a law degree from Bertolt-Brecht University.

Meet The Companies That Joined The Emerging Unicorn Board In October 2022,Gené Teare,2022/11/17,"

In October, only four companies with disclosed valuations above $500 million but less than $1 billion joined the Crunchbase Emerging Unicorn Board. The board currently hosts 355 companies valued collectively at over $242 billion. 1
As late-stage funding plummeted more than 60% year over year in the third quarter of 2022, far fewer companies were raising late-stage fundings at high valuations. Here we look at companies that were able to raise, despite the slower funding environment.
Fintech companies made up two of the newly minted emerging unicorns in October. A further nine companies already on the board raised funding this past month.
Fintech

San Francisco-based Tally, a service that helps users pay off credit card debt, raised an $80 million Series D led by Sway Ventures, an earlier investor. The company seeks to alleviate the $900 billion in credit card debt that impacts 30% of Americans. Tally has more than doubled its valuation since its last funding in 2019 led by Andreessen Horowitz. Kleiner Perkins and Shasta Ventures led prior funding rounds.
U.K.-based NatWest Group invested $57 million in Warsaw-based Vodeno, a builder of embedded financial solutions for businesses. It also created a U.K. subsidiary majority owned by NatWest to offer banking as a service to NatWest business customers.

Creator tools

OpenAI led a $50 million Series C funding in San Francisco-based Descript, valuing the company above $500 million. Descript provides simple audio and video editing tools for creators, making it as simple as editing text. Descript was founded by Groupon co-founder Andrew Mason. The company boasts a huge roster of angel investors. Spark Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and Redpoint led earlier funding rounds.

Agriculture

India-based DeHaat, a marketplace for farmers in India, raised a $46 million Series D led by Sofina, an existing investor. The company claims more than 1 million farmers in its network. Prior investors Lightrock India and Prosus Ventures also invested in the funding.

A new addition to the board from earlier this year is Paris-based BeReal, a photo-sharing app gaining traction with Gen Z users and said to have 20 million daily active users. TechCrunch recently disclosed BeReal’s Series B of $60 million. Announced in May 2022, the round was raised at a $587 million valuation (600 million euros).
And Barcelona-based human resources automation service Factorial graduated from the emerging board to The Crunchbase Unicorn Board in October at a $1 billion valuation close to double its Series B value of $530 million in September 2021.
Methodology
The curated Crunchbase Emerging Unicorn Board includes private companies with known valuations of $500 million or more but less than $1 billion, based on Crunchbase data. The list is updated whenever a new company reaches that valuation range or there is a change in valuation for a company already on the leaderboard. Companies that are subsequently valued at more than $1 billion will be removed from the board and promoted to The Crunchbase Unicorn Board. Companies that exit will also be removed from the Emerging Unicorn Board.

Where Amazon’s Layoffs Rank Among Largest Tech Job Cuts Of 2022,Jenna D'Illard,2022/11/16,"

Well, it’s official.
Today was certainly not a prime day for Amazon workers as the e-tailer turned everything-tailer continued laying off employees to the tune of 10,000 jobs.
Though huge, that number reportedly represents only about 3% of the company’s estimated 1.5 million full- and part-time workers worldwide. Cuts are planned for the behemoth’s devices, retail and human resources sectors.

The Amazon cuts also aren’t the largest in layoff headlines for tech this year. That nefarious award goes to Meta, which earlier this month announced plans to lay off 11,000 workers. At the time, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg attributed the cuts to over-hiring during the pandemic. Yeah, no kidding.


As word of Amazon’s intended layoffs broke Monday by The New York Times, Amazon’s PR team likely scrambled to also heavily promote Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos’ “exclusive” sit-down interview with CNN in which he discussed his intention to give away most of his $122 billion fortune during his lifetime.
Isn’t that nice.
Also on Tuesday, Amazon announced the launch of its new virtual clinic — all this on the heels of Bezos’ tweet last month recommending that followers “batten down the hatches.”
See, Amazon wants to help us.
The competing headlines amounted to good vs. bad news whiplash for industry watchers and we can only imagine the conversations among laid-off Amazon workers at happy hour tonight.

DispatchHealth Raises $330M To Alleviate Hospital Crowding,Keerthi Vedantam,2022/11/16,"

DispatchHealth announced on Tuesday it raised $330 million, according to Home Health Care News.
The round was led by health care-focused Optum Ventures, with additional funding from funds like Echo Health Ventures, Blue Shield of California and Humana.
The Denver-based company provides at-home nursing services for patients who require more care or a higher degree of observation and intervention. DispatchHealth partners with health systems, insurance companies and employers to offer families a long-term at-home care resource without jettisoning patients, especially those who are fragile or have limited mobility, in and out of hospitals and doctors offices.

The company is building a tech-enabled care platform helmed by former chief product officer at Uber, Daniel Graf. The platform, called the Last Mile Care Technology Platform, will track care patterns to help determine how resources should be utilized, how much of certain equipment is needed, and triaging patient care with other parts of the health care system.
Keeping patients out of the hospital
It might not seem like it at first glance, but the goal of pretty much all health care startups is to keep people out of emergency service systems like the ER. Hospitals, saddled with patients and overworked clinicians and nurses, operate on thin margins with very little ability to innovate or invest without disrupting the ecosystem.
That’s where companies like DispatchHealth come in. Startups in the on-demand health care space received $1.3 billion in funding so far this year, per Crunchbase data, a spike from pre-pandemic funding in 2019 and an indication that the pandemic fueled long-term need for options in the health care system that didn’t overflow hospitals or urgent cares with struggling patients.
DispatchHealth and companies like it are likely to see more popularity as time goes on. Baby boomers are expected to be the biggest elderly population in recent history, and will live far longer than generations before them. Most of them will prefer to age in place, at home, rather than going into a long-term care facility. Taking care of them will require a complete overhaul of the health care system, and removing hospitals as the go-to for urgent, chronic or long-term care.

Genesis Halts Withdrawals As FTX-Induced ‘Crypto Contagion’ Spreads,Chris Metinko,2022/11/16,"

Crypto has gone from a winter to a contagion.
Crypto lender Genesis said Wednesday it is suspending withdrawals and new loans after the dramatic collapse of crypto exchange FTX. 
“This decision was made in response to the extreme market dislocation and loss of industry confidence caused by the FTX implosion,” Genesis’ parent company Digital Currency Group said on Twitter.

The announcement comes just days after New York-based Genesis sent a letter to its clients letting them know it was able to secure an equity infusion of $140 million from Digital Currency Group. Genesis said it had about $175 million of assets locked away on FTX’s exchange — as reported by The Block.
Genesis also had significant exposure to Singapore crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) which filed for bankruptcy in the summer and led the crypto market into turmoil in July. 
The news started a domino effect, as also on Wednesday following Genesis’ announcement Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss’ Gemini said it would halt redemptions. Genesis was a partner.
“The past week has been an incredibly challenging and stressful time for our industry,” Gemini officials wrote in a blog post.
The situation is not dissimilar to the ripple effect 3AC’s bankruptcy had on the industry this summer, as the hedge fund’s collapse led to the fall of companies like Celsius Network and Voyager Digital.
FTX’s demise likely will have significantly greater effects.
Lawsuit filed
FTX’s legal problems also mounted, as late Tuesday a proposed class-action lawsuit was filed in Miami alleging FTX’s yield-bearing accounts were unregistered securities.
The suit was first reported by The Block.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages from FTX co-founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and nearly a dozen athletes and celebrities who promoted FTX.
Those named include Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady, Brazilian model Gisele Bündchen, tennis player Naomi Osaka, basketball star Steph Curry, and the Golden State Warriors.
FTX went big on advertising this year, using big-name entertainers to push its exchange. The company even aired an ad during the 2022 Super Bowl — telling viewers “Don’t Miss Out on Crypto.”
Help on the way?
In an effort to stop the destruction being caused by FTX’s fall, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao told CNBC he would be establishing a recovery fund to help people in the industry.
“We want the strong industry players today to protect the good industry players who might just be hurt short term,” said Zhao, who did not specify an exact figure for the recovery fund.
Zhao also said in the interview he did not expect recent events to cause long-term damage.

Fintech Investor Fiat Ventures Closes Oversubscribed $25M Fund,Gené Teare,2022/11/16,"

San Francisco-based Fiat Ventures has closed on its first fund of $25 million to invest in fintech, insurtech and proptech companies. The original target for the fund, which had a first close in 2021, was $15 million.

Its anchor investor is Invesco Private Capital. Other investors include DAHG Capital Partners, Joint Effects, Full Spectrum Capital, Temerity Capital Partners, Now Investments, Mountaineer Capital, Permit Ventures and fintech operators Jonathan Abelmann from Bestow, Kyle Daley at Chime, and Chinedu Eleanya from Mulberry.
Co-founders of Fiat Ventures: Drew Glover, Marcos Fernandez and Alex Harris. Photo by Deanna Leigh Photography.
Inside Fiat
Fiat’s founding team are former operators at fintech startups. We spoke with co-founder and general partner Alex Harris, previously head of growth and partnerships at Chime.
“You have these pain points that people have with traditional finance, traditional insurance. And technology is solving them and making it better from an experience perspective, from a financial value perspective,” said Harris on the firm’s investment thesis of investing in financial services that focus on those that are underserved.
His co-founders include Drew Glover whom Harris first met on the Berkeley football team where Glover was a player and Harris worked for the team. Glover was previously a vice president at Steady. The third partner at the firm is managing partner Marcos Fernandez, previously at SOFi and Ripple.
The fund opportunity grew organically out of Fiat Growth, which operates as an external CMO to help startups build revenue. As it helped startups raise funding, Harris saw an opportunity to invest.
One of those investments is a Series A the firm led in Seattle-based Copper, a digital bank built for teenagers that includes advice about money management and investing. The metrics were “massively better by multiples compared to anything else in the market,” said Harris on its investment.
The fund’s first check size is between $250,000 and $500,000 at pre-seed, seed or Series A. The firm reserves half of its fund for follow-on funding. So far, over 50% of its investments are in underrepresented founders, said Harris of the 25 investments the firm has already made.
The investment team includes Vice President Caitlin Keep, previously at Forge Global.
Investments from Fiat Ventures’ first fund include fractional vacation ownership startup Here, home equity service Splitero, auto insurance provider Sigo Seguros, and bill management and credit building company StellarFi.

"
Breaking Through The Concrete Ceiling In Venture Capital,Guest Author,2022/11/16,"

By Matt Cohen
The venture capital industry has a notoriously bad reputation for its lack of inclusivity and diversity.  This not only applies to the venture capitalists themselves, but the founders they fund.

The venture ecosystem is dealing with a barrier, more well known as a “concrete ceiling.” Oftentimes, social, gender and socioeconomic factors play into this; making it an ongoing challenge for women and underrepresented groups to break through.
Funding the fundamentals
The venture capital and startup ecosystem is also notoriously elusive. From the outside looking in, it’s difficult to break down lingo, frameworks and other insider knowledge needed to succeed. Educational resources and fellowship programs play a crucial role in leveling the playing field in venture. The earlier students can begin learning the fundamentals, the better.
Matt Cohen of Ripple Ventures
For instance, our firm offers the RippleX Fellowship that provides a free online course for students, ramping them into the world of startup and venture capital. This fellowship helps diverse students who would otherwise have a hard time cracking into this traditionally insular space.
Another program assisting diverse founders and emerging managers to dive into the VC space is Recast Capital’s Enablement Program. It launched the program with the goal to help GPs of venture firms in the early days establish themselves. This is another tuition-free program focused on building community and providing educational services to help new fund managers learn the ropes.
Educational resources are a catalytic approach to advancing these groups’ progress and representation in venture capital. It is not merely enough to provide capital to these founders. If the concrete ceiling breaks, it’s going to be from these diverse entrepreneurs chipping away at it, with the guidance of VCs and their educational resources.
Take a closer look at your talent funnel
Talent acquisition is yet another way VCs can break the barrier to inclusivity in the industry. Who, how and why recruiters hire people to work for a company can play a large role in a company’s team diversity and how the company is perceived overall. Although diversity in VC is starting to see some progression and growth, problems remain.
Another factor that plays into the concrete ceiling in VC is the way job descriptions are worded. A study from the University of Waterloo found that gendered women feel that job adverts with masculine-coded language were less appealing and that they belonged less in those occupations. Conversely, female-oriented language didn’t discourage male applicants from applying.
Additionally, female investors are dramatically more likely to consider the gender of the founders of startups they are thinking about investing in, according to two reports by the Angel Capital Association. ACA’s research found that more than half — 51% — of women feel a founders’ gender is highly important, compared to 6% of male investors.
Fostering a community of culture
A 2016 LinkedIn survey revealed that 85% of jobs are filled through networking. Through fellowship programs and strategic efforts in talent acquisition, venture firms can create a community of founders and funders with unique perspectives and backgrounds. Once these communities are in place, they have the power to become autonomous in their growth.

Matt Cohen, founder and managing partner at Ripple Ventures, was founding investor of Turnstyle Solutions, which was acquired by Yelp in 2017. He is a frequent contributor to Crunchbase News, having written about why more VCs are becoming startup founders and other topics.

Web3 Weekly: FTX’s Fall From Grace And What It Means To Venture And The World of Crypto,Chris Metinko,2022/11/16,"

This is a weekly feature that will look back at the week that was in crypto, blockchain and Web3, and offer insights and analysis. Check out last week’s here.
Through the first 10 months of 2022, crypto’s year has been rocky to say the least.
But no one would have imagined what the last week-plus would bring to the industry, as one of its biggest exchanges imploded, leaving crypto and venture investors wondering what could possibly happen next.

FTX’s unprecedented collapse — causing it and 130 related entities to declare bankruptcy — will have significant effects not just on the crypto and Web3 ecosystem, but in the greater venture network in general.
FTX was not just the fourth-largest crypto exchange by volume when it failed, but its co-founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was one of crypto’s biggest evangelists and financial backers. Through FTX Ventures and his other trading firm Alameda Research, the crypto whiz kid made hundreds of bets on the industry and the future of digital finance.
Now, in a span of days, his exchange’s implosion has left crypto enthusiasts, venture backers, startups and many others wondering what is next for the industry. Whatever is next, the one certainty is the reverberations from FTX’s demise will be significant and long lasting.

FTX Collapse Will Reverberate Throughout The VC World For A Long Time,Chris Metinko,2022/11/15,"

The sudden rise and fall of FTX seemingly caught everyone by surprise. However, as fast as it happened, the effects of FTX’s collapse are not just sudden, but likely will be continuous and long-lasting.
For perspective, Theranos had raised about $1.3 billion in funding and had a $10 billion valuation at its peak before the walls came tumbling down and a story started to unfold that everyone still talks about now and gave us a movie.

By comparison, FTX and FTX US had raised a combined $2.2 billion at a $32 billion valuation and $8 billion valuation, respectively, before everything fell apart.
Investors
With valuations that large, it’s unsurprising that some of the largest names in VC and investing took part.
Fellow crypto exchange Binance was one of the company’s first lead investors, taking part in a round of undisclosed value in late 2019, according to Crunchbase data.
Rounds became much more significant quickly for the failed crypto exchange. In July 2021, Sequoia Capital took the lead in a $1 billion round, FTX’s largest round.
That round had dozens of investors, including big names like NEA, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Insight Partners, Temasek, SoftBank Vision Fund, Thoma Bravo, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Coinbase Ventures, Ribbit Capital, Multicoin Capital, Paradigm and Altimeter.
Just three months later, FTX swept up another $420 million-plus, again led by Sequoia and also the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan.


Then came its $400 million Series C at a $32 billion valuation earlier this year — with many of the same participants again: Temasek, Paradigm, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board, NEA, IVP, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Steadview Capital, Tiger Global and Insight Partners, among others.
Facing facts
Many of those investors already are willing to face reality. It’s been reported Sequoia and Paradigm have written down their stakes to zero. The Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board said the $95 million it invested in FTX should have “limited impact on the plan, given this investment represents less than 0.05% of our total net assets.”
Others seem ready for a more prolonged fight, as it has been reported some VC firms are considering suing Sam Bankman-Fried for alleged fraud — although that seems like a Hail Mary to try to save face.
What does seem certain is that FTX’s collapse will not be forgotten by New Year’s. Such a fall from grace that involves so many marquee names in venture will likely have a ripple effect when those same firms look at their next Web3 or crypto investment. How eager will they be for that investment? How eager will their LPs be to see another deal in crypto? It may even affect their due diligence process outside of crypto deals.
Even crypto-specific firms like Paradigm and Multicoin Capital could suffer from a type of “post-FTX syndrome” when looking at their next crypto deal.
The effects of FTX’s fall will be long lasting — and you can bet there will be a movie made.
Alameda’s far reach
Aside from the FTX collapse’s effect on big-name venture firms, it also likely will have a significant impact on the crypto and Web3 ecosystem Bankman-Fried sought to foster.
Earlier this week, we talked about the nearly 50 investments FTX Ventures made this year since announcing its first $2 billion funding in January. Those rounds in total raised nearly $3 billion for burgeoning startups, with FTX Ventures leading some of the biggest of those deals.
However, Bankman-Fried’s other trading firm Alameda Research — also in bankruptcy — was a prolific investor in the crypto startup scene.
Per Crunchbase data, starting in 2019 the firm made 180 investments. In 2021 alone, the firm completed 100 deals. Those investments totaled $2.3 billion. This year, Alameda Research slowed that pace, making only 55 investments, but those totaled $2.1 billion.
It is important to note Alameda Research did not invest that amount, but rather simply took stake in rounds that totaled that amount.
However, it was an investor, and it is never ideal for a young startup — many of Alameda Research’s deals were seed and pre-seed rounds — to have an early investor declare bankruptcy.
Alameda Research also led or co-led 30 of those rounds, including some large ones such as: Toronto-based crypto-asset management tool 3Commas’ $37 million Series B in September, Chicago-based automated crypto investing platform Stacked’s $35 million Series A last December, and a $40 million venture round in Switzerland-based decentralized premier brokerage protocol Oxygen.org.
Bankman-Fried’s reach went well beyond a failed exchange. He touched many in the crypto startup ecosystem who shared his similar vision. Now time will tell how damaging his help will turn out to be.

Amazon Announces New Virtual Clinic As Telehealth Grows,Keerthi Vedantam,2022/11/15,"

Just a few months after Amazon acquired One Medical and shuttered its long-struggling telehealth arm Amazon Care, the company revealed a new telehealth offering on Tuesday: Amazon Clinic.
Amazon Clinic seems to be the health system’s answer to “a quick check in,, especially at a time when doctors are juggling far too many patients every single day and patients are finding it hard to get an appointment.

Need your birth control refilled? Have an acne issue that requires a topical treatment? Through Amazon Clinic, patients can search for a particular ailment (there are around 20 that are applicable), scroll through a list of providers and how much they cost, and message with them virtually after filling out a quick intake form.
“Virtual care isn’t right for every problem,” Amazon admits, which makes sense for a messaging-only application.
The telehealth business model might be due for a change
Perhaps it’s smart that Amazon ventured back into telehealth after its flagship Amazon Care product disintegrated. Funding among telehealth startups hasn’t reverted back to pre-pandemic numbers, signaling telehealth adoption is a permanent change in the health care system. Per Crunchbase data, 2022 so far has seen over $1.3 billion in funding (compare that to 2019, when funding clocked in at less than $500,000).
Like most telehealth services we’re seeing right now, Amazon Clinic does not take insurance. But it’s unclear if the company plans on getting employers involved to offer the service as part of an employee benefits package, something that contributed to the demise of Amazon Care.
We’ve addressed this before with Maven, which announced $90 million in fresh funding on Monday. Specialized telehealth companies usually latch onto employers as part of a benefits package as opposed to partnering with insurance firms, which is a good way for doctors offices to circumvent tedious administrative requirements involved with being insurance-based. There’s a reason why so many therapists don’t take insurance.
But we’re starting to see a shift in teletherapy.
Venture firms are increasingly looking at startups that use health insurance as part of their business model as it’s usually an indication of long-term patient and provider engagement. This is generally true for any health care offering that requires long-term care: mental health, chronic conditions or fertility, to name a few. It’ll be interesting to see how this change of strategy in teletherapy will affect the rest of the telehealth space.
For what it’s worth, it doesn’t look like Amazon Clinic is meant to be that sort of platform.

"
Why More Sexual Wellness Startups Are Turned On By Retail,Keerthi Vedantam,2022/11/15,"

The sexual health aisle at CVS is getting an update: Among condom boxes, pregnancy tests and vaginal hygiene products sitting in packaging that hasn’t been updated since the early ’90s is something fresh; bright bottles of lubricants with cheeky names like Tush Cush or So-Low Lotion.
Tush Cush and So-Low Lotion are just a tiny slice of the lubricants made by Cake, a 2-year-old sex health startup that began as a niche, direct-to-consumer brand and now finds itself in one of the largest drug stores in the country.
CVS isn’t the only one embracing this upgrade: Sephora, Nordstrom and Bloomingdale’s began stocking up on vibrators as sales of sex-related products blew up during the pandemic. That’s thanks to an increased cultural shift that embraced sexual pleasure as a crucial component of physical and mental health.

Niche, direct-to-consumer sex startups are quickly entering the mainstream and gaining favor with big retailers and consumers. But venture funding in the space has been volatile at best, as shown below:


The space peaked in 2016 at $372 million when direct-to-consumer was a huge category for success. But the years after were plagued with inconsistent funding numbers. While venture funding for sex-focused consumer packaged goods netted $133 million in 2021, that number has fallen to $52 million so far in 2022.
“People have sex in different ways and people think about sexual health and wellness in different ways,” said Caitlin Strandberg, an investor at Lerer Hippeau. “And so you need to have a different type of product, not just for one person, but for every type of potential consumer, and do it in a way that makes it fun and accessible.”
But first, some history
Before Facebook and other social media platforms became the advertiser behemoths they are now, marketing online was an easy task for companies that, by necessity, needed to be digitally native in the absence of retail approval. An early wave of direct-to-consumer startups such as Harry’s razors and quip toothbrushes found success in targeted online ads, aestheticizing the most mundane parts of human hygiene by ejecting a sense of luxury and purpose into essential tasks.
Those targeted ads quickly garnered cult followings online and translated into retail. Brands known for their supraliminal, ritualistic messaging suddenly could be found next to mouthwash and deodorant, and at a cheaper price. The deal allowed retail to remain fresh and relevant for young consumers while brands opened the gates to new audiences.
“Direct-to-consumer only was a very hot investing category in a marketing channel,” said Strandberg, whose firm invested in Cake, Casper mattresses and other DTC brands. “There was a moment of time, and there were people that could arbitrage that effectively, and that moment of time kind of closed.”
Consumer packaged goods startups today face a much different reality. Thanks to changes in social media algorithms, the growing expense of ad space, and the competitive DTC landscape, companies are now having a harder time capturing their audience and leading them through the funnel to turn them into a loyal customer. Apple also rolled out an iOS update on its phones, making it harder for marketers to track users and collect breadcrumbs of highly personalized information.
“It’s just harder to target people,” said Frances Tang, CEO of consumer-focused sexual wellness startup Awkward Essentials. “And it costs more to acquire them because you’re not able to target as exactly as you used to previously.”
But the strategy paved by digital-native startups like Harry’s is getting harder to replicate, especially in the sexual wellness space where innovations go far beyond what currently exists in the market.
Challenges to DTC and big-box retail
When Tang started Awkward Essentials, there wasn’t a product on the market quite like hers.
Her company’s flagship product, the Dripstick, was focused on after-sex semen cleanup.
Tang’s strategy, at first, was to get in at retail stores. But because of the unique nature of the product, and after educating people on what it did, that quickly changed. The company began pivoting to sex stores and adult spaces.
“In a location like that, a customer is more willing to ask questions, whereas you walk into a Target and they’re not even going to help you to figure out what toaster to buy,” she said.
But sex-related startups also face major problems in online marketing. You can’t market sex on social media, making it hard for startups in the space to educate potential customers on their products. And as the category fundamentally changes by opening the door for specific products as opposed to one-size-fits all lubricants, it can be hard to explain to a potential customer why they’re important.
“Even if there are things you don’t know or you’re learning more about particular things, [companies] educate their customers in a really compelling way,” Strandberg said.
The omnichannel strategy
When Hunter Morris and Mitch Orkis started Cake in 2020, the goal was to move away from sexual wellness products that appealed to the lowest common denominator in consumers and move towards niche, situation-based sex products. The company introduced a slew of lubricants for almost every kind of sex act you’d want one for, and then moved on to vibrators and condoms.
Cake was direct-to-consumer, pumping money into marketing strategies that would net them loyal customers who return to the website to buy their products. It landed an $8 million Series A funding round in September, garnering more than $16 million in funding total, and entering retail with deals at CVS, Urban Outfitters’ online shop and Thrive Market.
This “omnichannel strategy” has been gaining traction. Direct-to-consumer is most likely to deliver loyal, frequent customers and a higher profit margin. Others may stumble across it on Amazon or in specialty health and wellness stores. And big-box retailers provide the most bang for your buck.
“When founders and good marketers understand how to leverage the channels to drive acquisition and to drive sales, that’s always important to me,” said Melinda Moore, an adviser at Coyote Ventures, who is focused on women’s health and wellness.
But omnichannel is a capital-intensive strategy. It requires strong marketing to penetrate the right markets, finesse social media and e-commerce algorithms, and translate new customers into loyal ones. All without forgetting already-loyal customers.
“There’s an entire set of challenges and solutions and problems that every brand will face in kind of transitioning from direct to consumer toward retail,” said Morris.
He’s right. Shipping a couple bottles of lubricant to someone’s door is a much different logistical hassle than shipping cases to a warehouse. Customer acquisition with a direct-to-consumer strategy can be hard, but it pays in a breadth of detailed customer data.
In retail, products sell at a lower price but can be sold faster. And marketing strategies have to shift with it: Do startups direct users to their website or to brick-and-mortar stores?
“It comes down to: Do you have the resources to support omnichannel?” Moore said. “If you’re super, super early stage and you have a million or $2 million, it doesn’t make sense to be omnichannel because you’re not going to be able to pay attention to it and to be able to support it.”
But to curry favor with investors, brands in sexual health need to appeal to a variety of consumers in order to succeed.
“I don’t necessarily see businesses as DTC businesses or retail businesses,” Morris said. “I see it as being: How do you remove the most friction from a user purchasing from your company? How do we make it a really easy shopping experience for the consumers we want to be in front of?”

Be Careful: Constant Communication Could Kill The New Remote Work World,Guest Author,2022/11/15,"

By Tom Medema
The COVID pandemic obliterated the notion that information workers need to be in an office or on-site to get work done.
Truthfully, these employees can sign on from wherever, whenever — as long as communication channels with bosses, colleagues, customers and external partners are open and active.

In other words, it’s never been easier to connect, collaborate and share work. But being able to converse at a moment’s notice doesn’t always convert to getting work done.
Quality over quantity
Everyone, from a company’s founder to its newest hire, should also be aware there’s a hefty price tag associated with ineffective communication powered by frequent information exchanges lacking clarity, completeness and/or context.
Tom Medema, founder and CEO of Bubbles
For example, an executive might fail to share important details about a pending merger, partnership deal or company priority with board members, fellow leaders or staff. One employee might Slack a colleague to discover what happened during a Zoom meeting they missed and receive an incomplete or completely wrong summary.
Co-workers from different departments — product and marketing, for instance — might be tasked with collaborating on messaging a software update to users and simply never talk, email or chat about it until right before the update goes live.
Regardless of why, how or when communication breakdowns take place, they don’t happen in a vacuum. And consequences — immediate, such as a lost business deal, or longer-term, such as a nugget of unsubstantiated info that leads to a mass quitting event — could reach far beyond a break room, Zoom window or board meeting.
Company leaders must set the tone for effective communication across ranks and departments by consistently delivering clear, context-rich information.
The solution
Rather than acting like everything is urgent and pushing for everyone to return to the office, executives need to embrace employees’ desire to work in ways that are more compatible with their lifestyles.
Doing so involves more than investing in platforms like Zoom, Slack and Notion to bring people together regardless of where they’re physically located. It requires moving away from the very culture of constant chatter these platforms encourage which can result in complications from a minor misunderstanding between colleagues to a mass employee exodus.
The reality is that remote work is now simply work. Platforms offer 24/7 communication possibilities, but also drain employees will to engage and introduce new pressures to work environments.
At the same time, people are more free to explore alternative career options if they’re not satisfied with current employment for any reason. In fact, employees hold more leverage than ever to ask for conditions and policies that fit individual preferences, lifestyles and financial needs (a good thing, if you ask me).
The kicker: Technologies created to solve ineffective work communication (collaboration platforms and tools) are now fueling the problem. Constant chatter can easily lead to everything feeling like a fire drill, priorities becoming unclear and significant time spent sending and/or responding to messages instead of getting work done.
While it’s been heading in that direction for years, the pandemic put the fallacy that people have to be in the office or have their laptop cameras on during a Zoom or Loom to get work done and put to bed once and for all.
Against this backdrop and in the face of economic uncertainty and layoffs, industry leaders need to go beyond simply investing in collaboration technologies and embrace a culture of strategic, asynchronous communication.
The alternative path — staying with the constant chatter status quo — involves risking more than lost revenue or the departure of a few employees. It could prove fatal.
People actually developing digital collaboration solutions, meanwhile, need to take a beat. They should (re)think how to leverage innovation to help people connect, relay important information, understand nuanced context and get specific points across in today’s hybrid work environment.

"Just Like FTX, FTX Ventures Went Big — And Fast — When It Came To Investing",Chris Metinko,2022/11/14,"

While everyone is still sifting through the immediate FTX wreckage, there is a good chance more decimated debris is on the way.
Along with trying to be a white knight to companies such as Voyager Digital and lender BlockFi, Sam Bankman-Fried and his company also made their way to the venture world early this year.

FTX Ventures announced its first $2 billion funding in January and quickly made nearly 50 different investments from the new venture arm, according to Crunchbase data. Those rounds in total raised nearly $3 billion for burgeoning startups, with FTX Ventures leading some of the biggest of those deals.


The firm made waves right from the start when it hired former Lightspeed partner Amy Wu to lead its ventures, M&A and commercial initiatives. She reportedly stepped down late last week as FTX started to implode.
It also didn’t stop making news until nearly right up to the dying breaths of its parent. On Nov. 3, it was reported the venture arm had led a seed round for Web3 social media startup Lens Protocol for an undisclosed amount.
While that round was likely closed weeks — if not months — ago, it would be just days later when Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted his exchange would sell its holdings of FTX’s native token FTT, and FTX’s house of cards began to crumble.
Going big
Out of the 47 rounds FTX Ventures participated in, the firm led or co-led 19 including some of the largest, according to Crunchbase data.
In early September, it led a $300 million Series B into Mysten Labs, the developer of the Sui Layer 1 blockchain, that valued the startup at more than $2 billion.
In July, it co-led the $150 million Series A for Palo Alto, California-based Aptos Labs, valuing it at more than $2 billion. It also took part in a $200 million investment for the Layer 1 system blockchain just four months earlier.
In March, FTX Ventures co-led LayerZero Labs’ $135 million Series A. The round minted LayerZero, which creates software to connect  applications across different blockchains, a unicorn. However, The Information reported last week that LayerZero was able to return funding in exchange for getting its shares back after learning of the bankruptcy.
Aside from rounds it led or co-led, FTX Ventures also participated in a huge $450 million “seed” round for Miami-based Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT creator Yuga Labs, and a $350 million round into Ethereum rival NEAR Protocol.
The end
Now, as FTX and more than 130 of its affiliated entities declare bankruptcy, it seems crypto has lost a venture firm primed to be a big player in the Web3 space. With funding in the industry being down, that could spell doom for some startups, especially those still relatively young in the nascent space.
FTX Ventures launched in January with a blog posting, announcing to the world it would be “for builders, by builders,” and that it could invest in “at any check size and stage.”
“We measure time horizons in decades,” it reads. “We don’t mind if you’re anon. We won’t ask you to present in front of an investment committee.”
When it comes to vetting, it seems like the venture arm learned from FTX’s own investors.
FTX did not respond to a request for comment.

Maven Clinic Raises $90M In Year’s Largest Femtech Round,Keerthi Vedantam,2022/11/14,"

Maven Clinic, a teletherapy startup focused on women’s health, announced on Monday it raised $90 million in Series E funding. The round was led by General Catalyst, with additional participation from Intermountain Ventures, Sequoia Capital and CVS Health Ventures. Maven has raised more than $300 million in total funding, per the company. 
Eight-year-old Maven follows women and families through fertility and pregnancy to birth, pediatrics and menopause. Through its app, patients are connected to specialists who can talk them through a variety of medical procedures and long-term care plans for nutrition and child care. The company operates in 175 countries and offers care for families with different backgrounds and needs.
“We have reimagined the care model to address the complex needs of women and families in a global system that was not designed for them,” said Kate Ryder, Maven CEO and founder.

New York City-based Maven works with employers to provide supplemental benefits, but doesn’t accept insurance — although its website indicates per-appointment fees cost less than most copays.
Specialized care gains traction
Maven’s raise, so far, marks the largest raise in the femtech category this year. Funding has dropped 52% since last year, garnering only $683 million in 2022. 
But that’s not bad. Before 2020 and 2021, when a flood of funding ensconced the private markets, femtech netted $569 million in 2019. 
Maven is one of several virtual health startups operating in the niche care space, where companies are building care plans for people who have otherwise been shunned by the mainstream health care system: women, people of color, queer people and immigrants. In October we covered FOLX Health’s $30 million raise to further its care offerings to LGBTQIA+ patients such as gender-affirming health care, access to PrEP (medication that stymies the spread of HIV and AIDS), and fertility services for same-sex couples. Caraway, which raised $10.5 million in January, offers health care services for college-aged women such as sexual health education. 
But FOLX, Maven and Caraway, like many startups in this space, don’t take insurance. Rather, they either accept out-of-pocket payments or work with companies or schools to offer benefits to workers. Operating outside the insurance network might make it easier for patients to access specialists that are in demand and otherwise hard to schedule an appointment with. But the system also shuts out another group typically evaded by health care: the poor.

"The Week’s 10 Biggest Funding Rounds: Genesis Receives Cash Infusion After FTX Implosion, Zenas Raises Big",Chris Metinko,2022/11/14,"

This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds here.

The week’s top 10 is a little delayed due to the holiday last Friday, but here are the biggest rounds of last week. Perhaps not surprisingly, even this list couldn’t avoid the FTX collapse fallout, as a crypto startup that had its assets on the exchange frozen takes the top spot.
1. Genesis, $140M, crypto: The effects of FTX’s dramatic collapse will reverberate through the crypto and startup worlds for months — maybe longer — and Genesis is a good example. The New York-based brokerage sent a letter to its clients letting them know it was able to secure an equity infusion of $140 million from parent company, Digital Currency Group, after having about $175 million of assets locked away on FTX’s exchange. Genesis also had significant exposure to Singapore crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) which filed for bankruptcy in the summer and led the crypto market into turmoil in July. After what happened to FTX and 3AC, access to cash may be critical to a lot of crypto startups.
2. Zenas BioPharma, $118M, biotech: The first week of November was big for biotech, and last week another biotech startup saw a large round. Massachusetts-based Zenas BioPharma closed a $118 million Series B led by Enavate Sciences. The firm will use the new cash to start a phase 3 trial by the end of the year for obexelimab, a bispecific antibody for patients with IgG4-related disease, a chronic illness that can affect multiple organs and sites. The startup also will use the new cash to push other autoimmune disease programs into clinical development next year.
3. Ordergroove, $100M, ecommerce: Subscription-based consumer models can be tricky, as society’s tastes constantly change. However, that did not stop New York-based e-commerce platform Ordergroove from locking up $100 million in funding led by growth equity firm Primus Capital Partners. The startup works with consumer goods giants like The Honest Company, La Colombe, L’Oréal and PetSmart to create subscription strategies, trying to help those companies create loyal, long-term customers. Founded in 2010, the company has raised $130 million, per Crunchbase.
4. TRM Labs, $70M, blockchain: Funding to crypto and blockchain startups has not been what it was last year, but that did not stop San Francisco-based startup TRM Labs from grabbing another $70 million for its Series B last week led by Thoma Bravo. The company originally announced its $60 million Series B last December led by Tiger Global. The startup’s “blockchain intelligence” solution can investigate and analyze crypto-related fraud and financial crimes, making it valuable to everyone from law enforcement agencies to regulators and banks. Perhaps it makes sense then that the extension participation came from the likes of Goldman Sachs. Founded in 2018, the company has raised nearly $150 million.
5. (tied) Island, $60M, cybersecurity: Dallas-based Island has raised a lot of cash quickly even in this down market. The company announced a $100 million Series A and came out of stealth in February. Then in March, the startup — which develops enterprise browsers it says enhances both security and worker productivity — raised a $115 million Series B at a $1.3 billion valuation led by Insight Partners. Now the company is adding a Georgian-led $60 million to that round. The company’s valuation did not increase and it says the new money “adds to Island’s already considerable cash reserves.” Let’s hope they are considerable. That’s a lot of money to raise in a short amount of time in any market, let alone one some are comparing to 2008.
5. (tied) Kyte, $60M, fleet management: San Francisco-based Kyte has been busy, even in a down market. In March, the company took in $200 million in debt financing — an option that is becoming more enticing to startups as markets slow. Then last week, the on-demand car company closed a $60 million Series B led by InterAlpen Partners. The company is looking to become the world’s largest operator of EV fleets and will use the new cash to expand beyond the current 14 cities in which it operates. Through its app, customers can book a car and choose an exact time and location for their vehicle delivery. Founded in 2019, Kyte has raised approximately $300 million, according to the company.
7. (tied) Athletic Brewing Co., $50M, brewing: Stratford, Connecticut-based Athletic Brewing Co., a nonalcoholic brewer, closed a $50 million funding round led by Alliance Consumer Growth and TRB Advisors. Founded in 2017, the brewer has raised approximately $200 million, per Crunchbase.
7. (tied) Laika, $50M, compliance: New York-based compliance platform developer Laika closed a $50 million Series C funding led by Fin Capital. Founded in 2019, Laika syas it has raised $98 million.
9. Fathom, $46M, health care: San Francisco-based medical coding automation startup Fathom raised a $46 million Series B led by Alkeon Capital and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Founded in 2016, Fathom has raised $61 million in total, the company said.
10. (tied) Elemental Machines, $41M, data: Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Elemental Machines, a developer of a data and intelligence platform for labs, raised a $41 million Series B led by Sageview Capital and co-led by Omega Venture Partners. Founded in 2015, the company has raised nearly $58 million, per Crunchbase.
10. (tied) Juvena Therapeutics, $41M, biotech: Redwood City, California-based secreted proteins biotech startup Juvena Therapeutics closed a $41 million Series A co-led by Mubadala Capital and Horizons Ventures. Founded in 2017, Juvena has raised a total of $50 million, per the company.
Big global deals
If the largest deal for any given week doesn’t occur in the U.S., it usually happens in Europe or Asia. But last week offered a curveball:

Algeria-based on-demand service provider Yassir landed one of Africa’s largest raises of the year with a $150 million Series B.

Methodology
We tracked the largest rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of Nov. 5 to 11. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.

A Look Back At The SPAC-Fueled LA Mansion-Buying Spree Of 2021-22,Joanna Glasner,2022/11/11,"

Sometimes, it’s hard to wrap one’s head around the notion that November 2021 was just a year ago. At the time, large cap tech names like Meta and PayPal were roughly triple their current value and Bitcoin and Ethereum hit all-time highs.
And yes, SPACs were a very popular investment. Companies that took that route to market in 2020 and 2021, including Opendoor, Luminar, Fisker and Sonder Holdings, were stock market darlings for a while.
It was the kind of environment that apparently leads a startup founder to feel OK about dropping tens of millions on a Los Angeles mansion. And many, in fact, did just that.

It hasn’t worked out as planned. Last month, we reported on the Miami mansion of Bird founder Travis VanderZanden, which is now worth more than his stake in the one-time scooter unicorn. Turns out, he’s not the only one who bought high-priced homes in recent quarters expecting their net worth would be a lot higher today.
Below, in what we hope comes off as more a retrospective of a bygone-era than a pure exercise in schadenfreude, we look at some of the biggest mansion deals, and how buyers’ fortunes have turned. We’ve limited ourselves here to Los Angeles, which seemed to be a hot spot for tech riches-to-real-estate deals.
Did my SPAC open the door? (To a Bel Air mansion)
We’ll start with Eric Wu, co-founder and CEO of Opendoor, the real estate iBuyer platform that went public in a SPAC merger with a blank-check company led by “SPAC King” Chamath Palihapitiya.

Wu reportedly paid a whopping $32 million in April for an all-glass mansion in the Bel Air hills designed by famed architect Zoltan Pali. The 18,800-square-foot home, originally listed for $56 million, boasts “sweeping views of the Los Angeles Basin, unobstructed from the Getty Center to Long Beach, Century City, and Downtown.”
Since around the time the purchase closed, Opendoor shares have shed over two-thirds of their value. The company’s market cap is down over 90% from its 2021 peak. And its business model looks more suited to last year, when mortgage rates were half current levels and homes were selling fast.
Recent headlines haven’t been favorable. Last week, the company laid off 18% of its staff. In August, the Federal Trade Commission reported Opendoor has agreed to pay a settlement of $62 million over charges of misleading potential home sellers in its marketing campaigns. To make matters worse, the company is also reportedly selling homes it acquired at a loss.
Fisker house is not a fixer

Though it had been on shaky ground financially for many years, luxury electric-car maker Fisker finally made it to the public markets two years ago, courtesy of a SPAC merger. Shares peaked at over $28 in early 2021, giving the company a market cap of over $9 billion.
Husband-and-wife Henrik Fisker and Geeta Gupta-Fisker, who both hold large stakes in the company, went house shopping that year, spending $21.8 million for a Hollywood Hills mansion with views all the way to the Pacific Ocean.
While Los Angeles real estate has been holding up OK lately, the same can’t be said for Fisker shares. The stock is down around 70% from its peak.
Sonder CEO gets skyline views

Francis Davidson, CEO of Sonder, a provider of chic accommodations for short-term stays, reportedly paid $9.2 million early this year for a Hollywood Hills mansion formerly owned by prodigious Grammy winner Pharrell Williams.
But while the year started out well enough for the hospitality upstart, things have gone downhill. Sonder has shed roughly 80% of its value on Nasdaq after completing a SPAC merger in January.
Davidson reportedly sold $15 million worth of shares in January. It looks like his remaining reported stake is worth less than the price of the Hollywood house.
Luminar CEO was worth billions when he bought $83M house
Luminar, a developer of autonomous driving technology, made a splashy market debut in late 2020 and subsequently landed a market cap of more than $10 billion.

That was a lucrative time for Luminar’s 20-something founder and CEO, Austin Russell, who reportedly paid $83 million in the summer of 2021 for an 18-bedroom home in the Pacific Palisades enclave.
At the time, it was a very affordable home for Russell, whose stake was worth billions. He owned nearly a third of company shares when Luminar went public, according to a securities filing for the SPAC merger deal.
Now, with shares down over 75% from their 2020 peak, Russell is no longer a paper billionaire. Luminar’s current market cap — around $2.7 billion —  however, is still high enough for him to afford some very nice digs.
And more…
As we started compiling giant LA mansion purchases, the list was getting quite long. In the interest of reasonable brevity, we’re listing some of the other deals below in short form:

Bitcoin to Bel Air: In January, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong reportedly spent $133 million on a Bel Air compound said to rank as the fourth-priciest residential real estate deal ever inked in California. Since hitting its peak a year ago, Coinbase shares have lost 84% of their value.
Figs founders got mansions: Heather Hasson and Trina Spear, the founders of health care apparel maker Figs, generated enormous paper wealth when their company went public in spring 2021. Hasson reportedly used some of the proceeds for a $57 million Brentwood estate, while Spear purchased a nearby home for $22 million. Shares of the company are now down 86% from their peak.

A16z’s Marc Andreessen paid $177 million for this Malibu estate. Photo: Google Earth via LA Times.
Andreessen drops $255M in Malibu: When it comes to spending top dollar on Southern California real estate, no one can outdo the Andreessens. Marc Andreessen, the venture capitalist, and Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen, a philanthropy director, author and academic, spent $177 million last year on a Malibu estate that reportedly ranks as the priciest property ever sold in California. A few months later, they spent $44 million and $34 million, respectively, on two other nearby properties. The purchases were followed by some sharp declines of valuations in public companies with backing from Andreessen Horowitz, as we documented a few months ago. While market caps of  specific companies on the list have shifted since, the overall narrative of a downward trajectory remains valid.

Ordergroove Raises $100M To Bring Subscriptions To Consumer Packaged Goods,Keerthi Vedantam,2022/11/10,"

The subscription-based model that was widely embraced by SaaS companies and streaming services is now making its way to consumer goods.
Ordergroove, an e-commerce platform that helps consumer packaged goods companies with subscription services, announced on Thursday it raised $100 million in fresh funding led by growth equity firm Primus Capital Partners.

The company works with consumer goods giants like The Honest Company, La Colombe, L’Oréal and PetSmart to create subscription strategies, making it easier to retain hard-to-acquire customers in an age where consumers aren’t tied to their local grocery store, drug store or Amazon.
Subscriptions = consistent revenue
Subscription services have long been heralded by the software-as-a-service companies like Adobe and entertainment services like YouTube and Netflix. But Amazon has also rolled out a subscription service for certain home goods such as toilet paper and cleaning supplies — things consumers need on a regular basis — at a discount.
“If people sign up on a subscription to get it on a monthly basis or every three months, the consumer pays less,” said Melinda Moore, an adviser at Coyote Ventures focused on women-centered DTC goods. “But investors like models that are SaaS models where there’s consistent revenue.”
This is key for getting venture investment in consumer packaged goods, a category that became popular with the rise of known, digital-native brands and has since fallen out of favor with the rising cost of customer acquisition and supply chain issues.
Venture funding in the space spiked in 2018 with $21.5 billion, per Crunchbase data. In the years following, that number dwindled to $8.8 billion and hasn’t fluctuated much since (except for the venture funding banner year that was 2021).
Popular direct-to-consumer brands like Casper and Allbirds once had the ability to market on social media at an affordable cost. But customer acquisition costs have risen due to policy changes at social media platforms like Facebook and companies like Apple which make it harder to track and market to specific consumers without spending insurmountable dollars.

"After The FTX Collapse, This May Be A Good Time For VCs To Start Using ‘Common Sense’ Again",Chris Metinko,2022/11/10,"

As crypto prices plummet, some withdrawals are halted, and FTX scrambles for new investment after its astonishing fall, it seems fair to wonder what will happen to venture investment in the sector.

FTX’s debacle already has left its venture investors dumbfounded, with VC titan Sequoia Capital reportedly telling its LPs it has marked down the value of its stake in FTX to zero after investing more than $210 million in the exchange.


The crypto venture market has already cooled significantly from 2021 — like most other venture markets. Last year saw a record $23.3 billion invested in VC-backed crypto startups, according to Crunchbase data. Thus far this year, just slightly more than half that number — $12.8 billion — has been invested in similar startups.
That cooling may continue as investors start to ask questions they should have been asking all along.
“There’s a fine line between betting on the future — even when it means investing in concepts that, at least today, don’t entirely add up — and just throwing money at a concept because everyone else is doing it,” said Bradley Tusk, co-founder and managing partner at Tusk Venture Partners, which invests in the crypto industry.
Tusk said while crypto is a useful asset class for people who distrust central banks, that doesn’t justify all of the money raised and invested in the sector.
“This may be what forces VCs to start using common sense again — although that’s the byproduct of every downturn and it always dissipates the minute easy money arrives,” he added.
What happened?
While it can be argued FTX’s problems began years ago, the issues boiled over starting Nov. 6 when Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted that Binance — the largest exchange by volume — would sell its holdings of FTX’s native token, FTT. Zhao said the decision was due to “recent revelations that have came to light” about the token.
Earlier this month, reports came out that Sam Bankman-Fried’s trading firm Alameda Research had a large portion of FTT on its balance sheet, possibly helping prop up its value.
FTT prices dropped like a rock amid the controversy and FTX was thrown into disarray as withdrawals mounted.
Binance seemed to emerge as FTX’s white knight when Zhao tweeted the news his company would acquire FTX, but that deal quickly fell apart.
Early Thursday, Bankman-Fried tweeted out the obvious as it was reported he would wind down his Alameda trading platform and was seeking investors for emergency funding to FTX as it faces a $8 billion shortfall.
What now for venture?
The collapse is stunning when considering earlier this year FTX raised $400 million at a $32 billion valuation. According to Crunchbase, FTX has raised nearly $2 billion total. Investors in FTX include the likes of the SoftBank Vision Fund, Singapore’s Temasek Holdings, Paradigm and Lightspeed Venture Partners.
Despite the collapse and the ongoing “crypto winter” — which has seen crypto prices fall substantially off their highs last November — venture investors say while some faith may have been shaken in the market, they are not changing their long-term strategies.
“I do think that there will be an effect on investment in the crypto space for sure,” said crypto investor Jai Das, partner, president and co-founder at Sapphire Ventures. “I believe the investments will shift more toward the building of the next-generation computing platform — aka Web3 — which is blockchain based and is more distributed and secure.”
Crypto-based centralized finance companies — like FTX — that offer crypto in a form more similar to traditional financial-services products, Das said, will have a harder time raising financings, as opposed to DeFi-based financial services, which will still get funded since they have not been affected by the FTX meltdown.
“The valuations of many of these startups will come down, but I believe the smart crypto and blockchain investors will keep funding the best and brightest crypto founders,” he added.
A good thing?
Adam Struck, founder of LA-based venture firm Struck Capital and Struck Crypto, a $115 million crypto fund, said he is hoping the bearish sentiment in the market continues and removes the frothiness that has plagued the space. This could set the stage for the increased consumer protections necessary for cryptocurrency — and specifically DeFi — to fully hit its potential.
“While the FTX collapse is sure to send shockwaves throughout the totality of the ecosystem and will set the stage for continued bearish sentiment — a cooling off of sorts — we are not changing our strategy,” Struck said.
“The FTX debacle might be the major catalyst that sets the stage for DeFi to truly hit escape velocity,” said Struck, adding it may give consumers greater control of their assets.
“So in that sense we take a long-term approach; this equates to necessary growing pains in a nascent space and we remain focused on backing crypto native technologists that are building for the right reasons,” Struck said.

"3D Printing Public Offerings Flopped, But Venture Funding Still Flows To The Space",Joanna Glasner,2022/11/10,"

It’s true that 3D printing technology can produce tons of cool and essential stuff, from airplane parts to custom dental implants to cutlery. But one thing recently public upstarts in the space have proven they can’t print is money.
Rather, like most tech companies that made market debuts during the go-go days of 2020-21, 3D printing brands have been getting clobbered in recent quarters.

How far down? Per Crunchbase analysis, at least six venture-funded companies focused on or tied to 3D printing carried out public offerings in the past two years. All are trading well below their initial valuations, as we chart out below:


Fast Radius files for bankruptcy
The worst performer on the list, Chicago-based Fast Radius, announced Tuesday that it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The move comes just nine months after going public through a SPAC merger at an initial market valuation of $1.4 billion.
Fast Radius, which provides software and manufacturing offerings for engineers to design and make commercial grade parts, counted UPS and Drive Capital as lead venture backers and Goldman Sachs as a post-IPO investor. It attributes its current financial woes to “headwinds in the capital markets” that “have inhibited our ability to adequately put in place the capital structure needed.”
The fast downfall of Fast Radius has wiped out pretty much its entire market cap. Shares are currently down over 99% from the offer price, with broad expectations they’ll go to zero.
But that’s not all
Other 3D printing players are down too, including two Massachusetts companies — Desktop Metal and Markforged — that launched some of the larger offerings.
Desktop Metal, the first one on our list to go public, has shed over $1.75 billion from its market cap since making its debut in December 2020. Shares took a further beating after the company’s Q3 earnings report, released Wednesday, showed both a wider-than-expected loss and lower-than-expected revenue.
Markforged, meanwhile, posted earnings the same day, revealing year-over-year revenue growth of just 5% plus a wider net loss. The company has already shed over four-fifths its value since making its market debut following a SPAC merger in July 2021.
Meanwhile, the best performer on our list — Maryland-based Xometry — is also the one with the loosest ties to 3D printing. The company, down 41% since going public last year, offers a platform for on-demand manufactured parts that may be produced through 3D printing as well as CNC machining, die casting and other processes.
It’s not just market newcomers with ties to 3D printing that are performing poorly. The ARK 3D Printing ETF, a portfolio of companies with ties to the space, is down over 40% this year.
Venture funding still flows
But looking at the funding tallies for 2022, it doesn’t appear that startup investors have turned fully bearish on the 3D printing space.
Using Crunchbase data, we put together a sample set of 15 companies tied to the sector that have raised seed through late-stage funding this year.


Some raised very large rounds, including:

Austin, Texas-based Icon, a construction technology company known for its 3D-printed homes, led the pack with a $185 million Series B extension in February, bringing total funding to over $450 million.
Tel Aviv-based Redefine Meat, which employs 3D printing in production of its plant-based meat alternatives, raised $135 million in a January round.
Los Angeles-based SprintRay, a 3D printer manufacturer that focuses on digital dentistry, raised $100 million in an October Series D.

Big name VCs are also still active in the space. Tiger Global, for instance, led Icon’s large February financing, while SoftBank Vision Fund backed SprintRay’s Series D.
Exits? We’ll just have to wait
Looking at the terrible performance of recent public market entrants with ties to 3D printing, it’s probably not an opportune time for the latest big funding recipients to plan debuts. Nor, for that matter, is anyone focused on 3D printing likely to pull off a big IPO right now.
Still, there’s something inherently alluring about the space, as anyone who’s watched a video of Icon printing its iconic 3D home can attest. Looking more broadly at funded startups in the 3D printing space, it’s easy to walk away with the impression that our world would be a much cooler place if these kinds of innovations were happening at scale.
For now, however, public markets don’t seem to be sharing in that enthusiasm.

"Reading The Market, IVP Cools Investment Pace",Chris Metinko,2022/11/10,"

IVP is one of the oldest venture firms from Silicon Valley’s Sand Hill Road. In its 40-plus years, it has invested in more than 400 companies and has a 40-year IRR of 43%.
So maybe the firm — which has made a name for itself with investments in companies such as Brex, Coinbase, Slack and Twitter — also knows when to pull back in a cooling private market as the economy rides a rocky road to a possible recession.
Similar to its venture brethren such as Accel, Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, IVP has significantly slowed from last year’s heated market.

After taking part in 26 funding deals in the second and third quarters of 2021 — when the venture market reached record heights — IVP slowed that investment cadence to just eight deals in the same two quarters this year, according to Crunchbase data.


In fact, the firm took part in only one announced deal last quarter — a $65 million Series B to Paris-based business forecasting platform Pigment.
Fewer deals, less money
With deal count significantly down, so is the value of the rounds IVP has invested in recently. In Q2 and Q3 of last year combined, IVP’s more than two dozen rounds totaled more than $5 billion, according to Crunchbase data. The eight rounds it took part in for the same two quarters this year totaled less than $900 million.
It is important to note that it is unclear exactly how much money IVP invested itself, as specific stakes in a round are not usually divulged.
During those same middle quarters of last year, IVP led or co-led six rounds, according to Crunchbase. Those rounds included a $130 million Series B for Utah-based cryptocurrency tax and accounting software platform TaxBit and a $100 million Series C for Montreal-based edtech startup Paper.
For the same quarters this year, IVP led or co-led three rounds, including a $135 million Series D for San Francisco-based data reliability platform Monte Carlo that valued the company at $1.6 billion.
Although it is interesting to note, IVP already has taken part in two announced rounds this quarter, including Austin, Texas-based Jasper’s $125 million Series A led by Insight Partners that valued the company at $1.5 billion.
The other round IVP took part in this quarter was one it led, a $30 million Series A for Brooklyn-based remote tech startup Roam.
Those two rounds already put IVP past its total last quarter. While not a sign the private market is picking back up, it does show investors are still willing to invest in the right business model.
IVP declined to comment for this story.

Tackling Global Supply Chain Issues Requires Fresh Thinking And Better Tech,Guest Author,2022/11/10,"

By Lakhveer Singh Jajj
Small entrepreneurs never thought much about the supply chain before the pandemic threw the world into disarray. 
Now, that’s all they think and worry about. And while investors have sunk over $7 billion into supply chain-oriented ventures so far this year, there’s more work to be done to bring solutions to life and to market.
 
My family established a small food market in Toronto’s Little India neighborhood in 1981 shortly after immigrating to Canada. My three siblings and I helped my parents run the store, learning the basics about operating a business as we went along.

Our market specialized in importing Indian food products and dried fruit and nuts from abroad. In doing so, it was our first modest foray into developing and managing an international supply chain. My parents put me in charge of this for a time as a teenager. It required monitoring and scheduling payments, but the supply chain worked efficiently with paper orders and invoices and the odd phone call — kind of like magic. 
I left the store to study computer science and embarked on an exciting career in software engineering. Not long ago, however, as my father was preparing to retire, I learned that the supply-chain planning process had not changed. It was essentially run the same way as when I was still working there, except with the odd spreadsheet and email exchange. 
To me, there seemed to be a great many opportunities for growth that were lost to fear of modernization. Much of this was rooted in discounting and ignoring the role of logistics in growing a business. 
This was all before the pandemic, of course. 
The post-pandemic retail world
Since 2020, owners and operators have faced a whole new set of disruptions, only one of which is the supply chain. If you survived or launched in the pandemic, you already know the pre-pandemic rules of managing growth and scaling up are obsolete.
One of the great transformations of pandemic-era retailing and services is the rise of e-commerce. In 2021, over 27 million Canadians were regular e-commerce users. That’s nearly three-quarters of the population. Canadian consumers are spending over $3 billion a month through e-commerce, led by the fashion sector, and that is expected to rise steadily until 2025. 
A growing number of these e-commerce transactions are flowing through small to medium-sized businesses. To accommodate them and gain more customers, these businesses must focus intensely on two pillars: Making sure customers get the goods and services on time, and making their e-commerce platforms bulletproof to hackers and tech hiccups.
Inventory management and demand planning
Customers are still spending, and companies are still pivoting to meet their demands. A key piece of the puzzle is improving planning through inventory management and demand planning to make sure your brand grows in the channels that are right for you, even through tough times. 
New sales channels bring new overhead and stress. 
Companies like Amazon have the capacity and staff to adapt to new business and sales environments. New e-commerce businesses launched during the pandemic such as designer clothing, protein bars and kitchenware, do not. 
There are solutions to the great supply chain disruption of the 2020s for small businesses, and they are simpler and more accessible than owners may think. 
My company Moselle, for example, has developed a suite of data analytic tools that provide inventory planning and demand management to entrepreneurs. The role of these tools is to determine how much product to order, when to order it, and to automatically place the order. This allows businesses to manage administrative challenges like scaling up their supply chain.
The overarching goal: to provide SMBs with technology, data and support to scale up their supply chains efficiently — giving owners, operators and managers more time to create, market and sell. 
The bottom line for any company in e-commerce (and, frankly, commerce) is the need to surmount massive challenges to manage supply chains — predict product shortages before they happen and scale it up rapidly — in order to manage SMB headaches and challenges. The best way to manage a supply chain is through accurate, rapid information that is available to managers when they need it. 
With the data collection and user-friendly dashboard to keep tabs on the supply chain, entrepreneurs will be liberated to focus on new products and channels. Like imported dried fruit and nuts sold as gifts via an online store.

Binance-FTX Deal A No-Go,Chris Metinko,2022/11/9,"

Just as fast as the deal for Binance acquiring FTX.com — the non-U.S. exchange associated with FTX — was made, it appears to have disappeared.
Early Wednesday, it was reported Binance was likely to walk away from the deal and then by the afternoon a Binance spokesperson told The Information the company will not pursue an acquisition of FTX.

“In the beginning, our hope was to be able to support FTX’s customers to provide liquidity, but the issues are beyond our control or ability to help,” the spokesperson told the news service.
It’s unclear where this may leave FTX, the fourth largest crypto exchange by volume. 
During the weekend, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted Binance — the largest exchange by volume — would sell its holdings of FTX’s native token, FTT.
“Due to recent revelations that have came to light, we have decided to liquidate any remaining FTT on our books,” he said.
On Monday, FTT witnessed a major sell-off amid concerns about the solvency of FTX and Bankman-Fried’s other trading firm Alameda Research after the push by Binance. Earlier this month, reports came out that Alameda had a large portion of FTT on its balance sheet, possibly helping prop up its value. Alameda has disputed that claim.
FTT prices dropped like a rock amid the controversy, and concerns were further fanned when users reported slow withdrawals on FTX’s platform. Bankman-Fried has since said the company is working to clean out a backlog.
Some of those fears seemed to be relieved Tuesday when Zhao tweeted the news his company would acquire FTX. 
“There is a significant liquidity crunch. To protect users, we signed a non-binding LOI, intending to fully acquire http://FTX.com and help cover the liquidity crunch,” he tweeted.
FTX’s collapse is stunning when considering earlier this year it raised $400 million at a $32 billion valuation. According to Crunchbase, FTX has raised nearly $2 billion. Investors in FTX include the SoftBank Vision Fund, Singapore’s Temasek Holdings and Sequoia Capital.
Zhao and Binance also were early investors in FTX.
Forbes has estimated Bankman-Fried’s net worth to be $17 billion.

"As Maryland And Missouri Legalize Marijuana, Challenges Remain Over Cannabis Industry Payments",Keerthi Vedantam,2022/11/9,"

Thanks to the recent midterm elections, it’s now legal to use marijuana  in Maryland and Missouri for recreational purposes. With these two new additions, recreational marijuana use is now allowed in 21 U.S. states. While using it may have gotten a little easier, paying for it still remains a headache for both customers and sellers.
Cannabis industry dollars
Startups have been in the cannabis business for a while, with funding to the sector surpassing $1 billion for the first time in 2018.
This came as legalization ushered in a slew of companies that owned everything from testing bushels of flower, facilitating regulatory guidelines, performing critical logistics tasks, and marketing products. What was once a well-known underground industry has turned into a sophisticated billion-dollar market.
This is not new news.
But cannabis still functions very differently from other niches in the retail industry, and doesn’t operate with the same level of efficiency. The reason? Paying for cannabis is slow, cumbersome and wrought with legal issues.
A cash-only system
Last week, the enterprise resource planning platform Treez announced it acquired payments platform Swifter for an undisclosed amount.
“We’re tackling the challenges faced by dispensaries in normalizing the cannabis retail experience by bringing forward scalable fintech and payment solutions to optimize the customer experience and meet consumers where they are today,” said Treez CEO John Yang.
Across the country, states that have legalized cannabis for recreational purposes are still facing a critical problem: payments. Most dispensaries only take cash, an analog payment that causes headaches for both customers and sellers.
Cash is generally a problem for most sellers: It’s harder to integrate cash payments with point-of-sale systems, making it harder to track what was sold and how much of it was sold, and affecting the cannabis industry’s ability to understand inventory and what’s doing well in the market. It also makes dispensaries susceptible to theft.
But given that marijuana is still classed as a Schedule I drug (right up there with heroin) on a federal level, most banking institutions and credit card companies do not approve payments made toward cannabis products. This makes it hard to sell and distribute goods across the cannabis supply chain.
But help is on the way as some fintech platforms have entered the cannabis industry to combat this problem.
Bespoke Financial is a lending platform that supports cannabis businesses that often struggle to get loans from banks. The company raised $125 million in debt financing last year. Another, Greenbits, was acquired by Dutchie in 2021 for its easy point-of-sale solution for cannabis retailers.
While the addition of two states into the legalization fold may not seem overly significant for startups today, it does provide more geographical opportunities for future businesses that sell cannabis and support those that do.
